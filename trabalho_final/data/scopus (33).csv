However, excessive accumulation of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue leads to obesity and, in nonadipose tissues, is associated with tissue dysfunction. Hence, it is of great importance to have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of triacylglycerol synthesis. The final step in triacylglycerol synthesis is catalyzed by the acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2. Although recent studies have shed light on metabolic functions of these enzymes, little is known about the molecular aspects of their structures or functions. Here we report the topology for murine DGAT2 and the identification of key amino acids that likely contribute to enzymatic function. Our data indicate that DGAT2 is an integral membrane protein with both the N and C termini oriented toward the cytosol. A long hydrophobic region spanning amino acids 66-115 likely comprises two transmembrane domains or, alternatively, a single domain that is embedded in the membrane bilayer. The bulk of the protein lies distal to the transmembrane domains. This region shares the highest degree of homology with other enzymes of the DGAT2 family and contains a sequence HPHG that is conserved in all family members. Mutagenesis of this sequence in DGAT2 demonstrated that it is required for full enzymatic function. Additionally, a neutral lipid-binding domain that is located in the putative first transmembrane domain was also required for full enzymatic function. Our findings provide the first insights into the topography and molecular aspects of DGAT2 and related enzymes. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Enzymatic functions; Nonadipose tissues; Transmembrane domains; Triacylglycerols; Amino acids; Biosynthesis; Enzymes; Hydrophobicity; Metabolism; Mutagenesis; Tissue culture; Biological membranes; acyl coa diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1; acyl coa diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; amino acid; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; membrane protein; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; controlled study; enzyme activity; hydrophobicity; lipogenesis; membrane structure; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cell Membrane; Cercopithecus aethiops; COS Cells; Cytosol; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Hydrophobicity; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Peptide Fragments; Eukaryota; Murinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845977414

Experiments showed that the thermal resistance of nanoscale AlO x tunnel barriers increases linearly with thickness, which is consistent with the theory of energy transport in highly disordered materials. Heat conduction across a tunnel junction is impeded by significant additional resistance at interfaces between the barrier layer and electrodes due to mismatch in atomic vibrational properties and nonequilibrium between electrons and phonons. The quantum-mechanical tunneling probability depends strongly on electron energy, which leads to asymmetry in heat-generation rate along the two opposing electrodes of a tunnel junction.

The ability to simultaneously control the nanoscale structure and composition of such materials using simple and inexpensive routes is important for that potential to be realized. Here we introduce a simple and widely applicable methodology for the synthesis of multicomponent mesostructured metal oxides (MMMOs) from the combination of inexpensive and commercially available polymers with metal alkoxides solubilized in a sol-gel solution consisting of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and ethanol (AcHE). MMMOs obtained utilizing the AcHE system have tunable pore structures, a high degree homogeneity, and in certain cases thermal stability above 1000°C. The ability to easily process these diverse MMMOs in the form of thin films, free-standing membranes, and monoliths provides distinct advantages over previously reported MMO synthesis procedures-especially when large quantities of material are required, for instance, in heterogeneous catalyst development. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the controlled binding of reactive metal ions with acetic acid in the AcHE solution yields nanometer-sized particles for a diverse collection of inorganic materials with homogeneous condensation kinetics. This allows for the simple synthesis of complicated and novel MMMO compositions (e.g., rare earth and mixed transition metal oxides) via cooperative assembly with amphiphilic block copolymers. The development of such simple and widely applicable methodologies are extremely important for the practical implementation of porous metal oxides. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Metal oxides; Multicomponent mesostructured metal oxides (MMMOs); Nanoparticle assembly; Energy storage; Nanostructured materials; Organic polymers; Semiconductor devices; Sol-gels; Synthesis (chemical); Mesoporous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846345734

The simulation results show that the resonance frequency is not obviously affected by the gap dimension when the gap between a microcavity and its coupler is larger than 300 nm. However, the resonance frequency shifts observably with a further decreasing gap to the nanometre level. This shift is generally larger than the cavity resonance linewidth in the 10 νm diameter microdisc system, but is comparable to the cavity resonance linewidth in the 2 νm diameter microdisc system. With increasing gap, the cavity Q increases exponentially until it is saturated at a limit Q factor. An optimal gap dimension exists for maximum light energy transfer and storage. The concept of optimum gap is introduced and defined at the gap dimension where half-maximum energy storage capability is achieved; meanwhile, the cavity Q is high and the resonance frequency remains stable. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer simulation; Dielectric materials; Electric field effects; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Natural frequencies; Sensor data fusion; Waveguides; Microdisc system; Near-field gap effects; Planar dielectric microdisc; Resonators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846857789

The microstructures are of several types such as irregular aggregates, rouleaux, and layers of aligned cells. The dynamic deformability of the red cells, aggregation tendency, cell concentration, size of confining vessel and rate of flow are determining factors in the microstructure. Viscoelastic properties, viscosity and elasticity, relate to energy loss and storage in flowing blood while relaxation time and Weissenberg number play a role in assessing the importance of the elasticity relative to the viscosity. These effects are shown herein for flow in a large straight cylindrical tube, a small tube, and a porous medium. These cases approximate the geometries of the arterial system: large vessels, small vessels and vessels with many branches and bifurcations. In each case the viscosity, elasticity, relaxation time and Weissenberg number for normal human blood as well as blood with enhanced cell aggregation tendency and diminished cell deformability are given. In the smaller spaces of the microtubes and porous media, the diminished viscosity shows the possible influence of the Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect and at high shear rates, the viscoelasticity of blood shows dilatancy.

During the 6-min injection period, an instantaneous power loss of 0.05 W occurs at each low loss aperture. When averaged over the operational year, the loss of both the injection and the stored beams is equivalent to an average loss of 2 mW at each low loss aperture.

Catalogue identifier of previous version: ADCU_v1_0. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 94 (1996) 249. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Nature of problem: Prediction of atomic spectra-atomic energy levels, oscillator strengths, and radiative decay rates-using a 'fully relativistic' approach. Solution method: Atomic orbitals are assumed to be four-component spinor eigenstates of the angular momentum operator, j = l + s, and the parity operator Π = β π. Configuration state functions (CSFs) are linear combinations of Slater determinants of atomic orbitals, and are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the atomic electronic angular momentum operator, J, and the atomic parity operator, P. Lists of CSFs are either explicitly prescribed by the user or generated from a set of reference CSFs, a set of subshells, and rules for deriving other CSFs from these. Approximate atomic state functions (ASFs) are linear combinations of CSFs. A variational functional may be constructed by combining expressions for the energies of one or more ASFs. Average level (AL) functionals are weighted sums of energies of all possible ASFs that may be constructed from a set of CSFs; the number of ASFs is then the same as the number, nc, of CSFs. Optimal level (OL) functionals are weighted sums of energies of some subset of ASFs; the GRASP92 package is optimized for this latter class of functionals. The composition of an ASF in terms of CSFs sharing the same quantum numbers is determined using the configuration-interaction (CI) procedure that results upon varying the expansion coefficients to determine the extremum of a variational functional. Radial functions may be determined by numerically solving the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) equations that result upon varying the orbital radial functions or some subset thereof so as to obtain an extremum of the variational functional. Radial wavefunctions may also be determined using a screened hydrogenic or Thomas-Fermi model, although these schemes generally provide initial estimates for MCDF self-consistent-field (SCF) calculations. Transition properties for pairs of ASFs are computed from matrix elements of multipole operators of the electromagnetic field. All matrix elements of CSFs are evaluated using the Racah algebra. Reasons for the new version: During recent studies using the general relativistic atomic structure package (GRASP92), several errors were found, some of which might have been present already in the earlier GRASP92 version (program ABJN_v1_0, Comput. Phys. Comm. 55 (1989) 425). These errors were reported and discussed by Froese Fischer, Gaigalas, and Ralchenko in a separate publication [C. Froese Fischer, G. Gaigalas, Y. Ralchenko, Comput. Phys. Comm. 175 (2006) 738-744. [7]]. This version of GRASP92 corrects these errors. Summary of revisions:.

Restrictions: The maximum size of a multiconfiguration (MC) calculation, as measured by the length of the configuration state function (CSF) list nc, is limited by numerical stability, processing time, or storage. Numerical stability typically decreases as the number of radial functions varied increases and as the number of open subshells increases. Processing time increases as some power of nc greater than 1 but generally appreciably less than 3. Lists of angular integrals, Vr sk (a b c d), distinguished by tensor rank, k, are written to disk; the available disk storage must be large enough to store all such lists together. Each list is subsequently read into memory and sorted by canonically-ordered Slater integral indices a b c d; the available memory (including any available virtual memory) must be large enough to store the longest list before it is sorted. The lengths of the unsorted and sorted lists increase as some power of nc greater than 1 but generally less than the maximum of 2. The maximum size of a configuration interaction (CI) calculation is limited by processing time and storage. Processing time increases as some power of nc greater than 1 but generally appreciably less than 2. A sparse representation of the lower triangle of the Hamiltonian matrix is written to disk; the available disk storage must be large enough to store this representation of the Hamiltonian matrix. The size of this representation of the Hamiltonian matrix increases as some power of nc greater than 1 but generally less than the maximum of 2. All orbitals that share the quantum numbers nlj (i.e., all members of a subshell) are assumed to have the same radial dependence Pn l j (r), Qn l j (r). Orbitals with different values of the quantum numbers nlj are assumed to be orthogonal. The tables of coefficients of fractional parentage used in GRASP92 are limited to subshells with j ≤ 7 / 2; occupied subshells with j = 9 / 2 are, therefore, restricted to a maximum of two electrons. Unusual features: The GRASP92 package comprises task-specific component programs for the specification of nuclear properties, the generation and manipulation of lists of configuration state functions (CSFs), the computation of radial wavefunctions, of approximate atomic state functions (ASFs), the computation of properties of electromagnetic transitions between ASFs, and for the conversion of data between machine-specific unformatted representations and universal formatted representations. All component programs in the GRASP92 package have been designed for interactive use; the number of keystrokes required by the user is reduced by the provision of defaults appropriate to the types of calculations that are expected to be performed most frequently, and by the provision of interpretation for 'wild card' characters as sets of data items. Several devices have been adopted to reduce computational effort and storage requirements: in multiconfiguration (MC) calculations, the list of angular integrals is presorted by tensor rank prior to sorting by canonically-ordered Slater integral indices; in configuration-interaction (CI) and transition property calculations, angular integrals are not stored and an ordered list of radial integrals is searched and augmented as required as the calculation progresses; in MC and CI calculations, the lower triangle of the Hamiltonian matrix is stored in a sparse representation; the Davidson-Liu algorithm [E.R.

In binary alloys that exhibit complete solid solubility, de-alloying of the less noble component results in the formation of nanoporous metals, a materials class that has attracted attention for applications such as catalysis, sensing and actuation. In addition, the occurrence of de-alloying in metallic alloy systems under stress is known to result in stress-corrosion cracking, a key failure mechanism in fossil fuel and nuclear plants, ageing aircraft, and also an important concern in the design of nuclear-waste storage containers. Central to the design of corrosion-resistant alloys is the identification of a composition-dependent electrochemical critical potential, Vcrit, above which the current rises dramatically with potential, signalling the onset of bulk de-alloying. Below Vcrit, the surface is passivated by the accumulation of up to several monolayers of the more noble component. The current understanding of the processes that control Vcrit is incomplete. Here, we report on de-alloying results of Ag/Au superlattices that clarify the role of pre-existing length scales in alloy dissolution. Our data motivated us to re-analyse existing data on critical potentials of Ag-Au alloys and develop a simple unifying picture that accounts for the compositional dependence of solid-solution alloy critical potentials. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Actuators; Aircraft; Binary alloys; Catalysis; Corrosion resistant alloys; Fossil fuel deposits; Nanostructured materials; Nuclear power plants; Porous materials; Radioactive wastes; Sensors; Solubility; Stress corrosion cracking; Alloy dissolution; De-alloying; Interfacial free energy; Metallic alloys; Free energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751565970

Strong and fast interaction of light with matter is therefore highly desirable for producing reversible holographic media for information storage and/or processing. Widespread, well developed inorganic materials may loose their leading position to organics whose rising potential for photonic devices is envisioned e.g. liquid crystals for display applications. In this chapter we describe the main features of photorefractivity and photochromism in polymers, liquid crystals and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and its mutants designed by rational site-directed mutagenesis. Our goal was to provide a glimpse of complexity of phenomena occuring in optical media leading to conversion of spatial light intensity or polarization patterns into respective chemical and/or physical changes. We have discussed details of classic photorefractive effect which is the main effect allowing for volumetric optical storage in inorganic crystals. By chemical synthesis and sophisticated material engineering a whole class of efficient polymeric photorefractive materials have been reported in the literature. Despite extensive research on photorefractive polymers it is increasingly felt that they fall short of ideal properties of bR and its mutants which are promising candidates as ideal material for information storage. Next we describe the emerging field of dynamic holographic materials basing on low-molecular mass liquid crystals. The photorefractive effect observed in this class of materials differs from the classic one, nevertheless gives new options for spatial light modulation and parallel optical processing. We have discussed details of the physics underlying such interesting real-time holographic properties of liquid crystals and their limitations. Further we briefly describe photochromic effect and organic photochromic materials currently studied with emphasis to azo-functionalized polymers in which photoisomerization of chromophores is responsible for the light-induced anisotropy. Again this group of materials brings some novel features i.e. relief grating formation as well as exhibit drawbacks. Following that we move toward photochromic properties and branched photocycle of bR. Later in the chapter we have focused attention on optimization of bR properties by rational site-directed mutagenesis. A combination of theoretical analysis of the energy level diagram of wild-type bacteriorhodopsin and genetic engineering methods lead to the design of thermally stable bR mutants with perfect holographic properties. The goal of the chapter is also to explore the application of photorefractive polymers, liquid crystals and bR mutants for real-time holography and high-density holographic memories. These demanding applications need optimization of physical properties of materials, stability, processability and low cost which are discussed at the end of this chapter. Comparison of bR with other synthetic organic materials is not straightforward due to fact that each group of materials is optimized toward precisely defined application. However, superior capabilities of bR family over synthetic materials seems to be unsurpassable.

Gravitational forces present on earth increase the muscle forces required to support locomotion and other bodily movements. Increased muscle forces lead to increased energy stored in tendons and other extracellular matrices (ECMs) during movement that is eventually dissipated as heat by muscle cells. The role of collagen molecular and fibrillar stretching and slippage in energy storage and dissipation in ECMs has been studied in tendon, articular cartilage, and blood vessel wall. The results of these studies suggest that collagen is a block copolymer of alternating flexible and rigid regions with energy storage occurring primarily in the flexible regions devoid of the aromatic amino acids, proline, and hydroxyproline. Energy storage in collagen involves increase in steric energy associated with stretching of pairs of charged amino acids that are present in flexible regions of both the molecule and fibril; these regions coincide with the positively stained bands seen in the D period when collagen fibrils are stained with heavy metals and observed in the electron microscope. Energy storage is also associated with changes in steric energy of backbone carbonyl oxygen groups and stretching of the triple helical backbone. Energy stored in collagen fibrils of the ECM is transduced by the attached cells found in the ECM into changes in cell division and protein synthesis. The purpose of this chapter is to relate the structure of collagen fibrils in extracellular matrix (ECM) to the molecular and fibrillar bases of energy storage and dissipation. Besides this the relationship between energy storage and mechanochemical transduction by cells found in theECMis explored and a model of how energy storage may lead to changes in cell division, gene expression, and protein synthesis in the ECM is presented. © 2006 Springer.","cell-extracellular matrix interactions; collagen; energy storage and dissipation; mechanochemical transduction",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949563595

McDowell Road, Scottsdale, AZ 85257, United States","The common operating mode for strategic and tactical reconnaissance sensors has been, from the earliest days of photography, panchromatic. That is, the usual form of focal plane sensors integrate a wide range of data wavelengths into a single response. This single response is then usually displayed as a gray-scale image in which the integrated wavelength response at a given spatial point is given a gray-scale range between pure white (maximum response) and pure black (zero response). The choice of panchromatic sensing has been purely pragmatic in motivation. Although it is known that some narrow-band responses are of interest, such as in infrared, there have been few problems of reconnaissance significance that were driven by the need to couple wavelength sensitivity to spatial resolution. The preferability of only panchromatic sensing has begun to wane in recent years. A variety of questions are now important that can only be answered by the ability to perform precise recording of sensed energy in a number of narrow wavelength shces. For example, various types of camouflage and concealment techniques are revealed by narrow-band spectral sensing. The effluents of various manufacturing facilities, as sensed by fine spectral resolution, can be a critical clue to the type of processes employed in the facility. The agricultural yield and health of crops can be predicted from quantitative analysis of fine resolution spectral images [1]. The development and utilization of fine resolution spectral sensors is becoming of prominent interest for these and many other applications. The Landsat series of earth satellites conclusively established the value of employing image sensors with multiple wavelength sensitivity [2]. Landsat images represent a rather course slicing of the optical wavelength spectrum, however, being only 4 to 6 overlapping bands through the visible and near infrared wavelengths, with each band having a width of 100 to 200 nm. Given that many surface materials have absorption features that are only 20 to 40 nm wide [1], it is apparent that this class of ""multispectral"" sensor cannot record the narrow wavelength absorption features that are indicative of specific materials in laboratory-based spectroscopy [3j. The limitation associated with multispectral scanners has led to imaging spectrometers which register many narrow waveband images of a scene and allow the assemblage of a contiguous reflectance spectrum for each pixel in the scene. An early example of such a sensor is the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) [4]. AIS was developed by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for civil environmental applications. AIS could simultaneously record 128 nearinfrared wavebands (each being 9.3 nm wide) with a 365 to 787 m swath. A more complex JPL sensor is the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) [5,6]. ARIRIS can collect 209 visible and near-infrared wavebands, each of width 10 nm, with an 11-km swath. The radiometric quantization of AVIRIS is 10 bits for each spectral band. Because of the enhanced spectral and spatial resolution of modern hyperspectral scanners, tremendous amounts of raw data are produced. In fact, highresolution hyperspectral scanners can expel on the order of 512 megabits/second in their operational state. With satellite-based systems, transmission of the complete data record to an earth receiving station is difficult since current satellite downlink channels are capable of only 300 megabits/second, and must service all on-board experiments, not just the hyperspectral scanner [7]. Once the sensor information is down-loaded to an earth receiving station, processing and handling of the data is very problematic. For example, a satellite hyperspectral sensor platform could expel terabytes of data per day [8], with the total data collected being on the order of 10 bytes over a typical 15-year mission. Moreover, data handling expenses alone could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the system [9]. Ground-based operations include archival, browsing, dissemination, and rapid dehvery and analysis of the hyperspectral data. In uncoded form, storage of the data is feasible (although expensive) with the use of optical disk technology, but transmission from site to site places undue demands on the communications link, and browsing as a prelude to analysis is nearly impossible. It may be advantageous to have browse-quality data online to facilitate rapid viewing of several hyperspectral images. Fewer bytes on the disk equate to much faster read times, and transmission costs for the data are reduced significantly [9]. AVIRIS is exemplary of the characteristics of fine-spectral-resolution image sensors. The volume of data in such images requires fundamental rethinking of many image processing operations that have been developed for panchromatic and even low-dimensional multispectral data. A property of fine-spectralresolution imagery is interband correlation. It is easy to observe in even coarseband imagery, such as Landsat multispectral or three-primary color images, that many features of edge definition, contrast, texture, gray-level, etc., remain substantially the same from spectral band to spectral band. The interband correlation facilitates substantial reduction of the data required for the storage and transmission of the imagery. However, a careless approach to reducing the correlation could lead to disastrous loss of the information differences between bands that are the critical value of multispectral imagery. An improper reduction of correlation redundancy could make it impossible to exploit the imagery for significant utility. Compression of hyperspectral imagery can manifest itself in sensor-based and/or ground-based systems. The former requires fast, efficient algorithms, implement able with existing low complexity (low power consumption) hardware in near-real-time. The requirements of the latter are somewhat relaxed in that hardware of greater complexity can be utiHzed, and speed may not be of paramount importance. However, for uses such as rapid browsing, decoding should be fast enough to handle data rates in real time. Also, savings in transmission and storage should not be negated by the computational costs associated with decoding. Accordingly, much attention has been focused recently on the compression of hyperspectral imagery, and a broad sampling of techniques can be found in [10-18]. In this chapter, we present several image coding systems for the lossy compression of hyperspectral imagery, where each system employs a form of trelliscoded quantization (TCQ). The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines several version of TCQ that are used in the various hyperspectral image coders that are presented throughout the chapter. These include fixed-rate TCQ (FRTCQ), entropy-constrained TCQ (ECTCQ), entropy-constrained predictive TCQ (ECPTCQ) [16], and channel-optimized TCQ (COTCQ) [10]. Section 3 presents a hyperspectral image coder that combines the discrete cosine transform (DCT) with ECPTCQ [16]. In Section 4, a coder is presented where the 3-D DCT is used in conjunction with ECTCQ [18]. Section 5 discusses two adaptive coders that utilize differential pulse code modulation (DPCM), adaptive classification, and ECTCQ. The first coder is based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [19], while the second is based on the DCT [20]. For noisy channels. Section 6 presents a wavelet-based coder that uses COTCQ, which is resilient to channel errors [10]. Coding results and comparisons are presented in Section 7, and a conclusion is given in Section 8.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849130996

Consequentially, the strong scientific need for tunable, coherent radiation sources from the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) to the X-ray in the femtosecond and picosecond time domain has spurred international research efforts to develop a new generation of research facilities. Laser-driven light sources that use non-linear processes to create very high harmonics and the interaction between an ultra-short laser pulse and an electron bunch in a storage ring are both able to produce radiation pulses in the femtosecond time domain and in the soft EUV and X-ray region, but with a relatively low useful photon flux on the sample. In contrast Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) can produce light pulses with peak brilliance as much as ten orders of magnitude higher than the pulses generated in present third-generation synchrotron light sources and with photon energies ranging from the VUV to the hard X-rays, i.e. from about 10eV (120nm) to 10keV (0.12nm). This manuscript reviews the scientific fields that can be opened or extended by the new techniques along with the progress of FEL physics and the supporting accelerator physics and technology. © Società Italiana di Fisica.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547161847

The center of mass of harvestmen was found to undergo vertical and transverse displacements of unprecedented magnitude, but the pattern of displacements was consistent with those predicted by general models of energetic efficiency and dynamic stability of pedestrian locomotion.

Ethanol production has more than tripled since 2000, with annual US production expected to exceed 7 billion gallons by 2007. Sales of biobased plastics are also expanding. The growing availability of economically competitive biobased alternatives to petroleum can be attributed in large part to advances in the production and processing of corn grain for industrial uses. Steady increases in corn yields made possible by agricultural biotechnology continue to expand the supply of available grainbased feedstock. Rapid advances in the field of industrial biotechnology are greatly enhancing the efficiency of ethanol production and making possible a range of new biobased polymers, plastics, and textiles from agricultural starting materials. In order to meet the US Department of Energy (DOE) goal of 60 million gallons of ethanol production and 30 percent displacement of petroleum by 2030, new feedstock sources will be required to supplement high-efficiency production from grain. A robust sustainable supply chain for cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops will be needed within a few years.Nearly 1 billion dry tons of cellulosic biomass could be supplied by US agricultural lands in the form of crop residues and dedicated energy crops. A growing list of companies have announced intentions to begin construction of cellulosic biorefinerics. One challenge for the emerging cellulosic biomass industry is how to produce, harvest, and deliver this abundant feedstock to biorefineries in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. Corn stover and straw from cereals such as wheat and rice are the most likely cellulosic Feedstocks for commercial-scale production of ethanol in the near term, potentially supplying more than 200 million dry tons of feedstock annually within three to five years-enough to triple current ethanol production. Dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass will follow as a feedstock supplement once a market for cellulosic biomass develops further. Corn stover has the largest potential as a near-term biorefinery feedstock, given its high per-acre yields. Current cropping practices require that most or all stover remain on the field to maintain soil health. As biorefinery construction creates markets for crop residues, farmers will be more motivated to adopt practices that lead to economic and sustainable removal. An environmental and economic ""optimum"" removal will balance sufficient retention of residues to avoid erosion losses and maintain soil quality while using excess residue as biorefinery feedstocks. The impact of varying levels of stover and straw removal will depend considerably on local conditions and practices.Under a range of conditions, no-till cropping allows for substantially greater residue collection than current practice, enabling biorefinery siting in areas where suitable supplies are currently unavailable. Further evolution toward greater no-till cropping is needed in order to supply adequate feedstock while complying with erosion guidelines and maintaining soil quality. Lower operating costs and recent successes have spurred an increase in adoption of no-till, with 16 percent of wheat acreage and 20 percent of corn acreage now under no-till practice. However, no-till is not yet widely utilized in regions of the country with the greatest potential to supply biomass. Ultimately, growing demand for crop residues will likely prove a strong additional driver for the transition to more widespread no-till cropping. Once a market for agricultural residues develops, individual farmers or groups of farmers may elect to adopt no-till cropping to attract biorefineries to their area. Residue collection may also enable no-till cropping in wetter regions, such as the northern Com Belt, where excess residues currently hamper germination and reduce yields. While the economics depend on regional and local conditions, for those not currently practicing no-till, the benefits of converting may justiry the time to learn new methods and the $50,000-$100,000 investment in new planting equipment. For instance, a 1,000-acre farm could expect to recover the additional costs through revenue from residue sales in as little as two years. New markets that commoditize the environmental benefits of notill farming could provide even greater incentive to convert. Carbon credits for no-till transition currently sell for roughly $1 per acre on the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange. If mandatory greenhouse gas limits are established in the United States, the carbon credit benefits of no-till adoption could exceed $10 per acre. In addition to economic benefits for farmers, sustainable production, and collection of agricultural residues has the potential to deliver substantial benefits for the environment, such as reduced runoff of soil and fertilizers. But the greatest environmental benefit may be to the global climate through reduced emissions of fossil carbon and enhanced sequestration of soil carbon. With no-till cropping, sustainable collection of 30 percent of current annual corn stover production would yield over 5 billion gallons of ethanol and reduce net US greenhouse gas emissions by 90 million to 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, if burned as E85 fuel. This would more than offset the net annual growth in emissions from all sectors of the US economy experienced in 2004. To realize these benefits, additional infrastructure in collection, storage, and transportation is needed to supply biorefineries. Rail transport greatly reduces transportation costs relative to trucking, allowing for a much larger collection area. One-pass harvest, in which grain and residues are collected simultaneously, also offers strong opportunities to lower cost.To facilitate development of the infrastructure necessary for sustainable production and collection of cellulosic agricultural feed-stocks, and to achieve the DOE goal of 30 percent displacement of petroleum with renewable biobased feedstocks by 2030, the US Congress should consider adopting supportive policy measures in the 2007 Farm Bill, including: Funding for accelerated development and production of onepass harvesting equipment Development and distribution of simple-to-use soil carbon models to allow farmers to compute how much crop residue can be collected without degrading soil quality Assistance to farmers to encourage the transition to no-till cropping for biomass production Incentives for the development and expansion of short-line and regional rail networks Funding for demonstration projects to streamline collection, transport, and storage of cellulosic crop residue feedstocks Development of a system to monetize greenhouse gas credits generated by production of ethanol and other products from agricultural feedstocks Funding for programs to help farmers identify and grow the most suitable crops for both food production and cellulosic biomass production Cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops represents a highly promising new source of feedstock material for the production of ethanol, renewable chemicals, and a range of commercial biobased products.

LSP was able to provide reasonable estimates without any modifications to the model physics. To obtain reasonable simulations using CLM, the baseline TOPMODEL baseflow generation and the bottom drainage mechanisms were not employed and the lower layers were allowed to remain saturated. In addition, several of CLM's default wetland vegetation parameters were replaced with grassland parameters. Even after these modifications, CLM underestimated soil water storage. However, both model-simulated soil temperatures showed very good agreement as compared to measured temperatures, capturing both the soil warming during the study period and the diurnal fluctuations. Modeled surface energy fluxes also agreed well with measured values. LSP's inability to consistently capture latent heat fluxes appears to be linked to its canopy resistance scaling functions. Other minor issues were that CLM's rooting depth greatly exceeded observed depths and that CLM did not move water in the vadose zone from lower to upper layers during the nighttime as observed in the measurements. Overall, these results suggest that LSP can be applied to characterize a marsh dry down, but that minor modifications could greatly improve results. CLM demonstrated considerable potential, but requires some changes to model physics and default parameters prior to application to wetlands at a subgrid scale. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"computer simulation; energy flux; heat flux; land surface; model; soil temperature; water table; wetland; Florida [United States]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846331596

The effects of angle of incidence were also investigated for neutron-induced SEL. The angle of incidence can significantly impact SEL hardness. For one SRAM at a temperature of 75°C, characterizing SEL cross section at grazing angle resulted in a 16 times increase in SEL cross section. Large increases in SEL cross section with angle were also observed for other SRAMs characterized at room temperature. These increases in SEL cross section with angle of incidence are much larger than those measured previously for older SRAM technologies. The mechanism for the effect of angle of incidence on SEL cross section is not due simply to the deposition of more energy in the sensitive volume caused by an increase in path length as the angle of incidence is increased. To investigate possible mechanisms nuclear scattering calculations were performed and combined with device simulations. Simulation results suggest that the mechanism is a consequence of the linear energy transfer (LET) and range distributions of secondary ions produced by proton-material (or neutron-material) interactions coupled with an increase in SEL sensitivity (decrease in LET threshold) as angle of incidence is increased. These results have significant impact on SEL hardness assurance testing, especially for system applications where latchups cannot be tolerated. To best ensure that SEL hardness requirement are met, SRAMs should be characterized at both grazing and normal angles of incidence, and at maximum temperature, voltage, and proton energy. © 2006 IEEE.","Hardness assurance; Proton radiation effects; Single-event effects; Single-event latchup","Angle of incidence; Proton energies; Single-event effects; Single-event latchup (SEL); Computer simulation; Electric potential; Energy transfer; Hardness; Neutrons; Scattering; Static random access storage; Thermal effects; Protons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846315975

The composition of our diet is highly insulinogenic. The insulin drives energy into fat, and interferes with leptin signaling in the VMH. This results in weight gain and the sense of starvation, which results in decreased SNS activity, reducing energy expenditure and physical activity; and increased vagal activity, which promotes yet further insulin release and energy storage. Thus, hyperinsulinemia turns the leptin negative feedback system into a ""vicious cycle"" of obesity (see Figure 3, page 905). Externally, this appears as ""gluttony and sloth,"" but it is biochemically driven. How does this work? A thin, insulin- sensitive, 13-year-old boy might consume a daily allotment of 2,000 kcal, and burn 2,000 kcal daily (or 50 kcal/kg fat-free mass) in order to remain weight-stable with a stable leptin level. However, if that same 13-year-old became hyperinsulinemic and/or insulin resistant, perhaps as many as 250 kcal of the daily allotment would be shunted to storage in adipose tissue, promoting a persistent obligate weight gain. Due to the obligate energy storage, he now only has 1,750 kcal per day to burn. The hyperinsulinemia also results in a lower level of leptin signal transduction, conveying a CNS signal of energy insufficiency. The remaining calories available are lower than his energy expenditure; the CNS would sense starvation. Through decreased SNS tone, he would reduce his physical activity, resulting in decreased quality of life; and through increased vagal tone, he would increase caloric intake and insulin secretion, but now at a much higher level. Thus, the vicious cycle of gluttony, sloth, and obesity is promulgated. Is this personal responsibility, when a kid's brain thinks it's starving? Is it personal responsibility when the American Academy of Pediatrics still recommends juice for toddlers? Is it personal responsibility when the Women, Infant and Children program subsidizes fruit juice but not fruit? Is it personal responsibility when the first ingredient in the barbecue sauce is high-fructose corn syrup? Is it personal responsibility when high-fiber fresh produce is unavailable in poor neighborhoods? Is it personal responsibility when the local fast food restaurant is the only neighborhood venue that is clean and air-conditioned? Is it personal responsibility when in order to meet the criteria for No Child Left Behind, the school does away with physical education class? Is it personal responsibility when children are not allowed out of the house to play for fear of crime? We must get the insulin down. Fixing the ""toxic environment"" by altering the food supply and promoting physical activity for all children can't be done by government, and won't be done by Big Food. This will require a grassroots, bottom-up effort on the part of parents and community leaders.

Recent studies have shown that fat tissue is not a simple energy storage organ, but exerts important endocrine and immune functions. These are achieved predominantly through release of adipocytokines, which include several novel and highly active molecules released abundantly by adipocytes like leptin, resistin, adiponectin or visfatin, as well as some more classical cytokines released possibly by inflammatory cells infiltrating fat, like TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1 (CCL-2), IL-1. All of those molecules may act on immune cells leading to local and generalized inflammation and may also affect vascular (endothelial) function by modulating vascular nitric oxide and superoxide release and mediating obesity related vascular disorders (including hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance) but also cancer or non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Present review, in a concise form, focuses on the effects of major adipocytokines, characteristic for adipose tissue like leptin, adiponectin, resistin and visfatin on the immune system, particularly innate and adaptive immunity as well as on blood vessels. Macrophages and T cells are populating adipose tissue which develops into almost an organized immune organ. Activated T cells further migrate to blood vessels, kidney, brain and other organs surrounded by infiltrated fat leading to their damage, thus providing a link between metabolic syndrome, inflammation and cardiovascular and other associated disorders. Ceretain treatments may lead to significant changes in adipocytokine levels. For example include beta-2 adrenoreceptor agonists, thiazolidinediones as well as androgens lead to decrease of plasma leptin levels. Moreover future treatments of metabolic system associated disorders should focus on the regulation of adipocytokines and their modes of action.","Adiponectin; Adipose tissue; Endothelium; Inflammation; Leptin; Nitric oxide; Obesity; Resistin; Vascular function; Visfatin","adipocytokine; adiponectin; androgen; apelin; beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; CD69 antigen; glitazone derivative; interleukin 1; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; interleukin 6; leptin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nitric oxide; pioglitazone; resistin; rosiglitazone; superoxide; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; visfatin; adaptive immunity; adipose tissue; atherosclerosis; blood vessel function; cancer; cardiovascular function; clinical trial; cytokine release; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug activity; drug mechanism; heart infarction size; hormone blood level; human; hypertension; inflammation; innate immunity; insulin resistance; lymphocyte migration; metabolic syndrome X; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; protein blood level; protein expression; review; signal transduction; T lymphocyte activation; vascular disease; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Cytokines; Humans; Inflammation; Vascular Diseases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846263404

In contrast to previous works, the 3-D electrostatic effects investigated in this paper are proven very significant in the memory operations. Therefore, new design criteria of metal NC memories are investigated. Part I presents the physical model and the NC array design optimization. A sparse and large-size NC array, which is suitable for the one-dimensional narrow-channel memories, provides higher program/erase tunneling current density due to the field-enhancement effect and lower charging energy due to the large NC capacitance. On the other hand, to achieve a sufficient memory window, fast programming speed, and long retention time in the typical two-dimensional channel memories, a dense and large-size NC array is favorable while taking the tradeoff with the NC number density into account.

This idea of energy optimization through speed control has been subsequently applied to other components of electronic systems such as disk drives and wireless transceivers. In this paper, the energy-optimal speed profile (a function of time) of a generic device that has to execute a given task in a given time is obtained analytically. The proposed approach is applicable to devices with either discrete or continuous-speed sets. The main novelty of the approach is that for discrete-speed sets, the nature of the underlying continuous power-speed relationship does not need to be known. The discrete power-speed data points only need to satisfy a W-convex relation: a discrete analog of a convex function. Based on the observation that most devices have W-convex power-speed relations, it is shown that the optimal speed profile uses at most one speed (for continuous speeds) or two speeds (for discrete-speed sets). Furthermore, each device has an intrinsic speed (independent of the task) u c at which it consumes the least energy per unit work done. It is shown that this speed can be calculated directly from measured values of power-speed data points (for discrete-speed sets) or by an experimental line search procedure where each step involves measuring a power-speed data point (for continuous-speed sets). In either case, no curve fit or knowledge of analytical power models is required. The optimum speed profile was shown to be either u c or the minimum feasible speed(s) for the given task, with the choice depending on the energy overheads and task parameters. © 2006 IEEE.","Convex function; Discrete speeds; Dynamic voltage scaling; Energy optimization; Speed control","Convex function; Discrete speeds; Dynamic voltage scaling; Energy optimization; Function evaluation; Hard disk storage; Mathematical models; Optimization; Program processors; Speed control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845669120

The method periodically adjusts the size of physical memory and the timeout value to shut down a hard disk to reduce the average energy consumption. Pareto distributions are used to model the disk idle time. The parameters of the distributions are estimated at runtime and used to calculate the appropriate timeout value. The memory size is changed based on the predicted number of disk accesses at different memory sizes. The method also considers the delay caused by power management and limits the performance degradation. The method is simulated and compared with other power management methods. Simulation results show that the method consistently achieves better energy savings and less performance degradation across different workloads. © 2006 IEEE.","Disk latency; Dynamic power management; Memory management","Disk latency; Dynamic power management; Memory management; Pareto distributions; Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Delay circuits; Energy utilization; Storage allocation (computer); Hard disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845632501

The adipose organ, and in particular adipocytes, communicate with almost all other organs. Although some adipose tissue pads assume the functions as distinct ""miniorgans,"" adipocytes can also be present in smaller numbers interspersed with other cell types. Although fat pads have the potential to have a significant systemic impact, adipocytes may also affect neighboring tissues through paracrine interactions. These local or systemic effects are mediated through lipid and protein factors. The protein factors are commonly referred to as adipokines. Their expression and posttranslational modifications can undergo dramatic changes under different metabolic conditions. Due to the fact that none of the mutations that affect adipose tissue trigger embryonic lethality, the study of adipose tissue physiology lends itself to genetic analysis in mice. In fact, life in the complete absence of adipose tissue is possible in a laboratory setting, making even the most extreme adipose tissue phenotypes genetically amenable to be analyzed by disruption of specific genes or overexpression of others. Here, we briefly discuss some basic aspects of adipocyte physiology and the systemic impact of adipocyte-derived factors on energy homeostasis.

The lipin-deficient fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse is an exception, as there is lipodystrophy without a fatty liver. Using a combination of indirect calorimetry and stable-isotope flux phenotyping, we determined that fld mice exhibit abnormal fuel utilization throughout the diurnal cycle, with increased glucose oxidation near the end of the fasting period and increased fatty acid oxidation during the feeding period. The mechanisms underlying these alterations include a twofold increase compared with wild-type mice in tissue glycogen storage during the fed state, a 40% reduction in hepatic glucose production in the fasted state, and a 27-fold increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis in liver during the fed state. Thus, the inability to store energy in adipose tissue in the fld mouse leads to a compensatory increase in glycogen storage for use during the fasting period and reliance upon hepatic fatty acid synthesis to provide fuel for peripheral tissues during the fed state. The increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and peripheral utilization provides a potential mechanism to ameliorate fatty liver in the fld that would otherwise occur as a consequence of adipose tissue dysfunction. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"glucose; glycogen; lactic acid; nuclear protein; protein lipin; stable isotope; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; calorimetry; circadian rhythm; controlled study; diet restriction; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; feeding behavior; female; gluconeogenesis; glucose oxidation; lactate blood level; liver fatty degeneration; male; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Animals; Base Sequence; Calorimetry, Indirect; Circadian Rhythm; DNA Primers; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acid Synthetase Complex; Fatty Liver; Glycogen; Liver; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Knockout; Nuclear Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845537627

These neurons have several similarities to β- and α-cells in the pancreas, which are also responsive to ambient glucose levels. Many use glucokinase as a rate-limiting step in the production of ATP and its effects on membrane potential and ion channel function to sense glucose. Glucosensing neurons are organized in an interconnected distributed network throughout the brain that also receives afferent neural input from glucosensors in the liver, carotid body, and small intestines. In addition to glucose, glucosensing neurons can use other metabolic substrates, hormones, and peptides to regulate their firing rate. Consequently, the output of these ""metabolic sensing"" neurons represents their integrated response to all of these simultaneous inputs. The efferents of these neurons regulate feeding, neuroendocrine and autonomic function, and thereby energy expenditure and storage. Thus, glucosensing neurons play a critical role in the regulation of energy homeostasis.

The results showed that hydrogen production potential and hydrogen production rate increased with an increasing substrate concentration. The maximum hydrogen yields from sucrose, NFDM, and food waste were 234, 119, and 101 mL/g COD, respectively. The low pH (pH &lt; 4) inhibited hydrogen production and resulted in lower carbohydrate fermentation at high substrate concentration. Michaelis-Menten equation was employed to model the hydrogen production rate at different substrate concentrations. The equation gave a good approximation of the maximum hydrogen production rate and the half saturation constant (Ks) with correlation coefficient (R2) over 0.85. The Ks values of sucrose, NFDM, and food waste were 1.4, 6.6, and 8.7 g COD/L, respectively. Based on Ks values, the substrate affinity of the enriched hydrogen producing culture was found to depend on carbohydrate content of the substrate. The substrate containing high carbohydrate showed a lower Ks value.

Resource allocation theory suggests that longevity is enhanced by increasing somatic storage, at the expense of current reproduction. Phytophagous insects accumulate amino acids as hemolymph storage proteins for major developmental events. We hypothesized that protein storage is involved in life extension from CR. In a longitudinal experiment, we tested whether CR altered protein storage in female grasshoppers. Individuals on CR (60 or 70% of ad libitum) or late-onset CR had at least 60% greater longevity than ad libitum individuals. Age at first oviposition, dry mass of the first clutch, or lifetime fecundity were not affected by CR, but CR did increase the number of clutches produced. Most important, females on life-extending CR and late-onset CR did not differ in the concentration of hemolymph storage of proteins in comparison to ad libitum females. Protein storage changed with time in all groups, demonstrating sufficient sensitivity in our methods. Previous experiments have shown that severe CR (∼30% of ad libitum) can reduce hemolymph storage. Therefore, the reduction in intake needed to extend lifespan is not sufficient to reduce protein storage in the hemolymph. These results do not support the hypothesis that protein storage is involved in life extension from CR. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, little is known about the production of corticoids during early development in free-living animals, particularly during sensitive periods of acquisition of important behaviors. In a four-year study of Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, a non-invasive assay of glucocorticoids was used to quantify age and population differences among juveniles from three California locations. Fecal-cortisol metabolites are elevated during a short period when juveniles first emerge aboveground from their natal burrows at about 4 weeks of age. This period of cortisol elevation coincides with when young are learning survival behaviors such as anti-predator responses and foraging strategies. Population differences in juvenile cortisol levels, which may reflect local variation in habitat quality and predator environments, were not evident until 2 weeks after emergence. Elevated cortisol at the age of emergence was also observed in juveniles born and reared in captivity without exposure to typical stressors that occur around the age of emergence. These results indicate that corticoids are regulated during early development, and the possible functions of age-related corticoid levels are discussed, including mobilization of glucose for natal emergence and later facilitation of growth and energy storage during the short summer before hibernation. In some species, elevated corticoids can also facilitate learning and memory, and current work is exploring whether the higher cortisol observed in all three S. beldingi populations just after emergence function to promote rapid acquisition of survival behaviors. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The controversy stems from the fact that many tunneling time definitions seem to predict superluminal tunneling velocities. One prediction, termed the Hartman effect, states that the tunneling time becomes independent of barrier length for thick enough barriers, ultimately resulting in unbounded tunneling velocities. Experiments done with ""single photons"", classical light waves, and microwaves all show this apparent superluminality. The origin of these paradoxical effects has been a mystery for decades. In this article, we review the history of tunneling times starting with the early work of MacColl, Hartman, and Wigner. We discuss some of the tunneling time definitions, with particular emphasis on the phase time (also known as the group delay or Wigner time) and the dwell time. The key experiments are reviewed. We then discuss our recent work, which suggests that the group delay in tunneling is not a transit time as has been assumed for decades. It is, in reality, a lifetime and hence should not be used to assign a speed of barrier traversal. We show how this new understanding along with the concept of energy storage and release resolves all the outstanding tunneling time paradoxes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While much of this R&amp;D is directed at novel concepts and potential breakthrough technologies, there are also substantial efforts to improve CO2 capture technologies already in use. In this paper, we focus on amine-based CO2 capture systems for power plants and other combustion-based applications. The current performance and cost of such systems have been documented in several recent studies. In this paper we examine the potential for future cost reductions that may result from continued process development. We used the formal methods of expert elicitation to understand what experts in this field believe about possible improvements in some of the key underlying parameters that govern the performance and cost of this technology. A dozen leading experts from North America, Europe and Asia participated in this study, providing their probabilistic judgments via a detailed questionnaire coupled with individual interviews. Judgments about detailed technical parameters were then used in an integrated power plant modeling framework (IECM-CS) developed for USDOE to evaluate the performance and costs of alternative carbon capture and sequestration technologies for fossil-fueled power plants. The experts' responses have allowed us to build a picture of how the overall performance and cost of amine-based systems might improve over the next decade or two.

We simulate the potential role of coal integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), and wind power within a computable general equilibrium model of Germany from the present through 2050. These advanced technologies and their role within a future German electricity system are the focus of this paper. We model the response of greenhouse gas emissions in Germany to various technology and carbon policy assumptions over the next few decades. In our baseline scenario, all of the advanced technologies except CCS provide substantial contributions to electricity generation. We also calculate the carbon price where each fossil technology, combined with CCS, becomes competitive. Constant carbon price experiments are used to characterize the model response to a carbon policy. This provides an estimate of the cost of meeting an emissions target, and the share of emissions reductions available from the electricity generation sector. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To address the problem of the lack of training templates, we also propose a novel approach for human recognition by combining statistical gait features from real and synthetic templates. We directly compute the real templates from training silhouette sequences, while we generate the synthetic templates from training sequences by simulating silhouette distortion. We use a statistical approach for learning effective features from real and synthetic templates. We compare the proposed GEI-based gait recognition approach with other gait recognition approaches on USF HumanID Database.

Metabolic sensing neurons are the integrators of a variety of metabolic, humoral and neural inputs from the periphery. Such neurons, originally called ""glucosensing"", also respond to fatty acids, hormones and metabolites from the periphery. They are integrated within neural pathways involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Unlike most neurons, they utilize glucose and other metabolites as signaling molecules to regulate their membrane potential and firing rate. For glucosensing neurons, glucokinase acts as the rate-limiting step in glucosensing while the pathways that mediate responses to metabolites like lactate, ketone bodies and fatty acids are less well characterized. Many metabolic sensing neurons also respond to insulin and leptin and other peripheral hormones and receive neural inputs from peripheral organs. Each set of afferent signals arrives with different temporal profiles and by different routes and these inputs are summated at the level of the membrane potential to produce a given neural firing pattern. In some obese individuals, the relative sensitivity of metabolic sensing neurons to various peripheral inputs is genetically reduced. This may provide one mechanism underlying their propensity to become obese when exposed to diets high in fat and caloric density. Thus, metabolic sensing neurons may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Charles River and Harlan rats gained weight faster than Simonsen rats, but chow intake standardized for body weight was not increased, consistent with their greater caloric efficiency. Weight gain was inversely related with mean daily temperatures, without differences in activity levels. Half of the animals given lard and 32% sucrose solutions in addition to chow increased caloric intake and core temperature, decreased caloric efficiency, and increased fat depots, leptin, and in Simonsen rats, insulin. A 5-day regimen of once-daily 2-h restraint decreased feeding and caloric efficiency. Rats from two vendors with the availability of sucrose and lard, Charles River and Simonsen, showed blunted HPA responses to restraint compared to chow controls, whereas the Harlans exhibited no adrenocortorticotropin (ACTH) response and an amplified adrenocortical response on the high-energy diet compared to chow controls.

The reduced activation energy for proton motions may partly explain the improved thermolysis and lowering the activation barrier for the loss of the first equivalent of H2. In addition, the phonon density of states for neat ammonia borane compares well with other spectroscopic results, with the intense peak at 22 meV assigned to the librational NH3 and BH3 modes, whereas ammonia borane on MCM-41 displays a broad, featureless spectrum indicating a poorly crystalline material.","Backscattering; Dynamics; Hydrogen storage; Neutron; Quasielastic scattering","Backscattering; Crystalline materials; Energy storage; Mesoporous materials; Molecular dynamics; Neutron scattering; Hydrogen storage; Proton motion; Quasielastic scattering; Ammonium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751345391

Whereas it is known that hypothalamic administration of exogenous NPY peptides leads to increased body weight gain, hyperphagia, and many hormonal and metabolic changes characteristic of an obesity syndrome, the Y receptor(s) mediating these effects is disputed and unclear. To investigate the role of different Y receptors in the NPY-induced obesity syndrome, we used recombinant adeno-associated viral vector to overexpress NPY in mice deficient of selective single or multiple Y receptors (including Y1, Y2, and Y4). Results from this study demonstrated that long-term hypothalamic overexpression of NPY lead to marked hyperphagia, hypogonadism, body weight gain, enhanced adipose tissue accumulation, hyperinsulinemia, and other hormonal changes characteristic of an obesity syndrome. NPY-induced hyperphagia, hypogonadism, and obesity syndrome persisted in all genotypes studied (Y1-/-, Y2-/-, Y2Y4-/-, and Y1Y2Y4-/- mice). However, triple deletion of Y1, Y2, and Y4 receptors prevented NPY-induced hyperinsulinemia. These findings suggest that Y1, Y2, and Y4 receptors under this condition are not crucially involved in NPY's hyperphagic, hypogonadal, and obesogenic effects, but they are responsible for the central regulation of circulating insulin levels by NPY.

However, in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats with high B, low insulin replacement promotes lard intake. To test the role of the liver on this, rats were given STZ and infused with insulin or vehicle into either the superior mesenteric or right jugular vein. Controls were nondiabetic; all rats were treated with high B. After 5 d, all rats were offered lard, 32% sucrose, chow, and water ad libitum until d 10. Diabetes exacerbated body weight loss from high B; this was prevented by insulin into the jugular, but not superior mesenteric, vein. Without insulin, STZ groups essentially consumed only chow; controls increased caloric intake about equally from the three sources. Insulin into both sites reduced chow and increased lard intake. Although circulating insulin was increased only by jugular infusion, plasma glucose and liver glycogen were similar after insulin into both sites. Fat depot weights differed: sc fat was heavier after jugular and mesenteric fat was heavier after mesenteric insulin infusions. We conclude that there are important site-specific effects of insulin in regulating the choice of, but not total, caloric intake, body weight, and fat storage in diabetic rats with high B. Furthermore, lard intake might be regulated by an insulin-derived, liver-mediated signal because superior mesenteric insulin infusion had similar effects on lard intake to jugular infusion but did not result in elevated circulating insulin levels likely associated with liver insulin removal.

The efficiency of meal fat uptake into upper body subcutaneous fat was similar in both sexes, but women had a greater leg fat uptake, especially in response to a HF meal (P &lt; 0.0001).

The interplay between the magnetostatic and the exchange energy favours an in-plane, closed flux domain structure. This curling magnetization turns out of the plane at the centre of the vortex structure, in an area with a radius of about 10 nanometres - the vortex core. The vortex state has a specific excitation mode: the in-plane gyration of the vortex structure about its equilibrium position. The sense of gyration is determined by the vortex core polarization. Here we report on the controlled manipulation of the vortex core polarization by excitation with small bursts of an alternating magnetic field. The vortex motion was imaged by time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. We demonstrate that the sense of gyration of the vortex structure can be reversed by applying short bursts of the sinusoidal excitation field with amplitude of about 1.5 mT. This reversal unambiguously indicates a switching of the out-of-plane core polarization. The observed switching mechanism, which can be understood in the framework of micromagnetic theory, gives insights into basic magnetization dynamics and their possible application in data storage. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Electric excitation; Ferromagnetic materials; Magnetic flux; Magnetization; Magnetostatics; Vortex flow; Alternating field; Flux domain structure; Magnetic vortex core; Short bursts; Magnetic cores; magnetic field; magnetic property; magnetization; scanning electron microscopy; vortex; article; circular dichroism; computer memory; electronics; magnetic random access memory; magnetism; polarization; priority journal; radiofrequency; vortex motion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751341020

Such devices have various military (rail guns, electromagnetic launchers, and DEW) and commercial applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles, vehicle starting (SLI), and utility peak shaving. The storage and delivery of high levels of burst power can be achieved with a capacitor, flywheel, or rechargeable battery. In order to reduce the weight and volume of many systems they must contain advanced state-of-the-art electrochemical or electromechanical power sources. There is an opportunity and a need to develop energy-storage devices that have improved high-power characteristics compared to existing ultra capacitors, flywheels or rechargeable batteries. Electro Energy, Inc. has been engaged in the development of bipolar nickel-metal hydride batteries, which may fulfil the requirements of some of these applications. This paper describes a module rated at 300 V (255 cells) (6 Ah). The volume of the module is 23 L and the mass is 56 kg. The module is designed to deliver 50 kW pulses of 10 s duration at 50% state-of-charge. Details of the mechanical design of the module, safety considerations, along with the results of initial electrical characterization testing by the customer will be discussed. Some discussion of the possibilities for design optimization is also included. © 2005.","Conductivity; Module; Nickel","Capacitors; Electric vehicles; Electromagnetic launchers; Energy storage; Flywheels; Hydrides; Nickel; Electromechanical power sources; Energy-storage devices; Utility peak shaving; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750961185

In cardiovascular allografts, endothelial cell loss or injury may lead to impaired control of vascular permeability and tone, thrombosis, and inflammation. We hypothesized that hypothermia-induced damage to the endothelium is linked to increases in intracellular catalytic iron pools and oxidative stress. In this study, bovine aortic endothelial cells and cell culture methods were used to model the response of the endothelium of cardiovascular tissues to hypothermia. Confluent cells were stored at 0°C to 25°C and cell damage was measured by lipid peroxidation (LPO) and lactate dchydrogenuse release. Varying the bleomyein-detuctible iron (BD1) in cells modulated cold-induced LPO and cell injury. In untreated cells, injury was highest at 0°C and a minimum at 10°C. A similar temperature-dependent trend was found in BDI levels and cell plating efficiencies. Arrhcnius plots of cell killing and iron accumulation rates showed biphasic temperature dependence, with minima at 10°C und matching activation energies above and below 10°C. These findings imply thut the mechanisms underlying the hypothermic increase in catalytic iron, oxidative stress, and cell killing are the same and that preservation of the endothelium may be optimized at temperatures above those routinely used.

Biological control relies upon intricate systems composed of multiple organs and specialized cell types that regulate energy up-take, storage, and expenditure. Because these systems simultaneously perform diverse functions and are highly integrated, they are extremely difficult to understand in terms of their individual component contributions to energy homeostasis. In order to provide improved treatments and clinical options, it is important to identify the principle genetic and molecular components, as well as the systemic features of regulation. To begin, many of these features can be discovered by integrating experimental technologies with advanced methods of analysis.

It is shown that the candidate of a Lyapunov function V(k) of the tracking error between the output of a neural network and the desired reference signal is chosen first, and the weights of the neural network are then updated, from the output layer to the input layer, in the sense that ΔV(k) = V(k) - V(k-1) > 0. The output tracking error can then asymptotically converge to zero according to Lyapunov stability theory. Unlike gradient-based BP training algorithms, the new Lyapunov adaptive BP algorithm in this paper is not used for searching the global minimum point along the cost-function surface in the weight space, but it is aimed at constructing an energy surface with a single global minimum point through the adaptive adjustment of the weights as the time goes to infinity. Although a neural network may have bounded input disturbances, the effects of the disturbances can be eliminated, and asymptotic error convergence can be obtained. The new Lyapunov adaptive BP algorithm is then applied to the design of an adaptive filter in the simulation example to show the fast error convergence and strong robustness with respect to large bounded input disturbances. © 2006 IEEE.","Adaptive filtering; Backpropagation (BP); Convergence; Feedforward neural networks; Lyapunov stability","Adaptive filtering; Algorithms; Asymptotic stability; Backpropagation; Computer simulation; Convergence of numerical methods; Lyapunov methods; Adaptive backpropagation algorithm; Lyapunov stability; Feedforward neural networks; algorithm; article; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; information retrieval; information science; methodology; signal processing; systems theory; Algorithms; Information Storage and Retrieval; Information Theory; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Systems Theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548618294

In this article we present two external memory index structures for the efficient retrieval of records stored on the local flash memory of a WSD. Our index structures, MicroHash and MicroGF (micro grid files), exploit the asymmetric read/write and wear characteristics of flash memory in order to offer high-performance indexing and searching capabilities in the presence of a low-energy budget, which is typical for the devices under discussion. Both structures organize data and index pages on the flash media using a sorted by timestamp file organization. A key idea behind these index structures is that expensive random access deletions are completely eliminated. MicroHash enables equality searches by value in constant time and equality searches by timestamp in logarithmic time at a small cost of storing index pages on the flash media. Similarly, MicroGF enables spatial equality and proximity searches in constant time. We have implemented these index structures in nesC, the programming language of the TinyOS operating system. Our trace-driven experimentation with several real datasets reveals that our index structures offer excellent search performance at a small cost of constructing and maintaining the index. © 2006 ACM.","Access methods; Flash memory; Wireless sensor networks","Computer operating system - TinyOS; Computer programming language - nesC; Wireless sensor devices (WSD); Wireless sensor networks; Computer operating systems; Computer programming languages; Content based retrieval; Data structures; File organization; Flash memory; Online searching; Indexing (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846686729

Our proposed architecture, PicoServer, employs 3D technology to bond one die containing several simple slow processing cores to multiple DRAM dies sufficient for a primary memory. The 3D technology also enables wide low-latency buses between processors and memory. These remove the need for an L2 cache allowing its area to be re-allocated to additional simple cores. The additional cores allow the clock frequency to be lowered without impairing throughput. Lower clock frequency in turn reduces power and means that thermal constraints, a concern with 3D stacking, are easily satisfied. The PicoServer architecture specifically targets Tier 1 server applications, which exhibit a high degree of thread level parallelism. An architecture targeted to efficient throughput is ideal for this application domain. We find for a similar logic die area, a 12 CPU system with 3D stacking and no L2 cache outperforms an 8 CPU system with a large on-chip L2 cache by about 14% while consuming 55% less power. In addition, we show that a PicoServer performs comparably to a Pentium 4-like class machine while consuming only about 1/10 of the power, even when conservative assumptions are made about the power consumption of the PicoServer.

By in situ manipulation using a nanoprobe, the nanohelix could elastically recover its shape after an extremely large axial stretching to a degree close to the theoretical limit, while suffering little residual plastic deformation. As a result, its spring constant can be increased continuously for up to 300-800%. A shape memory/recovery of the nanohelix was observed after subjecting to a buckling deformation. The superelastic deformation and fracture process of a nanohelix have been studied by transversely compressing under an AFM tip. A two-step mechanism is suggested for explaining the measured force-displacement curve. It is suggested that the small thickness and the superlattice structure of the nanohelix might be the keys for the observed superelasticity. The ZnO nanohelices may be a new category of shape-memory ceramic nanostructures, which could be of great interest for investigating nanoscale fracture process and application in MEMS and NEMS. The elastic recovery of the nanohelix after extremely large deformation makes it a potential structure for nanoscale elastic energy storage. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Buckling deformation; In situ manipulation; Nanohelices; Superelasticity; Buckling; Plastic deformation; Shape memory effect; Superlattices; Zinc oxide; Nanostructured materials; nanotube; zinc oxide; article; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; elasticity; methodology; particle size; sensitivity and specificity; Elasticity; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Nanotubes; Particle Size; Sensitivity and Specificity; Zinc Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846179046

However, not all patients who are overweight have EFRMD, and not all patients with EFRMD are significantly overweight. The adipocentric paradigm provides the basis for a unifying, pathophysiological process whereby fat gain in susceptible patients leads to fat dysfunction ('sick fat'). and wherein pathological abnormalities in fat function (adiposopathy) are more directly related to the onset of EFRMD than increases in fat mass (adiposity) alone. But just as worsening fat function worsens EFRMD, improved fat function improves EFRMD. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists increase the recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes ('healthy fat') and cause apoptosis of hypertrophic and dysfunctional (including visceral) adipocytes resulting in improved fat function and improved metabolic parameters associated with EFRMD. Weight loss interventions, such as a hypocaloric diet and physical exercise, in addition to agents such as orlistat, sibutramine and cannabinoid receptor antagonists, may have favorable effects upon fat storage (lipogenesis and fat distribution), nutrient metabolism (such as free fatty acids), favorable effects upon adipose tissue factors involved in metabolic processes and inflammation, and enhanced 'cross-talk' with other major organ systems. In some cases, weight loss therapeutic agents may even affect metabolic parameters and adipocyte function independently of weight loss alone, suggesting that the benefit of these agents in improving EFRMD may go beyond their efficacy in weight reduction. This review describes how adiposopathy interventions may affect fat function, and thus improve EFRMD. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.","Adiposopathy; Diabetes; Dyslipidemia; Hypertension; Obesity","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; acylation stimulating protein; adiponectin; adipsin; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor; androgen receptor; angiotensinogen; cannabinoid receptor antagonist; catecholamine; ceramide; cholesterol ester transfer protein; estrogen receptor; fatty acid; glucocorticoid receptor; hormone sensitive lipase; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; lipoprotein lipase; lysophospholipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pyrophosphate); plasminogen activator; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; resistin; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unindexed drug; adipocyte; adipogenesis; appetite; bariatric surgery; body fat distribution; body mass; cell differentiation; cell function; drug mechanism; dyslipidemia; exercise; genetic susceptibility; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; lipogenesis; low calory diet; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; review; side effect; therapy effect; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Anti-Obesity Agents; Diet, Reducing; Energy Metabolism; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Life Style; Metabolic Syndrome X; Obesity; Risk Factors; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845875978

Despite these adaptations, swimming in scallops is never far from failure, and it is surprising to find a swimming scallop in Antarctica, where low temperature increases the viscosity of seawater, decreases the power output of the adductor muscle and potentially compromises the energy storage capability of the hinge material (abductin, a protein rubber). How does the Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, cope with the cold? Its shell mass is substantially reduced relative to that of temperate and tropical scallops, but this potential advantage is more than offset by a drastic reduction in adductor-muscle mass. By contrast, A. colbecki's abductin maintains a higher resilience at low temperatures than does the abductin of a temperate scallop. This resilience may help to compensate for reduced muscle mass, assisting the Antarctic scallop to maintain its marginal swimming ability. However, theory suggests that this assistance should be slight, so the adaptive value of increased resilience remains open to question. The high resilience of A. colbecki abductin at low temperatures may be of interest to materials engineers.","Abductin; Adamussium colbecki; Antarctic; Jet propulsion; Scallop; Swimming","Abductin; protein; animal; Antarctica; article; biomechanics; cold; genetics; histology; muscle; physiology; scallop; swimming; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Biomechanics; Cold; Muscles; Pectinidae; Proteins; Swimming; Adamussium colbecki; Bivalvia; Pectinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845725205

Although the metabolic pathways responsible for storage reserve synthesis such as carbohydrates, oils, and proteins are known, little is known about their regulation. Protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous form of regulation that influences many aspects of dynamic cellular behavior in plant biology. Here a systematic study has been conducted on five sequential stages (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after flowering) of seed development in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. Reston) to survey the presence and dynamics of phosphoproteins. High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with a phosphoprotein-specific Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein fluorescence stain revealed ∼300 phosphoprotein spots. Of these, quantitative expression profiles for 234 high quality spots were established, and hierarchical cluster analyses revealed the occurrence of six principal expression trends during seed filling. The identity of 103 spots was determined using LC-MS/MS. The identified spots represented 70 non-redundant phosphoproteins belonging to 10 major functional categories including energy, metabolism, protein destination, and signal transduction. Furthermore phosphorylation within 16 non-redundant phosphoproteins was verified by mapping the phosphorylation sites by LC-MS/MS. Although one of these sites was postulated previously, the remaining sites have not yet been reported in plants. Phosphoprotein data were assembled into a web database. Together this study provides evidence for the presence of a large number of functionally diverse phosphoproteins, including global regulatory factors like 14-3-3 proteins, within developing B. napus seed. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"annexin; beta tubulin; carboxyltransferase; cysteine synthase; dehydroascorbic acid reductase; elongation factor 1alpha; fluorescent dye; fructokinase; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; glutamate cysteine ligase; heat shock cognate protein 70; heat shock protein; heat shock protein 70; initiation factor 4A; initiation factor 4B; malate dehydrogenase; peroxiredoxin; phosphoglucomutase; phosphoglycerate kinase; phosphoprotein; phosphoribulokinase; proteasome; protein 14 3 3; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; pyruvate decarboxylase; regulator protein; ribosome protein; transketolase; triosephosphate isomerase; unindexed drug; article; Brassica; cluster analysis; controlled study; energy; functional proteomics; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolism; nonhuman; plant seed; priority journal; protein analysis; protein database; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein processing; quantitative analysis; rapeseed; seed development; signal transduction; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Amino Acid Sequence; Brassica napus; Chromatography, Liquid; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Seeds; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Brassica napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751401609

While carboxylic acids have been historically known to serve as fuel sources and biomarkers of disease, these studies demonstrate that fatty acids can act as signalling molecules at the cell-surface level. This receptor subfamily shares approx. 30% identity among members, with some limited cross-over between ligand activities. Generalized expression patterns within the pancreatic β-cell, adipose depots and the gastrointestinal tract infer involvement in energy source recognition, absorption, storage and/or metabolism. GPR40, activated by medium and long-chain fatty acids, has been shown to potentiate insulin secretion at the β-cell, and has been hypothesized to participate in the detrimental effects of chronic fatty acid exposure on β-cell function. GPR41 and GPR43 have been reported to stimulate leptin release and adipogenesis respectively via activation by short-chain fatty acids.

In a typical field deployment, a sensor network self-organizes, closely interacts with its physical environment, and works unattended possibly in a hostile environment such as a battlefield. In such environments, sensor networks are subject to node capture as well as a myriad of other attacks. Constrained energy, memory, and computational capabilities of sensor nodes mandate a clever design of security solutions to minimize overhead while maintaining secure communications over the lifespan of the network. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Combinatorial Key management scheme, DCK, to provide efficient, scalable, and survivable dynamic keying in a clustered sensor network with a large number of sensor nodes. DCK employs the Exclusion-Basis Systems (EBS) as the underlying framework for key management at both the cluster and the sensor node levels. DCK enhances network security by localizing cluster key management functions, thus, limiting the impact of sensor node capture to the attacked cluster. Within a cluster, DCK decouples key generation, assignment, and distribution, and distributes the key management tasks among cluster nodes. Simulation results show that DCK is efficient in terms of energy consumption and storage. Also, it significantly outperforms other dynamic keying schemes, in particular with regards to energy consumed in key refreshment and re-keying after node capture.

The 3D shapes and the high aspect ratio of the resulting carbon structures are critical factors in applications where specific surface area plays a key role. Furthermore, lithographic techniques used in the C-MEMS technology may solve the downscaling problems of conventional carbon manufacturing techniques. The application of C-MEMS as a lithium-ion battery anode has already been demonstrated in our previous work. It is well known that a protective film, referred to as the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), forms on carbonaceous materials used as negative electrodes in commercial lithium-ion batteries. The passivating film forms during the first battery charging cycle. Detailed SEI investigations of this film, made up of electrolyte decomposition products, have not been explored yet.

A field study compared fall and spring harvest measuring biomass yield, element concentration, carbohydrate characterization, and total synthetic gas production as indicators of biofuel quality for direct combustion, ethanol production, and gasification systems for generation of energy. Switchgrass yields decreased almost 40% (from about 7-4.4 Mg ha-1) in winters with above average snowfall when harvest was delayed over winter until spring. The moisture concentration also decreased (from about 350-70 g kg -1) only reaching low enough levels for safe storage by spring. About 10% of the yield reduction during winter resulted from decreases in tiller mass; however, almost 90% of the yield reduction was due to an increase in biomass left behind by the baler. Mineral element concentrations generally decreased with the delay in harvest until spring. Energy yield from gasification did not decrease on a unit biomass basis, whereas ethanol production was variable depending on the assessment method. When expressed on a unit area basis, energy yield decreased. Biofuel conversion systems may determine harvest timing. For direct combustion, the reduced mineral concentrations in spring-harvested biomass are desirable. For ethanol fermentation and gasification systems, however, lignocellulose yield may be more important. On conservations lands, the wildlife cover provided by switchgrass over the winter may increase the desirability of spring harvest along with the higher biofuel quality. © American Society of Agronomy.",,"Biomass; Carbohydrates; Gasification; Harvesting; Biofuel quality; Gasification systems; Harvest timing; Plants (botany); Biomass; Carbohydrates; Gasification; Harvesting; Plants; Panicum virgatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751107201

Mice were studied in middle-adulthood and were fed a low-energy, low-fat diet during their lifetime. We measured the weight of the retroperitoneal adipose depot (near the kidney) and the gonadal adipose depot (near the epididymis in males and ovaries in females). An important feature of the analysis was the comparison of linkage results for absolute adipose depot weight and depot weight adjusted for body size, i.e., relative weight. We detected 67 suggestive linkages for six phenotypes, which fell into one of three categories: those specific to absolute but not relative depot weight (Chr 5, 11, and 14), those specific to relative but not absolute depot weight (Chr 9, 15, and 16), and those involving both (Chr 2 and 7). Some quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affected one adipose depot more than another: Retroperitoneal depot weight was linked to Chr 8, 11, 12, and 17, but the linkage effects for the gonadal depot were stronger for Chr 5, 7, and 9. Several linkages were specific to sex; for instance, the absolute weight of gonadal fat was linked to Chromosome 7 in male (LOD = 3.4) but not female mice (LOD = 0.2).

Kinematic variables (limb phase, duty factor) provide important timing information regarding the neural control and limb coordination of various gaits. Whereas, mechanical variables (potential and kinetic energy relative phase, %Recovery, %Congruity) provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that minimize muscle work and the metabolic cost of locomotion, and also influence neural control strategies. Two basic mechanisms identified by Cavagna et al. (1977. Am J Physiol 233:R243-R261) are used broadly by various bipedal and quadrupedal species. During walking, animals exchange CoM potential energy (PE) with kinetic energy (KE) via an inverted pendulum mechanism to reduce muscle work. During the stance period of running (including trotting, hopping and galloping) gaits, animals convert PE and KE into elastic strain energy in spring elements of the limbs and trunk and regain this energy later during limb support. The bouncing motion of the body on the support limb(s) is well represented by a simple mass-spring system. Limb spring compliance allows the storage and return of elastic energy to reduce muscle work. These two distinct patterns of CoM mechanical energy exchange are fairly well correlated with kinematic distinctions of limb movement patterns associated with gait change. However, in some cases such correlations can be misleading. When running (or trotting) at low speeds many animals lack an aerial period and have limb duty factors that exceed 0.5. Rather than interpreting this as a change of gait, the underlying mechanics of the body's CoM motion indicate no fundamental change in limb movement pattern or CoM dynamics has occurred. Nevertheless, the idealized, distinctive patterns of CoM energy fluctuation predicted by an inverted pendulum for walking and a bouncing mass spring for running are often not clear cut, especially for less cursorial species. When the kinematic and mechanical patterns of a broader diversity of quadrupeds and bipeds are compared, more complex patterns emerge, indicating that some animals may combine walking and running mechanics at intermediate speeds or at very large size. These models also ignore energy costs that are likely associated with the opposing action of limbs that have overlapping support times during walking. A recent model of terrestrial gait (Ruina et al., 2005. J Theor Biol, in press) that treats limb contact with the ground in terms of collisional energy loss indicates that considerable CoM energy can be conserved simply by matching the path of CoM motion perpendicular to limb ground force. This model, coupled with the earlier ones of pendular exchange during walking and mass-spring elastic energy savings during running, provides compelling argument for the view that the legged locomotion of quadrupeds and other terrestrial animals has generally evolved to minimize muscle work during steady level movement. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"animal; article; audiovisual equipment; biomechanics; comparative study; gait; physiology; running; vertebrate; walking; Animals; Biomechanics; Gait; Models, Anatomic; Running; Vertebrates; Walking; Animalia; Tetrapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751008648

Thus, it is not surprising that fungi possess a broad range of hydrolytic enzymes that attack neutral lipids and phospholipids. Especially during infection of a mammalian host, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes released by fungi could play important roles not only for nutrient acquisition and tissue invasion, but for intricate modulation of the host's immune response.

With higher X-ray fluxes and improved focusing, it is usually the scattered intensity detector that places the most serious limitations on the overall capabilities of the instrument. Incorporating relatively simple components like point detectors, scattering standards, masking filters and in-line sample visualization into the flight tube of a pinhole-geometry SAXS camera can do much to mitigate these limitations. How these enhancements can be incorporated into routine data collection is demonstrated on the ChemMatCARS SAXS instrument, which utilizes pinhole geometry with an undulator insertion device at sector 15 of the Advanced Photon Source. In addition, with an X-ray energy range of 6-32 keV (2.0-0.4 Å) and an energy resolution of 10-4 ΔE/E, this instrument can measure anomalous SAXS over a wide variety of atom species, with reliable normalization of scattered data. © 2006 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.","Small-angle x-ray scattering; Wide-angle x-ray scattering","Calibration; Data acquisition; Geometrical optics; Masks; Synchrotrons; X ray scattering; Insertion devices; Point detectors; Small angle x ray scattering (SAXS); Wide angle x ray scattering; X ray optics; article; calibration; factual database; filtration; information retrieval; instrumentation; methodology; optics; radiation scattering; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; standard; synchrotron; X ray diffraction; Calibration; Databases, Factual; Filtration; Information Storage and Retrieval; Optics; Reproducibility of Results; Scattering, Small Angle; Sensitivity and Specificity; Synchrotrons; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750297821

This instability had a form that was not detected by routine assessment, but rather was observed only by collecting many consecutive shock waves in nonstop regimen. Materials and Methods: A Dornier® DoLi-50 lithotriptor used exclusively for basic research was tested and approved by the regional technician. This assessment included hydrophone measures at select power levels with the collection of about 25 shock waves per setting. Subsequent laboratory characterization used a fiberoptic hydrophone and storage oscilloscope for data acquisition. Waveforms were collected nonstop for hundreds of pulses. Results: Output was typically stable for greater than 1,000 shock waves but substantial fluctuations in acoustic pressures were also observed. For example, output at power level 3 (mean peak positive acoustic pressure ± SD normally 44 ± 2 MPa) increased dramatically to greater than 50 MPa or decreased significantly to approximately 30 MPa for hundreds of shock waves. The cause of instability was eventually traced to a faulty lithotriptor power supply. Conclusions: Instability in lithotriptor acoustic output can occur and it may not be detected by routine assessment. Collecting waveforms in a nonstop regimen dramatically increases sampling size, improving the detection of instability. Had the instability that we observed occurred during patient treatment, the energy delivered may well have exceeded the planned dose. Since the potential for adverse effects in lithotripsy increases as the dose is increased, it would be valuable to develop ways to better monitor the acoustic output of lithotriptors. © 2006 American Urological Association.","acoustics; adverse effects; kidney; lithotripsy","acoustics; article; device; electromagnetic field; fiber optics; laboratory test; lithotripsy; lithotriptor; medical research; oscilloscope; power supply; priority journal; shock wave; waveform; Acoustics; Electromagnetics; Lithotripsy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750295476

All available evidences suggest that the earliest photosynthetic organisms were anoxygenic and that oxygen-evolving photosynthesis is a more recent development. The reaction center complexes that form the heart of the energy storage process are integral membrane pigment proteins that span the membrane in vectorial fashion to carry out electron transfer. The origin and extent of distribution of these proteins has been perplexing from a phylogenetic point of view mostly because of extreme sequence divergence. A series of integral membrane proteins of known structure and varying degrees of sequence identity have been compared using combinatorial extension-Monte Carlo methods. The proteins include photosynthetic reaction centers from proteobacteria and cyanobacterial photosystems I and II, as well as cytochrome oxidase, bacteriorhodopsin, and cytochrome b. The reaction center complexes show a remarkable conservation of the core structure of 5 transmembrane helices, strongly implying common ancestry, even though the residual sequence identity is less than 10%, whereas the other proteins have structures that are unrelated. A relationship of sequence with structure was derived from the reaction center structures; with characteristic decay length of 1.6 Å. Phylogenetic trees derived from the structural alignments give insights into the earliest photosynthetic reaction center, strongly suggesting that it was a homodimeric complex that did not evolve oxygen. © The Author 2006.

Major considerations include the soaring worldwide price of petroleum products, especially home heating oil, the toxicity of the petroleum-derived fuels and the environmental damage that leaking petroleum tanks afford. For these reasons, it has been suggested that domestic renewable energy sources be considered as replacements, or at the least, as blending stocks for home heating fuels. If recycled soy restaurant cooking oils could be employed for this purpose, this would represent an environmental advantage. Renewable plant sources of energy tend to be less toxic than their petroleum counterparts. This is an important consideration when tank leakage occurs. Home fuel oil storage tanks practically always contain some bottom water. This water environment has a pH value that factors into heating fuel stability. Therefore, the question is: would the biofuel help or exacerbate fuel stability and furnace maintenance issues?

The potential failure mechanism of flywheels constructed with fiber composites was evaluated. Analytical codes for predicting elastic and viscoelastic (long-term) behavior was developed for flywheel design. Material characterization and test matrices were proposed to design flywheels with maximum performance. Component level test methods and devices were developed to validate flywheel performance.

Quasi-static tests were performed using a miniature loading stage while a Kolsky bar apparatus was used to investigate intermediate deformation rates. High deformation rates were examined using a light gas gun. Optical imaging of the sample deformation was performed in real time by means of high-speed photography. In this article, we provide a quantification of load-deformation response and associated failure modes across the sample as captured by high-speed photography. A finite element model is formulated and thorough simulations performed to understand the roles of material strain rate hardening and structural microinertia. Deformation modes were identified from acquired images, force-deformation histories and numerical modeling. Comparison between force-deformation histories under quasi-static and Kolsky bar loading reveals a moderate microinertia effect as manifested by a small increase in peak compressive stress. At high deformation rates, gas gun experiments, a totally different deformation mode is manifested with a major increase in peak compressive stress. In this case, the inertia associated to the bending and buckling of truss struts played a significant role. This effect appears to dominate the early truss core response because of two effects: (i) the propagation of a plastic wave along the truss members; (ii) buckling induced lateral motion. These findings are consistent with prior theoretical and computational work carried out by Vaughn et al. (2005) [Vaughn, D. Canning, M., Hutchinson, J.W., 2005. Coupled plastic wave propagation and column buckling. Journal of Applied Mechanics 72 (1), 1-8]. At larger deformations, the material strain rate hardening contribution to the total energy is as pronounced as the contribution arising from microinertia effect. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Practical considerations in this effort should include walnut orientation, differential heating between open and closed shell walnuts after bleaching, intermittent mixing to improve heating uniformity, nut quality after storage, and energy costs. A pilot-scale 27 MHz, 6 kW/12 kW RF system was used to determine the effect of process parameters on walnut temperature distribution. Temperatures of vertically oriented walnuts were 7.4 °C higher than those of horizontally oriented walnuts. The open shell walnuts heated much faster in RF systems than closed shell walnuts after 1.5 min of bleaching. Mixing the walnuts twice during 3 min of RF treatment improved the heating uniformity of final walnut temperatures by reducing non-uniformity of the electromagnetic field in the RF system. The accelerated shelf life tests at 35 °C for 10 and 20 days provided accurate simulations of actual storage at 4 °C for 1- and 2-year periods, respectively, based on similar peroxide and free fatty acid values. The energy costs of treating 4540 kg/h was only $0.23 cents/kg.

The proton pump bacteriorhodopsin and the phototaxis receptor sensory rhodopsin II (SRII) differ by 74% of their residues, with nearly all conserved residues within the photoreactive retinal-binding pocket in the membrane-embedded center of the proteins. Here, we show that three residues in bacteriorhodopsin replaced by the corresponding residues in SRII enable bacteriorhodopsin to efficiently relay the retinal photoisomerization signal to the SRII integral membrane transducer (HtrII) and induce robust phototaxis responses. A single replacement (Ala-215-Thr), bridging the retinal and the membrane-embedded surface, confers weak phototaxis signaling activity, and the additional two (surface substitutions Pro-200-Thr and Val-210-Tyr), expected to align bacteriorhodopsin and HtrII in similar juxtaposition as SRII and HtrII, greatly enhance the signaling. In SRII, the three residues form a chain of hydrogen bonds from the retinal's photoisomerized C13=C14 double bond to residues in the membrane-embedded α-helices of HtrII. The results suggest a chemical mechanism for signaling that entails initial storage of energy of photoisomerization in SRII's hydrogen bond between Tyr-174, which is in contact with the retinal, and Thr-204, which borders residues on the SRII surface in contact with HtrII, followed by transfer of this chemical energy to drive structural transitions in the transducer helices. The results demonstrate that evolution accomplished an elegant but simple conversion: The essential differences between transport and signaling proteins in the rhodopsin family are far less than previously imagined. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Bacteriorhodopsin; Phototaxis; Retinal; Sensory rhodopsin; Transport","alanine; amino acid; bacteriorhodopsin; proline; proton pump; sensory rhodopsin; sensory rhodopsin II; threonine; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; alpha helix; amino acid substitution; article; hydrogen bond; ion transport; isomerization; light; nonhuman; phototaxis; priority journal; protein transport; sensory receptor; Bacteriorhodopsins; Crystallography, X-Ray; Halobacterium salinarum; Hydrogen Bonding; Models, Molecular; Photochemistry; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Protein Transport; Protons; Receptors, Sensory; Spectrum Analysis; Halobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750795324

It was found that addition of 5% Co increased the NOx storage capacity of a 1% Rh/15% Ba catalyst by 50% and that of a 1% Pt/15% Ba catalyst by 100%. This promotional effect was attributed to the high oxidizing ability of Co, present in the form of Co3O4, providing extra oxidation sites for NO to NO2 conversion and more contact area for NO2 spillover to Ba storage sites. Empirical models were developed to predict the NOx conversion capacity of the catalyst as a function of total cycle time and the fraction spent in the lean phase. Using these models, it was found that 5% Co also improved the performance of 1% Pt/15% Ba and 1% Rh/15% Ba catalysts at higher lean fractions, allowing substantial improvement in overall fuel efficiency. The reduction capacity of Co was much less than that of noble metals, such that noble metals were still necessary (although at a reduced loading) for regenerating the catalyst in the rich phase. Along these lines, it was found that a 0.25% Pt/5% Co/15% Ba-containing catalyst showed better performance than a 1% Pt/15% Ba-containing catalyst. This implies that the cost of NSR catalysts can be substantially reduced by replacing some of the Pt with Co as the active oxidizing metal in NSR catalyst formulations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of thermal pretreatment (120°C under vacuum) prior to aging on the electrochemical properties of the electrodes was studied in detail. Electrochemical impedance measurements, which were carried out periodically during storage, showed that (i) the electrodes' interfacial impedance decreased substantially with the heat-treatment time, (ii) the rate of impedance increase upon storage in electrolyte at elevated temperatures was predetermined by the heat-treatment parameters, and (iii) physicochemical properties of carbon (carbon black) were primarily responsible for the observed interfacial impedance behavior of the electrodes during aging. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, and Fourier transform infrared analysis of aged electrodes revealed a thin surface film of electrolyte decomposition products. Adsorbed water and oxygen containing surface groups on carbon reacted with the electrolyte to produce inorganic and organic surface deposits. The thin-film formation on carbon black particles during aging, and consequently, a gradual loss of electronic conductivity within the electrode is most likely responsible for degradation of electrochemical performance. © 2006 The Electrochemical Society.

Special attention is paid to the processes which occur in electrodes with double electric layer (DEL) of HES capacitors during their charge and discharge by different currents. It is demonstrated theoretically that in the efficiency of HES capacitors' operation, an important role is played by distribution of the potential along the thickness of electrodes with DEL. In order to build capacitors with improved parameters and optimal design, it is of paramount importance to take account of the type and value of conductivity of the material of the electrode with DEL and conductivity of the electrolyte in its pores. Analysis is performed to determine the efficiency of PbO2 |H 2SO4|C system capacitors' operation subject to thickness, conductivity, and specific capacitance of the electrode with DEL. It is established that energy and capacity parameters of the capacitors depend to a great extent on conductivity of their negative electrodes and electrolytes.

Autotomy strongly decreased feeding, energy storage and growth. Intact juveniles showed a ∼ 3 fold higher feeding rate than autotomized individuals throughout the experiment. Intact juveniles also had a higher (∼ 5 fold) energy content per pyloric caeca in each arm. This was mainly due to higher lipid content, the main proximate constituent of pyloric caeca. Intact juveniles showed a greater growth rate and reached a greater size than autotomized individuals, more evident for underwater mass than radius length. The reduced capacity to feed reduced energy intake in autotomized individuals. However, low energy reserves along with low growth in autotomized sea stars, support the hypothesis that juveniles of this species allocate energy to regeneration to the detriment of growth. This was also supported by the ∼ 25% of arm length regeneration after 5 mo. Remaining small could increase risk of lethal predation, however, S. striatus may reduce predation risk by using crevices and kelp holdfasts as refuges from predators. Given the strong impact of autotomy on feeding, regeneration of arms to recover full capacity to forage and grow seems a better strategy for juvenile S. striatus, than merely growing. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We have found that, while a single Ti atom at the corner can bind up to three hydrogen molecules, a single Ti atom on the surface of the cluster can bind only one hydrogen molecule. Accordingly, a Ti8C12 met-car can bind up to 16H2 molecules and hence can be considered as a high-capacity hydrogen storage medium. Strong interaction between two met-car clusters leading to the dimer formation can affect H2 storage capacity slightly. Increasing the storage capacity by directly inserting H 2 into the met-car or by functionalizing it with an Na atom have been explored. It is found that the insertion of neither an H2 molecule nor an Na atom could further promote the H2 storage capacity of a Ti8C12 cluster. We have also tested the stability of the H2-adsorbed Ti8C12 met-car with ab initio molecular dynamics calculations which have been carried out at room temperature. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Adsorption; Dimerization; Hydrogen; Molecular dynamics; Thermal effects; Titanium alloys; Dimer formation; Hydrogen molecules; Hydrogen storage; Titanium metallocarbohedryne (met-car); Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749438540

In this paper, we propose an efficient data-collection scheme that can be used for event monitoring or network-wide diagnosis. Our scheme relies on the well-known representation of data-contour maps, which trade off accuracy with the amount of samples. The scheme consists of three novel algorithms to build contour maps: distributed spatial and temporal data suppression, contour reconstruction at the sink via interpolation and smoothing, and an efficient mechanism to convey routing information over multiple hops. By reducing the number of transmissions required to convey relevant information to the sink, the proposed contour mapping scheme saves energy and improves network lifetime. In a sharp contrast to related work in this area, the scheme does not require all nodes to explicitly share information. The contour mapping scheme can be applied for tasks such as: (1) presenting a global picture of the network in both temporal and spatial domains, (2) being used as a diagnosis tool, e.g., to detect faulty sensors and to scan for residual energy, (3) working in concert with in-network aggregation schemes to further reduce the communication overhead of aggregation schemes. The proposed scheme imposes little processing and storage overhead, allowing for the sensor networking paradigm of 'dumb sensor, smart sink' which enables economical deployment of large-scale sensor networks. Simulation results show that our scheme is resilient to both high packet loss rate and measurement noise. The design is also energy efficient, resulting in up to an-order-of-magnitude power savings when compared with the base line scheme where every sensor sends its report to the sink. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, it is a major variable for plant disease prediction. Surface wetness is commonly measured with electronic sensors but simulation with a surface wetness model is an alternative. Recently, the increased use of interpolation procedures and atmospheric models to produce site-specific weather products has created a greater need for reliable surface wetness models. However, surface wetness models have not been widely used operationally because they are often highly complex, do not simulate both dews and rain or do not adapt well to a new spatial scale or crop. Other models estimate surface wetness in units that are cumbersome to observe in the field. In addition, few models have been calibrated to observed surface wetness over a wide range of atmospheric variables and plant leaf properties under controlled environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to develop a surface wetness model that would be appropriate for operational use in site-specific weather products for grapes. For this purpose, we developed the surface wetness energy balance (SWEB) model based on a 'big leaf'. The SWEB model consists of four sub-modules describing: (i) surface water distribution based on an observed wet fraction; (ii) canopy water budget; (iii) energy balance module based on a combination equation developed by Tanner and Fuchs; (iv) a transfer function based on Bird et al.'s generic transfer coefficient that was previously calibrated to surface wetness under controlled conditions. The SWEB model can be adapted to the physical characteristics of a particular crop by adjusting four plant parameters: leaf area index (LAI), maximum fraction of canopy allowed as wet surface area (Wmax), crop height and maximum water storage. The SWEB model is most sensitive to LAI and Wmax. The SWEB model is close to the required criteria for a suitable surface wetness model including simplicity, utility, scalability, easily observable output units and in addition, it has been calibrated under controlled conditions.

By searching an effective Hamiltonian in which the energy of lithium imide is expressed as a function of imide group orientations it is shown that nearest-neighbor imide groups prefer to orient antiparallel within a {110} plane of the antifluorite host structure.

The large, water-filled stems of baobab trees (Adansonia spp.) are generally assumed to serve a water storage function, yet recent studies indicate limited use of stored water. Through an analysis of wood structure and composition, we examined whether baobab morphology reflects biomechanical constraints rather than water storage capacity in the six Madagascar baobab species. Baobab wood has a high water content (up to 79%), low wood density (0.09-0.17 g·cm-3), high parenchyma content (69-88%), and living cells beyond 35 cm into the xylem from the cambium. Volumetric construction cost of the wood is several times lower than in more typical trees, and the elastic modulus approaches that of parenchyma tissue. Safety factors calculated from estimated elastic buckling heights were low, indicating that baobabs are not more overbuilt than other temperate and tropical trees, yet the energy investment in stem material is comparable to that in temperate deciduous trees. Furthermore, the elastic modulus of the wood decreases with water content, such that excessive water withdrawal from the stem could affect mechanical stability.","Anatomy; Biomechanics; Bombacaceae; Construction cost; Madagascar; Parenchyma; Safety factor; Water storage","biomechanics; deciduous tree; morphology; stem; water content; wood; Adansonia; Adansonia digitata; Malvaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749427983

Property optimization for specific applications rests largely on controlling the volume, size, and shape of the pores at the synthetic level. Direct atom-scale experiments which might accurately and reliably measure these quantities are problematic, so indirect methods such as gas sorption are generally employed. Here we apply a second indirect method, small-angle X-ray scattering (S AXS), to study porosity in carbidederived carbons (CDC).

It can be challenging to save energy and improve performance at the same time in conventional (i.e. single-rotation-rate) disk-based storage systems. Most existing solutions compromise performance for energy conservation. In this paper, we propose a redundancy-based, two-level I/O cache architecture called RIMAC to address this problem. The idea of RIMAC is to enable data on the standby disk to be recovered by accessing data in the two-level I/O cache or on currently active/idle disks. At both cache and disk levels, RIMAC dynamically transforms accesses toward standby disks by exploiting parity redundancy in parity-based redundant disk arrays. Because I/O requests that require physical accesses on standby disks involve long waiting time and high power consumption for disk spin-up (tens of seconds for SCSI disks), transforming those requests to accesses in a two-level, collaborative I/O cache or on active disks can significantly improve both energy efficiency and performance.In RIMAC, we developed i) two power-Aware read request transformation schemes called Transformable Read in Cache (TRC) and Transformable Read on Disk (TRD), ii) a power-Aware write request transformation policy for parity update and iii) a second-chance parity cache replacement algorithm to improve request transformation rate. We evaluated RIMAC by augmenting a validated storage system simulator, disksim. For several real-life server traces including HP's cello 99, TPC-D and SPC's search engine, RIMAC is shown to reduce energy consumption by up to 33% and simultaneously improve the average response time by up to 30%. © 2006 Authors.","cache management; disk storage; power management","Digital storage; Energy utilization; Green computing; Hierarchical systems; HPSS; Power management; Redundancy; Search engines; Cache architecture; Cache replacement algorithm; Hierarchical caches; High power consumption; Improve performance; Reduce energy consumption; Transformation rates; Transformation scheme; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080670111

These modal data consist of all propagating modes and edge vibrations and they constitute the basis for a wave function expansion of the reflection of waves arriving at the traction-free end of the cylinder. Without any other external stimulus, a passive reflection event occurs. This traction-free end condition is enforced at the Gaussian integration points over the end cross-section on the combination of incoming and reflected wave fields. Reflections due to monochromatic incoming axisymmetric (m = 0) and flexural (m = 1) waves are studied and two numerical examples are presented. For an incoming axisymmetric wave, there is a particular frequency that induces an end resonance, which is characterized by high (but finite) amplitudes of end displacements vis-a-vis those of neighboring (i.e., slightly different) frequencies. This phenomenon is illustrated in the two cylinder examples. It is possible to modify the passive reflection event by imposing some voltage distribution over the free end. For an oscillating end voltage that is out-of-phase with the incoming wave, it is possible to extract electrical energy from it, i.e., energy harvesting. Examples of such an oscillating voltage with a particular radial distribution are given, that illustrate the amount of extracted energy as a function of the frequency of the incident monochromatic wave. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The physiological importance of lipids is illustrated by the numerous diseases to which lipid abnormalities contribute, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease. Lipidomics, a branch of metabolomics, is a systems-based study of all lipids, the molecules with which they interact, and their function within the cell. Recent advances in soft-ionization mass spectrometry, combined with established separation techniques, have allowed the rapid and sensitive detection of a variety of lipid species with minimal sample preparation. A ""lipid profile"" from a crude lipid extract is a mass spectrum of the composition and abundance of the lipids it contains, which can be used to monitor changes over time and in response to particular stimuli. Lipidomics, integrated with genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, will contribute toward understanding how lipids function in a biological system and will provide a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanism of lipid-based disease, for biomarker screening, and for monitoring pharmacologic therapy.

The high dielectric constant also causes the polarization saturation at fields much below the breakdown field and whereby the discharged energy density increases nearly linearly with applied field, distinctively different from the low dielectric constant linear dielectric polymers whose energy density rises with square of the applied field. The strong frequency dispersion and nonlinear polarization response (polarization saturation) of the relaxor terpolymer result in a low effective capacitance at the beginning of the discharge and the effective capacitance increases with time during the discharge. Furthermore, due to the frequency dispersion and nonlinear effect, the discharged energy density of the terpolymer to a resistor load RL increases with RL.

Relevant studies and results show that this class of electroactive polymers offers unique properties in comparison with other ferroelectric polymers. The terpolymer exhibits high electrostrictive strain (&gt;7%) with relatively high modulus (&gt;0.3GPa). It has been also observed that the large electrostrictive strain is nearly constant in the temperature range from 20 to 80°C. The high room temperature relative dielectric constant (∼50), which is the highest among all the known polymers), high induced polarization (∼ 0.05 C/m2), and high electric breakdown field (&gt;400 MV/m) lead to very high volume efficiency for the electric energy storage operated under high voltage (∼10 J/cm 3). © 2006 IEEE.","Actuators; Capacitors; Electrostrictive polymer","Actuators; Capacitors; Crystalline materials; Electrostriction; Permittivity; Polymerization; Electrostrictive polymers; Semicrystalline terpolymers; Trifluoroethylene (TrFE); Vinylidene fluoride (VDF); Terpolymers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750797557

There is a metabolic cost associated with fluctuations in mechanical energy, even in the most efficient animals. In this study we investigate the exchanges between different forms of mechanical energy involved in high-speed gallop locomotion in Thoroughbred race horses during over-ground locomotion using innovative, mobile data collection techniques. We use hoof-mounted accelerometers to capture foot contact times, a GPS data logger to monitor speed and an inertial sensor mounted over the dorsal spinous processes of the fourth to sixth thoracic vertebrae (the withers) of the horse to capture trunk movement with six degrees of freedom. Trunk movement data were used to estimate the movement of the centre of mass (CoM). Linear (craniocaudal, mediolateral and dorsoventral) and rotational (roll, pitch and heading) kinematic parameters (displacement, velocity and acceleration) were calculated for seven horses at gallop speeds ranging from 7 to 17 m s-1 during their regular training sessions. These were used to estimate external mechanical energy (potential energy and linear kinetic energy of the CoM) as well as selected components of internal energy (angular kinetic energy). Elastic energy storage in the limbs was estimated from duty factor, sine wave assumptions and published leg stiffness values. External mechanical energy changes were dominated by changes in craniocaudal velocity. Potential energy change, which was in phase with craniocaudal energy during the front limb stances, was small. Elastic energy storage in the limbs was small compared to the overall amplitude of fluctuation of external mechanical energy. Galloping at high speeds does not therefore fit classical spring mass mechanics.","Biomechanics; Centre of mass movement; High speed locomotion; Horse; Mechanical energy","acceleration; animal; article; biomechanics; body weight; comparative study; gait; horse; locomotion; physiology; telemetry; Acceleration; Animals; Biomechanics; Body Weight; Gait; Horses; Locomotion; Telemetry; Animalia; Equidae; Equus caballus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750589685

Mansf., intended for export to Japan. Apples were exposed in water baths to 27,12MHz RF energy at 12 kW with a pulse mode of 30 s-on/30 s-offfor different durations. The temperature uniformity was determined by measurements at 12 sites evenly spaced at two depths in the fruit. The most promising exposure time was 29 min. The efficacy of the treatment with the pulse mode was examined against the codling moth larvae by using exposures between 27 and 30 min and up to 30 min of holding time in bath after treatment. The treatment that killed all larvae with the least amount of energy was the 29-min exposure with 50-min holding time. This treatment was appraised for fruit quality in ""Delicious"" apples. Some injury was observed when treated fruits were removed from 1C storage after 30 days. When these fruits were held at 25C for 1 week, all were too damaged to evaluate for fruit quality.

In this talk an overview of the current physics and system performance of the HLT selection for electrons and photons is given. The performance has been evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and has been partly demonstrated in the ATLAS testbeam in 2004. The efficiency for the signal channels, the rate expected for the selection, the global data preparation and execution times will be highlighted.

These properties make them appealing dielectrics for use in high-energy storage systems and as high-power switching media. Most of the studies on electrical breakdown and recovery have focused on water as a switch medium in pulsed-power systems. As an alternative to water, the authors have studied the breakdown and dielectric recovery of propylene carbonate (C4H6O3). One advantage of propylene carbonate over water is its relatively low freezing temperature of -55 °C, which allows its use at a high altitude. The permittivity of propylene carbonate is 65, somewhat less than water (81). Its dielectric strength for pulses of 200-ns duration was measured as 2.2 MV/cm, higher than that of water (1.5 MV/cm). A nonlinear increase in conductivity above electric fields of 1.225 MV/cm, assumed to be due to field-enhanced dissociation, was recorded in both cases. The recovery of propylene carbonate is similar to that of water, with plasma decay, shock-wave emission, and vapor bubble formation, except for the very last phase, which is determined by chemical reactions: the generation and decay of polypropylene polymers. This limits the time for dielectric recovery of propylene carbonate switches to values of more than 10 ms. © 2006 IEEE.","Breakdown; Dielectric recovery; Polar liquid; Polypropylene carbonate; Propylene carbonate; Shock wave; Vapor bubble; Water","Bubble formation; Carbonates; Electric breakdown of liquids; Electric conductivity of liquids; Permittivity; Plasma shock waves; Polypropylenes; Propylene; Dielectric recovery; Dielectric strength; Polar liquid; Polypropylene carbonate; Propylene carbonate; Vapor bubble; Dielectric liquids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750393647

This parameter determines how charge will accumulate and redistribute across the spacecraft, as well as the timescale for charge transport and dissipation. American Society for Testing and Materials constant-voltage methods are shown to provide inaccurate resistivity measurements for materials with resistivities greater than ∼1017 Ω · cm or with long polarization decay times such as are found in many polymers. These data have been shown to often be inappropriate for spacecraft-charging applications and have been found to underestimate charging effects by one to four orders of magnitude for many materials. The charge storage decay method is shown to be the preferred method to determine the resistivities of such highly insulating materials. A review is presented of methods to measure the resistivity of highly insulating materials - including the electrometer in resistance method, the electrometer in constant-voltage method, and the charge storage method. The different methods are found to be appropriate for different resistivity ranges and for different charging circumstances. A simple macroscopic physics-based model of these methods allows separation of the polarization current and dark current components from long-duration measurements of resistivity over day- to month-long timescales. Model parameters are directly related to the magnitude of charge transfer and storage and the rate of charge transport. The model largely explains the observed differences in resistivity found using the different methods and provides a framework for recommendations for the appropriate test method for spacecraft materials with different resistivities and applications. © 2006 IEEE.","Materials testing; Resistivity; Space environment effects; Spacecraft-charging","Computer simulation; Electric conductivity; Electric conductivity measurement; Energy dissipation; Polarization; Spacecraft; Macroscopic physics-based model; Space environment effects; Spacecraft charging; Electric space charge",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750391928

Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption. © 2006 IEEE.","Energy-efficient design; Multiple-match; Packet classification; Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Energy-efficient design; Multiple-match; Packet classification; Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM); Algorithms; Associative storage; Packet networks; Problem solving; Security systems; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749871036

It is very challenging, however, to process a large amount of information in a limited time in order to make decisions about the health of the processes and products. This paper develops a ""preprocessing"" procedure for multiple sets of complicated functional data in order to reduce the data size for supporting timely decision analyses. The data type studied has been used for fault detection, root-cause analysis, and quality improvement in such engineering applications as automobile and semiconductor manufacturing and nanomachining processes. The proposed vertical-energy-thresholding (VET) procedure balances the reconstruction error against data-reduction efficiency so that it is effective in capturing key patterns in the multiple data signals. The selected wavelet coefficients are treated as the ""reduced-size"" data in subsequent analyses for decision making. This enhances the ability of the existing statistical and machine-learning procedures to handle high-dimensional functional data.

Skeletal muscle resistance to insulin is fundamental to the metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity and physical inactivity, and contributes to the development of the metabolic syndrome (MS). The inability to efficiently take up and store fuel, and to transition from fat to glucose as the primary source of fuel during times of caloric abundance (high insulin) or scarcity (low insulin) has been termed metabolic inflexibility which contributes to a whole body metabolic dysregulation and cardiovascular risk. Potential mechanisms contributing to reduced insulin signaling and action in skeletal muscle includes adipose tissue expansion and increased inflammatory adipokines, increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, decreases in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, increased intramuscular lipid accumulation, and increased reactive oxygen species. Future research is focused upon understanding these and other potential mechanisms in order to identify therapeutic targets for reducing MS risk.

The method is based on matching polar curves obtained from the radial projections of the image energies, defined as the squared magnitudes of their Fourier transforms. Such matching is formulated as a simple minimization problem whose optimal solution is found with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The analysis of affine transformations in the frequency domain exploits the well-known property whereby the translational displacement in this domain can be factored out and separately estimated through phase correlation after the four remaining degrees of freedom of the affine warping have been determined. Another important contribution of this paper, emphasized through one example of image mosaicking and one example of remote sensing image registration, consists in showing that affine motion can be accurately estimated by applying our algorithm to the shapes of macrofeatures extracted from the images to register. The excellent performance of the algorithm is also shown through a synthetic example of motion estimation and its comparison with another standard registration technique. © 2006 IEEE.","Affine transformations; Curve matching; Fourier transform; Image mosaicking; Image registration; Phase correlation; Radial projection; Remote sensing data","Algorithms; Correlation methods; Feature extraction; Fourier transforms; Remote sensing; Affine transformation; Image mosaicking; Image registration; Phase correlation; Polar curve matching; Radical projection; Remote sensing data; Image processing; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; computer assisted diagnosis; environmental monitoring; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; methodology; motion; signal processing; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Motion; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749160636

The effect of foot and ankle prosthetic components on braking and propulsive impulses during transtibial amputee gait. Objective: To assess the influence of energy storage and return (ESAR) prosthetic feet and multi-axis ankles on ground reaction forces and loading asymmetry between lower limbs in transtibial amputees. Design: Subjects wore 2 different prosthetic feet with and without a multi-axis ankle and were analyzed using a blind repeated-measures multivariate analysis-of-variance design. Setting: Gait analysis laboratory. Participants: Fifteen healthy unilateral transtibial amputees (>55y) who had an amputation at least 1 year before testing because of vascular disorders. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The anteroposterior ground reaction force impulse, peak ground reaction forces, and braking and propulsion impulse duration were analyzed as subjects walked at a self-selected speed while wearing each of the 4 foot-ankle prosthesis combinations. Statistical analyses were used to determine if there was a significant foot, ankle, or foot-ankle interaction effect on the outcome measures for each foot (P<.05). Results: Amputees generated a significantly greater propulsive impulse with the residual leg when wearing a multi-axis ankle with the ESAR and non-ESAR foot, which improved the propulsive symmetry between the residual and intact legs. There was no prosthetic foot effect on these measures. There were no significant differences in the peak residual-leg braking or propulsive ground reaction forces or the impulse durations due to the prosthetic foot, ankle, or foot-ankle interactions, although an increase in the propulsive impulse duration approached significance (P=.062) with a multi-axis ankle. Conclusions: These results suggest that amputee gait may improve with the prescription of multi-axis ankles that allow for greater propulsive impulses by the residual leg, which improve the loading symmetry between legs. © 2006 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.","Amputees; Rehabilitation; Walking","adult; ankle; article; below knee amputation; clinical article; energy; female; foot; gait; ground reaction force; human; leg prosthesis; male; multivariate analysis of variance; outcome assessment; statistical analysis; vascular disease; velocity; walking; Amputation; Amputees; Ankle Joint; Artificial Limbs; Biomechanics; Female; Foot; Gait; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prosthesis Design; Tibia; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749144474

Each forage species was harvested at two or three maturity stages and analyzed for carbohydrates, lignin, protein, lipid, organic acids, and mineral composition. The biomass samples were also evaluated for sugar yields following pretreatment with dilute sulfuric followed by enzymatic saccharification using a commercial cellulase preparation. Total carbohydrate content of the plants varied from 518 to 655 g kg-1 dry matter (DM) and cellulose concentration from 209 to 322 g kg-1 DM. Carbohydrate and lignin contents were lower for samples from early maturity samples compared to samples from late maturity harvests. Several important trends were observed in regards to the efficiency of sugar recovery following treatments with dilute acid and cellulase. First, a significant amount of the available carbohydrates were in the form of soluble sugars and storage carbohydrates (4.3-16.3% wt/wt). Recovery of soluble sugars following dilute acid pretreatment was problematic, especially that of fructose. Fructose was found to be extremely labile to the dilute acid pretreatments. Second, the efficiency at which available glucose was recovered was inversely correlated to maturity and lignin content. However, total glucose yields were higher for the later maturities because of higher cellulose contents compared to the earlier maturity samples. Finally, cell wall polysaccharides, as determined by the widely applied detergent fiber system were found to be inaccurate. The detergent fiber method consistently over-estimated cellulose and hemicellulose and underestimated lignin by substantial amounts.","Bioenergy; Bioethanol; Biomass; Medicago sativa L.; Panicum virgatum L.; Phalaris arundinacea L.","Biomass; Composition; Enzyme kinetics; Enzymes; Saccharification; Bioenergy; Bioethanol; Medicago sativa L.; Panicum virgatum L.; Phalaris arundinacea L.; Plants (botany); Biomass; Composition; Enzyme kinetics; Enzymes; Plants (botany); Saccharification; biomass power; carbohydrate; chemical composition; comparative study; energy crop; enzyme activity; experimental study; lignin; perennial plant; Medicago sativa; Panicum virgatum; Phalaris; Phalaris arundinacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748922048

Gemini Drive, Flagstaff, AZ 86004, United States","The temporal signature of thermal emission from a volcano is a valuable clue to the processes taking place both at and beneath the surface. The Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) observed the volcano Prometheus, on the jovian moon Io, on multiple occasions between 1996 and 2002. The 5 micron (μm) brightness of this volcano shows considerable variation from orbit to orbit. Prometheus exhibits increases in thermal emission that indicate episodic (though non-periodic) effusive activity in a manner akin to the current Pu'u 'O'o-Kupaianaha (afterwards referred to as the Pu'u 'O'o) eruption of Kilauea, Hawai'i. The volume of material erupted during one Prometheus eruption episode (defined as the interval from minimum thermal emission to peak and back to minimum) from 6 November 1996 to 7 May 1997 is estimated to be ∼0.8 km3, with a peak instantaneous volumetric flux (effusion rate) of ∼140 m3 s-1, and an averaged volumetric flux (eruption rate) of ∼49 m3 s-1. These quantities are used to model subsurface structure, magma storage and magma supply mechanisms, and likely magma chamber depth. Prometheus appears to be supplied by magma from a relatively shallow magma chamber, with a roof at a minimum depth of ∼2-3 km and a maximum depth of ∼14 km. This is a much shallower depth range than sources of supply proposed for explosive, possibly ultramafic, eruptions at Pillan and Tvashtar. As Prometheus-type effusive activity is widespread on Io, shallow magma chambers containing magma of basaltic or near-basaltic composition and density may be common. This analysis strengthens the analogy between Prometheus and Pu'u 'O'o, at least in terms of eruption style. Even though the style of eruption appears to be similar (effusive emplacement of thin, insulated, compound pahoehoe flows) the scale of activity at Prometheus greatly exceeds current activity at Pu'u 'O'o in terms of volume erupted, area covered, and magma flux. Whereas the estimated magma chamber at Prometheus dwarfs the Pu'u 'O'o magma chamber, it fits within expectations if the Pu'u 'O'o chamber were scaled for the greater volumetric flux and lower gravity of Io. Recent volumetric eruption rates derived from Galileo data for Prometheus were considerably smaller than the rate that produced the extensive flows formed in the ∼17 years between the Voyager and Galileo missions. These smaller eruption rates, coupled with the fact that flows are not expanding laterally, may mean that the immediate heat source that generates the Prometheus plume is simultaneously running out of available volatiles and the thermal energy that drives mobilization of volatiles. This raises the question of whether the current Prometheus eruption is in its last throes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.","Data reduction techniques; Earth; Geological processes; Io; Jupiter; satellites; Volcanism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748713044

However, increasing performance and energy demands faced by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are forcing designers to alter the fundamental architectural template of the HLS output, namely, a controller datapath associated with a memory subsystem (monolithic, partitioned, etc.). An architectural template for the HLS output that consists of a controller-datapath circuit associated with a memory subsystem into which computation units have been integrated is proposed. The enhanced memory subsystem is called computation-unit integrated memory (CIM). A CIM offers higher memory bandwidth (relative to what is offered through the system bus) to computation units present locally within it and reduces the overall communication between the memory subsystem and the controller datapath, thus providing a template highly suitable for deriving efficient implementations of memory-intensive applications. This paper addresses the challenge of providing a systematic synthesis framework for a CIM-based architecture. This framework can analyze the various tradeoffs involved in selecting suitable operations in a behavior for execution using a CIM and generate a high-performance low-overhead implementation. Efficient data reuse of register files have also been fully exploited to further improve system performance. Experiments with several behaviors indicate that an average performance improvement of 2.02 × (a maximum of 2.70×) is possible with very low area overheads. The energy-delay product improves by an average of 2.5 × (maximum of 3.8×). © 2006 IEEE.","Application-specific integrated circuits; Controller/datapath; High-level synthesis; Integrated memory","Application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC); Controller/datapath; High-level synthesis (HLS); Integrated memory; Computational methods; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Data storage equipment; High level languages; Integrated circuits; Integrated circuit layout",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748300807

From a structural point of view, these polymers can be divided into four main categories including (1) polymers with fullerenes physically incorporated into the foreign polymeric network without forming covalent bonds, (2) fullerene homopolymers formed via [2+2] cycloaddition, (3) ""pearl necklace"" polymers with fullerenes mutually linked covalently to form polymer chains, and (4) ""charm bracelet"" polymers containing pendant fullerene substituents. The methods of electrochemical polymerization of these systems are described and assessed. The structural features and properties of the electrochemically prepared polymers and their chemically synthesized analogs are compared. Polymer films containing fullerenes are electroactive in the negative potential range due to electroreduction of the fullerene moieties. Related films made with fullerenes derivatized with electron-donating moieties as building blocks are electroactive in both the negative and positive potential range. These can be regarded as ""double cables"" as they exhibit both p- and n-doping properties. Fullerene-based polymers may find numerous applications. For instance, they can be used as charge-storage and energy-converting materials for batteries and photoactive units of photovoltaic cell devices, respectively. They can be also used as substrates for electrochemical sensors and biosensors. Films of the C60/Pt and C60/Pd polymers containing metallic nano-particles of platinum and palladium, respectively, effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of olefins and acetylenes. Laser ablation of electrochemically formed C60/M and C70/M polymer films (M=Pt or Ir) results in fragmentation of the fullerenes leading to the formation of hetero-fullerenes, such as [C59M]+ and [C 69M]+.","""Charm bracelet"" fullerene polymers; ""Double-cable"" fullerene polymers; ""Pearl necklace"" fullerene polymers; Fullerene electropolymerization; Fullerene homopolymers; Fullerene polymer films; Fullerenes","Addition reactions; Chemical bonds; Electrochemical sensors; Electrochemistry; Electropolymerization; Fullerenes; Nanostructured materials; Photovoltaic cells; ""Charm bracelet"" fullerene polymers; ""Double-cable"" fullerene polymers; ""Pearl necklace"" fullerene polymers; Fullerene electropolymerization; Fullerene homopolymers; Fullerene polymer films; Plastic films",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746734951

We then documented the mobility of the robot for 10 cases of deep snow and four cases of shallow snow. The scaled predictions agreed well with average sinkage, resistance and traction measured in deep snow and thus gave useful design guidance. Nevertheless, large differences occurred between measured and predicted snow-compaction resistance on individual test days. The behavior of actual snow packs is difficult to capture using simple Bekker theory. Most deep-snow packs showed a linear relationship between pressure and sinkage for small indentation, followed by a steep rise in pressure as indentation compacted the snow against the ground.

Floodplains are an important component of watershed systems because they affect downstream storage and delivery of overbank flood waters, and they also serve as sources and temporary sinks for sediments and toxic substances delivered by river systems. Here, 14C and 137Cs isotopic dating methods are used along with ages of culturally related phenomena associated with mining and agriculture to determine rates of sedimentation and morphologic change for a reach of the upper Mississippi River and adjacent tributaries in southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois. The most important environmental change that influenced fluvial activity in this region during last 10,000 years involved the conversion of a late Holocene mosaic of prairie and forest to a landscape dominated by cropland and pastureland associated with Euro-American settlement. Results presented herein for the Upper Mississippi Valley (UMV) show that the shift from pre-agriculture, natural land cover to landscape dominance by agricultural land use of the last 175-200 years typically increased rates and magnitudes of floodplain sedimentation by at least an order of magnitude. Accelerated overbank flooding led to increased bank heights on tributary streams and, in turn, contributed to more frequent deep flows of high energy. These high energy flows subsequently promoted bank erosion and lateral channel migration, and the formation of a historical meander belt whose alluvial surface constitutes a new historical floodplain inset against the earlier historical floodplain. The new historical floodplain serves as a ""flume-like"" channel that provides efficient downstream transport of water and sediment associated with moderate and large magnitude floods. Floodplains on lower tributaries, however, continue to experience rates of overbank sedimentation that are of anomalously high magnitude given improved land cover and land conservation since about 1950. This lower valley anomaly is explained by minimal development of historical (agriculture period) meander belts because of relatively low stream power in these channel and floodplain reaches of relatively low gradient. In general, long-term pre-agriculture rates of vertical accretion between about 10,000 and 200 years ago averaged about 0.2 mm yr- 1 in tributary watersheds smaller than about 700 km2 and about 0.9 mm yr- 1 on the floodplain of the upper Mississippi River where the contributing watershed area increases to about 170,000 km2. On the other hand, rates of historical vertical accretion during the period of agricultural dominance of the last 200 years average between 2 and 20 mm yr- 1, with short episodes of even higher rates during times of particularly poor land conservation practices. Significant hydrologic effects of mining and agricultural started by the 1820s and became widespread in the study region by the mid-19th century. The hydrologic and geomorphic influences of mining were relatively minor compared to those related to agriculture. High resolution dating of floodplain vertical accretion deposits shows that large floods have frequently provided major increments of sedimentation on floodplains of tributaries and the main valley upper Mississippi River. The relative importance of large floods as contributors to floodplain vertical accretion is noteworthy because global atmospheric circulation models indicate that the main channel upper Mississippi River should experience increased frequencies of extreme hydrologic events, including large floods, with anticipated continued global warming. Instrumental and stratigraphic records show that, coincident with global warming, a shift to more frequent large floods occurred since 1950 on the upper Mississippi River, and these floods generally contributed high magnitudes of floodplain sedimentation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Such turbidity, however, as representative of particle transport, can be used as to trace certain features of particle transport properties. In order to investigate the relation between particle and dissolved species transport and hydrodynamics in karst systems, correlation and spectral analyses were performed on time series of rainfall (input signal), and water level, specific conductance, and turbidity (output signals) at a karst spring system in the chalk aquifer of the lower Seine valley, France. This system is composed of a spring connected to a sinkhole on the chalk plateau where a small creek enters the subsurface. The autocorrelation functions for water level and turbidity showed a short memory effect, demonstrating the short duration of the influence of flood events on these two parameters, whereas specific conductance (representing less-mineralized storm-derived water) had a much longer memory effect. These results were interpreted as reflecting the rapid reactivity of the spring to rain events, with storage of water in the fissured chalk explaining the longer memory effect for specific conductance than for particles. Energy spectra computed by fast Fourier transform of autocorrelation functions showed a strong structure in the output signals, whereas the input signal (rainfall) was random, thus allowing assessment and comparison of system behaviour regarding dissolved and solid transport, as well as hydraulics. Cross-correlation functions (which allow an assessment of impulse response functions) confirmed the low inertia of the system for water level and turbidity and the much higher inertia for specific conductance. In addition to the main peak, two secondary peaks in the cross-correlation functions suggest the existence of additional flowpaths that might involve the contribution of other point-source recharge and/or delayed infiltration through the clayey surficial formation and solution pipes, which could act as epikarst. Analysis using continuous wavelet spectra allowed a better investigation of the rainfall signal structure and highlighted a strong relationship between turbidity and rainfall, which could not be deduced from the energy spectra. Specific spectral components in water level were isolated and a time-domain reconstruction using inverse wavelet transform allowed separation of quick-flow and slow-flow components. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ChREBP and Mlx dimerize and function together as a glucose-responsive transcription factor to regulate target genes, such as liver-type pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and fatty acid synthase. To identify additional glucose-responsive genes in the liver, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression patterns in low and high glucose conditions in hepatocytes. Target genes of ChREBP·Mlx were simultaneously identified by gene profiling in the presence or absence of a dominant negative Mlx. Of 224 genes that are induced by glucose, 139 genes (62%) were also inhibited by the dominant negative Mlx. Lipogenic enzyme genes involved in the entire pathway of de novo lipogenesis were found to be glucose-responsive target genes of ChREBP·Mlx. Genes encoding enzymes in other metabolic pathways and numerous regulators of metabolism were also identified. To determine if any of these genes are direct targets of ChREBP·Mlx, we searched for ChoRE-like sequences in the 5′-flanking regions of several genes that responded rapidly to glucose. ChoRE sequences that bound to ChREBP·Mlx and supported a glucose response were identified in two additional genes. Combining all of the known ChoRE sequences, we generated a modified ChoRE consensus sequence, CAYGNGN5CNCRTG. In summary, ChREBP·Mlx is the principal transcription factor regulating glucose-responsive genes in the liver and coordinately regulates a family of genes required for glucose utilization and energy storage. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Biodiversity; Biological organs; Dimerization; Enzyme inhibition; Glucose; Metabolism; Proteins; Gene expression; Genes encoding; Lipogenesis; Genes; DNA binding protein; glucose; messenger RNA; protein chrebp; transcription factor; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix leucine zipper transcription factor; glucose; MLX protein, rat; transactivator protein; Wbscr14 protein, rat; animal experiment; article; controlled study; DNA flanking region; gene expression; gene repression; gene sequence; gene targeting; genetic code; glucose homeostasis; lipogenesis; liver cell; microarray analysis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein analysis; protein modification; animal; biological model; DNA microarray; dominant gene; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; liver; male; metabolism; mouse; physiology; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; Mammalia; Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Dominant; Glucose; Humans; Liver; Male; Mice; Models, Biological; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Trans-Activators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749407193

It takes the view that the timing behavior of a real-time system depends not only on delays due to process synchronization, but also on the availability of shared resources. Thus, ACSR employs resources as a basic primitive and it represents a real-time system as a collection of concurrent processes which may communicate with each other by means of instantaneous events and compete for the usage of shared resources. Resources are used to model physical devices such as processors, memory modules, communication links, or any other reusable resource of limited capacity. Additionally, they provide a convenient abstraction mechanism for capturing a variety of aspects of system behavior. The resulting framework combines the areas of process algebra and real-time scheduling, and can facilitate the reasoning about systems that are sensitive to deadlines, process interaction and resource availability. In this paper we give an overview of ACSR and three of its extensions PACSR, P2ACSR and MCSR, which take into account probabilistic failures, power consumption and multi-capacity resources. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Target values that must be achieved for the critical parameters in such a system have been drawn up by the US Department of Energy. It is quite clear that these targets cannot be met by systems that store hydrogen at high pressure or as a liquid at cryogenic temperatures. Attention has thus been focused on methods of storing hydrogen in, or on, a solid phase. In such schemes it is obviously desirable to make use of elements from the early part of the periodic table and there has been much interest in the possible use of carbon as a hydrogen host.

Variations in the total solar irradiance with an amplitude of 0.1% have been observed from space for more than two decades. Although the variability of this solar output has been definitely established, the detailed dependence of the rate of energy output on the level of solar magnetic activity has not yet been measured with enough continuity and precision to determine the correlation throughout the full solar cycle. While a large fraction of the irradiance variability can be explained by the distribution of solar magnetic activity at the surface, small changes in the solar radius (i.e., contributing to the global variability of the solar envelope) could account for a significant fraction of the remaining variations. Studies of the apparent solar radius variation have reported contradictory results, in the form of both correlations and anticorrelations between the solar radius and, for example, the cycle of sunspot numbers. We present results from more than 30 yr of solar radius measurements obtained from the Mount Wilson synoptic program of solar magnetic observations carried out at the 150 foot (45.72 m) tower. We have used an improved definition of the solar radius that also allows us to study the heliolatitude dependence of the radius measurements. We find that the variations of the average radius are not significantly correlated with the solar cycle over the last three decades. We also compare the heliolatitude dependence of these radius measurements with recent results obtained at the Pic du Midi Observatory in France. © 2006. The American Astronomical Society.

Consumption of energy-rich diets can lead to obesity and is associated with deleterious consequences not only in humans but also in many other animals, including insects. The question thus arises whether animals restricted over multiple generations to high-energy diets can evolve mechanisms to limit the deposition of adverse levels of body fat. We show that Plutella xylostella caterpillars reared for multiple generations on carbohydrate-rich foods (either a chemically defined artificial diet or a high-starch Arabidopsis mutant) progressively developed the ability to eat excess carbohydrate without laying it down as fat, providing strong evidence that excess fat storage has a fitness cost. In contrast, caterpillars reared in carbohydrate-scarce environments (a chemically defined artificial diet or a low-starch Arabidopsis mutant) had a greater propensity to store ingested carbohydrate as fat. Additionally, insects reared on the low-starch Arabidopsis mutant evolved a preference for laying their eggs on this plant, whereas those selected on the high-starch Arabidopsis mutant showed no preference. Our results provide an experimental example of metabolic adaptation in the face of changes in the nutritional environment and suggest that changes in plant macronutrient profiles may promote host-associated population divergence. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Geometric framework; Nutrition; Plutella","adaptation; Arabidopsis; article; artificial diet; carbohydrate intake; controlled study; egg laying; insect; insect resistance; lipid storage; mutant; nonhuman; obesity; Plutella xylostella; priority journal; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Arabidopsis; Behavior, Animal; Biological Evolution; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Evolution; Humans; Larva; Lipids; Moths; Obesity; Animalia; Arabidopsis; Hexapoda; Insecta; Plutella; Plutella xylostella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748990575

To better understand the influence of core materials and construction on a board's stiffness, ultimate failure load, and stored energy, several commercially available snowboards were tested to failure in three point bending. A series of representative boards were tested with three different core materials: foam, wood, and honeycomb.

Aggressive supply-voltage scaling has emerged as the most effective way to reduce energy use. In this work, we review circuit behavior at low voltages, specifically in the subthreshold (Vdd &lt; Vth) regime, and suggest new strategies for energy-efficient design. We begin with a study at the device level, and we show that extreme sensitivity to the supply and threshold voltages complicates subthreshold design. The effects of this sensitivity can be minimized through simple device modifications and new device geometries. At the circuit level, we review the energy characteristics of subthreshold logic and SRAM circuits, and demonstrate that energy efficiency relies on the balance between dynamic and leakage energies, with process variability playing a key role in both energy efficiency and robustness. We Continue the study of energy-efficient design by broadening our scope to the architectural level. We discuss the energy benefits of techniques such as multiple-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB), and we also consider the performance benefits of multiprocessor design at ultralow supply voltages. © Copyright 2006 by International Business Machines Corporation.",,"Digital circuits; Energy efficiency; Microprocessor chips; Sensitivity analysis; Static random access storage; Threshold voltage; Adaptive body biasing (ABB); Multiple-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS); Supply-voltage scaling; CMOS integrated circuits",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748554808

However, X-ray tube emits a spectrum of energies and hence it becomes difficult to study some important aspects, such as the reconstructed density accuracy of special reconstruction algorithm and beam hardening effects of polychromatic imaging. If the energy spectrum of X-ray tube, geometry of phantom, and material compositions of all sub-regions are known, the actual projections can be simulated with more accuracy. Motivated by this fact, we propose an improved three-step discrete scheme to simulate the X-ray projections based on physical model. First, CT-numbers of all sub-regions of a phantom are determined in advance. Next, CT-numbers are decomposed into different material compositions under the constraint that sub-regions correspond to different human tissues. Finally, the projections are measured according to the energy spectrum distribution of X-ray tube, using the knowledge of X-ray imaging physics and our strategy to simulate the projecting process. Our scheme requires significantly less storage and computation to achieve a higher accuracy and precision. To demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme, we use the well-known FORBILD head phantom to generate projections and the Feldkamp algorithm for image reconstruction. The anticipated beam hardening effects are clearly seen in images reconstructed from projections simulated using our scheme. This scheme can be utilized in many medical X-ray imaging research aspects, such as algorithm design, performance analysis, distortion calibrations, artifact reduction, etc. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

Substituting deuterium for protium offers advantages in experimental studies of the helium-hydrogen-damage synergisms. The influence of preimplanted helium and self-ion induced damage on deuterium trapping in 18Cr10NiTi stainless steel was studied using thermal desorption spectrometry, the nuclear reactions 3He(D, p)4He and D(3He, p)4He, and transmission electron microcopy. Reemission, retention and evolution of depth distribution profiles of deuterium in 18Cr10NiTi SS were studied for 10 keV D2+ and 10 keV He+ implantation at room temperature followed by annealing at 300-1500 K. The amounts of trapped and released deuterium and helium atoms were measured as a function of implantation dose at various temperatures. It was found that retention of hydrogen and deuterium is strongly enhanced by the presence of large amounts of helium and also strongly enhanced by damage introduced by 2 MeV Cr3+ ions. These results are consistent with recent observations of hydrogen storage in stainless steels after irradiation in LANSCE with high energy protons and neutrons and also after irradiation in light water reactors.","H0200; H0400; I0400; S0500","Corrosion; Deuterium compounds; Hardening; Ions; Irradiation; Stainless steel; H0200; H0400; I0400; S0500; Helium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748256687

Batteries are a key enabling technology for the development of clean, fuel-efficient vehicles and are key to making today's hybrid electric vehicles a success. Fuel cells are the key enabling technology for a future hydrogen economy and have the potential to revolutionize the way we power our nations, offering cleaner, more efficient alternatives to today's technology. Additionally fuel cells are significantly more energy efficient than combustion-based power generation technologies. Fuel cells are projected to have energy efficiency twice that of internal combustion engines. However before fuel cells can realize their potential, significant challenges remain. The two most important are cost and durability for both automotive and stationary applications. Recent electrocatalyst developments have shown that Pt alloy catalysts have increased activity and greater durability than Pt catalysts. The durability of conventional fluorocarbon membranes is improving, and hydrocarbon-based membranes have also shown promise of equaling the performance of fluorocarbon membranes at lower cost. Recent announcements have also provided indications that fuel cells can start from freezing conditions without significant deterioration. Hydrogen storage systems for vehicles are inadequate to meet customer driving range expectations (>300 miles or 500 km) without intrusion into vehicle cargo or passenger space. The United States Department of Energy has established three centers of Excellence for hydrogen storage materials development. The centers are focused on complex metal hydrides that can be regenerated onboard a vehicle, chemical hydrides that require off-board reprocessing, and carbon-based storage materials. Recent developments have shown progress toward the 2010 DOE targets. In addition DOE has established an independent storage material testing center to verify storage capacity of promising materials. These developments point to a viable path to achieving the DOE/FreedomCAR cost and performance goals. The transition to hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles will occur over the next 10-15 years. In the interim, fossil fuel consumption will be reduced by increased penetration of battery/gasoline hybrid cars. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports the development of a new type of solid-state hydrogen gas sensor that couples novel metal hydride thin films with a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) structure known as a micro-hotplate. Micro-hotplate structures are fabricated via surface silicon micro-machining, resulting in a suspended platform with an embedded heater and thermally isolated from the substrate. A rare earth metal thin film, overcoated with a palladium capping layer, is deposited on this structure and serves as the active hydrogen-sensing layer. The change in electrical resistance of this bilayer when exposed to hydrogen gas is the sensor output. Sub-second response times to 0.25% hydrogen in air and sensitivity to hydrogen concentrations below 200 ppm are measured. Rise and decay times of the response depend on the effective temperature of the micro-hotplate and decrease with increasing heater power. These results suggest that this device has the potential to meet the sensing requirements of advanced hydrogen applications. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A key indicator of their structural stability is the shear modulus. By density functional theory calculations in a 106-atom supercell, under the local density approximation, we find c 11=29.2 GPa and c 12=13.1 GPa for Zn-based MOF 5. However, we find c 44 of MOF-5 to be exceedingly small, only 1.4 GPa at T=0 K. The binding energy E ads of a single hydrogen molecule in MOF-5 is evaluated using the same setup. We find it to be -0.069 to -0.086 eV/H 2 near the benzene linker and -0.106 to -0.160 eV/H 2 near the Zn 4O tetrahedra. Substitutions of chlorine and hydroxyl in the benzene linker have negligible effect on the physisorption energies. Pentacoordinated copper (and aluminum) in a framework structure similar to MOF-2 gives E ads ≈ -0.291 eV/H 2 (and -0.230 eV/H 2), and substitution of nitrogen in benzene (pyrazine) further enhances E ads near the organic linker to -0.16 eV/H 2, according to density functional theory with local density approximation. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Elastic constants; Local density approximation; Metal-organic frameworks (MOF); Structural stability; Benzene; Catalysis; Copper; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Gas fuel storage; Hydrogen; Probability density function; Separation; Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748251654

Reversible hydrogen storage in this material is dependent on the presence of 2-4% Ti dopant. Our combined study shows that the role of Ti may be linked entirely to Ti-containing active catalytic sites in the metallic A1 phase present in the dehydrogenated NaAlH4. The EXAFS data presented here show that dehydrogenated samples contain a highly disordered distribution of Ti-Al distances with no long-range order beyond the second coordination sphere. We have used density functional theory techniques to calculate the chemical potential of possible Ti arrangements on an Al(001) surface for Ti coverages ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 monolayer (ML) and have identified those that can chemisorb molecular hydrogen via spontaneous or only moderately activated pathways. The chemisorption process exhibits a characteristic nodal symmetry property for the low-barrier sites: the incipient doped surface-H2 adduct's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) incorporates the σ* antibonding molecular orbital of hydrogen, allowing the transfer of charge density from the surface to dissociate the molecular hydrogen. This work also proposes a plausible mechanism for the transport of an aluminum hydride species back into the NaH lattice that is supported by Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulations of the stability and mobility of aluminum clusters (alanes) on Al(001). As an experimental validation of the proposed role of titanium and the subsequent diffusion of alanes, we demonstrate experimentally that AlH3 sources reacts with NaH to form NaAlH4 without any requirement of a catalyst or hydrogen overpressure. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysis; Chemisorption; Dehydrogenation; Gas fuel storage; Molecular dynamics; Probability density function; Sodium compounds; Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD); Coordination sphere; Reversible hydrogen storage; Ti-Al distances; Titanium compounds; hydrogen; sodium alanate; sodium derivative; titanium; unclassified drug; absorption spectroscopy; article; density functional theory; diffusion; electron; energy; Fourier transformation; molecular dynamics; solid state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748361992

A brief account of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, as appropriate for the description of such a turbulent flow is given. Following the classical statistical approach to the turbulent flow, the equation for the turbulent kinetic energy budget in the physical space and its version in the wave number space are derived in a straightforward manner. The closure of the spectral equation is achieved through the modeling of the terms describing production of the turbulent kinetic energy from the mean velocity shear, energy transfer through hierarchy of the eddies and the contribution of the buoyancy forces towards turbulent kinetic energy. A complete solution for the three-dimensional energy spectrum and the two one-dimensional energy spectra corresponding to the turbulent velocity components in the horizontal and vertical directions are obtained. All these spectra are evaluated, with the data from well known simulated experiment on the stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer in a meteorological wind tunnel. The behaviour of these spectra over a wide range of wave numbers, which includes both inertial and dissipation ranges, is discussed.","Heat flux or buoyancy spectrum; Monin-Obukhov similarity theory; Thermally stratified flow; Turbulent kinetic energy spectrum; Viscous energy dissipation","Aerodynamics; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Atmospherics; Budget control; Computational fluid dynamics; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Geophysics; Kinetic energy; Numerical methods; One dimensional; Shear flow; Shearing machines; Spectrum analysis; Three dimensional; Troposphere; Turbulence; Turbulent flow; Waves; Well stimulation; Wind power; Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL); Atmospheric surface layer (ASL); buoyancy forcing; Complete solutions; En ergy spectrum; Kinetic energy spectra; Mean velocities; Monin Obukhov similarity theory (MOST); One-dimensional; Physical space; Simulated experiments; SPECTRA (CO); Spectral equation; Statistical approaches; Three dimensional energy; Turbulence energy; Turbulent kinetic energy (tke); Turbulent shear flows; Turbulent velocity; Vertical directions; wave number space; Wave numbers; Wide-range; Atmospheric spectra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45449115964

The intracellular iron storage protein ferritin is central to the regulation of iron. In this study, we determined the neurochemical profile of brains of animals deficient in heavychain ferritin (H-ferritin) using high-resolution magic angle spin proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR-MAS 1H MRS). Spectra of 2 mm-thick coronal tissue punches (∼4 mg) were obtained using a CPMGpulse sequence on BrukerAvance 500 and quantified (nmol/mg tissue) using customized LCModel software (16 metabolites). In H-ferritin deficient mice, we found significant increases in striatal glutamate, hippocampal choline, and N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate in both the cortex and the hippocampus (t-test, p &lt; 0.05). Neurochemical profiling with principal component analysis (PCA) revealed increased glutamate in the hippocampus, striatum, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in H-ferritin deficient animals as compared to wild-type. While lactate was increased in the VTA of deficient animals, it was decreased in the striatum. Also, GABA was increased in both cortical and striatal regions of deficient mice. These changes reveal the importance of proper iron management for maintaining neurochemical balance and provide new evidence for region specific differences in neurochemical profiles as a result of compromised ability of neurons to store iron while overall iron status is normal. Because H-ferritin is predominantly expressed in neurons, the neurochemical profile is suggestive of neuronal iron deficiency and may have relevance to the functional consequences associated with brain iron deficiency. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Cortex; Ferritin; Hippocampus; Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Striatum; VTA","4 aminobutyric acid; choline; dipeptide; ferritin; glutamic acid; N acetyl 1 aspartylglutamic acid; N-acetyl-1-aspartylglutamic acid; animal; article; brain cortex; brain level; genetics; hippocampus; iron metabolism disorder; metabolism; mouse; neostriatum; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; physiology; principal component analysis; Animals; Brain Chemistry; Cerebral Cortex; Choline; Dipeptides; Ferritins; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Glutamic Acid; Hippocampus; Iron Metabolism Disorders; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Mice; Neostriatum; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247164754

Particular emphasis has been put on those dosemeters that change their optical properties in proportion to the absorbed dose. Many of the dosemeters that have been evaluated have had limitations such as lack of transparency, diffusion of the image of the dose distribution or poor stability of baseline optical density. Many of these performance limitations have been overcome by the development of PRESAGE™, an optically clear polyurethane-based radiochromic 3-D dosemeter. The solid PRESAGE™ dosemeter is formulated with a free radical initiator and a leuco dye and it does not require a container to maintain its shape. The polyurethane matrix is tissue equivalent and prevents the diffusion of the dose distribution image. There is a linear dose-response, which is independent of both photon energy and dose rate.

Storage of CO2 into depleted oil reservoirs may prove to be both cost effective and environmentally safe. However, injection of CO2 into oil reservoirs is a complex issue, spanning a wide range of scientific, technological, economic, safety, and regulatory issues. Detailed studies about the long-term impact of CO2 on the host reservoir are necessary before this technology can be deployed. This article provides an overview of a U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored project that examines CO2 sequestration in a depleted oil reservoir. The main objectives of the project are (1) to characterize the oil reservoir and its sequestration capacity; (2) to better understand CO2 sequestration-related processes; and (3) to predict and monitor the migration and ultimate fate of CO2 after injection into a depleted sandstone oil reservoir. The project is focused around a field test that involved the injection of approximately 2090 tons (2.09 million kg) of CO2 into a depleted sandstone reservoir at the West Pearl Queen field in southeastern New Mexico. Geophysical monitoring surveys, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations were performed in support of the field experiment. Results show that the response of the West Pearl Queen reservoir during the field experiment was significantly different than predicted response based on the preinjection characterization data. Furthermore, results from a 19-month bench-scale experiments of CO2 interaction with the Queen sand were not able to be fully reproduced using the latest numerical modeling algorithms, suggesting that the current models are not capturing important geochemical interactions.

To examine this, plus inter-clonal responses, one male colony of S. glaucum, known to produce sarcophytoxide as its predominant complementary (secondary) metabolite, was sectioned, producing 10 clones. The same was done for a female colony. These two sets of clones were then relocated to grids and placed in contact with Acropora clones. Relocated and non-relocated controls were also monitored. High levels of tissue necrosis were observed in the hard coral under contact conditions with both the male and female clones after 20 days. The development of a protective polysaccharide layer in the alcyonacean was also observed. Differences observed in the concentrations of complementary metabolites within the two different S. glaucum colonies were related to sex. Both under competition and non-competition conditions, females exhibited significantly higher concentrations of sarcophytoxide than males, and this increased with time. Fatty ester concentration was also higher in females than males, varying significantly through time, and falling dramatically just after spawning. Fatty ester concentrations decreased linearly through time in the male clones. When involved in competition for space, females possessed higher concentrations of fatty esters than males, both at the site of contact and in non-contact sites, again, decreasing after spawning. No significant changes in sarcophytoxide levels were noted in the parental colonies, but such changes were observed in fatty esters, with the female producing higher concentrations until after spawning. The use of these two variates in the form of a ratio (sarcophytoxide concentration:fatty ester concentration) yielded a variable Rho (ρ) which was a more sensitive indicator of biochemical change than either of its components alone. These two sets of compounds appeared to have a negative association through time and varied highly significantly between sexes. The diterpene sarcophytoxide may be considered an allelopathic or stress metabolite, while the lipids act as energy storage metabolites. © 2006 The Authors.

The salt media must contain pyruvate and lactate. In an effort to test the hypothesis that pyruvate may be acting as an antioxidant, a series of experiments were conducted using a H2O2 challenge to artificially produce damage due to lipid peroxidation. Results of these experiments indicated that addition of lactate or pyruvate and lactate to SKMG-Tyrode's media was not able to prevent the detrimental affects of H2O2. The addition of lactate to the SKMG-Tyrode's media resulted in an improvement of post-storage motility; however, increasing the concentration of pyruvate did not further improve motility. Therefore, because lactate dehydrogenase has been shown to be correlated with motility, and lactate has been shown to be preferred as an energy source by spermatozoa from other species, the beneficial effects of lactate and pyruvate as components of a modified SKMG extender are probable as energy sources. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In XFCT, a sample is irradiated with pencil beams of monochromatic synchrotron radiation that stimulate the emission of fluorescence X-rays from atoms of elements whose K - or L-edges lie below the energy of the stimulating beam. Scanning and rotating the object through the beam allows for acquisition of a tomographic dataset that can be used to reconstruct images of the distribution of the elements in question. XFCT is a stimulated emission tomography modality, and it is thus necessary to correct for attenuation of the incident and fluorescence photons. The attenuation map is, however, generally known only at the stimulating beam energy and not at the energies of the various fluorescence X-rays of interest. We have developed a penalized-likelihood image reconstruction strategy for this problem. The approach alternates between updating the distribution of a given element and updating the attenuation map for that element's fluorescence X-rays. The approach is guaranteed to increase the penalized likelihood at each iteration. Because the joint objective function is not necessarily concave, the approach may drive the solution to a local maximum. To encourage the algorithm to seek out a reasonable local maximum, we include in the objective function a prior that encourages a relationship, based on physical considerations, between the fluorescence attenuation map and the distribution of the element being reconstructed. © 2006 IEEE.","Image reconstruction; Penalized likelihood; X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT)","Fluorescence X-rays; Monochromatic synchrotron radiations; Penalized likelihood; X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT); Algorithms; Computerized tomography; Fluorescence; Scanning; Stimulated emission; Synchrotron radiation; Image reconstruction; algorithm; article; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; evaluation; image quality; information retrieval; instrumentation; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; spectrometry; statistical model; Algorithms; Information Storage and Retrieval; Likelihood Functions; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748103172

A new performance model as well as an early cache design tool and predictor of access and cycle time for cache stack (PRACTICS) has been developed for on-chip static random access memory (SRAM) cache design that includes both delay and dynamic-power models. Efficient models for distributed interconnect delays, verified by Cadence simulations, are introduced, and their necessity is demonstrated. In the delay model, the access time is estimated by decomposing each component into several equivalent lumped resistance-capacitance (RC) circuits and using an appropriate order π model to approximate the distributed wire delays of each stage. The dynamic-power model calculates the charging power dissipation of the load capacitances using the same equivalent lumped RC circuits. The delay model has been validated with an Intel 18-Mb SRAM at the 180-nm node, achieving accuracy to within 10% of the measured results. The dynamic-power model has been validated with an International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) 18-Mb SRAM at the 180-nm node, to within 13% of the measured power consumption. Detailed comparisons between PRACTICS and cache access and cycle time model (CACTI) in both validation cases indicate that an improved wire delay, appropriate circuit structures, and technology dependent parameters are necessary to accurately predict large cache memory performance at deep submicrometer technology nodes. PRACTICS is used to analyze the access time and power consumption in terms of cache sizes and various degrees of associativity for architectural studies. In addition, the PRACTICS simulation results show that repeater insertion reduces the access time significantly, with a small overhead in dynamic-power consumption for large size cache design at deep submicrometer technology. © 2006 IEEE.","Cache access time; Cache cycle time; Distributed resistance-capacitance (RC) model; Lumped resistance capacitance (RC) model; Memory architecture; Static random access memory (SRAM)","Cache access time; Cache cycle time; Distributed resistance capacitance (RC) model; Lumped resistance capacitance (RC) model; Memory architecture; Buffer storage; Capacitance; Computer aided design; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Energy dissipation; Integrated circuits; Static random access storage; Microprocessor chips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748098181

There are two novelties in the proposed registration method. First, a set of best-scale geometric features are selected for each point in the brain, in order to facilitate correspondence detection during the registration procedure. This is achieved by optimizing an energy function that requires each point to have its best-scale geometric features consistent over the corresponding points in the training samples, and at the same time distinctive from those of nearby points in the neighborhood. Second, the active points used to drive the brain registration are hierarchically selected during the registration procedure, based on their saliency and consistency measures. That is, the image points with salient and consistent features (across different individuals) are considered for the initial registration of two images, while other less salient and consistent points join the registration procedure later. By incorporating these two novel strategies into the framework of the HAMMER registration algorithm, the registration accuracy has been improved according to the results on simulated brain data, and also visible improvement is observed particularly in the cortical regions of real brain data. © 2006 IEEE.","Best features; Best scale selection; Consistency measurement; Deformable registration; Feature-based registration; Hierarchical registration; Learning-based method; Saliency measurement","Algorithms; Brain; Computational geometry; Image analysis; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Best features; Best scale selections; Consistency measurements; Feature-based registration; Hierarchical registrations; Learning-based methods; Saliency measurements; Medical imaging; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; histology; human; image enhancement; image quality; image subtraction; information retrieval; instrumentation; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748095663

When a critical event triggers a surge of data generated by the sensors, congestion may occur as data packets converge toward a sink. Congestion causes energy waste, throughput reduction, and information loss. However, the important problem of congestion avoidance in sensor networks is largely open. This paper proposes a congestion-avoidance scheme based on light-weight buffer management. We describe simple yet effective approaches that prevent data packets from overflowing the buffer space of the intermediate sensors. These approaches automatically adapt the sensors' forwarding rates to nearly optimal without causing congestion. We discuss how to implement buffer-based congestion avoidance with different MAC protocols. In particular, for CSMA with implicit ACK, our 1/k-buffer solution prevents hidden terminals from causing congestion. We demonstrate how to maintain near-optimal throughput with a small buffer at each sensor and how to achieve congestion-free load balancing when there are multiple routing paths toward multiple sinks. © 2006 IEEE.","Network communication; Sensor networks","Buffer storage; Mobile computing; Routers; Telecommunication traffic; Topology; Congestion avoidance; Data packets; Lightweight buffer management; Multiple routing paths; Multiple sinks; Sensor data fusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747620515

For example, they may be used as ionic conductors in solid oxide fuel cells or nuclear waste forms for the storage of actinides, particularly Pu. Here, the recent progress in understanding ion beam irradiation-induced phenomena in pyrochlore compounds is briefly reviewed with a focus on the ion beam-induced crystalline-to-amorphous and pyrochlore-to-fluorite structural transitions. Systematic ion irradiation studies of lanthanide pyrochlores with B = Ti, Zr and Sn have indicated that the radiation response of the pyrochlore compounds is highly dependent on compositional changes. Both the ionic size and cation electronic configurations (e.g. bond-types) affect the structural distortion from the ideal fluorite structure and thus the response of pyrochlore-structure types to ion beam irradiation. An ion beam-induced pyrochlore-to-fluorite structural transition occurs in all irradiated pyrochlore compositions, and the independent kinetics of the cation and anion disordering processes has been discussed.

This improves the competitiveness of external ice-on-tube systems as compared to other TES systems, such as dynamic ice harvesters and static internal melt systems. In this study the amount of ice growth enhancement is predicted theoretically, by performing simplified 1-D calculations, and is then validated in the laboratory through carefully controlled experiments.

The degree of enhancement of the energy storage has been shown in terms of the total energy stored rate. The numerical results from the parametric study indicated that the total energy charged rate can be significantly enhanced by using composite PCMs as compared to the single PCM.

Hydrogen adsorption isotherms were measured separately at 77 K and &lt;1 atm, and at 298 K and &lt;10 MPa. It was found that the hydrogen adsorption capacity of LSX zeolite depended strongly on the cationic radius and the density of the cations that are located on the exposed sites. The interaction energies between H2 and the cations follow the order Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+, as predicted based on the ionic radii. Oxygen anions on zeolite framework were minor adsorption sites. Li-LSX had an H2 capacity of 1.5 wt % at 77 K and 1 atm, and a capacity of 0.6 wt % at 298 K and 10 MPa, among the highest of known sorbents. The hydrogen capacity in LSX zeolite by bridged hydrogen spillover was also investigated. A simple and effective technique was employed to build carbon bridges between the H2 dissociation catalyst and the zeolite to facilitate spillover of hydrogen atoms. Thus, the hydrogen storage capacity of Li-LSX zeolite was enhanced to 1.6 wt % (by a factor of 2.6) at 298 K and 10 MPa. This is by far the highest hydrogen storage capacity obtained on a zeolite material at room temperature. Furthermore, the adsorption rates were fast, and the storages were shown to be fully reversible and rechargeable. Further optimization of the bridge building technique would lead to an additional enhancement of hydrogen storage. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Catalysts; Dissociation; Energy storage; Silica; Zeolites; Cationic radius; Dissociation catalysts; Hydrogen storage capacities; Interaction energies; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748848563

In this investigation we put forth a simple model to quantify the capacity of series elasticity to increase work and power output from an actuator. We show that an appropriate spring constant increases the energy that an actuator can deliver to a mass by a factor of 4. The series elasticity changes the actuator operating point along its force-velocity curve and therefore affects the actuator work output over a fixed stroke length. In addition, the model predicts that a series spring can store energy and deliver peak powers greater than the power limit of the source by a factor of 1.4. Preliminary experiments are performed to test model predictions. We find qualitative agreement between the model and experimental data, highlighting the importance of series elasticity for actuator work and power amplification across a fixed stroke length.

In this work, several transmission-based measurement techniques were compared, including coincidence mode with and without rod windowing, singles mode with two different energy sources (68Ge and 57Co), and postinjection transmission scanning. In addition, the effectiveness of transmission segmentation and the propagation of transmission bias and noise into the emission images were examined. The 57Co singles measurements provided the most accurate attenuation coefficients and superior signal-to-noise ratio, while 68Ge singles measurements were degraded due to scattering from the object. Scatter correction of 68Ge transmission data improved the accuracy for a 10 cm phantom but over-corrected for a mouse phantom. 57Co scanning also resulted in low bias and noise in postinjection transmission scans for emission activities up to 20 MBq. Segmentation worked most reliably for transmission data acquired with 57Co but the minor improvement in accuracy of attenuation coefficients and signal-to-noise may not justify its use, particularly for small subjects.

Because of the subsurface temperature profile of terrestrial storage sites, CO2 stored in these reservoirs is buoyant. As a result, a portion of the injected CO2 can escape if the reservoir is not appropriately sealed. We show that injecting CO2 into deep-sea sediments &lt;3,000-m water depth and a few hundred meters of sediment provides permanent geologic storage even with large geomechanical perturbations. At the high pressures and low temperatures common in deep-sea sediments, CO2 resides in its liquid phase and can be denser than the overlying pore fluid, causing the injected CO2 to be gravitationally stable. Additionally, CO2 hydrate formation will impede the flow of CO2(I) and serve as a second cap on the system. The evolution of the CO2 plume is described qualitatively from the injection to the formation of CO2 hydrates and finally to the dilution of the CO 2(aq) solution by diffusion. If calcareous sediments are chosen, then the dissolution of carbonate host rock by the CO2(aq) solution will slightly increase porosity, which may cause large increases in permeability. Karst formation, however, is unlikely because total dissolution is limited to only a few percent of the rock volume. The total CO2 storage capacity within the 200-mile economic zone of the U.S. coastline is enormous, capable of storing thousands of years of current U.S. CO2 emissions. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; CO2 hydrates; Energy; Sequestration","carbon dioxide; natural gas; article; carbon dioxide transport; chemical reaction kinetics; climate change; deep sea; geochemistry; geology; marine environment; priority journal; rock; sediment; storage; thermal analysis; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747596690

The Pt atom tends to occupy the axial bridge site of the BN tube with the highest binding energy of -0.91 eV. Upon Pt doping, several occupied and unoccupied impurity states are induced, which reduces the band gap of the pristine BN nanotube. Upon hydrogen adsorption on Pt-doped BN nanotube, the first hydrogen molecule can be chemically adsorbed on the Pt-doped BN nanotube without crossing any energy barrier, whereas the second hydrogen molecule has to overcome a small energy barrier of 0.019 eV. At least up to two hydrogen molecules can be chemically adsorbed on a single Pt atom supported by the BN nanotube, with the average adsorption energy of -0.365 eV. Upon hydrogen adsorption on a Pt-dimer-doped BN nanotube, the formation of the Pt dimer not only weakens the interaction between the Pt cluster and the BN nanotube but also reduces the average adsorption energy of hydrogen molecules.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that regulates cellular metabolism. The role of AMP-activated protein kinase in adipocyte differentiation is not completely understood, therefore, we examined the effect of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D- ribofuranoside (AICAR), a pharmacological activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on adipocyte differentiation in 3T3L1 cells and in a mouse Diet induced obesity (DIO) model. Methods: To examine the effect of AICAR on adipocyte differentiation in 3T3L1 cells and in a mouse Diet induced obesity (DIO) model, 3T3L1 cells were differentiatied in the presence or absence of different concentration of AICAR and neutral lipid content and expression of various adipocyte-specific transcription factors were examined. In vivo study, treated and untreated mice with AICAR (0.1-0.5 mg/g body weight) were fed high-fat diet (60% kcal% fat) to induce DIO and several parameters were studied. Results: AICAR blocked adipogenic conversion in 3T3L1 cells along with significant decrease in the neutral lipid content by downregulating several adipocyte-specific transcription factors including peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), C/EBPα and ADD1/SREBP1, which are critical for adipogenesis in vitro. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of AICAR (0.5 mg g/body weight) to mice fed with high-fat diet (60% kcal% fat) to induce DIO, significantly blocked the body weight gain and total content of epididymal fat in these mice over a period of 6 weeks. AICAR treatment also restored normal adipokine levels and resulted in significant improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The reduction in adipose tissue content in AICAR treated DIO mice was due to reduction in lipid accumulation in the pre-existing adipocytes. However, no change was observed in the expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα and ADD1/SREBP1 transcription factors in vivo though PGC1α expression was significantly induced. Conclusion: This study suggests that AICAR inhibits adipocyte differentiation via downregulation of expression of adipogenic factors in vitro and reduces adipose tissue content in DIO mice by activating expression of PGC1α without inhibiting adipocyte-specific transcription factors in DIO mice. © 2006 Giri et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"5 amino 4 imidazolecarboxamide riboside; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; lipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; transcription factor; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell differentiation; cell strain 3T3; controlled study; dose response; down regulation; drug inhibition; drug mechanism; experimental model; glucose tolerance; insulin sensitivity; lipid composition; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; metabolic syndrome X; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; parameter; protein expression; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748612432

When NaAlH4 was sonochemically doped with 2 mol% TiCl3 in a decalin slurry using THF as a co-solvent and then ball milled, the dehydrogenation temperature in the 90-150 °C range decreased by about 30 °C during temperature programmed desorption (5 °C/min) compared to a conventionally wet doped and ball milled sample. Similarly, during constant temperature desorption the dehydrogenation kinetics of sonochemically doped and ball milled samples of NaAlH4 increased by factors of 9.0, 5.1 and 3.1, respectively, at 90, 110 and 130 °C over those exhibited by conventionally wet doped and ball milled samples. These marked kinetic enhancements persisted through several dehydrogenation/hydrogenation cycles, now with corresponding increases by factors of 16.1, 4.5 and 3.5, and with a striking factor of four improvement in the hydrogenation kinetics also realized at 1250 psia and 125 °C. The observed kinetic effect was interpreted in terms of the complementary mechanochemical effects imparted to the sample by high-intensity ultrasound followed by high energy ball milling. It was surmised that sonochemical doping induced superior mixing of the titanium(III) chloride and sodium aluminum hydride reagents, thereby fostering the formation of smaller catalyst and NaAlH4 particles. This ensured a finer dispersion of the catalyst particles over the surfaces of the NaAlH4 crystals prior to and during the subsequent high energy ball milling process, which greatly improved the mechanochemical effectiveness of ball milling. Strong evidence in support of this supposition stemmed from sonochemical doping being only marginally more effective than conventional wet doping without subsequent ball milling, and scanning electron microscopy images revealing the formation of the factor of ten smaller NaAlH4 particles for the sonochemically doped and ball milled samples. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We have identified a novel nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-80, that regulates delta-9 desaturase gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we describe fatty acid compositions, lifespans, and gene expression studies of strains carrying mutations in nhr-80 and in the three genes encoding delta-9 desaturases, fat-5, fat-6, and fat-7. The delta-9 desaturase single mutants display only subtle changes in fatty acid composition and no other visible phenotypes, yet the fat-5;fat-6;fat-7 triple mutant is lethal, revealing that endogenous production of monounsaturated fatty acids is essential for survival. In the absence of FAT-6 or FAT-7, the expression of the remaining desaturases increases, and this ability to compensate depends on NHR-80.

For example, by introducing fluorine into bonding oxide layers and NH 2 groups onto surfaces of bonding oxide layers before bonding, bonding energy equivalent to silicon fracture energy (2500 mJ/m 2) has been realized at room temperature after storage in air. Fluorine incorporation causes Si-O-Si ring breaking leading to fluorinated oxide formation with lower density, thus facilitating a higher diffusion rate of polymerization by-products and enhanced moisture absorptivity. Results indicate that by-products of the polymerization reaction between NH 2 groups on mating surfaces appear to be more easily diffused and dispersed away from the bonding interface by the low density fluorinated oxide than are polymerization by-products of OH groups.

The purpose of adding MF resin to the UF resin was to reduce the formaldehyde emission. As the MF resin content was increased in the UF-MF resin mixture, the formaldehyde emission decreased. The storage modulus (E′). loss modulus (E″) and loss factor (tan δ) of each resin were measured by DMTA. With increasing temperature, as the resin cured, the storage modulus (E′) increased in all resin systems. The storage modulus (E′) increased both as a function of increasing temperature and with increasing MF content. The activation energies (E a) of the curing reactions of the UF and MF resins alone, as well as the mixed resins, on different substrates, were calculated on the basis of the variation of the temperature of the maximum of each DSC scan exotherm using the Kissinger equation. The Ea value of the UF resin decreased as the MF resin content ratio increased, and because of this lower activation energy the UF-MF resins cured faster than the UF resin.

In addition, an ideal storage system should be able to operate under ambient thermodynamic conditions and exhibit fast hydrogen sorption kinetics. No materials are known that meet all these requirements. While recent theoretical efforts showed some promise for transition-metal-coated carbon fullerenes, later studies demonstrated that these metal atoms prefer to cluster on the fullerene surface, thus reducing greatly the weight percentage of stored hydrogen. Using density functional theory we show that Li-coated fullerenes do not suffer from this constraint. In particular, we find that an isolated Li 12C60 cluster where Li atoms are capped onto the pentagonal faces of the fullerene not only is very stable but also can store up to 120 hydrogen atoms in molecular form with a binding energy of 0.075 eV/H 2. In addition, the structural integrity of L12C 60 clusters is maintained when they are allowed to interact with each other. The lowest energy structure of the dimer is one where the Li atom capped on the five-member ring of one fullerene binds to the six-member ring of the other. The binding of hydrogen to the linking Li atom and the potential of materials composed of Li12C60 building blocks for hydrogen storage are discussed. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Atoms; Binding energy; Dimers; Fullerenes; Gravimetric analysis; Hydrogen; Reaction kinetics; Sorption; Transition metals; Energy structure; Hydrogen storage; Li12C60; Volumetric density; Lithium; carbon; dimer; fullerene derivative; hydrogen; lithium; transition element; article; density; density functional theory; energy; gravimetry; kinetics; materials; solid state; storage; surface property; thermodynamics; weight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746583585

The as-grown Ag nanorods are aligned on the substrate and have a diameter of ∼60-70 nm, a density of ∼200-300 × 107 cm-2, and a tilting angle of ∼70°-80° with respect to the surface normal. The electrochemical behaviours of the Ag nanorod electrode are characterized by cyclic voltammetry at various scan rates with comparison to an Ag thin-film electrode. The capacitive current is found to be proportional to the actual surface area, and the faradic redox current also increases monotonically with the surface area of the nanorod electrodes, but the increase is not as significant as that of the capacitive current due to the diffusion layer overlapping for the highly compacted nanorods. This indicates that the Ag nanorod electrode could improve the electrolytic sensor for amperometric response measurements, especially for the bimolecular measurements due to the biocompatibility of Ag. The high capacitance also suggests a promising usage of the developed nanostructures for battery and energy storage applications. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biocompatibility; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Nanorods; Nanostructures; Silver; Surface diffusion; Vacuum deposition; A densities; Amperometric responses; Capacitive currents; Diffusion layers; Electrochemical behaviours; Electrochemical characterizations; Energy storage applications; Faradic redoxes; Film electrodes; Monotonically; Nanorod electrodes; Oblique angles; Scan rates; Silver nanorods; Surface areas; Surface normals; Tilting angles; Vacuum deposition techniques; Electrochemical electrodes; nanofilm; nanorod; silver; article; biocompatibility; chemical reaction kinetics; density; diffusion; electric capacitance; electric current; electrochemical analysis; electrode; nanosensor; potentiometry; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248348519

SRAMs from six different vendors were characterized for single-event upset (SEU) hardness at proton energies from 20 to 500 MeV and at temperatures of 25 and 80°C after total dose irradiating the SRAMs with either protons, Co-60 gamma rays, or low-energy x-rays. It is shown that total dose irradiation and the memory pattern written to the memory array during total dose irradiation and SEU characterization can substantially affect SEU hardness for some SRAMs. For one SRAM, the memory pattern made more than two orders of magnitude difference in SEU cross section at the highest total dose level examined. For all SRAMs investigated, the memory pattern that led to the largest increase in SEU cross section was the same memory pattern that led to the maximum increase in total-dose induced power supply leakage current. In addition, it is shown that increasing the temperature during SEU characterization can also increase the effect of total dose on SEU hardness. As a result, worst-case SEU hardness assurance test conditions are the maximum total dose and temperature of the system environment, and the minimum operating voltage of the SRAM. Possible screens for determining whether or not the SEU cross section of an SRAM will vary with total dose, based on the magnitude of the increase in power supply leakage current with total dose or the variation in SEU cross section with power supply voltage, have been suggested. In contrast to previous works, our results using selective area x-ray irradiations show that the source of the effect of total dose on SEU hardness is radiation-induced leakage currents in the memory cells. The increase in SEU cross section with total dose appears to be consistent with radiation-induced currents originating in the memory cells affecting the output bias levels of bias level shift circuitry used to control the voltage levels to the memory cells and/or due to the lowering of the noise margin of individual memory cells caused by radiation-induced leakage currents. © 2006 IEEE.","Hardness assurance; Proton irradiation; Single-event upset","Hardness assurance; Radiation-induced currents; Radiation-induced leakage currents; Single-event upset (SEU); Electric potential; Electric power systems; Gamma rays; Hardness; Leakage currents; Random access storage; Thermal effects; X ray analysis; Proton irradiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748345155

Since previous reports have indicated a benefit of combining histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) and University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, we evaluated the effects of initial flush with low viscosity HTK, followed by storage in UW. Material and Methods: Kidneys from inbred Lewis rats were procured using HTK or UW for initially perfusion and re-flushed after 30 min with either solution. In a third group, after perfusion with HTK, organs were re-flushed with UW. Organs were stored for 16-24 h (4°C). Study parameters were high-energy phosphates, histology, apoptosis, recipient survival and urine excretion of 15-F2t-isoprostanes (oxidative stress marker). Results: Prior to transplantation, tissue ATP/ADP concentrations were: HTK/UW &gt; UW-only &gt; HTK-only. In transplanted kidneys, histological damage was highest after preservation in HTK-only. Twenty-four hours after transplantation (24 h cold ischemia time - CIT), cleaved-PARP was most abundant using UW-only. 16 h of CIT resulted in higher urine concentrations of isoprostanes in the order HTK-only (368 ± 308) &gt; UW-only (157 ± 105) &gt; HTK/UW (67 ± 26), and was lower in HTK/UW after 24 h of CIT (146 ± 38) vs. UW-only (507 ± 33 pg/mg creatinine). Survival (24 h CIT) was significantly reduced, and percentage of initial non-functioning (INF) kidneys highest in HTK-only (2.6 ± 0.3 days, 100%), compared to UW-only (13 ± 4.4 days, 75%) and HTK/ UW (18.5 ± 4.6 days, 33%). Conclusions: In long-term preservation, UW is superior over HTK. However, our results indicate that perfusion with HTK prior to storage in UW may improve the results of UW alone which is reflected by better survival, lower rate of INF, higher cellular energy conservation and a decrease of free radicals.

In this study, we compared the physiological response to an exogenous MC3/4R agonist and the hypothalamic expression of proopic melanocortin (POMC) gene, encoding few MC3/4R ligands, between broiler and layer chicken strains. These strains, representing the two most prominent commercial strains of chickens grown for meat (broilers) and egg production (layers), differ in their food intake, fat accumulation, and reproductive performance and, therefore, form a good model of obese and lean phenotypes, respectively. A single i.v. injection of the synthetic peptide melanotan-II (MT-II; 1 mg/kg body weight) into the wing vein of feed-restricted birds led to attenuation of food intake upon exposure to feeding ad libitum in both broiler and layer chickens. A study of the POMC mRNA encoding the two prominent natural MC3/4R agonists, α-MSH and ACTH, also revealed a general similarity between the strains. Under feeding conditions ad libitum, POMC mRNA levels were highly similar in chicks of both strains and this level was significantly reduced upon feed restriction. However, POMC mRNA down-regulation upon feed restriction was more pronounced in layers than in broilers. These results suggest: (i) a role for MC3/4R, agonists in the control of appetite; (ii) that the physiological differences between broilers and layers are not related to unresponsiveness of broiler chickens to the satiety signal of MC3/4R ligands. Therefore, these findings suggest that artificial activation of this circuit in broiler chicks could help to accommodate with their agricultural shortcomings of overeating, fattening, and impaired reproduction. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.",,"alpha intermedin; anorexigenic agent; corticotropin; melanocortin; melanocortin 3 receptor; melanocortin 4 receptor; melanotan ii; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; article; chick; controlled study; diet restriction; down regulation; female; food intake; gene expression; hypothalamus; lean body weight; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; phenotype; priority journal; protein blood level; statistical significance; strain difference; alpha-MSH; Animals; Chickens; Female; Gene Expression; Hypothalamus; Obesity; Peptides, Cyclic; Phenotype; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747892308

If islanded operation of these DG sources is allowed on a feeder subjected to a disturbance, DG may reduce the number of interruptions and/or durations for customers residing within their protection zones, thus increasing the reliability of service. To that end, a procedure for finding optimal positions for DG and protection devices is presented for a feeder equipped with capacity-constrained distributed generators, using a custom-tailored genetic algorithm, and the improvement in reliability is demonstrated on a test feeder.

Underlying metabolic muscle diseases have not been evaluated extensively. In a cross-sectional study of 136 patients with drug-induced myopathies, we report a higher prevalence of underlying metabolic muscle diseases than expected in the general population. Control groups included 116 patients on therapy with no myopathic symptoms, 100 asymptomatic individuals from the general population never exposed to statins, and 106 patients with non-statin-induced myopathies. Of 110 patients who underwent mutation testing, 10% were heterozygous or homozygous for mutations causing three metabolic myopathies, compared to 3% testing positive among asymptomatic patients on therapy (P = 0.04). The actual number of mutant alleles found in the test group patients was increased fourfold over the control group (P < 0.0001) due to an increased presence of mutation homozygotes. The number of carriers for carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency and for McArdle disease was increased 13- and 20-fold, respectively, over expected general population frequencies. Homozygotes for myoadenylate deaminase deficiency were increased 3.25-fold with no increase in carrier status. In 52% of muscle biopsies from patients, significant biochemical abnormalities were found in mitochondrial or fatty acid metabolism, with 31% having multiple defects. Variable persistent symptoms occurred in 68% of patients despite cessation of therapy. The effect of statins on energy metabolism combined with a genetic susceptibility to triggering of muscle symptoms may account for myopathic outcomes in certain high-risk groups. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency; McArdle disease; Metabolic myopathies; Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency; Statin myopathy","adenosine monophosphate deaminase; antilipemic agent; atorvastatin; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; cerivastatin; creatine kinase; fenofibrate; gemfibrozil; genomic DNA; glycogen phosphorylase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; mevinolin; simvastatin; ubidecarenone; adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency; adult; aged; allele; article; carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; drug induced disease; energy metabolism; enzyme deficiency; fatigue; fatty acid metabolism; female; gene mutation; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; glycogen storage disease type 5; high risk population; homozygote; human; human tissue; hyperlipidemia; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; metabolic disorder; mitochondrial respiration; muscle biopsy; muscle cramp; muscle disease; muscle weakness; myalgia; myoglobinuria; myopathy; priority journal; rhabdomyolysis; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; AMP Deaminase; Antilipemic Agents; Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase; DNA Mutational Analysis; Drug Synergism; Fatty Acids; Female; Gene Frequency; Glycogen Storage Disease Type V; Heterozygote; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Diseases; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746665298

The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) responds to changes in growth factors, amino acids, oxygen tension, and energy status; however, it is unclear how TOR contributes to physiological homeostasis and disease conditions. Here, we show that reducing the function of Drosophila TOR results in decreased lipid stores and glucose levels. Importantly, this reduction of dTOR activity blocks the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome phenotypes associated with increased activity of the insulin responsive transcription factor, dFOXO. Reduction in dTOR function also protects against age-dependent decline in heart function and increases longevity. Thus, the regulation of dTOR activity may be an ancient ""systems biological"" means of regulating metabolism and senescence, that has important evolutionary, physiological, and clinical implications. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Forty-eight overweight volunteers were randomly assigned to four groups: control (100% of energy requirements), 25% calorie restriction (CR), 12.5% calorie restriction +12.5% energy expenditure through structured exercise (CREX), or 15% weight loss by a low-calorie diet followed by weight maintenance for 6 months (LCD). Weight, percent body fat, VAT, IMCL, IHL, FCS, and Si were assessed at baseline and month 6. RESULTS - At baseline, FCS was related to VAT and IHL (P &lt; 0.05) but not to IMCL. FCS was also the strongest determinant of Si (P &lt; 0.01). Weight loss at month 6 was 1 ± 1% (control, mean ± SE), 10 ± 1% (CR), 10 ± 1% (CREX), and 14 ± 1% (LCD). VAT, FCS, percent body fat, and IHL were reduced in the three intervention groups (P &lt; 0.01), but IMCL was unchanged. Si was increased at month 6 (P = 0.05) in the CREX (37 ± 18%) and LCD (70 ± 34%) groups (P &lt; 0.05) and tended to increase in the CR group (40 ± 20%, P = 0.08). Together the improvements in Si were related to loss in weight, fat mass, and VAT, but not IHL, IMCL, or FCS. CONCLUSIONS - Large adipocytes lead to lipid deposition in visceral and hepatic tissues, promoting insulin resistance.

Such changes in host life history may reflect: 1) a parasite tactic: the parasite adaptively manipulates energy flow within the host so that the host is induced to make a reduction in reproductive effort and reproductive investment, making more energy available to the parasite; 2) no tactic: there is no change in host reproductive effort and reproductive investment simply decreases as a side effect of the parasite depleting host energy stores; 3) a host tactic: the host adaptively increases reproductive effort in the face of infection and loss of body condition, reproductive investment possibly being reduced despite the increased reproductive effort. Females in Alaskan lake populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are capable of clutch production when parasitized by the cestode Schislocephalus solidus despite large relative parasite masses. We analyzed the somatic energy reserves, maturation stage and ovarian mass of female sticklebacks collected from an Alaska lake during a single reproductive season. We found that parasitized females were less likely to carry fully-matured gametes, had smaller ovarian masses, and had lower somatic energy stores than unparasitized females. The relationship between reproductive investment and energy storage did not differ between parasitized and unparasitized females. Thus, reproductive effort did not change in response to parasitic infection. We conclude there was no indication of either a parasite tactic or a host tactic. Simple nutrient theft is involved in the parasite's influence on host reproduction, consistent with an earlier hypothesis that reproductive curtailment in threespine sticklebacks is a side effect.

A necessary condition for achieving maximal SNR is stated, based on the covariance of the noise and the residual part. We provide two practical alternatives for estimating this condition by observing that the filtering of the image and the noise can be approximated by a decoupling technique, with respect to the weight or time parameters. Our automatic algorithm obtains quite accurate results on a variety of synthetic and natural images, including piecewise smooth and textured ones. We assume that the statistics of the noise were previously estimated. No a priori knowledge regarding the characteristics of the clean image is required. A theoretical analysis is carried out, where several SNR performance bounds are established for the optimal strategy and for a widely used method, wherein the variance of the residual part equals the variance of the noise. © 2006 IEEE.","Image denoising; Nonlinear diffusion; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); Total-variation; Variational image processing","Algorithms; Estimation; Image quality; Nonlinear filtering; Optimization; Partial differential equations; Signal to noise ratio; Decoupling technique; Image denoising; Nonlinear diffusion; Image enhancement; algorithm; article; artifact; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; nonlinear system; quality control; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; statistical model; Algorithms; Artifacts; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Nonlinear Dynamics; Quality Control; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746217160

Typically, hydrogen is stored in the CNTs by exposure of the material to a high-pressure H2 atmosphere at different temperatures. The maximum hydrogen concentrations stored following this method and measured using ion beam analysis do not exceed 1 wt.%. Introduction of defects by ion irradiation (i.e. implantation) prior to high-pressure H2 treatment, offers an alternative method to activate H adsorption and enhance the chemisorption of hydrogen. This is a preliminary work where hydrogen was introduced into single-wall nanotubes and carbon films by low-energy (13.6 keV) hydrogen ion implantation. Elastic recoil detection was used to measure the quantity and depth distribution of hydrogen retained in the carbonaceous materials. Results show that there are substantial differences in the measured profiles between the CNT samples and the vitreous carbon. On another hand, only ∼43% of the implanted hydrogen in the CNTs is retained in the region where it should be located according to the SRIM simulations for a solid carbon sample. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Higher order Z-corrections were implemented for extending the stopping calculations down to the Bragg peak. The construction of molecular cross sections allows the contribution of each electronic channel to the stopping process to be calculated and the need to separately evaluate the shell corrections is overcome.

In skin, mechanical energy is stored during loading and then is transmitted and dissipated, which protects skin from mechanical failure. Thus energy storage (elastic properties) and dissipation (viscous properties) are important characteristics of extracellular matrices. Methods: A uniaxial incremental stress relaxation test method has been used to characterize the time-dependent (viscous) and time-independent (elastic) properties of human dermis. Viscoelasticity was investigated in processed human dermis that was equilibrated at pHs of 3.0, 7.4 and 11.0 in an effort to study the link between electrostatic interactions within the collagen matrix and macroscopic tissue properties. Results: Our results show that the solution pH and the charge on collagen significantly affected the high-strain elastic behavior of dermis; the elastic behavior of skin has previously been shown to be directly correlated with axial stretching of the collagen triple helix in crosslinked collagen fibrils. A positive linear correlation existed between the high-strain elastic modulus and both pH (R2 = 0.96) and the total number of charged residues on collagen (R2 = 0.93). These results provide in vitroex vivo evidence that charged groups on the surface of collagen molecules in processed human skin influence the high-strain elastic properties of dermis and are likely to be involved in elastic energy storage. Conclusion: It is proposed that the pH and charged residue dependency of the elastic modulus suggests that charged pair interactions and repulsions within and between collagen molecules are involved in elastic energy storage during stretching at high strains. It is hypothesized that elastic energy storage is associated with the stretching of pairs of charged amino acid residues that are found primarily in the flexible regions of collagen molecules.

A torque motor was used to oscillate the forearms of seven healthy male subjects (23-40 years) during SSC and non-SSC contractions at four frequencies of movement (.58, 1.5, 2.4 and 3.3 Hz) over a range of 105°-162° of elbow extension. The torque was integrated as a function of joint angle to yield the work produced by the elbow flexors. The elbow flexors were transcutaneously stimulated with a voltage equivalent to 60% maximum voluntary isometric contraction torque for 4 s at 50 Hz. EMG of the elbow flexors and extensors was recorded from the biceps and triceps respectively. The processed EMG was used to drive a Hill based model to predict the torque of the elbow flexors. Results indicate that muscle work increases from non-SSC to SSC trials. Work decreases for SSC and non-SSC trials with increasing velocity. The simulated constant activation muscle model predicted work well for all trials and conditions, indicating muscle model accuracy. The EMG driven model predicted well for all non-SSC trials, but significantly underestimated the work for SSC tasks, suggesting that the contractile component is directly involved in optimising muscle work during SSC tasks. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

On one hand it is periodic and on the other hand it is chaotic. Thus, we propose a hybrid model-the spatial chaotic dynamics for the associative recall to retrieve patterns, similar to Walter Freeman's discovery, and the fixed point dynamics for memory storage, similar to Hopfield and Grossberg's findings. Each neuron in the network is a chaotic map, whose phase space is divided into two states. One is periodic dynamic state of period V, representing a V-value retrieved pattern; another is chaotic dynamic state corresponding to searching process. Firstly, patterns are stored in memory by the pseudo-inverse matrix learning algorithm. In the retrieving process, all neurons are initially set to be chaotic. Due to the ergodicity property of chaos, each neuron will approximate the periodic points covered by the chaotic attractor at some instants. When this occurs, the control is activated to drive the dynamics of each neuron to one of the V stable periodic points. If a neuron is driven to a wrong periodic point, it contributes to high partial energies to itself and all other neurons. As a consequence, some neurons may jump back to the chaotic state and the searching process continues until all neurons settle down at their correct periodic points. In this way, the corresponding stored pattern is retrieved. Computer simulations confirm the theoretical prediction. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, measurements were performed in large-scale, vertical flames to characterize the dimensional and radiative properties of an ignited hydrogen jet. These data are relevant to the safety scenario of a sudden leak in a high-pressure hydrogen containment vessel. Specifically, the data will provide a technological basis for determining hazardous length scales associated with unintended releases at hydrogen storage and distribution centers. Visible and infrared video and ultraviolet flame luminescence imaging were used to evaluate flame length, diameter and structure. Radiometer measurements allowed determination of the radiant heat flux from the flame. The results show that flame length increases with total jet mass flow rate and jet nozzle diameter. When plotted as a function of Froude number, which measures the relative importance of jet momentum and buoyancy, the measured flame lengths for a range of operating conditions collapse onto the same curve. Good comparison with hydrocarbon jet flame lengths is found, demonstrating that the non-dimensional correlations are valid for a variety of fuel types. The radiative heat flux measurements for hydrogen flames show good agreement with non-dimensional correlations and scaling laws developed for a range of fuels and flame conditions. This result verifies that such correlations can be used to predict radiative heat flux from a wide variety of hydrogen flames and establishes a basis for predicting a priori the characteristics of flames resulting from accidental releases. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Combustion; Hydrogen; Hydrogen flames; Turbulent jet","Codes (standards); Combustion; High pressure effects; Hydrogen fuels; Imaging techniques; Luminescence; Radiation; Turbulent flow; Hydrogen flames; Luminescence imaging; Radiative properties; Turbulent jets; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744940526

As complementary solutions, hydrogen energy storage to provide a large capacity and access-oriented storage based on magnetic, electric or kinetic energy with less capacity but a faster response time are considered. These are arranged to form a multi-level storage that can compensate stochastic fluctuations of power over diverse time scales. The developed energy management coordinates the operation of the diverse storage modules. In this context, the access-oriented storage acts as a shock absorber in order to shield fuel cells and electrolysers from fast fluctuations of wind power and load. The functions of the plant are validated through simulation using meteorological information obtained from the National Wind Technology Center in the USA. The plant is shown to provide the scheduled output of hydrogen and electric power.

In the absence of a mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or some other significant incentive for CCS deployment, this cost effectively limits CCS technology deployment to small niche markets and stymies the potential for further technological development through learning by doing until these disincentives for the free venting of CO2 are in place. By far, the largest current fraction of these costs is capture (including compression and dehydration), commonly estimated at $25-60/t CO2 for power plant applications, followed by CO2 transport and storage, estimated at $0-15/t CO2. Of the storage costs, only a small fraction of the cost will go to accurate geological characterization. These one time costs are probably on the order of $0.1/t CO2 or less as these costs are spread out over the many millions of tons likely to be injected into a field over many decades. Geologic assessments include information central to capacity prediction, risk estimation for the target intervals and development facilities engineering. Since assessment costs are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than capture costs, and assessment products carry other tangible societal benefits, such as improved accuracy in fossil fuel and ground water reserves estimates, government or joint private-public funding of major assessment initiatives should underpin early policy choices regarding CO 2 storage deployment and should serve as a point of entry for policy makers and regulators. Early assessment is also likely to improve the knowledge base upon which the first commercial CCS deployments will rest. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This research addresses the following questions: 1) Does LWD influence the spatial pattern of the storage of benthic organic matter in meander bends? 2) How mobile is the LWD in low-gradient meandering systems? 3) Do characteristics of LWD such as length/bankfull channel width ratio, affect movement? Based on detailed sampling of sediment and LWD monitoring, this study provides a detailed representation of the influence of LWD on the storage of benthic organic matter in meander bends, as well as a detailed documentation of the mobility of LWD in the study reach. This study has demonstrated that: 1) LWD strongly influences patterns of storage of benthic organic matter in low-gradient meander bends; 2) removal of LWD from meander bends in low-gradient systems can substantially reduce the storage of benthic organic matter; and 3) the LWD within the study reach at Poplar Creek is highly mobile. The high mobility of LWD, observed in this study, contrasts with the rates observed in high-gradient systems and suggests that LWD-influenced patterns of storage of organic matter are temporally variable and that storage of benthic organic matter occurs in pulses, interspersed with transport, that are keyed to the mobility of LWD. Although LWD may exert an equally significant control over patterns of storage of organic matter in high- and low-gradient systems, the differences in the mobility rates of LWD suggest a fundamental difference in the dynamics of LWD-mediated organic matter between low- and high-gradient systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Rats with relatively high systemic estrogen (intact females and OVX females and males administered estrogen subcutaneously) were significantly more sensitive to leptin's anorexic action in the brain (i3vt), as well as significantly less sensitive to insulin's i3vt action, than intact males. Administering estradiol directly into the brain of our females increased i3vt leptin sensitivity while decreasing i3vt insulin sensitivity and changed the body fat distribution of our females to resemble that of intact females.

However, a drawback of ACCs is that their performance can decline with increasing ambient air temperature. A new approach is proposed in this paper that has the potential to alleviate this drawback of ACCs. In this approach, a chilled-water thermal energy storage system (TES) is used to precool the inflow air to the ACC whenever the ambient air temperature increases above the design air inlet temperature. The temperature of the TES system is maintained by an absorption refrigeration system (ARS) driven by low-quality waste heat from the CCPP. A process model integrating the CCPP with the ARS and the TES has been developed to optimize the volume of the TES. A 500 MW CCPP with steam turbine net output of 170.9 MW was chosen to evaluate the application of this approach for a power plant to be located in southern New Mexico. This analysis showed that a tank volume of 4,500 m 3 will be required to maintain the air temperature at the inlet to the ACC at the design value of 20°C throughout the year. Simulations under ambient air temperatures up to 40°C indicated that the proposed system is capable of maintaining the rated net power output of the plant with minimal fluctuations. Simulations also showed that TES tank volume is most sensitive to the design air inlet temperature to the ACC - an increase of this temperature by 1°C can result in at least 25% reduction in the volume. © ASCE.","Absorption; Cooling; Energy storage; New Mexico; Powerplants","Absorption refrigeration system (ARS); Air-cooled condensers (ACCs); Combined-cycle power plants (CCPPs); New Mexico; Thermal energy storage system (TES); Absorption; Air conditioning; Computer simulation; Cooling; Energy storage; Refrigeration; Systems analysis; Thermal effects; Combined cycle power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746256534

Using the technique of multiple collision expansions we provide a first-principle analytical calculation of the time-dependent autocorrelation function for the wave packet in the high-energy diffraction regime, in which the particle's de Broglie wavelength, while being small compared to the size of the scatterers, is large enough to prevent the formation of geometric shadow over distances of the order of the particle's free flight path. The hard-disk or hard-sphere scattering system must be sufficiently dilute in order for this high-energy diffraction regime to be achievable. Apart from the overall exponential decay, the autocorrelation function exhibits a generally complicated sequence of relatively strong peaks corresponding to partial revivals of the wave packet. Both the exponential decay (or escape) rate and the revival peak structure are predominantly determined by the underlying classical dynamics. A relation between the escape rate, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the counterpart classical system, previously known for hard-disk billiards, is strengthened by generalization to three spatial dimensions.

However, the design and optimization of an integrated microfluidic device to detect and separate chemically similar molecules will require computational techniques capable of predicting the energy storage (or release) associated with conformational change. To this end we developed midlevel modeling approach for the prediction of macromolecular motion in a confinement channel using finite element analysis and stochastic methods. As a proof of concept, we investigated the mechanical behavior of a carbonic anhydrase molecule where the molecule was modeled as a beam network constructed by the backbone carbon atoms. Each pair of the adjacent atoms form an elastic beam that bears both axial and shear stresses. The molecular conformation and associated dynamic behavior of the reconstructed molecule were investigated via two protocols: (1) compression of the molecule under a pair of parallel plates; and (2) propagation of the molecule through a shrinking channel.

It has been shown previously that exergy storage and energy throughflow increase during stages of ecosystem growth and development. We hypothesis that network changes yielding the highest exergy storage and throughflow will have a selective advantage and would be more favorable to the overall system organization. This hypothesis could be used to explain the selective criterion for changes that occur in an ecological network. Here, we investigate which changes, in general, lead to these more favorable conditions. Model results demonstrate the following six rules regarding network effects on exergy and power: I. Increased input gives proportional increase of exergy and power; II. Additional links only affect power and exergy when they increase the overall network throughflow, thus the connection placement is important; III. Food chain prolongation has a positive effect on the power and exergy of the network; IV. Reduction of loss of exergy to the environment or as detritus (with a β value of 1 only) yields a higher power and exergy of the network; V. Faster cycling-detritus is decomposed faster or the transfer rates between two tropic levels are increased-implies higher power and exergy; and, VI. Input of additional exergy or energy recycling flows has bigger effect the earlier in the food chain the addition takes place. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The subpixel shifts (displacement) among the images are unknown due to the uncontrolled natural jitter of the imager. A correlation method is utilized to estimate subpixel shifts between each low-resolution aliased image with respect to a reference image. An error-energy reduction algorithm is derived to reconstruct the high-resolution alias-free output image. The main feature of this proposed error-energy reduction algorithm is that we treat the spatial samples from low-resolution images that possess unknown and irregular (uncontrolled) subpixel shifts as a set of constraints to populate an oversampled (sampled above the desired output bandwidth) processing array. The estimated subpixel locations of these samples and their values constitute a spatial domain constraint. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the alias-free image (or the sensor imposed bandwidth) is the criterion used as a spatial frequency domain constraint on the oversampled processing array.

Slowing the growth rate of the infesting larvae is a simple strategy that can decrease the amount of damage and decrease the frequency of pesticide intervention. The growth rates of Indian meal moths on different cereal products varies widely indicating product-related differences in nutrient availability for the insects. Nutrient availability depends upon both the amounts of nutrients available in the cereal product and upon physical characteristics of the product that restrict the assimilation of nutrients. The development of control strategies for protecting processed cereal products based upon nutrient availability requires a simple, palatable test diet of known composition. Wheat germ mixed with 30% glycerol (w/w) provides a suitable growth medium for the Indian meal moth whose nutrients have been largely identified and quantified.

An hypothesis is presented which argues that repeated acute or chronic psychologically stressful states may cause this inflammatory process. The mediators are the major stress hormones norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) and cortisol together with components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the proinflammatory cytokines (PIC), as well as free fatty acids (ffa), the latter as a result of lipolysis of neutral fat. NE/E commence this process by activation of NFκB in macrophages, visceral fat, and endothelial cells which induces the production of toll-like receptors which, when engaged, produce a cascade of inflammatory reactions comprising the acute phase response (APR) of the innate immune system (IIS). The inflammatory process is most marked in the visceral fat depot as well as the vasculature, and is involved in the metabolic events which culminate in the insulin resistance/metabolic syndromes (IRS/MS), the components of which precede and comprise the major risk factors for CVD and NIDDM. The visceral fat has both the proclivity and capacity to undergo inflammation. It contains a rich blood and nerve supply as well as proinflammatory molecules such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), leptin, and resistin, the adipocytokines, and acute phase proteins (APP) which are activated from adipocytes and/or macrophages by sympathetic signaling. The inflammation is linked to fat accumulation. Cortisol, IL-6, angiotensin II (angio II), the enzyme 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 and positive energy balance, the latter due to increased appetite induced by the major stress hormones, are factors which promote fat accumulation and are linked to obesity. There is also the capacity of the host to limit fat expansion. Sympathetic signaling induces TNF which stimulates the production of IL-6 and leptin from adipocytes; these molecules promote lipolysis and ffa fluxes from adipocytes. Moreover, catecholamines and certain PIC inhibit lipoprotein lipase, a fat synthesizing enzyme. The brain also participates in the regulation of fat cell mass; it is informed of fat depot mass by molecules such as leptin and ffa. Leptin stimulates corticotrophin releasing hormone in the brain which stimulates the SNS and HPA axes, i.e. the stress response. Also, ffa through portal signaling from the liver evoke a similar stress response which, like the response to psychologic stress, evokes an innate immune response (IIR), tending to limit fat expansion, which culminates in inflammatory cascades, the IRS-MS, obesity and disease if prolonged. Thus, the brain also has the capacity to limit fat expansion. A competition apparently exists between fat expansion and fat loss. In ""western"" cultures, with excessive food ingestion, obesity frequently results. The linkage of inflammation to fat metabolism is apparent since weight loss diminishes the concentration of inflammatory mediators. The linkage of stress to inflammation is all the more apparent since the efferent pathways from the brain in response to fat signals, which results in inflammation to decrease and limit fat cell mass, is the same as the response to psychologic stress, which strengthens the hypothesis presented herein. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Most mammalian tissues store glucose as glycogen, with the major depots located in muscle and liver. The French physiologist Claude Bernard first identified a starch-like substance in liver and muscle and coined the term glycogen, or ""sugar former,"" in the 1850s. During the 150 years since its identification, researchers in the field of glycogen metabolism have made numerous discoveries that are now recognized as significant milestones in biochemistry and cell signaling. Even so, more questions remain, and studies continue to demonstrate the complexity of the regulation of glycogen metabolism. Under classical definitions, the functions of glycogen seem clear: muscle glycogen is degraded to generate ATP during increased energy demand, whereas hepatic glycogen is broken down for release of glucose into the bloodstream to supply other tissues. However, recent findings demonstrate that the roles of glycogen metabolism in energy sensing, integration of metabolic pathways, and coordination of cellular responses to hormonal stimuli are far more complex.

XLαs is only expressed from the paternal allele, whereas Gsα is biallelically expressed in most tissues. XLαs knock-out mice (Gnasxlm+/p-) have poor suckling and perinatal lethality, implicating XLαs as critical for postnatal feeding. We have now examined the metabolic phenotype of adult Gnasxlm+/p- mice. Gnasxlm+/p- mice had reduced fat mass and lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, with increased food intake and metabolic rates. Gene expression profiling was consistent with increased lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. These changes likely result from increased sympathetic nervous system activity rather than adipose cell-autonomous effects, as we found that XLαs is not normally expressed in adult adipose tissue, and Gnasxlm+/p- mice had increased urinary norepinephrine levels but not increased metabolic responsiveness to a β3-adrenergic agonist. Gnasxlm+/p- mice were hypolipidemic and had increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The similar metabolic profile observed in some prior paternal Gnas knock-out models results from XLαs deficiency (or deficiency of the related alternative truncated protein XLN1).

The anharmonic vibrational wave functions of the initial and final states are expanded unambiguously by harmonic oscillator basis functions of normal coordinates of the respective electronic states. The anharmonic FC integrals are then obtained as linear combinations of harmonic counterparts, which can, in turn, be evaluated by established techniques taking account of the Duschinsky rotations, geometry displacements, and frequency changes. Alternatively, anharmonic wave functions of both states are expanded by basis functions of just one electronic state, permitting the FC integral to be evaluated directly by the Gauss-Hermite quadrature used in the VSCF and VCI steps [Bowman et al., Mol. Phys. 104, 33 (2006)]. These methods in conjunction with the VCI and coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] method have predicted the peak positions and intensities of the vibrational manifold in the X̃ 2B 1 photoelectron band of H 2O with quantitative accuracy. It has revealed that two weakly visible peaks are the result of intensity borrowing from nearby states through anharmonic couplings, an effect explained qualitatively by VSCF and quantitatively by VCI, but not by the harmonic approximation. The X̃ 2B 2 photoelectron band of H 2CO is less accurately reproduced by this method, likely because of the inability of CCSD(T)/ cc-pVTZ to describe the potential energy surface of open-shell H 2CO + with the same high accuracy as in H 2O +. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Anharmonic vibrationns; Franck Condon factors; Polyatomic molecules; Vibrational self consistent-field (VSCF); Electric energy storage; Harmonic analysis; Oscillators (electronic); Potential energy; Tensors; Waveform analysis; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745788568

Carbide derived carbons (CDC) produced by leaching metals from TiC and ZrC at temperatures from 600 to 1200 °C have highly tailorable microstructure and porosity, allowing them to serve as excellent model systems for porous carbons in general. BET SSA and average pore size increased with synthesis temperature and was 600-2000 m2 g-1 and 0.7-1.85 nm, respectively. Maximum specific capacitance in 1 M H2SO4 was found to occur at an intermediate synthesis temperature, 800 °C, for both ZrC and TiC derived carbons and was 190 and 150 F g-1, respectively. Volumetric capacitance for TiC and ZrC derived carbons was maximum at 140 and 110 F cm-3. These results contradict an oft-reported axiom that increasing pore size and SSA, all other things being held constant, increases specific capacitance. A correlation between specific capacitance and SSA of micropores (less than 2 nm in diameter) has been shown. As expected, increasing pore size was found to improve the frequency response. However, CDCs with similar pore size distributions but obtained from different starting materials showed noticeable differences in impedance behavior. This highlights the importance of not only the pore size and specific surface area measured using gas sorption techniques, but also the pore shape or tortuousity, which is non-trivial to characterize, on energy storage. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The CNS also directly regulates adipocyte metabolism, as we have shown here by examining central action of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. Chronic central ghrelin infusion resulted in increases in the glucose utilization rate of white and brown adipose tissue without affecting skeletal muscle. In white adipocytes, mRNA expression of various fat storage-promoting enzymes such as lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 was markedly increased, while that of the rate-limiting step in fat oxidation, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1α, was decreased. In brown adipocytes, central ghrelin infusion resulted in lowered expression of the thermogenesis-related mitochondrial uncoupling proteins 1 and 3. These ghrelin effects were dose dependent, occurred independently from ghrelin-induced hyperphagia, and seemed to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Additionally, the expression of some fat storage enzymes was decreased in ghrelin-deficient mice, which led us to conclude that central ghrelin is of physiological relevance in the control of cell metabolism in adipose tissue. These results unravel the existence of what we believe to be a new CNS-based neuroendocrine circuit regulating metabolic homeostasis of adipose tissue.",,"acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase alpha; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; acyl coenzyme A desaturase 1; appetite stimulant; carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1alpha; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; fatty acid synthase; ghrelin; lipoprotein lipase; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 3; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adrenergic system; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; brain; brown adipose tissue; cell metabolism; central nervous system; chronic drug administration; controlled study; dose response; drug effect; drug mechanism; energy balance; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glucose metabolism; glucose utilization; hormone action; hyperphagia; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; rat; skeletal muscle; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Brain; Carrier Proteins; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acid Synthetase Complex; Glucose; Homeostasis; Ion Channels; Lipoprotein Lipase; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mitochondrial Proteins; Neuropeptide Y; Peptide Hormones; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745834734

As part of the feasibility and conceptual-design analysis, a study has been made of the potential benefits of a hybrid power plant in which fuel cells comprise the prime mover and a battery or flywheel provides auxiliary power. The potential benefits of a hybrid power plant are: (i) enhancement of transient power and hence tractive effort; (ii) regenerative braking; (iii) reduction of capital cost. Generally, the tractive effort of a locomotive at low speed is limited by wheel adhesion and not by available power. Enhanced transient power is therefore unlikely to benefit a switcher locomotive, but could assist applications that require high acceleration, e.g. subway trains with all axles powered. In most cases, the value of regeneration in locomotives is minimal. For low-speed applications such as switchers, the available kinetic energy and the effectiveness of traction motors as generators are both minimal. For high-speed heavy applications such as freight, the ability of the auxiliary power device to absorb a significant portion of the available kinetic energy is low. Moreover, the hybrid power plant suffers a double efficiency penalty, namely, losses occur in both absorbing and then releasing energy from the auxiliary device, which result in a net storage efficiency of no more than 50% for present battery technology. Capital cost in some applications may be reduced. Based on an observed locomotive duty cycle, a cost model shows that a hybrid power plant for a switcher may indeed reduce capital cost. Offsetting this potential benefit are the increased complexity, weight and volume of the power plant, as well as 20-40% increased fuel consumption that results from lower efficiency. Based on this analysis, the consortium has decided to develop a pure fuel cell road-switcher locomotive, that is, not a hybrid. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper attempts to quantify certain aspects of this problem by using both Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and theoretical methods. The stress on a chip capacitor mounted on a printed circuit board is calculated by FEA considering variations in capacitor size, solder temperature, and fillet height. The most dramatic result from this analysis is the dramatic lowering of stress at a fillet height in the range of 0.030,"" followed by an increase in the stress as the fillet height increases. The underlying reasons for this will require more indepth study, but are most likely due to counteracting forces. The stress on a semiconductor die is shown theoretically to be functions of several variables, including die size, solder temperature, solder thickness, and the shear modulus of the solder. The initial processing of the die in terms of the cracks generated on the edges is shown to play an important role in the ultimate strength of the system.",,"Brazing; Capacitance; Capacitors; Ceramic capacitors; Dielectric devices; Dies; Electric conductivity; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electronic equipment manufacture; Energy storage; Finite element method; Molecular beam epitaxy; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit manufacture; Semiconducting organic compounds; Semiconductor materials; Welding; Capacitor size; Ceramic substrates; Chip capacitors; Die size; Finite element analysis; Functions of several variables; In-depth studies; Mechanical stressing; Shear modulus; Solder temperature; Temperature extremes; Ultimate strength; Stresses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949095737

The energy cycle consists of the net energy fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and the surface, the atmospheric energy storage rates over the global land and ocean, and the atmospheric energy transport between the land and ocean. The energy cycle was investigated using a multi-model ensemble for its centennial mean, climatological annual variation and long-term trend. Some distinctive features of the cycle were revealed: (1) the ocean-to-land atmospheric energy transport plays a key role in partitioning the global net TOA flux between the ocean and land, (2) the annual variation of the global net TOA flux is primarily attributed by the ocean surface flux, and (3) it is ascertained that the planetary energy imbalance on the long-term period is induced by the ocean's heat uptake.

These factors include the chemical composition of the inks and media, as well as the ambient environmental conditions - light, heat, humidity, and air quality - under which the prints are stored and/or displayed. In order to correlate the results of accelerated testing in the laboratory with what actually happens to a photographic print under long term, real world conditions, it is necessary to better understand the typical ambient environmental conditions under which the prints are being displayed and/or stored. In phase I of this study, light levels, spectral energy distributions, temperatures, and humidities were monitored for 6-12 months in eight homes in each of four cities around the world (Rochester, Los Angeles, London, and Melbourne). For phase II, eight homes in each of four additional cities (São Paulo, Shanghai, Atlanta, and Tokyo) were monitored for 10-12 months. A key finding of these studies is that ambient home display conditions are dominated by relatively low intensity, indirect, window-filtered daylight. The long term temperature and humidity levels averaged close to the commonly cited conditions of 23°C, 50% relative humidity, with the exception of Shanghai and São Paulo where somewhat higher levels were observed.

The goals of this study were to: (1) quantify in vivo power output and activity of the depressor mandibulae muscles that are responsible for ballistic mouth opening, which powers tongue projection; (2) quantify the elastic properties of the depressor mandibulae muscles and their series connective tissues using in situ muscle stimulation and force-lever studies; and (3) develop and test an elastic recoil model, based on the observed elastic properties of the depressor mandibulae muscles and series connective tissues, that accounts for displacement, velocity, acceleration and power output during ballistic mouth opening in toads. The results demonstrate that the depressor mandibulae muscles of toads are active for up to 250 ms prior to mouth opening. During this time, strains of up to 21.4% muscle resting length (ML) develop in the muscles and series connective tissues. At maximum isometric force, series connective tissues develop strains up to 14% ML, and the muscle itself develops strains up to 17.5% ML. When the mouth opens rapidly, the peak instantaneous power output of the depressor mandibulae muscles and series connective tissues can reach 9600 W kg-1. The results suggest that: (1) elastic recoil of muscle itself can contribute significantly to the power of ballistic movements; (2) strain in series elastic elements of the depressor mandibulae muscle is too large to be borne entirely by the cross bridges and the actin-myosin filament lattice; and (3) central nervous control of ballistic tongue projection in toads likely requires the specification of relatively few parameters.","Contractile properties; Depressor mandibulae; Elastic properties; Elastic recoil model; Load clamp; Load dependence; Parallel elastic component; Power output; Series elastic component; Toad","animal; article; biological model; elastic tissue; elasticity; electromyography; energy metabolism; histology; movement (physiology); muscle isometric contraction; physiology; predation; sarcomere; skeletal muscle; toad; transmission electron microscopy; ultrastructure; Animals; Bufonidae; Elastic Tissue; Elasticity; Electromyography; Energy Metabolism; Isometric Contraction; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Models, Biological; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Predatory Behavior; Sarcomeres; Anura",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747037788

Recent explorations into sub-threshold operation for logic show that minimum energy operation is possible in this region. These two trends suggest a meeting point for energy-constrained applications in which SRAM operates at sub-threshold voltages compatible with the logic. Since sub-threshold voltages leave less room for large static noise margin (SNM), a thorough understanding of the impact of various design decisions and other parameters becomes critical. This paper analyzes SNM for sub-threshold bitcells in a 65-nm process for its dependency on sizing, V DD, temperature, and local and global threshold variation. The V T variation has the greatest impact on SNM, so we provide a model that allows estimation of the SNM along the worst-case tail of the distribution. © 2006 IEEE.","Process variation; SRAM; Static noise margin; Sub-threshold; Sub-threshold memory; Voltage scaling","Process variation; Static noise margin; Sub-threshold; Sub-threshold memory; Voltage scaling; Data storage equipment; Electric potential; Energy utilization; Size determination; Thermal effects; Threshold voltage; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746369469

The characterization of mouse models of lipodystrophy, in which adipose tissue development and function are impaired, has shed new light on the mechanisms by which adipose tissue dysregulation may contribute to conditions such as insulin resistance, fatty liver, and β-cell toxicity. RECENT FINDINGS: Here we review recent findings from mouse models with genetic alterations leading to reduced adipose tissue mass. The metabolic consequences depend on the basis for the adipose tissue reduction, and we classify mouse models into three categories based on whether they confer (1) lipoatrophy accompanied by insulin resistance, (2) reduced adipose tissue storage associated with enhanced energy expenditure, or (3) both lipoatrophic and energetic effects. SUMMARY: Reductions in the capacity of adipose tissue to store triglycerides or to secrete adipokine hormones lead to altered lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. In contrast, depletion of fat stores by virtue of enhanced energy metabolism does not produce undesirable metabolic effects. However, enhanced energy metabolism cannot overcome the deleterious effects of impaired adipokine production, as revealed by studies of models with both lipoatrophic and energetic effects. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Adipokine; Energy expenditure; Glucose homeostasis; Inflammatory response; Insulin resistance; Lipodystrophy; Lipotoxicity; Transgenic mice","adipocytokine; adiponectin; cytokine; fk 506 binding protein; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; lipid; resistin; transforming growth factor beta; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipose tissue; cytokine production; disease association; drug mechanism; drug protein binding; drug targeting; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; experimental model; experimental mouse; fatty liver; glucose homeostasis; human; hyperglycemia; hypertriglyceridemia; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin blood level; insulin release; insulin resistance; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoatrophy; lipodystrophy; metabolic disorder; metabolic rate; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet disease; protein blood level; review; triacylglycerol blood level; wild type; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Lipodystrophy; Mice",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746253894

A solution is found by convolution of Green's function with the source function. The final result shows a significant difference in the behavior of the radiant energy density between the solution obtained for a distributed source and the diffusion approximation.

In this paper we introduce a new correlation filter design that can provide a user-specified response to in-plane scale distortion. The design is based on the Mellin radial harmonic (MRH) transform and incorporates multiple harmonics into the correlation filter for improved discrimination capability. Additionally, the filter design minimizes the average correlation energy in order to achieve sharp correlation peaks, and thus we refer to these filters as minimum average correlation energy Mellin radial harmonic (MACE-MRH) filters.

Because energy storage in the brain is limited, an uninterrupted supply of glucose and its rapid metabolism are essential for normal cognitive function. This study utilized an oral glucose load to examine hippocampal glucose metabolism in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) - a disease characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive function and glucose hypometabolism. Short echo time 1H MR spectra (20 ms) from the right hippocampus of 8 patients with probable AD, 14 healthy elderly and 14 healthy young adults were compared pre- and post-glucose loading. In contrast to the healthy adults, the AD patients exhibited significantly elevated hippocampal glucose concentrations post-glucose ingestion relative to baseline (P&lt;.01).

These inland low salinity waters are often deficient in key ions necessary for normal physiological function. In west Alabama, farmers normally remedy ionic deficiencies in the water profile through the addition of fertilizers containing K+ and Mg2+. It has been suggested that increasing phospholipids (lecithin) and cholesterol in excess of dietary requirement improve osmoregulatory capacity in Litopenaeus vannamei, thus leading to better survival and growth under low salinity conditions. Cholesterol is an essential sterol involved in the molting process in shrimp. Phospholipids are important in cholesterol transport, facilitate the storage of lipids in the hepatopancreas, an important energy reserve during the molting process and are an important component of cell membranes. In order to investigate the possibility of improving growth and survival under stressful (i.e. low K+ and Mg2+) rearing conditions, a series of lab and on-farm experiments were conducted. Two separate 35 day laboratory studies were conducted in reconstituted low salinity (4.0 ppt, low K+) waters. In both trials, five practical diets were formulated to contain 36% protein and 8% lipid, and supplemented with varying levels of cholesterol and lecithin. Three of these diets were utilized for an additional experiment carried out on-site at two different low salinity shrimp farms in west Alabama. Results from the lab trials indicated no significant differences in survival, growth, or percent weight gain among treatments. Survival, final weight, and percent weight gain ranged from 68% to 77%, 2.70-3.0 g, 415-471% in experiment 1, and 56-69%, 2.7-3.2 g, 1572-1913% in experiment 2. These results indicate that the shrimp were stressed in both experiments, and there were no apparent benefits to supplementing lecithin and cholesterol in excess of the dietary requirement. Two on farm trials were conducted in parallel using either a mediated water source (Farm 1) to produce low stress or waters. At farm 1, survival, final weight, percent weight gain, and FCR ranged from 93.8% to 98.8%, 4.48-5.23 g, 4273-4901%, and 1.79-2.06, respectively. At farm 2 shrimp had lower survival (37.5-47.5%), lower final weight (2.65-3.25 g), lower percent weight gain (2342-3088%), and higher FCRs (6.85-10.64). No benefits from lecithin and cholesterol supplementation in excess of the dietary requirement were observed when compared to the basal diet under any test conditions. Based on results of the present study, dietary supplementation of cholesterol and phospholipids in excess of the requirement is not warranted for L. vannamei reared in low salinity waters. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We focused concurrently on understanding seasonal and interannual variations of both the water fluxes to the atmosphere and water partitioned into surface runoff and groundwater infiltration, with special attention to the transitions from cold-dominated (snow, ice) to warm-dominated (rain, liquid soil moisture) hydrology. Results showed when compared with a suite of field observations IBIS simulated water and energy cycling at daily to interannual timescales with reasonable accuracy. Because of errors associated with field observations, the accuracy with which we simulated each component of the water balance is not easily quantified. By investigating the complete land surface water balance, however, we increased the likelihood that all components were being captured. The modeled monthly energy balance, annual water balance, and drainage rates were generally within 5-15% of the observed values. Modeled and observed soil temperatures generally differed by less than 3°C and had r2 values that were greater than 0.9. Soil moisture values were within 5-20%, and freeze and thaw timing was within a few days of observations. Modeled snow dynamics captured the observed snow arrival and departure (accumulation on the surface) within a few days of observations, but overestimated the average maximum depth by 86%. Because model formulations were subjected to varying soil conditions and water phases, this evaluation exercise enhanced our understanding of northern Wisconsin's water balance and increased model credibility for applications in seasonally cold climates.

In this study the ecosystem process model, BIOME-BGC, was adapted to represent these unique conditions in Arctic ecosystems by including a new water storage and evaporation routine that accounts for nonvascular vegetation and the effects of permafrost, adding ground heat flux as an input, and representing ground shading by dead vegetation. The new Arctic version and the original BIOME-BGC models are compared to observed ET from two eddy flux towers in Barrow, Alaska over four summer seasons (1999-2002). The two towers are located less than 1 km apart, yet represent contrasting moisture conditions. One is located in a drained thaw lake, marsh area, while the other is located in a drier, upland area characterized by mesic tundra. Results indicate that the original BIOME-BGC model substantially underestimated ET, while the Arctic version slightly overestimated ET at both sites. The new Arctic model version worked particularly well at the wet tower because the model was able to capture energy limitations better than water limitations. Errors in the simulation of snowmelt date led to errors in the ET estimates at both sites. Finally, the substantial differences in soil moisture led to substantially different ET rates between the sites that were difficult to simulate and indicates that soil moisture heterogeneity is a strong controller on ET in these ecosystems.

Here we report substantially increased hydrogen storage capacities of modified MOFs by using a simple technique that causes and facilitates hydrogen spillover. Thus, the storage of 4 wt % is achieved at room temperature and 100 atm for the modified IRMOF-8. The adsorption is reversible, and the rates are fast.

However, MEMS-based storage provides a limited amount of storage per device and is likely to be more expensive than magnetic disk. Systems designers will therefore need to make trade-offs to achieve well-balanced designs. We present an architecture in which MEMS devices are organized into MEMS storage enclosures with online spares. Such enclosures are proven to be highly reliable storage building bricks with no maintenance during their economic lifetimes. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using MEMS as another layer in the storage hierarchy, bridging the cost and performance gap between MEMS storage and disk. We show that using MEMS as a disk cache can significantly improve system performance and cost-performance ratio. © 2006 ACM.","Cost-performance; Economic lifetime; Hybrid storage devices; Maintenance strategies; MEMS-based storage; Storage enclosures","Cost-performance; Economic lifetime; Hybrid storage devices; Maintenance strategies; MEMS-based storage; Storage enclosures; Acoustic bulk wave devices; Computer architecture; Costs; Data storage equipment; Energy conservation; Magnetic storage; Microelectromechanical devices; Computer systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745268866

TRB3 promoted ACC ubiquitination through an association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase constitutive photomorphogenic protein 1 (COP1). Indeed, adipocytes deficient in TRB3 accumulated larger amounts of ACC protein than did wild-type cells.

Notably, because the formed product during NOx uptake, Ba(NO3)2, requires a lattice expansion from BaO, one can anticipate that significant structural rearrangements are possible during the storage/reduction processes. Associated with the small crystallite size of high-surface area γ-Al2O3, it is difficult to extract structural and morphological features of Ba(NO3)2 supported on γ-Al2O3 by any direct imaging method, including transmission electron microscopy. In this work, by choosing a model system of Ba(NO3)2 particles supported on single-crystal α-Al2O3, we have investigated the structural and morphological features of Ba(NO3)2 as well as the formation of BaO from Ba(NO3)2 during the thermal release of NOx, using ex-situ and in-situ TEM imaging, electron diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Wulff shape construction. We find that Ba(NO3)2 supported on α-Al2O3 possesses a platelet morphology, with the interface and facets being invariably the eight {111} planes. Formation of the platelet structure leads to an enlarged interface area between Ba(NO3)2 and α-Al 2O3, indicating that the interfacial energy is lower than the Ba(NO3)2 surface free energy. In fact, Wulff shape constructions indicate that the interfacial energy is ∼ 1/4 of the {111} surface free energy of Ba(NO3)2. The orientation relationship between Ba(NO3)2 and the α-Al 2O3 is α-Al2O3[0001]// Ba(NO3)2[111] and α-Al2O 3(1-210)//Ba-(NO3)2(110). Thus, the results clearly demonstrate dramatic morphology changes in these materials during NOx release processes. Such changes are expected to have significant consequences for the operation of the practical NOx storage/reduction catalyst technology. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Alumina; Catalysts; Crystalline materials; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Transmission electron microscopy; Crystallite size; Lattice expansion; NOx storage/reduction catalysts; Wulff shape construction; Barium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745700137

No molecular hydrogen is added to the process. Raman-active molecular hydrogen vibrations are apparent in samples at atmospheric conditions (300 K, 1 bar) for samples prepared 1 year previously and stored in ambient air. Hydrogen evolves slowly at room temperature and is accelerated upon sample heating, with a first increase in hydrogen evolution occurring at approximately 60 °C. Subsequent chemical modification leads to the observation of crystalline carbons, including nanocrystalline diamond surrounded by graphene ribbons, other sp2-sp3 transition regions, purely graphitic regions, and a previously unidentified crystalline carbon form surrounded by amorphous carbon.

Significant quantities of electrons result when halo ions are lost to beam tubes, generating gas which can be ionized and ion-induced electrons that can multiply and accumulate, causing degradation or loss of the ion beam. In order to understand the physical mechanisms of ion-induced electron production, experiments studied the impact of 50 to 400 keV K+ ions on stainless steel surfaces near grazing incidence, using the 500 kV ion source test stand (STS-500) at LLNL. The experimental electron yield scales with the electronic component (dEe/dx) of the stopping power and its angular dependence does not follow 1/cos (θ). A theoretical model is developed, using TRIM code to evaluate dEe/dx at several depths in the target, to estimate the electron yield, which is compared with the experimental results. The experiment extends the range of energy from previous works and the model reproduces the angular dependence and magnitude of the electron yield. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547648142

Redundancy has been proposed as a prerequisite for objectivity, the defining property of classical objects. We consider two ensembles of states for a model universe consisting of one system and many environments: the first consisting of arbitrary states, and the second consisting of ""singly branching"" states consistent with a simple decoherence model. Typical states from the random ensemble do not store information about the system redundantly, but information stored in branching states has a redundancy proportional to the environment's size. We compute the specific redundancy for a wide range of model universes, and fit the results to a simple first-principles theory. Our results show that the presence of redundancy divides information about the system into three parts: classical (redundant); purely quantum; and the borderline, undifferentiated or ""nonredundant,"" information. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,"Coherent light; Computational methods; Data storage equipment; Electron energy levels; Information science; Mathematical models; Decoherence models; Decoherence processes; Entanglement; Quantum information; Quantum theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745055574

We identified a neuronal pathway that participates in the cross talk between the liver and adipose tissue. By studying a mouse model, we showed that adenovirus-mediated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ2 in the liver induces acute hepatic steatosis while markedly decreasing peripheral adiposity. These changes were accompanied by increased energy expenditure and improved systemic insulin sensitivity. Hepatic vagotomy and selective afferent blockage of the hepatic vagus revealed that the effects on peripheral tissues involve the afferent vagal nerve. Furthermore, an antidiabetic thiazolidinedione, a PPARγ agonist, enhanced this pathway.

A contaminant release model was developed based on these experimental results and solid-phase characterization results presented elsewhere. Uranium release was determined to be controlled by two phases and occurred in three stages. In the first stage, U release is controlled by the solubility of čejkaite, which is suppressed by high concentrations of sodium released from the dissolution of NaNO3 in the residual sludges. Equilibrium solubility calculations indicate the U released during this stage will have a maximum concentration of 0.021 M. When all the NaNO3 has dissolved from the sludge, the solubility of the remaining čejkaite will increase to 0.28 M. After čejkaite has completely dissolved, the majority of the remaining U is in the form of poorly crystalline Na2U 2O7 [or clarkeite Na[(UO2)O(OH)](H 2O)0-1]. In contact with Hanford groundwater this phase is not stable, and becquerelite becomes the U solubility controlling phase, with a calculated equilibrium concentration of 1.2 × 10-4 M. For Tc, a significant fraction of its concentration in the residual sludge was determined to be relatively insoluble (20 wt % for C-203 and 80 wt % for C-204). Because of the low concentrations of Tc in these sludge materials, the characterization studies did not identify any discrete Tc solids phases. Release of the soluble fraction of Tc was found to occur concomitantly with NO 3-. It was postulated that a NaNO3-NaTcO 4 solid solution could be responsible for this behavior. The Tc release concentrations for the soluble fraction were estimated to be 2.4 × 10-6 M for C-203 and 2.7 × 10-5 M for C-204. Selective extraction results indicated that the recalcitrant fraction of Tc was associated with Fe oxides. Release of the recalcitrant fraction of Tc was assumed to be controlled by dissolution of Fe oxide in the form of ferrihydrite. Based on this assumption and measured values for the ratio of recalcitrant Tc to total Fe in each bulk sludge, the release concentration of the recalcitrant fraction of Tc was calculated to be 3.9 × 10-12 M for C-203 and 10.0 × 10-12 M for C-204. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Contaminant release model; Empirical solubility measurements; Selective extractions; Thermodynamic modeling; Concentration (process); Extraction; Iron oxides; Sewage sludge; Solubility; Uranium; Solid wastes; becquerelite; cejkaite; clarkeite; iron oxide; radioactive material; sodium nitrate; technetium 99m; unclassified drug; uranium; Concentration (process); Extraction; Iron oxides; Sewage sludge; Solid wastes; Solubility; Uranium; groundwater; leaching; sludge; sodium; thermodynamics; waste; article; extraction; leaching; model; radioactive waste disposal; radioactive waste storage; residual waste; solubility; tank; thermodynamics; United States; Radioactive Waste; Refuse Disposal; Sewage; Solubility; Technetium; Thermodynamics; Uranium; Washington; Water; Hanford; North America; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745176957

Čejkaite [Na 4(UO2)(CO3)3] was the dominant crystalline phase in the C-203 and C-204 sludges. This is one of the few occurrences of čejkaite reported in the literature and may be the first documented occurrence of this phase in radioactive wastes from DOE sites. Characterization of residual solids from water leach and selective extraction tests indicates that čejkaite has a high solubility and a rapid rate of dissolution in water at ambient temperature and that these sludges may also contain poorly crystalline Na2U2O7 [or clarkeite Na[(UO2)O(OH)](H2O)0-1] as well as nitratine (soda niter, NaNO3), goethite [α-FeO(OH)], and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3). Results of the SEM/EDS analyses indicate that the C-204 sludge also contains a solid that lacks crystalline form and is composed of Na, Al, P, O, and possibly C. Other identified solids include Fe oxides that often also contain Cr and Ni and occur as individual particles, coatings on particles, and botryoidal aggregates; a porous-looking material (or an aggregate of submicrometer particles) that typically contain Al, Cr, Fe, Na, Ni, Si, U, P, O, and C; Si oxide (probably quartz); and Na-Al silicate(s). The latter two solids probably represent minerals from the Hanford sediment, which were introduced into the tank during prior sampling campaigns or other tank operation activities. The surfaces of some Fe-oxide particles in residual solids from the water leach and selective extraction tests appear to have preferential dissolution cavities. If these Fe oxides contain contaminants of concern, then the release of these contaminants into infiltrating water would be limited by the dissolution rates of these Fe oxides, which in general have low to very low solubilities and slow dissolution rates at near neutral to basic pH values under oxic conditions. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Botryoidal aggregates; Dissolution rates; Hanford sediments; Residual solids; Dissolution; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Extraction; Leaching; Scanning electron microscopy; Sediments; Sewage sludge; X ray diffraction analysis; Solid wastes; aluminum; aluminum silicate; carbon; cejkaite; chromium; clarkeite; ferric hydroxide; ferric oxide; iron; iron oxide; nickel; nitratine; oxygen; phosphate; radioisotope; silicon; silicon dioxide; sodium; sodium nitrate; unclassified drug; uranium; Dissolution; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Extraction; Leaching; Scanning electron microscopy; Sediments; Sewage sludge; Solid wastes; X ray diffraction analysis; crystallinity; dissolution; extraction method; infiltration; metal; oxic conditions; radioactive waste; scanning electron microscopy; sediment; sludge; solid waste; X-ray diffraction; article; dissolution; leaching; radioactive waste disposal; radioactive waste storage; residual waste; roentgen spectroscopy; scanning electron microscopy; sediment; sludge; solid; synchrotron radiation; tank; United States; water contamination; X ray diffraction; X ray microdiffraction; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Models, Theoretical; Radioactive Pollutants; Radioactive Waste; Sewage; Solubility; Spectrum Analysis; Technetium; Thermodynamics; Uranium; Uranium Compounds; X-Ray Diffraction; Hanford; North America; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745129370

Using molecular orbitals we have analyzed the maximum number of H2 molecules that can be adsorbed as well as the nature of their bonding and orientation. The charge transfer from the H2 bonding orbital to the empty dxy and d x2 - y2 orbitals of Ti has been found to be singularly responsible for the observed binding of the hydrogen molecule. It is argued that early transition metals are better suited for optimal adsorption/desorption of hydrogen. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Gravimetric densities; Molecular orbitals; Organic molecules; Organometallic systems; Adsorption; Binding energy; Chemical bonds; Desorption; Gravimetric analysis; Hydrogen; Molecular orientation; Phase transitions; Titanium; Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745145459

The change in the viscoelastic material functions such as elastic storage modulus, G′, viscous loss modulus, G″ and complex dynamic viscosity, η* during the gelation process was evaluated accurately for the first time. The isothermal kinetics reaction was described using a phenomenological equation based on the Malkin and Kulichikhin model that was originally developed for predicting isothermal curing kinetics of thermosetting polymers from differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) data. The Malkin and Kulichikhin model was found to conform excellently well for the rheokinetics data presented here. The rate of the gelation process was found to be a second-order reaction regardless of the temperature and shear frequency, and to be in good agreement with literature data. The isothermal gelation kinetics was also analyzed using a standard isoconversional method that is based on replicated experimental data and model-free kinetics calculations. This isoconversional method evaluates an effective activation energy that is independent of the degree of conversion, indicating that the rate of gelation is controlled by a single step (homogeneous) process with no change in the fractal gel formation mechanism at different degree of conversions. The temperature dependence of the gelation rate constant was well described by an Arrhenius plot with an average apparent activation energy equal to 127 ± 2 kJ/mol, in reasonable agreement with the value obtained from the temperature dependence of gel time, t gel. The nonisothermal kinetics reaction rate was interpreted using the classical rate equation, the Arrhenius equation and the time-temperature relationships. A frequency-independent apparent activation energy was evaluated nonisothermally and found to be similar to that obtained from isothermal kinetics data. The high value of activation energy is thought to be due to the strong interaction between the PU-dispersed particles during the gelation process, making a significant contribution to the rate of structure formation. It is noteworthy that, in some respects, these results resemble those from other cross-linking polymer networks and gels measured by DSC, yet in very important ways the aqueous PUDs of the present study is quite unique. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"High deformation flows; Phenomenological equation; Shear frequency; Viscous loss modulus; Activation energy; Data reduction; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dispersions; Gelation; Isotherms; Polymers; Viscoelasticity; Polyurethanes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745791937

The mechanisms for magnetic energy storage are crucial in understanding how a field may possess enough free energy to overcome the Aly limit and open up. Previously, we have pointed out that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in the corona plays a significant role in storing magnetic energy. In this paper, we investigate another hydromagnetic consequence of magnetic-helicity accumulation. We propose a conjecture that there is an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity that a force-free field can contain. This is directly related to the hydromagnetic property that force-free fields in unbounded space have to be self-confining. Although a mathematical proof of this conjecture for any field configuration is formidable, its plausibility can be demonstrated with the properties of several families of power-law, axisymmetric force-free fields. We put forth mathematical evidence, as well as numerical, indicating that an upper bound on the magnetic helicity may exist for such fields. Thus, the accumulation of magnetic helicity in excess of this upper bound would initiate a nonequilibrium situation, resulting in a CME expulsion as a natural product of coronal evolution. © 2006.

All the data was obtained by a deformation calorimetry technique. Loading and unloading of samples were performed at room temperature with strain rate έ = 10 -2-10-4 sec-1 under uniaxial compression up to engineering strains of εdef = 40-50%. During straining all polymers accumulate an excess of the latent energy U(ε). Elastic fraction of the energy is released completely at sample unloading and only residual Ures(ε) energy is conserved in samples. The latent energy U res(ε) grows up to εdef =20-25% and levels off then. Shapes of the Ures(ε) curves are the same (S-shape) for all polymers. However, the saturation level is different for each polymer. The ratio U(ε)/W(ε) was also measured. It was found that at strains εdef &lt; % (εy - strain at the yield point) U(ε)/W(ε) ≈ 100%. I.e. all W is stored by sample in a form of U. The ratio decreases up to 60-30% for different polymers at higher strains. Release of the residual energy Ures (DSC measurements) and strain εres (thermally stimulated strain recovery technique) was measured for deformed and unloaded samples at heating. It was found that about 85-90% of Ures stored by samples is released in glassy state of polymers (below Tg). The Ures is related to a small fraction of εres, only to 7-10%. The rest of Ures and εres are recovered at the softening (devitrification) interval, around Tg. Computer modeling (molecular dynamics) of an isothermal shear deformation was performed for 2-dimentional two component atomic glass containing 500 Lennard-Jones particles of two different diameters. It was found that localized deformation events are of anelastic nature. The εan appears at early deformation stage in a form of localized shear events (transformations). Such events are nucleated in a sample and merged and united at later deformation stages, when concentration of the events becomes high enough. Finally, merged transformations form kind of shear band crossing entire sample. On the basis of experimental data and computer modeling the deformation mechanism for glassy polymers is proposed. The first stage of the process is the nucleation of ""the carriers of non-elastic strain"", anelastic shear transformations (ASTs). All these ASTs are energetically excited. The concentration of the ASTs is responsible for the amount of U res(ε) stored by a sample. It is suggested that such nucleation is the rate-controlling step in non-elastic deformation of any non-covalent glass. Saturation of the stored energy is defined by the reaching the steady state regime in carrier's concentration. In this regime the rates of nucleation and termination (decrease of the stored local energy by AST) of carriers becomes equal. The termination proceeds spontaneously and easy (fast). The decrease of local energy of ASTs follows by local uncoiling of chains and by an appearance of new, extended chain conformers. However, such uncoiling is not the rate-controlling step for entire deformation process. Suggested mechanism very well describes all existing experimental facts. Deformation mechanisms for glasses seriously differ from that operating in rubbers and crystals.",,"Deformation; Glass; Polyesters; Shear deformation; Thermotropic liquid crystals; Glassy polymers; Room temperature; Thermotropic aromatic polyesters; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745048282

Of the ones investigated here, the highest gravimetric total storage of hydrogen (ca. 2 wt% at P = 22 MPa and 303 K) was observed for the OMC replica of the cubic Im3̄m material which was characterized by the largest lattice parameter and internal pore radius of the carbon sphere (a = 9.98 nm and Rint ≈ 3.0 nm). However, the corresponding volumetric density of hydrogen did not exceed 17 kg H2/m3. The highest excess storage was observed for a threshold value given approximately by a ≈ 7.98 nm and Rint ≈ 2.4 nm. Above this value, the excess storage and volumetric density of hydrogen did not change. The adsorption was dominated by the bulk storage, with the adsorbent serving as a tank whose storage properties were governed by the available space for hydrogen molecules (bulk storage) and not by physical adsorption (i.e. densification of the supercritical fluid on the walls of the porous material). The calculated average value for hydrogen adsorption in internal spaces was twice as high as in the internal spaces of the spherical cavities, i.e. in the lattice parameter range of the Im3̄m OMC replicas that were studied experimentally at 303 K.

In this paper, new trends in power electronics for the integration of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generators are presented.

Properties of this nuclide are promising for its potential application as a relatively safe power source characterized by high density of accumulated energy. Metal natHf samples were activated in the Dubna IBR-2 reactor at positions corresponding to different neutron fluxes. Samples were bare or shielded by Cd and B4C layers. The gamma activity of the samples was analyzed with Ge gamma spectrometers during a two-year period following their irradiation. In the presence of dominant activation products 175Hf and 181Hf, the high-spin isomers multiscripts(Hf, prescripts(), mml:none(), 178 m2) and multiscripts(Hf, prescripts(), mml:none(), 179 m2) were also detected despite relatively low levels. The isomer-to-ground state ratios and cross-sections were determined from the measured yields. For multiscripts(Hf, prescripts(), mml:none(), 178 m2), the cross-section for burnup (destruction) by neutron capture after its production was also estimated, clarifying the results from earlier experiments. In the context of suggestions for use of multiscripts(Hf, prescripts(), mml:none(), 178 m2) for applications, the results confirm that large-scale production of this isomer by reactor irradiations is not feasible. In contrast, the efficiency of production of multiscripts(Hf, prescripts(), mml:none(), 179 m2) is much higher and an amount of about 1016 atoms may be produced in standard reactor irradiations. For multiscripts(Hf, prescripts(), mml:none(), 178 m2), more productive methods are known, in particular fast neutron irradiations at En ≥ 14 MeV and spallation reactions at intermediate energies.

A new magnetic field measurement system, based on the use of digital signal processors (DSP) and Analog to Digital (A/D) converters, was developed and prototyped at Fermilab. This system uses Pentek 6102 16 bit A/D converters and the Pentek 4288 DSP board with the SHARC ADSP-2106 family digital signal processor. It was designed to acquire multiple channels of data with a wide dynamic range of input signals, which are typically generated by a rotating coil probe. Data acquisition is performed under a RTOS, whereas processing and visualization are performed under a host computer. Firmware code was developed for the DSP to perform fast continuous readout of the A/D FIFO memory and integration over specified intervals, synchronized to the probe's rotation in the magnetic field. C, C++ and Java code was written to control the data acquisition devices and to process a continuous stream of data.

The coil size will have a direct impact on the overall magnet cost and the stored energy will raise new questions on protection. To reduce coil size and minimize risk, the coil may have to be graded. Grading is achieved by splitting the coil into several layers with current densities that match the short sample field in each layer. Grading, especially at high fields, can be effective; however it will also significantly raise the stress. In this paper we report on the results of a study on the coil size and field relation to that of the stress and stored energy.

Through a training process using the AdaBoost algorithm 9 our system can efficiently search for important features in a large set of features, as indicated by the user, and effectively retrieve the images according to these features.

Can trapping be assured in saline formations where there is no history of hydrocarbon accumulation? The Frio experiment in Texas was undertaken to provide answers to these questions. One thousand six hundred metric tons of CO2 were injected into the Frio Formation, which underlies large areas of the United States Gulf Coast. Reservoir characterization and numerical modeling were used to design the experiment, as well as to interpret the results through history matching. Closely spaced measurements in space and time were collected to observe the evolution of immiscible and dissolved CO2 during and after injection. The high-permeability, steeply dipping sandstone allowed updip flow of supercritical. CO2 as a result of the density contrast with formation brine and absence of a local structural trap. The front of the CO2 plume moved more quickly than had been mode led. By the end of the 10-day injection, however, the plume geometry in the plane of the observation and injection wells had thickened to a distribution similar to the modeled distribution. As expected, CO2 dissolved rapidly into brine, causing pH to fall and calcite and metals to be dissolved.

DNA was successfully extracted from manure samples by utilizing the Whatman FTA® card technology, which allows for simple processing and storage of samples at room temperature. The FTA® cards were washed and subjected to a Chelex-100 incubation to remove any remaining polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors and to elute the DNA from the FTA® card. This isolated DNA was then subjected to direct real time fluorescent PCR analysis. Detection of MAP DNA from bovine fecal samples spiked with known concentrations of viable MAP cells was obtained. The detection limits of the assay was consistently found to be between 102 and 104 colony forming units [CFU]/g, with some samples containing as low as 10 CFU/g, yielding positive assay results.

Obesity of Il18-/- mice resulted from accumulation of fat tissue based on increased food intake. Il18-/- mice also had hyperinsulinemia, consistent with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance was secondary to obesity induced by increased food intake and occurred at the liver level as well as at the muscle and fat-tissue level. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the hepatic insulin resistance in the Il18-/- mice involved an enhanced expression of genes associated with gluconeogenesis in the liver of Il18 -/- mice, resulting from defective phosphorylation of STAT3. Recombinant IL-18 (rIL-18) administered intracerebrally inhibited food intake. In addition, rIL-18 reversed hyperglycemia in Il18-/- mice through activation of STAT3 phosphorylation. These findings indicate a new role of IL-18 in the homeostasis of energy intake and insulin sensitivity. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"cucurbitacin glycoside; glucose; insulin; interleukin 18; interleukin 18 binding protein; interleukin 18 receptor; recombinant interleukin 18; recombinant leptin; STAT3 protein; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; caloric intake; controlled study; drug effect; food intake; gene expression; gene overexpression; genetic association; gluconeogenesis; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hyperphagia; inhibition kinetics; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; knockout mouse; lipid storage; liver function; liver level; molecular dynamics; mouse; muscle level; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; tissue level; transgenic mouse; treatment outcome; Animals; Body Weight; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Glycoproteins; Homeostasis; Hyperphagia; Insulin Resistance; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Interleukin-18; Interleukin-18 Receptor alpha Subunit; Liver; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Obesity; Receptors, Interleukin; Receptors, Interleukin-18; Recombinant Proteins; STAT3 Transcription Factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745009509

Consequently, it is not yet possible to reconcile the extreme differences of opinion which have lingered on for years concerning the nature of this disorder, as well as its origin and even the most basic aspects of its histopathological classification. It does not even have a recognized name: in fact, the term 'cellulitis' is used in scientific English to indicate a spreading gangrenous infection of the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The other terms used from time to time [panniculitis, lipodystrophy, edematofibrosclerotic panniculitis (EFP), liposclerosis, lipoedema, etc.] have quite different morphological and pathogenetic connotations in general. Over the last few decades, three major conflicting theories have emerged in relation to the ethiopathogenesis of cellulite. These indicate, respectively, the following causes: 1. Oedema caused by excessive hydrophilia of the intercellular matrix. 2. A homeostatic alteration on a regional microcirculatory level; this pathogenetic theory is summarized in a synthetic and self-explanatory denomination: EFP. 3. A peculiar anatomical conformation of the subcutaneous tissue of women, different from male morphology. These theories must all now be updated in the light of recent advances on the sophisticated and composite physiopathology of the adipose organ - which acts not only as a control device which regulates the systematic equilibrium of energy and modulates the food intake and the metabolism of other tissue substrate through a multiple glandular secretion of hormones and parahormones. © 2006 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.","Cellulite; Ipodermis; Subcutaneous adipose tissue","cellulose; adipose tissue; cellulitis; edema; energy balance; energy expenditure; food intake; histopathology; homeostasis; hormone release; human; lipid storage; lipidosis; lipodystrophy; medical literature; medical research; microcirculation; morphology; panniculitis; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; review; subcutaneous tissue",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744960657

We show that when willingness to accept a public bad exceeds the willingness to pay, the net benefit is unambiguously lower when the property right supports the status quo institutional structure. Thus, Kaldor-Hicks efficiency tests tend to favor public programs and mitigation over the status quo even when mitigation negatively affects another group. To illustrate the result, we develop social-cost estimates for moving nuclear waste from current temporary-storage facilities to a permanent central repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, USA. For a representative city with a population of 226,195, the present value of the external cost of shipping waste is $1.42 billion when those living near temporary nuclear-waste storage facilities are assigned the property right to ""health and safety."" That number swells to $5.95 billion when those living near the transport route are assigned the property right. Thus, property-right assignment affects the efficient level of nuclear-waste, and thus nuclear energy, produced. © Springer 2006.","Coase theorem; Nuclear-waste storage; Nuclear-waste transport; Public bads; WTA and WTP","Cost benefit analysis; Nuclear energy; Project management; Public policy; Waste management; Coase theorem; Nuclear-waste storage; Public bads; WTA and WTP; Radioactive waste transportation; mitigation; property rights; radioactive waste; social characteristics; Nevada; North America; United States; Yucca Mountain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744956482

We have developed a rodent paradigm that models the process of regain after weight loss, and we have employed both prospective and cross-sectional analyses to characterize the compensatory adaptations to weight reduction that may contribute to the propensity to regain lost weight. Obese rats were fed an energy-restricted (50-60% kcal) low-fat diet that reduced body weight by 14%. This reduced weight was maintained for up to 16 wk with limited provisions of the low-fat diet. Intake restriction was then removed, and the rats were followed for 56 days as they relapsed to the obese state. Prolonged weight reduction was accompanied by 1) a persistent energy gap resulting from an increased drive to eat and a reduced expenditure of energy, 2) a higher caloric efficiency of regain that may be linked with suppressed lipid utilization early in the relapse process, 3) preferential lipid accumulation in adipose tissue accompanied by adipocyte hyperplasia, and 4) humoral adiposity signals that underestimate the level of peripheral adiposity and likely influence the neural pathways controlling energy balance. Taken together, long-term weight reduction in this rodent paradigm is accompanied by a number of interrelated compensatory adjustments in the periphery that work together to promote rapid and efficient weight regain. These metabolic adjustments to weight reduction are discussed in the context of a homeostatic feedback system that controls body weight.

A non-woven, polypropylene-based cation-exchange textile was prepared using UV-induced graft polymerization. Urease was covalently immobilized onto the cation-exchange textile using three different coupling agents: N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-cyclohexyl-N′-(b-[N-methylmorpholino]ethyl)carbodiimide p-toluenesulfonate (CMC), and glutaraldehyde (GA). The immobilized biocatalyst was characterized by means of FT-IR spectrometry, SEM micrographs, dependence of the enzyme activity on pH and temperature, and according to the kinetic constants of the free and immobilized ureases. The biotextile prepared with EDC in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide performs best. The optimum pH was 7.2 for the free urease and 7.6 for the immobilized ureases. The reactivity was maximal at 45 °C for free urease, 50°C for biotextiles prepared using EDC or CMC, and 55°C for biotextiles prepared with GA. The activation energy for the immobilized ureases was 4.73-5.67 kcal mol-1, which is somewhat higher than 4.3 kcal mol-1 for free urease. The urea conversion for a continuous-flow immobilized urease reactor is nearly as good as a continuously stirred tank reactor having a much longer residence time, suggesting that the packed bed reactor had sufficient diffusive mixing and residence time to reach nearly optimal results. Urease immobilized on a biotextile using EDC has good storage and operational stability. © 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.","Cation-exchange textile; Covalent bond; Immobilized urease; Ion-exchange textile; Urea hydrolysis","Activation energy; Biocatalysts; Bioreactors; Graft copolymers; Hydrolysis; Ion exchange; Packed beds; Polymerization; Polypropylenes; Textiles; Cation-exchange textile; Continuous-flow immobilized urease reactor; Covalent bond; Ion-exchange textiles; Urease immobilization; Nitrogen removal; 1 (3 dimethylaminopropyl) 3 ethylcarbodiimide; glutaraldehyde; polypropylene; urea; urease; Activation energy; Biocatalysts; Bioreactors; Graft copolymers; Hydrolysis; Ion exchange; Nitrogen removal; Packed beds; Polymerization; Polypropylenes; Textiles; article; biocatalyst; continuous flow reactor; continuous stirred tank reactor; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme immobilization; Fourier transform mass spectrometry; hydrolysis kinetics; packed bed reactor; pH; polymerization; scanning electron microscopy; temperature dependence; textile; waste component removal; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744798758

Some authors have speculated that the equine interosseus contains muscle fibers at birth only to undergo loss of these fibers through postnatal ontogeny. We describe the muscle fibers in eight interosseus specimens from adult horses. These fibers were studied histochemically using myosin ATPase studies and immunocytochemically using several antibodies directed against type I and type II myosin heavy chain antibodies. We determined that 95% of the fibers were type I, presumed slow-twitch fibers. All fibers exhibited normal morphological appearance in terms of fiber diameter and cross-sectional area, suggesting that the muscles are undergoing normal cycles of recruitment. SDS-PAGE studies of myosin heavy chain isoforms were consistent with these observations of primarily slow-twitch muscle. Fibers were determined to be ∼800 μm long when studied using nitric acid digestion protocols. Short fiber length combined with high pinnation angles suggest that the interosseus muscle is able to generate large amounts of force but can produce little work (measured as pulling the distal tendon proximally).

Considering the economics of existing electric utility rate structures, there is little incentive to increase HTFC ramping capability beyond 1 kWs-1 (0.4% s-1). However, in order to ease concerns about grid instabilities from utility companies and increase market adoption, HTFC systems will have to increase their ramping abilities, and will likely have to incorporate electrical energy storage (EES). Because batteries have low power densities and limited lifetimes in highly cyclic applications, ultra capacitors may be the EES medium of choice. The current analyses show that, because ultra capacitors have a very low energy storage density, their integration with HTFC systems may not be feasible unless the fuel cell has a ramp rate approaching 10 kWs-1 (4% s-1) when using a worst-case design analysis. This requirement for fast dynamic load response characteristics can be reduced to 1 kWs-1 by utilizing high resolution demand data to properly size ultra capacitor systems and through demand management techniques that reduce load volatility. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a novel idea of using program counters to predict I/O activities in the operating system. It presents a complete design of Program-Counter Access Predictor (PCAP) that dynamically learns the access patterns of applications and predicts when an I/O device can be shut down to save energy. PCAP uses path-based correlation to observe a particular sequence of program counters leading to each idle period and predicts future occurrences of that idle period. PCAP differs from previously proposed shutdown predictors in its ability to: 1) correlate I/O operations to particular behavior of the applications and users, 2) carry prediction information across multiple executions of the applications, and 3) attain higher energy savings while incurring lower mispredictions. We perform an extensive evaluation study of PCAP using a detailed trace-driven simulation and an actual Linux implementation. Our results show that PCAP achieves lower average mispredictions and higher energy savings than the simple timeout scheme and the state-of-the-art Learning Tree scheme. © 2006 IEEE.","Energy-aware systems; Hardware/software interfaces; Storage management","Energy-aware systems; Program-counter access predictor; Storage management; Computer simulation; Interfaces (computer); Signal filtering and prediction; Storage allocation (computer); Input output programs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646477108

Central to the performance of these devices is the extent of thermal mixing which occurs at the interface between the hot and cold fluid volumes as one or the other is displaced from the vessel. Useful volume fraction, a parameter reflecting the temperature limited usefulness of the stored fluid, and internal entropy generation are used to characterize the extent of thermodynamic losses in time and their variation with flow rates ranging from well-stratified to highly-mixed conditions. The transition to highly-mixed behavior is critically important since it limits the achievable energy discharge rates. Distinct trends in the variation of cumulative performance with Reynolds number indicate this transition occurs at Froude numbers of approximately one and lead to identification of a gravity-dominated and an inertia-dominated regime. In the gravity-dominated regime, the useful volume fraction increases linearly with time after an initial adjustment period and the turbulent diffusivity affects the variation of entropy generation only at the edges of the relatively distinct thermocline. Within the thermocline, the turbulent kinetic energy is completely damped by gravity. However, in the inertia-dominated or highly-mixed regime, the useful volume fraction starts to drop in the later stages of the filling process and appreciable entropy generation levels are distributed across a relatively wide thermocline with turbulent diffusivity playing a significant role throughout. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Heat storage capacity is directly related to the mass of the building envelope surrounding this space and particularly that of high-mass, homogeneous earthen or cementitious material. A thermal storage cycle is created by the time-lag effect if sufficient mass is available. A similar strategy applied to the lunar and/or Martian regolith would provide a surface structure with micrometeorite and radiation protection, thermal insulation, and natural supplemental heat energy that would significantly reduce the energy requirements met by mechanical equipment. HEAT2 is an energy simulation program that solves heat transfer problems using the partial differential heat conduction equation in two dimensions with the method of explicit finite differences. HEAT2 simulation data suggests that, although thermal mass is most suitable for climates where desired indoor temperatures fall within a large daily external temperature gradient, the heat storage cycle is least effective at the annual extremes occurring in midwinter and in midsummer. A more moderate climate will allow the heat storage cycle to modulate between positive and negative heat flows which are then shifted to align with peak load conditions, reducing energy demand. Also, diurnal and seasonal temperature gradients can initiate a sequence of phase transitions in the soil's moisture content affecting the overall conductivity. This study will present a more accurate explanation of the heat transfer processes occurring in soils of varying compositions when thermal properties are altered by transient climatic conditions. © 2006 ASCE.","Granular materials; Heat transfer; Porosity; Soil structure; Thermal analysis; Thermal properties","Climatic conditions; Micrometeorite; Thermal mass; Thermal storage cycle; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Granular materials; Heat transfer; Porosity; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Structures (built objects)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646543689

Fitting the modified Froissart-Stora equation to the measured polarization data after crossing an rf-induced spin resonance, we found 10-20-fold deviations from the depolarizing resonance strength equations used for many years. The polarization was typically manipulated by linearly sweeping the frequency of an rf dipole or rf solenoid through an rf-induced spin resonance; spin-flip efficiencies of up to 99.9% were obtained. The Lorentz invariance of an rf dipole's transverse ∫dl and the weak energy dependence of its spin resonance strength E together imply that even a small rf dipole should allow efficient spin flipping in 100 GeV or even TeV storage rings; thus, it is important to understand these large deviations. Therefore, we recently studied the resonance strength deviations experimentally by varying the size and vertical betatron tune of a 2.1GeV/c polarized proton beam stored in COSY. We found no dependence of E on beam size, but we did find almost 100-fold enhancements when the rf spin resonance was near an intrinsic spin resonance. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547139620

Basaltic tephra erupted over the last 8 centuries and as late as in November 2004 from the Grímsvötn central volcano, which together with Laki are a part of a single volcanic system, is indistinguishable in δ18O from Laki glass. This suggests that all tap a homogeneous and long-lived low-δ18O magma reservoir. In contrast, we observe extreme oxygen isotope heterogeneity (2.2-5.2‰) in olivine and plagioclase contained within these lavas and tephra, and disequilibrium mineral-glass oxygen-isotope fractionations. Such low-δ18Oglass values, and extreme 3‰ range in δ18Oolivine have not been described in any other unaltered basalt. The energy constrained mass balance calculation involving oxygen isotopes and major element composition calls for an origin of the Laki-Grímsvötn quartz tholeiitic basaltic melts with δ18O = 3.1‰ by bulk digestion of low-δ18O hydrated basaltic crust with δ18O = - 4‰ to + 1‰, rather than magma mixing with ultra-low-δ18O silicic melt. The abundant Pleistocene hyaloclastites, which were altered by synglacial meltwaters, can serve as a likely assimilant material for the Grímsvötn magmas. The (226Ra /230Th) activity ratio in Laki lavas and 20th century Grímsvötn tephras is 13% in-excess of secular equilibrium, but products of the 20th century Grímsvötn eruptions have equilibrium (210Pb /226Ra). Modeling of oxygen isotope exchange between disequilibrium phenocrysts and magmas, and these short-lived U-series nuclides yields a coherent age for the Laki-Grímsvötn magma reservoir between 100 and 1000 yrs. We propose the existence of uniquely fingerprinted, low-δ18O, homogeneous, large volume, and long-lived basaltic reservoir beneath the Laki-Grímsvötn volcanic system that has been kept alive in its position above the center of the Icelandic mantle plume. Melt generation, crustal assimilation, magma storage and homogenization all took place in only a few thousands of years at most. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The valves are bilayer structures, made in shape of a flap hinged on one side to a valve seat, consisting of thin films of evaporated gold and electrochemically deposited polypyrrole (PPy). Drugs (dry or wet) were pre-stored in an array of these reservoirs and their release is accomplished by bending the bilayer flaps away from the substrate with a small applied bias. In vitro color dye release experiment has been conducted. Seventy-five percent less energy consumption was achieved with this bilayer polymer valve design to open a same size reservoir compared to metal-corrosion based valves. Complex release patterns such as multiple drug pulsatile release and continuous linear release have been successfully implemented through flexible control of valve actuation sequence. These valves can be actuated under closed-loop-control of sensors responding to a specific biological or environmental stimulus, leading to potential applications in advanced responsive drug delivery systems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Interaction of an electron beam with a femtosecond laser pulse copropagating through a wiggler modulates the electron energies within a short slice of the electron bunch with about the same duration of the laser pulse. The bunch develops a longitudinal density perturbation due to the dispersion of electron trajectories, and the resulting hole emits short pulses of temporally and spatially coherent terahertz pulses synchronized to the laser. We present measurements of the intensity and spectra of these pulses.

All measurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (MPI-K) in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also calculated these resonance strengths and energies using three independent, perturbative, state-of-the-art theoretical techniques: the multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) method, the multi-configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method, and the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). Overall reasonable agreement is found between our experimental results and these theoretical calculations. We have used our measurements to produce a Maxwellian-averaged DR rate coefficient for Fe XXIII. Our experimentally derived rate coefficient is estimated to be accurate to better that ≈20%. At temperatures where Fe XXIII is predicted to form in both photoionized and electron-ionized gas, we find mixed agreement between our experimental rate coefficient and previously published rate coefficients.

A tight link between sensing energy availability and managing energy acquisition and utilization constitutes a common feature among all organisms. While such a link was likely adaptive during prehistoric evolution, modern lifestyles may decouple perceived cues from actual energy availability so as to promote obesity in humans. A particular illegitimate signal is chronic stress, which may shift body phenotype to suit a more conservative state of energy management. In prehistoric times, such a response likely aided survival during periods of low resource availability. However, new sources of chronic stress have emerged that bear little relationship to contextual energy, which is generally abundant in the modern world. In addition, modern techniques of husbandry and agriculture can produce stress in the food chain, such that food itself can act as an illegitimate signal of chronic stress. Obese livestock and unusual fat profiles in farmed fish, meat, and eggs may reflect stress phenotypes. Consumers of stressed foods may sense those signals - a phenomenon known as xenohormesis - and assume the stressed phenotype. This maladaptive process may promote obesity by erroneously biasing hosts towards caloric accumulation in the context of energy abundance. Regional tissue accumulation of fat may indicate local tissue stress. Atherosclerosis may result from stress signals that induce sympathetic bias and regional fat accumulation in vessel adventitia. Medications such as neuroleptics and foods such as diet drinks may generate illegitimate signals by mimicking molecules used for energy management. Implications for the prevention and treatment of dysfunctions related to these derangements are discussed. New strategies for manufacturing biologics by manipulating stress conditions or controlling fatty acid attachments to proteins are envisioned. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The GRACE mission consists of two identical satellites flying on an almost polar orbit with an altitude of about 300-500 km and satelite-to-satellite ranging of about 220 km. Thanks to the payloads of space-borne GPS receivers, accelerometers and high-precision K-band satelite-to-satellite ranging mesurements, GRACE gravity models are expected to achieve more than one order of magnitude of improvement over previous models at spatial scales of a few hundred kilometers or larger. Recovery of surface mass re-distribution based on GRACE's time-varying gravity models is applied to studies in solid Earth geophysics, oceanography, climatology and geodesy. At secular time scales, GRACE is expected to provide valuable information on global ice changes, whose variations have profound in fluences on global climate, and in particular, on sea level changes. At seasonal time scales, GRACE is expected to reveal surface water changes with an accuracy of less than 1 cm, or ocean bottom pressure changes with an accuracy of less than 1 mbar (1 mbar = 102 Pa). These surface mass redistribution measurements would improve our understanding of the global and regional mass and energy cycles that are critical to human life. Using 15 GRACE monthly gravity models covering the period from April 2002 to December 2003, this study compares seasonal water storage changes recovered from GRACE data and hydrology models at global and regional scales, with particular focus on the Yangtze River basin of China. Annual amplitude of 3.4 cm of equivalent water height change is found for the Yangtze River basin with maximum in Spring and Autumn, agreeing with two state-of-the-art hydrology models. The differences between GRACE results and model predictions are less than 1-2 cm. We conclude that satellite gravimetry has huge potentials in monitering water storage changes in large river basins such as Yangtze. © Science in China Press 2006.","Earth gravity; GRACE; Water storage; Yangtze River basin","Catchments; Climatology; Geophysics; Gravitation; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Satellites; Sea level; Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE); Surface mass redistribution measurements; Water storage; Yangtze River basin; Surface waters; gravimetry; remote sensing; satellite data; seasonal variation; water storage; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750581660

Given the large uncertainties regarding the potential risks associated with this degree of global warming, it would be more prudent to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations at or below current levels which, in turn, would require more than 20-fold reduction (i.e., ≥95%) in per capita carbon emissions in industrialized nations within the next 50-100 years. Using the Kaya equation as a conceptual framework, this paper examines whether CO 2 mitigation approaches such as energy efficiency improvements, carbon sequestration, and the development of carbon-free energy sources would be sufficient to bring about the required reduction in per capita carbon emissions without creating unforeseen negative impacts elsewhere. In terms of energy efficiency, large improvements (≥5-fold) are in principle possible through aggressive investments in R&amp;D and the removal of market imperfections such as corporate subsidies. However, energy efficiency improvements per se will not result in a reduction in carbon emissions if, as predicted by the IPCC, the size of the global economy expands 12-26-fold by 2100. Terrestrial carbon sequestration via reforestation and improved agricultural soil management has many environmental advantages, but has only limited CO2 mitigation potential because the global terrestrial carbon sink (ca. 200 Gt C) is small relative to the size of fossil fuel deposits (≥4000 Gt C). By contrast, very large amounts of CO2 can potentially be removed from the atmosphere via sequestration in geologic formations and oceans, but carbon storage is not permanent and is likely to create many unpredictable environmental consequences. Renewable energy can in theory provide large amounts of carbon-free power. However, biomass and hydroelectric energy can only be marginally expanded, and large-scale solar energy installations (i.e., wind, photovoltaics, and direct thermal) are likely to have significant negative environmental impacts. Expansion of nuclear energy is highly unlikely due to concerns over reactor safety, radioactive waste management, weapons proliferation, and cost. In view of the serious limitations and liabilities of many proposed CO2 mitigation approaches, it appears that there remain only few no-regrets options such as drastic energy efficiency improvements, extensive terrestrial carbon sequestration, and cautious expansion of renewable energy generation. These promising CO2 mitigation technologies have the potential to bring about the required 20-fold reduction in per capita carbon emission only if population and economic growth are halted without delay. Therefore, addressing the problem of global warming requires not only technological research and development but also a reexamination of core values that equate material consumption and economic growth with happiness and well- being. © Springer 2006.","Carbon emission reductions; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Economic growth; Energy efficiency; Kaya equation; Nuclear energy; Population stabilization; Renewable energy","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; conceptual framework; economic growth; emission; fossil fuel; global economy; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mitigation; nuclear power; solar power; stabilization; Torreya nucifera",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746521755

Lipid content was substantially greater in the liver than in dorsal musculature of all three species. Two piscivores (Cichla temensis and Serrasalmus manueli) showed large, statistically significant seasonal fluctuations in liver lipid content. Liver lipid content increased during high water, through the falling water, and into the early dry season for both piscivores. Seasonal variation in dorsal muscle lipid content was large and statistically significant for C. temensis, but was small and non-significant for S. manueli. Cichla temensis appeared to 'finance' costs associated with reproduction by accumulating lipids during the falling-water period when migratory prey allowed the species to subsidize their energetic dynamics. Semaprochilodus kneri, a migratory algivore and detritivore, showed no significant seasonal variation in dorsal muscle lipid content and minimally significant seasonal variation in liver lipid content. Statistically significant effects of lipid content on δ13C was observed when tissue lipid content varied by &gt;12%, while biological interpretation of food web statistics based on δ13C values appears robust to minor variations in lipid content. Nonetheless, when lipid content varied by larger amounts (e.g. &gt;35% for C. temensis and S. manueli liver tissue) lipids appeared to have a large potential effect on δ13C and food web statistics calculated from such measurements may have been biased. Surprisingly, even large variation in tissue lipid content did not affect δ15N. © 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Energy storage; Flood pulse; Lipid extraction; Migration; Neotropics; Stable isotope ratios","fish; hydrology; life history; muscle; seasonal variation; tropical region; Cichla temensis; Semaprochilodus kneri; Serrasalmus manueli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745422102

In particular, the time course of cell morphology, of bead motion and of cortical tension were determined. Here, we introduce a number of mechanistic models for phagocytosis and test their validity by comparing the experimental data with finite element computations for multiple bead sizes. We find that the optimal models involve two key mechanical interactions: a repulsion or pressure between cytoskeleton and free membrane that drives protrusion, and an attraction between cytoskeleton and membrane newly adherent to the bead that flattens the cell into a thin lamella. Other models such as cytoskeletal expansion or swelling appear to be ruled out as main drivers of phagocytosis because of the characteristics of bead motion during engulfment. We finally show that the protrusive force necessary for the engulfment of large beads points towards storage of strain energy in the cytoskeleton over a large distance from the leading edge (∼0.5 μm), and that the flattening force can plausibly be generated by the known concentrations of unconventional myosins at the leading edge.","Cell mechanics; Cell motility; Finite element simulations; Lamella; Membrane tension","antibody; Fc receptor; myosin; Fc receptor; article; cell adhesion; cell energy; cell interaction; cell membrane transport; cell motion; cell size; cell strain; cell structure; cell swelling; cell wall; controlled study; cytoskeleton; experimental model; finite element analysis; force; lamellar body; mathematical computing; molecular mechanics; neutrophil; phagocytosis; pressure; priority journal; quantitative analysis; validity; animal; cell membrane; cell shape; cytology; cytoskeleton; human; mathematics; mechanical stress; metabolism; particle size; physiology; surface property; theoretical model; Animals; Antibodies; Cell Membrane; Cell Shape; Cytoskeleton; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Theoretical; Neutrophils; Particle Size; Phagocytosis; Receptors, IgG; Stress, Mechanical; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744531652

Although energy storage is more efficient in capacitors than in inductors, due to some inherent advantages of current-source converter topology, and at the first place, the absence of a dc-link electrolytic capacitor, a current-source drive system made with a considerably reduced dc link inductor could be better low-cost solution with improved reliability, lifetime, and transient response than conventional drive.

Bunn Rd., Prosser, WA 99350, United States","The advantages of variable power control for heat-balance sap flow gauges are evident under high flow rates (e.g., &gt;600 g h-1) where high rates of power must be applied. Under the very high flow rates (e.g., 1500-4000 g h-1) of mature grapevines (Vitis spp.), we evaluated two algorithms to control the power applied to heat-balance sap flow gauges, and thus the temperature difference (ΔT) above and below gauge heaters: (i) a proportional-derivative (PD) algorithm and (ii) an open-loop controller following the theoretical diurnal course of irradiance. The PD algorithm was tuned for expected maximum flow rates and could keep ΔT within 0.1°C of its daytime (0800-1800 h) target value. Over 21 d, mean daytime ΔT was 1.32 ± 0.001°C (s.e.m.) for an 18-gauge system. The algorithm was unstable early in the morning and in the evening as rates of sap flow were below those for which the algorithm had been tuned. In the open-loop algorithm, power output was programmed to change according to a sine curve tied to daylength. In well-watered vines, the power curve mimicked actual sap flow patterns. As flow rates varied it accommodated the changing dead time of the system, which is the delay or time required before any change in ΔT occurs. Daytime ΔT varied sinusoidally with a typical amplitude of 0.5 to 1.0°C. The coefficient of variation in daytime ΔT appeared to be higher (16-26%) under the open-loop algorithm than under the PD algorithm (5-13%). Under weekly cycles of deficit irrigation, the variance in daytime ΔT increased with the number of days after irrigation, suggesting that the open-loop algorithm might best be applied when the stem energy balance includes an estimate of heat storage. © American Society of Agronomy.",,"Flow of fluids; Gages; Heat storage; Irrigation; Power control; Diurnal course; Open-loop controller; Sap flow gauges; Temperature difference; Algorithms; Algorithms; Fluid Flow; Irrigation; Vitis; Vitis sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646794933

Cyclic voltammetry and FET characterization techniques were used to study the properties of these hybrid devices. The redox-active molecules have tunable charge states, which are quantized at room temperature and can be accessed at relatively low voltages. The discrete molecular states were manifested in the drain current and threshold voltage characteristics of the device, confirming the presence of distinct energy levels within the molecules at room temperature. This study demonstrates the modulation of Si-MOSFETs' drain currents via redox-active molecular monolayers. The single-electron functionality provided by the redox-active molecules is ultimately scalable to molecular dimensions, and this approach can be extended to nanoscale field-effect devices including those based on carbon nanotubes. The molecular states coupled with CMOS devices can be utilized for low-voltage, multiple-state memory and logic applications and can extend the impact of silicon-based technologies. © 2006 IEEE.","Charge storage molecules; Hybrid silicon/molecular devices; Molecular electronics; Monolayer; MOSFETs; Redox-active molecules","Charge storage molecules; Hybrid silicon/molecular devices; Molecular electronics; Redox-active molecules; Room temperature; CMOS integrated circuits; Cyclic voltammetry; Molecular physics; Monolayers; Nanotechnology; Silicon; MOSFET devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646751092

From the photosphere to the corona, the observations give us information about the motion of magnetic elements (photospheric magnetograms), the location of flares (e.g., Ha, EUV or soft X-ray brightenings), and the type of events (Ha blueshift events). Assuming that the evolution of the coronal magnetic field above an active region can be described by successive equilibria, we follow in time the magnetic changes of the 3D nonlinear force-free (nlff) fields reconstructed from a time series of photospheric vector magnetograms. We apply this method to AR 8210 observed on May 1, 1998 between 17:00 UT and 21:40UT. We identify two types of horizontal photospheric motions that can drive an eruption: a clockwise rotation of the sunspot, and a fast motion of an emerging polarity. The reconstructed nlff coronal fields give us a scenario of the confined flares observed in AR 8210: the slow sunspot rotation enables the occurence of flare by a reconnection process close to a separatrix surface whereas the fast motion is associated with small-scale reconnections but no detectable flaring activity. We also study the injection rates of magnetic energy, Poynting flux and relative magnetic helicity through the photosphere and into the corona. The injection of magnetic energy by transverse photospheric motions is found to be correlated with the storage of energy in the corona and then the release by flaring activity. The magnetic helicity derived from the magnetic field and the vector potential of the nlff configuration is computed in the coronal volume. The magnetic helicity evolution shows that AR 8210 is dominated by the mutual helicity between the closed and potential fields and not by the self helicity of the closed field which characterizes the twist of confined flux bundles. We conclude that for AR 8210 the complex topology is a more important factor than the twist in the eruption process. © ESO 2006.","Sun: corona; Sun: evolution; Sun: flares; Sun: magnetic fields","Magnetic fields; Mathematical models; Rotation; Solar radiation; Sun; Three dimensional; Vectors; Sun: corona; Sun: evolution; Sun: flares; Sun: magnetic fields; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646500359

In contrast, little is known about the ability of germinating seeds to synthesize TAG. We report that castor cotyledons are capable of TAG synthesis. The rate of incorporation of ricinoleic acid into TAG reached a peak at 7 d after imbibition (DAI) (1.14 nmol/h/mg) and decreased rapidly thereafter, but was sustained at 20 DAI in cotyledons and true leaves. The castor DAG acyltransferase (RcDGAT) mRNA and protein were expressed throughout seed germination at levels considerably enhanced from that in the dormant seed, thus indicating new expression. Significant degradation of the RcDGAT protein was observed after 7 DAI. The DGAT activity was found to be predominantly a function of the level of the intact RcDGAT protein, with the rate of TAG synthesis decreasing as degradation of the RcDGAT protein proceeded. A possible mechanism for the degradation of the RcDGAT protein is discussed. The induction of DGAT mRNA and protein, the capacity for TAG synthesis in vitro and in tissue slices, and the differing TAG composition of dormant seed TAG vs. cotyledonary TAG provide strong circumstantial evidence for active TAG synthesis by cotyledons. However, we have not yet determined the physiological significance of this capability.

We hypothesized that it is possible to simultaneously determine whole body carbon (energy) balance and the dynamics of lipids and proteins in specific tissues in vivo. Growing C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet were injected with a bolus of ""doubly labeled"" water (i.e., 2H2O and H2 18O). The rate of CO2 production was determined from the difference between the elimination rates of 2H and 18O from body water. The rates of synthesis and degradation of triglycerides extracted from epididymal fat pads and of proteins extracted from heart muscle were determined by mathematically modeling the 2H labeling of triglyceride-bound glycerol and protein-bound alanine, respectively. We found that mice were in positive carbon balance (∼20% retention per day) and accumulated lipid in epididymal fat pads (∼9 μmol triglyceride accumulated per day). This is consistent with the fact that mice were studied during a period of growth. Modeling the 2H labeling of triglycerides revealed a substantial rate of lipid breakdown during this anabolic state (equivalent to ∼25% of the newly synthesized triglyceride). We found equal rates of protein synthesis and breakdown in heart muscle (∼10% of the pool per day), consistent with the fact that the heart muscle mass did not change. In total, these findings demonstrate a novel application of the doubly labeled water method. Utilization of this approach, especially in unique rodent models, should facilitate studies aimed at quantifying the efficacy of interventions that modulate whole body carbon balance and lipid flux while in parallel determining their impact on (cardiac) muscle protein turnover. Last, the simplicity of administering doubly labeled water and collecting samples allows this method to be used in virtually any laboratory setting.

We determined whether chronic treatment with the PPAR-α activator fenofibrate affects myocardial I/R injury in pigs. Domestic farm pigs were assigned to treatment with fenofibrate 50 mg·kg -1·day-1 orally or no drug treatment, and either a low-fat (4% by weight) or a high-fat (20% by weight) diet. After 4 wk, 66 pigs underwent 90 min low-flow regional myocardial ischemia and 120 min reperfusion under anesthetized open-chest conditions, resulting in myocardial stunning. The high-fat group received an infusion of triglyceride emulsion and heparin during this terminal experiment to maintain elevated arterial free fatty acid (FFA) levels. An additional 21 pigs underwent 60 min no-flow ischemia and 180 min reperfusion, resulting in myocardial infarction. Plasma concentration of fenofibric acid was similar to the EC50 for activation of PPAR-α in vitro and to maximal concentrations achieved in clinical use. Myocardial expression of PPAR-α mRNA was prominent but unaffected by fenofibrate treatment. Fenofibrate increased expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)-I mRNA in liver and decreased arterial FFA and lactate concentrations (each P &lt; 0.01). However, fenofibrate did not affect myocardial CPT-I expression, substrate uptake, lipid accumulation, or contractile function during low-flow I/R in either the low- or high-fat group, nor did it affect myocardial infarct size. Despite expression of PPAR-α in porcine myocardium and effects of fenofibrate on systemic metabolism, treatment with this PPAR-α activator does not alter myocardial metabolic or contractile responses to I/R in pigs.","Cytokine; Energy metabolism; Fibric acid derivative; Nuclear receptor; Ventricular function","creatine; creatine palmitoyltransferase; fenofibrate; gamma interferon; heparin; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipid emulsion; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; transferase; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; drug blood level; female; growth, development and aging; heart arrhythmia; heart hemodynamics; heart infarction size; heart left ventricle contractility; heart muscle blood flow; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle reperfusion; heart protection; in vitro study; lipid diet; lipid storage; low fat diet; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; stunned heart muscle; Animals; Antilipemic Agents; Cardiotonic Agents; Cytokines; Female; Male; Myocardial Contraction; PPAR alpha; PPAR gamma; Procetofen; Reperfusion Injury; Swine; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646412849

For the latter, two different types of plates are used, smooth plates and grooved plates; the latter are used to improve sample-plate contact. In addition, oscillatory compression rheology is used; however, machine compliance prevents accurate measurements at high conversions. A fractional conversion is defined based on the maximum storage modulus achieved at a given temperature, and is compared to the fractional conversion calculated from enthalpy measurements. As expected, the rates of reaction derived from these fractional conversions are very different for calorimetry and rheometry.

In rats fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, we compared the effects of 2 ARBs, telmisartan and valsartan, on body weight, food intake, energy expenditure, fat accumulation, fat cell size, and hepatic triglyceride levels. Telmisartan, but not valsartan, promoted increases in caloric expenditure and protected against dietary-induced weight gain. In the telmisartan-treated rats, absolute food intake, but not food intake adjusted for body weight, was lower than in valsartan-treated rats or controls. Telmisartan reduced the accumulation of visceral fat and decreased adipocyte size to a much greater extent than valsartan and was also associated with a significant reduction in hepatic triglyceride levels. Moreover, telmisartan, but not valsartan, increased the expression of both nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded genes in skeletal muscle known to play important roles in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Thus, in addition to a class effect of ARBs in modulating adipocyte size, these findings raise the possibility that certain molecules, like telmisartan, may have a particularly strong impact on fat cell volume and fat accumulation, as well as distinctive effects on energy metabolism, that may help protect against dietary-induced visceral obesity and weight gain. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.","Angiotensin II; Hypertension; Liver; Obesity; Receptors","angiotensin receptor antagonist; mitochondrial protein; nuclear protein; telmisartan; triacylglycerol; valsartan; angiotensin receptor antagonist; benzimidazole derivative; benzoic acid derivative; drug derivative; telmisartan; tetrazole derivative; valine; valsartan; adipocyte; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body fat distribution; carbohydrate diet; cell size; cell volume; controlled study; drug effect; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; fatty liver; food intake; gene expression; genetic code; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipid storage; liver protection; male; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; skeletal muscle; weight change; weight gain; adipose tissue; animal; cell count; energy metabolism; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrion; pathology; pathophysiology; Sprague Dawley rat; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Animals; Benzimidazoles; Benzoates; Cell Count; Cell Size; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Liver; Gene Expression; Male; Mitochondria; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tetrazoles; Valine; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646148948

Traditionally, hexagonal sampling grids have been shunned due to their inability to preserve the high-frequency components of blue-noise dither patterns at gray-levels near one-half, but as will be shown, only through the introduction of diagonal correlations between dots can even rectangular sampling grids preserve these frequencies. And by allowing the sampling grid to constrain the placement of dots, a particular algorithm may introduce visual artifacts just as disturbing as excess energy below the principal frequency. If, instead, the algorithm maintains radial symmetry by introducing a minimum degree of clustering, then that algorithm can maintain its grid defiance illusion fundamental to the spirit of the blue-noise model. As such, this paper shows that hexagonal grids are preferrable because they can support gray-levels near one-half with less required clustering of minority pixels and a higher principal frequency. Along with a thorough Fourier analysis of blue-noise dither patterns on both rectangular and hexagonal sampling grids, this paper also demonstrates the construction of a blue-noise dither array for hexagonal grids.

We present a summary of new features of the ZFITTER program version 6.42 compared to version 6.21. The most important additions are: (i) some higher-order QED corrections to fermion pair production, (ii) electroweak one-loop corrections to atomic parity violation, (iii) electroweak one-loop corrections to over(ν, ̄)e νe production, (iv) electroweak two-loop corrections to the W boson mass and the effective weak mixing angle.

No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:185 824. Distribution format:tar.gz. Does the new version supersede the previous version:Yes. Nature of the physical problem: Fermion pair production is an important reaction for precision tests of the Standard Model, at LEP/SLC and future linear colliders at higher energies. For this purpose, QED, electroweak and QCD radiative corrections have to be calculated with high precision, including higher order effects. Multi parameter fits used to extract model parameters from experimental measurements require a program of sufficient flexibility and high calculational speed. ZFITTER combines these two aspects by employing analytical integrations of matrix elements and at most one-dimensional numerical integration, as well as a variety of flags defining the physics content used. The calculated predictions are typically at the per mille precision level, sometimes better. Method of solution: Numerical integration of analytical formulae. Reasons for new version:Addition of substantial material into the code: covering of more reactions; more accurate description of existing reactions. Summary of revisions:New parts for predicting atomic parity violation and for neutrino pair production; more accurate higher order QED corrections for fermion pair production; two-loop corrections to the predictions of W mass and of the weak mixing angle. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: Fermion pair production is described below the top quark pair production threshold. Photonic corrections are taken into account with simple cuts on photon energy, or the energies and acollinearity of the two fermions, and one fermion production angle. The treatment of Bhabha scattering is less advanced. Typical running time: On a Pentium IV PC installation (2.8 GHz) using g77 under Linux 2.4.21, approximately 23 s are needed to run the standard test of subroutine ZFTEST. This result is for a default/recommended setting of the input parameters, with all corrections in the Standard Model switched on. ZFTEST computes 12 cross-sections and cross-section asymmetries for 8 energies with 5 interfaces, i.e. about 360 cross-sections in 23 s. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

CCS technology is available today and is expected to become an increasingly affordable CO2 abatement alternative. Whereas the rapidly growing scientific literature on CCS as well as experimental and commercial practice demonstrate the technological and economic feasibility of implementing this clean fossil fuel option on a large scale, relatively little attention has been paid so far to the risks and environmental externalities of geological storage of CO2. This paper assesses the effects of including CCS damage costs in a long-term energy scenario analysis for Europe. An external cost sensitivity analysis is performed with a bottom-up energy technology model that accounts not only for CCS technologies but also for their external costs. Our main conclusion is that in a business-as-usual scenario (i.e. without climate change intervention or externality internalisation), CCS technologies are likely to be deployed at least to some extent, mainly in the power generation sector, given the economic benefits of opportunities such as enhanced coal bed methane, oil and gas recovery. Under a strict climate (CO2 emissions) constraint, CCS technologies are deployed massively. With the simultaneous introduction of both CO2 and CCS taxation in the power sector, designed to internalise the external atmospheric and geological effects of CO2 emissions and storage, respectively, we find that CCS will only be developed if the climate change damage costs are at least of the order of 100 €/t CO2 or the CO2 storage damage costs not more than a few €/t CO2. When the internalised climate change damage costs are as high as 67 €/t CO2, the expensive application of CCS to biomass-fuelled power plants (with negative net CO2 emissions) proves the most effective CCS alternative to reduce CO2 emissions, rather than CCS applied to fossil-based power plants. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

FLD has the inherent propensity to progress toward the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is generally difficult to distinguish AFLD from NAFLD on morphological grounds alone despite the distinctions implied by these etiological designations. The indistinguishable spectrum of histological features of both AFLD and NAFLD suggests a possible convergence of pathogenetic mechanisms at some critical juncture that enables the progression of steatohepatitis toward cirrhosis and liver cancer. From a pathogenetic perspective, FLD may be considered a single disease with multiple etiologies. Excess energy consumption and reduced energy combustion appear to be critical events that culminate in lipid storage in the liver. Energy combustion in the liver is controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α-regulated mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation systems and the microsomal ω-oxidation system. PPAR-α, a receptor for peroxisome proliferators, functions as a sensor for fatty acids (lipid sensor), and ineffective PPAR-α sensing can lead to reduced energy burning resulting in hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. Delineation of the pathogenetic aspects of FLD is necessary for developing novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.

When modern out-of-order processors handle interrupts precisely, they typically begin by flushing the pipeline to make the CPU available to execute handler instructions. In doing so, the CPU ends up flushing many instructions that have been brought in to the reorder buffer. In particular, these instructions may have reached a very deep stage in the pipeline-representing significant work that is wasted. In addition, an overhead of several cycles and wastage of energy (per exception detected) can be expected in refetching and reexecuting the instructions flushed. This paper concentrates on improving the performance of precisely handling software managed translation look-aside buffer (TLB) interrupts, one of the most frequently occurring interrupts. The paper presents a novel method of in-lining the interrupt handler within the reorder buffer. Since the first level interrupt-handlers of TLBs are usually small, they could potentially fit in the reorder buffer along with the user-level code already there. In doing so, the instructions that would otherwise be flushed from the pipe need not be refetched and reexecuted. Additionally, it allows for instructions independent of the exceptional instruction to continue to execute in parallel with the handler code. By in-lining the TLB interrupt handler, this provides lock-up free TLBs. This paper proposes the prepend and append schemes of in-lining the interrupt handler into the available reorder buffer space. The two schemes are implemented on a performance model of the Alpha 21264 processor built by Alpha designers at the Palo Alto Design Center (PADC), California. We compare the overhead and performance impact of handling TLB interrupts by the traditional scheme, the append in-lined scheme, and the prepend in-lined scheme. For small, medium, and large memory footprints, the overhead is quantified by comparing the number and pipeline state of instructions flushed, the energy savings, and the performance improvements. We find that lock-up free TLBs reduce the overhead of refetching and reexecuting the instructions flushed by 30-95 percent, reduce the execution time by 5-25 percent, and also reduce the energy wasted by 30-90 percent. © 2006 IEEE.","Exception handlers; In-line interrupt; Lock-up free; Performance modeling; Precise interrupts; Reorder-buffer (ROB); Translation lookaside buffers (TLBs)","Data storage equipment; Mathematical models; Microprocessor chips; Pipeline processing systems; Central processing unit (CPU); In-line interrupt; Lock-up free; Performance modeling; Precise interrupts; Reorder-buffer (ROB); Translation look-aside buffer (TLB); Buffer storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645805012

The facility was used to fabricate HEU fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the SRS production reactors. The facility operated for more than 35 years. During this time thousands of uranium-aluminum alloy (U-Al) production reactor fuel tubes were produced. After the facility ceased operations in 1995, all of the easily accessible U-Al was removed from the building, and only residual amounts remained. The bulk of this residue was located in the equipment that generated and handled small U-Al particles and in the exhaust systems for this equipment (e.g., chip compactor, casting furnaces, log saw, lathes A &amp; B, cyclone separator, Freon™ cart, riser crusher, ..., etc). The D&amp;D project is likely to represent an important example for D&amp;D activities across SRS and across the Department of Energy weapons complex. The Savannah River National Laboratory was tasked to conduct holdup assays to quantify the amount of HEU on all components removed from the facility prior to placing in solid waste containers. The 235U holdup in any single component of process equipment must not exceed 50 g in order to meet the container limit. This limit was imposed to meet criticality requirements of the low level solid waste storage vaults. Thus, the holdup measurements were used as guidance to determine if further decontamination of equipment was needed to ensure that the quantity of 235U did not exceed the 50 g limit and to ensure that the waste met the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) of the solid waste storage vaults. Since HEU is an accountable nuclear material, the holdup assays and assays of recovered residue were also important for material control and accountability purposes. In summary, the results of the holdup assays were essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control &amp; Accountability, and to ensure that administrative criticality safety controls were not exceeded. This paper discusses the γ-ray assay measurements conducted and the modeling of the acquired data to obtain measured holdup in process equipment, exhaust components, and fixed geometry scrap cans. It also presents development work required to model new acquisition configurations and to adapt available instrumentation to perform the assays. © 2006 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,"aluminum; neptunium; nuclear fuel; uranium; uranium 235; article; bioassay; energy; equipment; furnace; gamma radiation; geometry; instrumentation; solid waste; waste management; weapon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33344470291

On the basis of the present and previously reported results, we propose that moderate (&lt;∼873 K) temperature calcinations result in a single monolayer (ML) 'coating' of BaO on the alumina surface. At high Ba loading in excess of that required for a full monolayer 'coating' (&gt;8 wt.% BaO), small (∼5 nm) particles of 'bulk' BaO are present on top of the one ML BaO/Al2O3 surface. We did not observe any detectable morphological changes upon higher temperature thermal treatment of 2 and 8 wt.% BaO/Al2O3 samples, while dramatic changes occurred for the 20 wt.% sample. In this latter case, the transformations included BaAl2O4 formation at the expense of the bulk BaO phase. In particular, we conclude that the surface (ML) BaO phase is quite stable against thermal treatment, while the bulk phase provides the source of Ba for BaAl2O4 formation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We performed practically relevant NOx storage/regeneration cycling (56 s/4 s) experiments over a monolithic Pt/K/Al2O3 catalyst in a bench-flow reactor and resolved multiple transient reactions and exotherms. Carbon monoxide was the reductant and intra-channel speciation and temperature measurements were instrumental in resolving CO chemistry. Gas-phase O2 reacted with CO very fast over the entire regeneration time, and was depleted at the catalyst front. The resulting exotherm was significant and dissipated slowly over time raising the subsequent storage temperature considerably. NOx release/reduction by CO was also vigorous and primary NOx removal occurred at early regeneration times. The NOx-attributable exotherm was smaller than that of the O2-CO reaction, but extended deeper into the front portion of catalyst due to axially distributed NOx storage. Secondary NOx release/reduction occurred after the primary and produced NH3 as the main product. Hydrogen appeared when and where both the O2 consumption and major NOx release/reduction were near complete. We proposed that H2 produced via water-gas shift (WGS) reaction had little impact on O2 depletion and primary NOx release/reduction under the conditions studied. Further study is necessary to assess the impact of WGS reaction on secondary NOx release/reduction. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

As a first step in correlating the effects of crystallinity in the soft segment phase to the hard segment phase, we chose to examine the morphology and mechanical behavior of polyurethanes containing polyether soft blocks with varying tendencies to crystallize and phase segregate and the evolution of the microstructure with deformation. A series of high molecular weight polyurethanes containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (1000 and 4600 g/mol) and poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) (1900 g/mol) soft segments with varying hard segment content were synthesized using a two-step solution polymerization method. The presence of soft segment crystallinity (PEO 1000 g/mol) was shown to improve the storage modulus of the segmented polyurethanes below the Tm of the soft block and to enhance toughness compared to the PEO-PPO-PEO soft segment polyurethanes. We postulate that this enhancement in mechanical behavior is the result of crystalline soft regions that serve as an additional load-bearing component during deformation. Morphological characterization also revealed that the microstructure of the segmented polyurethanes shifts from soft segment continuous to interconnected and/or hard domain continuous with increasing hard segment size, resulting in diminished ultimate elongation, but enhanced initial moduli and tensile strengths. Tuning the soft segment phase crystallinity may ultimately lead to tougher polyurethane fibers. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The RAPS system consists of modules designed to provide 150 kWh per day of utility grade ac electricity over a 24 h period. Each module contains a diesel generator, battery bank using heavy-duty 2 V VRLA gelled electrolyte batteries, a battery charger, a photovoltaic array and an inverter. Despite early difficulties, the system in the first village has now commenced operation and the promise of RAPS schemes as a means for providing sustainable remote electrification appears to be bright. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Y. 10021, United States","Tests were conducted to determine whether weight gain or nutrient intake measures during the first week of exposure to a macronutrient diet can accurately predict an animal's long-term propensity towards obesity. In multiple groups of normal-weight Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 35-70/group), daily weight gain during the first 5 days on a high-fat diet (45-60% fat) was found to be strongly, positively correlated (r = + 0.71 to r = + 0.82) with accumulated body fat in 4 dissected depots after 4-6 weeks on the diet. This measure consistently identified obesity-prone (OP) rats which, relative to the obesity-resistant (OR) rats, were only slightly heavier (+ 15 g, 4%) and hyperphagic (+ 9 kcal, 8%) after 5 days but markedly heavier (+ 70 g) with up to 2-fold greater fat mass after several weeks on the diet. Other dietary conditions and measures revealed weaker relationships to ultimate body fat accrual. The OP rats identified by their 5-day weight-gain score exhibited at this early stage clear disturbances characteristic of markedly obese rats. These included elevated leptin, insulin, triglycerides and glucose, along with increased lipoprotein lipase activity (LPL) in adipose tissue and galanin expression in the paraventricular nucleus. Most notable were significant reductions in muscle of LPL activity and ratio of β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase to citrate synthase activity, indicating a decline in lipid transport and capacity of muscle to metabolize lipids. By occurring early with initial weight gain, these hypothalamic and metabolic disturbances in OP rats, favoring fat storage in adipose tissue over fat oxidation in muscle, may have causal relationships to long-term accumulation of body fat. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The ability to 'bank' such samples for storage and restore or 'reanimate' them at a later time without causing damage to the structure and/or function becomes imperative. However, to date, such attempts have produced conflicting results. We here demonstrate for the first time that isolated rat brain mitochondria can be successfully cryopreserved and restored for later use. We added a well characterized cryoprotectant 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to purified rat cortical mitochondria and allowed them to cool at a uniform rate of ∼1°C/min and stored them at -80°C. Freshly isolated as well as reanimated brain mitochondria were analyzed for respiration. Structural integrity of cryopreserved mitochondria was also verified by electron microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane marker levels were assessed along with cytochrome c levels. Intact structure and function of the cryopreserved brain mitochondria observed allows us the opportunity to store mitochondria for longer periods of time as well as perform metabolic studies as needed. This will considerably expand the time-frame required for carrying out functional analysis in large comparative studies. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand,there is potential for enhancing system performance in terms ofcapacity and diversity. On the other hand, the presence of multiple transceivers at both ends hascreated additional cost in terms of hardware and energyconsumption. For coherent detection as well as to do optimizationsuch as water filling and beamforming, it is essential that theMIMO channel is known. However, due to the presence of multipletransceivers at both the transmitter and receiver, the channelestimation problem is more complicated and costly compared to aSISO system. Several solutions have been proposed to minimize thecomputational cost, and hence the energy spent in channelestimation of MIMO systems. We present a novel method ofminimizing the overall energy consumption. Unlike existingmethods, we consider the energy spent during the channelestimation phase which includes transmission of training symbols,storage of those symbols at the receiver, and also channelestimation at the receiver.

Nor do studies systematically explore a range of CO 2 capture efficiencies to identify the most cost-effective levels of CO 2 control and the key factors that affect such levels. An exploration of these issues is the focus of this paper. As part of the United States Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program, we have developed an integrated modeling framework (called IECM-cs) to evaluate the performance and cost of alternative CCS technologies and power systems in the context of plant-level multipollutant control requirements. This paper uses IECM-cs to identify the most cost-effective level of CO 2 control using currently available amine-based CO 2 capture technology for PC plants. Two general cases are of interest. First, we examine the effects of systematically increasing the CO 2 capture efficiency of an amine-based system for PC applications over a broad range. We report two measures of cost: (i) capital cost and (ii) cost-effectiveness (cost per tonne of CO 2 avoided) relative to similar plants without CCS. Second, we examine the cost-effectiveness of plant designs that partially bypass the amine capture unit so as to achieve low to moderate reductions of CO 2, but at lower overall cost. Results from these cases are compared to the conventional case of a capture unit treating the entire flue gas stream. In each case, we identify the most cost-effective strategies and the key factors that affect those results. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Capture systems; Carbon Sequestration Programmes; CCS technologies; Coal-fired power plants; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Flue gases; Power plants; Strategic planning; Gas absorption; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Flue gases; Gas absorption; Power plants; Strategic planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646252954

Unlike other books that deal with alternative sources of energy from a mechanical point of view, Integration of Alternative Sources of Energy takes an electrical engineering perspective. Moreover, the authors examine the full spectrum of alternative and renewable energy with the goal of developing viable methods of integrating energy sources and storage efficiently. Readers become thoroughly conversant with the principles, possibilities, and limits of alternative and renewable energy. The book begins with a general introduction and then reviews principles of thermodynamics. Next, the authors explore both common and up-and-coming alternative energy sources, including hydro, wind, solar, photovoltaic, thermosolar, fuel cells, and biomass. Following that are discussions of microturbines and induction generators, as well as a special chapter dedicated to energy storage systems. After setting forth the fundamentals, the authors focus on how to integrate the various energy sources for electrical power production. Discussions related to system operation, maintenance, and management, as well as standards for interconnection, are also set forth. Throughout the book, diagrams are provided to demonstrate the electrical operation of all the systems that are presented. In addition, extensive use of examples helps readers better grasp how integration of alternative energy sources can be accomplished. The final chapter gives readers the opportunity to learn about the HOMER Micropower Optimization Model. This computer model, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), assists in the design of micropower systems and facilitates comparisons of power generation techniques. Readers can download the software from the NREL Web site. This book is a must-read for engineers, consultants, regulators, and environmentalists involved in energy production and delivery, helping them evaluate alternative energy sources and integrate them into an efficient energy delivery system.

A dramatic increase of T c is predicted for 0.01 W ≤ J ≤ 10W. This should have immense technological impact in electric energy production, storage and transmission, as well as for medical electronics, microwave electronics, computer memory and information storage, separations technology and maglev, amongst others. The striking prediction to be confirmed by experiment is that the pairing order parameter Δ(k) is predicted to be p-wave, i.e., l = 1, S = 1, as compared to l = 2 and S = 1 for conventional HTS materials.

This article focuses on this basic problem, as it may relate to most catabolic disorders, and provides our current experience involving inherited diseases of mitochondrial fat oxidation, glycogen storage, and pyruvate metabolism using the anaplerotic compound triheptanoin. The observations have led to a realization that 'inter-organ' signalling and 'nutrient sensors' such as adenylate monophosphate mediated-protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appear to play a significant role in the intermediary metabolism of these diseases. Activated AMPK turns on catabolic pathways to augment ATP production while turning off synthetic pathways that consume ATP. Information is provided regarding the inter-organ requirements for more normal metabolic function during crisis and how anaplerotic therapy using triheptanoin, as a direct source of substrate to the CAC for energy production, appears to be a more successful approach to an improved quality of life for these patients. © SSIEM and Springer 2006.",,"4 aminobutyric acid; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; adenosine triphosphate; alanine; branched chain amino acid; glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; glutamine; heptanoic acid derivative; mammalian target of rapamycin; protein kinase; anaplerosis; article; catabolism; citric acid cycle; congestive heart failure; diet restriction; diet supplementation; diet therapy; disorders of carboxylic acid metabolism; drug efficacy; drug metabolism; drug potency; energy consumption; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; genetic disorder; glycogen storage disease; hepatomegaly; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; hypoglycemia; lysosome storage disease; metabolic balance; metabolic disorder; metabolic regulation; muscle weakness; nonhuman; outcome assessment; protein degradation; protein function; protein synthesis; pyruvate carboxylase deficiency; respiratory chain; rhabdomyolysis; signal transduction; treatment outcome; Animals; Citric Acid Cycle; Fatty Acids; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Heptanoates; Humans; Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Mitochondria, Liver; Oxidation-Reduction; Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency Disease; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745088995

The site is owned by a large international energy company and is operated by the northeast's largest supplier of natural gas. The owner, operator, consultants and contractors used effective communication, coordination and flexibility, combined with an aggressive project schedule to complete the project with minimal disturbance to the day-to-day operations of the LNG facility. This paper presents a case study of the coordination and teamwork required to design, permit and install the remedial systems on a 4.93 acre section of the upland portion of the site. Work is progressing to address ongoing environmental issues in the intertidal portion of the site. Installation of the remedial systems proved to be challenging because of heavily contaminated soils, the unknown location and contents of many historical pipes, and the presence of high-pressure gas distribution lines. In less than eight months, approximately 2000 linear feet of piping, 23 000 square yards of low permeability liner, 18 800 tons of gravel and 12 900 square yards of pavement were installed, along with many improvements to the facility's infrastructure. To date, no visual or olfactory evidence of contamination have been observed on the capped portions of the site. The on-site reuse of almost 90% of the excavated soils saved the responsible parties approximately $900,000 in soil disposal costs.",,"contaminated land; environmental issue; liquefied natural gas; pollutant transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744522027

However, energy consumption continues to remain a barrier challenge in many sensor network applications that require long lifetimes. Battery-operated sensor nodes have limited energy storage capability due to small form-factors, or operate in environments that rule out frequent energy replenishment, resulting in a mismatch between the available energy budget for system operation and the required energy budget to obtain desired lifetimes. This article surveys several techniques that show promise in addressing and alleviating this energy consumption challenge. In addition to describing recent advances in energy-aware platforms for information processing and communication protocols for sensor collaboration, the article also looks at emerging, hitherto largely unexplored techniques, such as the use of environmental energy harvesting and the optimization of the energy consumed during sensing. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Data processing; Network protocols; Sensors; Technology transfer; Wireless telecommunication systems; Academic research; Wireless sensor networks; Information use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646949477

The hindleg of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis is a good candidate for a passive, vertical leg spring because its vertically oriented joint axes of rotation limit the possibility of active movements and contributions of muscle properties. We oscillated passive legs while measuring force to determine the leg's dynamic, mechanical properties. The relative dimensionless stiffness of an individual cockroach leg was equal to that estimated for a single leg of a biped or quadruped. Leg resilience ranged from 60 to 75%, affording the possibility that the leg could function as a spring to store and return the mechanical energy required to lift and accelerate the center of mass. Because hysteresis was independent of oscillation frequency, we rejected the use of a Voigt model - a simple spring in parallel with a viscous damper. A hysteretic damping model fit the cockroach leg force-displacement data over a wide range of frequencies and displacement using just two parameters. Rather than simply acting as a spring to minimize energy, we hypothesize that legs must manage both energy storage and absorption for rapid running to be most effective.","Biomechanics; Blaberus discoidalis; Locomotion; Modeling","animal; article; biomechanics; cockroach; histology; limb; physiology; Animals; Biomechanics; Cockroaches; Extremities; Arthropoda; Blaberus discoidalis; Blattaria; Hexapoda; Insecta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646743644

One key component, precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P - ET), remains largely unmeasured due to the absence of observations of ET. Precipitation minus evapotranspiration describes the flux of water between the atmosphere and the earth's surface, and therefore provides important information regarding the interaction of the atmosphere with the land surface. In this paper, large-scale changes in continental water storage derived from satellite gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) project are combined with river discharge data to obtain estimates of areally averaged P - ET. After constructing an equation describing the large-scale terrestrial water balance reflecting the temporal sampling of GRACE water storage estimates, GRACE-derived P - ET estimates are compared to those obtained from a reanalysis dataset [NCEP/Department of Energy (DOE) reanalysis-2] and a land surface model driven with observation-based forcing [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)/Noah] for two large U.S. river basins. GRACE-derived P - ET compares quite favorably with the reanalysis-2 output, while P - ET from the Noah model shows significant differences. Because the uncertainties in the GRACE results can be computed rigorously, this comparison may be considered as a validation of the models. In addition to showing how GRACE P - ET estimates may be used to validate model output, the accuracy of GRACE estimates of both the seasonal cycle and the monthly averaged rate of P - ET is examined. Finally, the potential for estimating seasonal evapotranspiration is demonstrated by combining GRACE seasonal P - ET estimates with independent estimates of the seasonal cycle of precipitation. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); water budget; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646592276

The aim of this study was to delineate the mechanism of fenofibrate-mediated reductions in adiposity, improvements in insulin sensitivity, and lowering of triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) and to investigate if these favorable changes are related to the inhibition of lipid deposition in the aorta. To test this hypothesis we used male LDLr deficient mice that exhibit the clinical features of metabolic syndrome X when fed a high fat high cholesterol (HF) diet. LDLr deficient mice fed HF diet and simultaneously treated with fenofibrate (100 mg/kg body weight) prevented development of obesity, lowered serum triglycerides and cholesterol, improved insulin sensitivity, and prevented accumulation of lipids in the aorta. Lowering of circulating lipids occurred via down-regulation of lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and diacyl glycerol acyl transferase-2, concomitant with decreased liver TG and cholesterol, and TG output rate. Fenofibrate also suppressed liver apoCIII mRNA levels and markedly increased lipoprotein lipase mRNA levels, known to enhance serum TG catabolism. In addition, fenofibrate profoundly reduced epididymal fat and mesenteric fat mass to the levels seen in lean mice. The reductions in body weight were associated with elevation of hepatic uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) mRNA, a concomitant increase in the ketone body formation, and improved insulin sensitivity associated with tumor necrosis factor-α reductions and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase down-regulation. These results demonstrate that fenofibrate improves lipid abnormalities partly via inhibition of TG production and partly via clearance of TG-rich apoB particles by elevating LPL and reduced apoCIII. The prevention of obesity development occurred via energy expenditure. Fenofibrate-mediated hypolipidemic effects together with improved insulin sensitivity and loss of adiposity led to the reductions in the aortic lipid deposition by inhibiting early stages of atherosclerosis possibly via vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) modulation. These results suggest that potent PPAR-α activators may be useful in the treatment of syndrome X. © Springer Science+Business Media, B.V. 2006.","Atherosclerosis; Diabetes; Fenofibrate; LDL receptor knock out; Lipogenesis; Metabolic syndrome X; Obesity; PPAR; VCAM-1","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; apolipoprotein C3; cholesterol; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; fenofibrate; ketone body; ligand; lipoprotein lipase; low density lipoprotein receptor; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; uncoupling protein 2; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aorta; article; atherosclerosis; cholesterol blood level; cholesterol diet; clinical feature; controlled study; down regulation; energy expenditure; enzyme regulation; epididymis fat; gene control; human; human cell; hypothesis; insulin sensitivity; ketogenesis; lipid storage; male; mesentery; metabolic syndrome X; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; triacylglycerol blood level; weight reduction; Adiposity; Animals; Aorta; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Diet, Atherogenic; Energy Metabolism; Gluconeogenesis; Hypercholesterolemia; Hypertriglyceridemia; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Leptin; Ligands; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Lipogenesis; Liver; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; PPAR alpha; Procetofen; Receptors, LDL; Triglycerides; Weight Gain; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646192257

The few studies that have addressed this trade-off have dealt only with life history traits such as age and size at maturity. Physiological traits have largely been ignored in studies assessing the impact of environmental stressors, and it is largely unknown whether they respond independently of life history traits. Here, we studied the simultaneous effects of time constraints, i.e., as imposed by seasonality, and predation risk on immune defense, energy storage, and life history in lestid damselflies. As predicted by theory, larvae accelerated growth and development under time constraints while the opposite occurred under predation risk. The activity of phenoloxidase, an important component of insect immunity, and investment in fat storage were reduced both under time constraints and in the presence of predators. These reductions were smaller when time constraints and predation risk were combined. This indicates that predators can induce sublethal costs linked to both life history and physiology in their prey, and that time constraints can independently reduce the impact of predator-induced changes in life history and physiology. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Carry-over costs; Complex life cycle; Damselfly larvae; Fat reserves; Immune function; Life history plasticity; Predation risk; Time constraints","damselfly; developmental stage; fat reserve; foraging behavior; immunity; life history; predation; predation risk; predator; animal; article; immunology; insect; life cycle; physiology; predation; Animals; Insects; Life Cycle Stages; Predatory Behavior; Insecta; Lestidae; Zygoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646136676

Objective: The objective of the study was to assess changes in body composition and the serum concentrations of adiponectin, a marker of negative energy balance and insulin sensitivity, in adult patients with CF. Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Setting: The study was conducted at an outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. Participants: Twenty-four stable adult CF patients and 24 healthy controls, matched for body mass index, age, sex, and hormonal therapy in women participated in the study. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in body composition (assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry) and serum adiponectin levels were measured. Results: Body mass index, percent fat mass (in percentage of body weight), and percent lean body mass were similar in patients and controls, whereas central fat accumulation was increased [trunk to extremity fat ratio 1.2 (0.99 -1.51) vs. 0.99 (0.81-1.25), P = 0.01] in patients with CF, compared with controls. Decreased lean mass and increased highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels were independently associated with worse lung function in CF patients. Despite similar insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) and similar SHBG serum concentrations, the serum concentrations of adiponectin were higher in CF patients, compared with controls, independent of other confounders (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Central fat accumulation is increased in patients with CF. It is postulated that the energy deficit-induced increase in serum adiponectin could explain the preservation of insulin sensitivity in these patients despite the increase in central fat and in highly sensitive C-reactive protein serum concentrations and could prevent a further deterioration of protein catabolism.

There is also an adjustment given for the atomic mass of multiscripts(He, mml:none(), mml:none(), prescripts(), mml:none(), 4) and we present a preliminary result for the atomic mass of multiscripts(H, mml:none(), mml:none(), prescripts(), mml:none(), 2). In addition, we present our plans for replacing the present spectrometer with a new one containing a cylindrical storage trap that will be loaded using an external ion source and two hyperbolic traps whose dimensions are identical to the Penning trap in our present spectrometer. Thus, it is expected that the new spectrometer will have essentially the same systematics as those described in this paper. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we developed an image-processing technique for suppressing the contrast of ribs and clavicles in chest radiographs by means of a multiresolution massive training artificial neural network (MTANN). An MTANN is a highly nonlinear filter that can be trained by use of input chest radiographs and the corresponding ""teaching"" images. We employed ""bone"" images obtained by use of a dual-energy subtraction technique as the teaching images. For effective suppression of ribs having various spatial frequencies, we developed a multiresolution MTANN consisting of multiresolution decomposition/composition techniques and three MTANNs for three different-resolution images. After training with input chest radiographs and the corresponding dual-energy bone images, the multiresolution MTANN was able to provide ""bone-image-like"" images which were similar to the teaching bone images. By sub-tracting the bone-image-like images from the corresponding chest radiographs, we were able to produce ""soft-tissue- image-like"" images where ribs and clavicles were substantially suppressed. We used a validation test database consisting of 118 chest radio-graphs with pulmonary nodules and an independent test database consisting of 136 digitized screen-film chest radiographs with 136 solitary pulmonary nodules collected from 14 medical institutions in this study. When our technique was applied to nontraining chest radiographs, ribs and clavicles in the chest radiographs were suppressed substantially, while the visibility of nodules and lung vessels was maintained. Thus, our image-processing technique for rib suppression by means of a multiresolution MTANN would be potentially useful for radiologists as well as for CAD schemes in detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs. © 2006 IEEE.","Artificial neural network; Chest radiography; Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD); Dual-energy subtraction; Lung nodule; Rib suppression","Chest radiography; Clavicles; Dual-energy subtraction; Energy bone images; Lung nodule; Lung nodules; Rib suppression; Computer aided diagnosis; Decomposition; Image processing; Pulmonary diseases; Radiography; Neural networks; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; human; image quality; image subtraction; information retrieval; lung coin lesion; methodology; radiography; reproducibility; retrospective study; rib; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Coin Lesion, Pulmonary; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Ribs; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645673568

Abnormalities in cardiac conduction can occur due to a variety of factors, including developmental and congenital defects, acquired injury or ischemia of portions of the conduction system, or less commonly due to inherited diseases that alter cardiac conduction system function. So called 'idiopathic' conduction system degeneration may have familial clustering, and therefore is consistent with a hereditary basis. This 'Molecular Perspectives' will highlight several diverse mechanisms of isolated conduction system disease as well as conduction system degeneration associated with other cardiac and non-cardiac disorders. The first part of this review focuses on channelopathies associated with conduction system disease. Human genetic studies have identified mutations in the sodium channel SCN5A gene causing tachyarrhythmia disorders, as well as progressive cardiac conduction system diseases, or overlapping syndromes. Next, the importance of embryonic developmental genes such as homeobox and T-box transcription factors are highlighted in conduction system development and function. Conduction system diseases associated with multisystem disorders, such as muscular and myotonic dystrophies, will be described. Last, a new glycogen storage cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular preexcitation and progressive conduction system degeneration will be reviewed. There are a myriad of mutations identified in genes encoding cardiac transcription factors, ion channels, gap junctions, energy metabolism regulators, lamins and other structural proteins. Understanding of the molecular and ionic mechanisms underlying cardiac conduction is essential for the appreciation of the pathogenesis of conduction abnormalities in structurally normal and altered hearts.","Atrioventricular block; Basic: Cellular electrophysiology/electropharmocology; Basic: molecular biology/genetics; Cardiac conduction system; Cardiomyopathy; Congenital heart disease; His-Purkinje system; Lamin; Sinus node dysfunction; Transcription factors","calsequestrin; connexin 40; emerin; gap junction protein; homeodomain protein; ion channel; lamin; myotonic dystrophy protein kinase; potassium channel; protein SCN5A; sodium channel; structural protein; T box transcription factor; transcription factor; unclassified drug; anatomy; cardiomyopathy; congenital heart disease; developmental disorder; developmental genetics; disease association; embryo development; gene mutation; genetic disorder; glycogen storage disease; heart accessory conduction pathway; heart development; heart function; heart injury; heart muscle; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle ischemia; heart stimulation; human; human genetics; inheritance; molecular dynamics; multigene family; muscular dystrophy; myotonic dystrophy; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; review; risk factor; tachycardia; Arrhythmia; DNA; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Heart Conduction System; Humans; Muscle Proteins; Mutation; Sodium Channels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645326225

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), using methyl bromide fumigation. Restrictions and limitations imposed on the uses of methyl bromide have increased interest in developing alternative non-chemical quarantine treatments. It is imperative that the treatment is effective against codling moth yet maintains the quality of treated apples. The present study explored the application of radio frequency (RF) energy in conjunction with conventional hot water treatment to develop feasible heat treatments. Treatment parameters were selected based on minimum time-temperature conditions required for 100% mortality of fifth-instar codling moth and apple quality. The treatments included preheating of infested or wholesome apples in warm water at 45°C for 30 min. The preheated apples were then heated to 48°C in a hydraulic fruit mover placed between two parallel plate electrodes in a 12 kW, 27.12 MHz pilot scale RF system. RF treated apples were transferred to a 48°C hot water bath and held for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min before being hydro-cooled in ice water for 30 min. The mortality of codling moths in the infested apples was assessed, and the quality of wholesome apples was evaluated by measuring weight loss, firmness, color, soluble solids content, and titratable acidity after 0, 7, and 30 days of storage at 4°C. The results showed that the treatment at 48°C for 15 min was the most practical and effective both for insect control and apple quality. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Conversely, one central BioOil plant could supply several energy users in distributed locations, or several plants could supply numerous end-users, just as in the petroleum industry. Renewable Oil International® LLC (ROI) is one of several developers of fast pyrolysis technology. The production of BioOil can convert raw biomass into a low-viscosity liquid that, depending on the moisture content of the feedstock, increases the energy density of biomass by a factor of 6 to 7 times over green wood chips. The increase in energy density increases the amount of energy that can be hauled by standard tanker trucks versus a chip trailer van by a factor of two. Capital costs, exclusive of land costs, are comparable for a 50 MWe biomass handling system at the power plant.

For contacts between diamond indenters (radius R=5 or 10 μm) and PDMS, force-displacement curves were highly reversible and consistent with Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) behavior. However, our experiments have revealed striking differences between the experimental measurements of tip-sample interaction stiffness and the theoretical JKR stiffness. The measured stiffness was always greater than zero, even in the reflex portion of the curve (between the maximum adhesive force and release), where the JKR stiffness is negative. This apparent paradox can be resolved by considering the effects of viscoelasticity of PDMS on an oscillating crack tip in a JKR contact. Under well described conditions determined by oscillation frequency, sample viscoelastic properties, and the Tabor parameter (with variables R, reduced elastic modulus, E*, and interfacial energy, Δγ), an oscillating crack tip will neither advance nor recede. In that case, the contact size is fixed (like that of a flat punch) at any given point on the load-displacement cycle, and the experimentally measured stiffness is equal to the equivalent punch stiffness. For a fixed oscillation frequency, a transition between JKR and punch stiffness can be brought about by an increase in radius of the probe or a decrease in PDMS modulus. Additionally, varying the oscillation frequency for a fixed E*, R, and Δγ also resulted in transition between JKR and punch stiffness in a predictable manner. Comparisons of experiments and theory for an oscillating viscoelastic JKR contact are presented. The storage modulus and surface energy from nanoscale JKR stiffness measurements were compared to calculated values and those measured with conventional nanoindentation and JKR force-displacement analyses. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

During human gait, the storage and return of elastic energy in compliant structures is an important energy saving mechanism that may reduce the necessary muscle fiber work and be an important determinant of the preferred gait mode (i.e., walk or run) at a given speed. In the present study, the mechanical work done by individual muscle fibers and series-elastic elements (SEE) was quantified using a musculoskeletal model and forward dynamical simulations that emulated a group of young healthy adults walking and running above and below the preferred walk-run transition speed (PTS), and potential advantages associated with the muscle fiber-SEE interactions during these gait modes at each speed were assessed. The simulations revealed that: (1) running below the PTS required more muscle fiber work than walking, and inversely, walking above the PTS required more muscle fiber work than running, and (2) SEE utilization in running was greater above than below the PTS.

The self-discharge behavior of a LaNi3.55Co0.75Mn0.4Al0.3 electrode in alkaline solution, with and without ZnO additive, was investigated. Experimental results showed that the self-discharge rate (hydrogen desorption) within the single-phase region is controlled by the difference between the equilibrium hydrogen partial pressure at the electrode and the actual hydrogen partial pressure in the cell. Dissolved oxygen was also found to exert a strong influence on the self-discharge rate in the single-phase region. In the two-phase region, the self-discharge is limited by the rate of phase transformation. A four-step mechanism for the self-discharge process is proposed. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

GRP78 has ATPase activity, acts as a chaperone, and interacts specifically with other proteins, such as caspases, as part of a mechanism regulating apoptosis. GRP78 is also reported to have a possible role as a Ca2+ storage protein. In order to understand the potential biological effects of Ca2+ and ATP/ADP binding on the biology of GRP78, we have determined its ligand binding properties. We show here for the first time that GRP78 can bind Ca2+, ATP, and ADP, each with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and that the binding of cation and nucleotide is cooperative. These observations do not support the hypothesis that GRP78 is a dynamic Ca2+ storage protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that whereas Mg2+ enhances GRP78 binding to ADP and ATP to the same extent, Ca2+ shows a differential enhancement. In the presence of Ca2+, the KD for ATP is lowered ∼11-fold, and the KD for ADP is lowered around 930-fold. The KD for Ca 2+ is lowered ∼40-fold in the presence of ATP and around 880-fold with ADP. These findings may explain the biological requirement for a nucleotide exchange factor to remove ADP from GRP78. Taken together, our data suggest that the Ca2+-binding property of GRP78 may be part of a signal transduction pathway that modulates complex interactions between GRP78, ATP/ADP, secretory proteins, and caspases, and this ultimately has important consequences for cell viability. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Adenosinetriphosphate; Bioelectric potentials; Cells; Molecular biology; Proteins; ATPase activity; GRP78; Mechanism regulating apoptosis; Binding energy; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; caspase; glucose regulated protein 78; magnesium; secretory protein; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; chaperone; heat shock protein; molecular chaperone GRP78; recombinant protein; article; calcium binding; cell viability; controlled study; differential scanning calorimetry; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein binding; protein interaction; protein purification; signal transduction; stoichiometry; thermodynamics; animal; binding site; calorimetry; chemistry; circular dichroism; comparative study; dose response; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; mouse; mutation; protein tertiary structure; regression analysis; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Mammalia; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Binding Sites; Calcium; Calorimetry; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Circular Dichroism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Heat-Shock Proteins; Least-Squares Analysis; Magnesium; Mice; Molecular Chaperones; Mutation; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Proteins; Regression Analysis; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646844964

The spillover and interaction of atomic hydrogen with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is the focus of this combined theoretical and experimental work. To understand the spillover mechanism, very low occupancies (i.e., 1 and 2 H atoms adsorbed) on (5,0), (7,0), (9,0) zigzag (semiconducting) SWNTs and a (5,5) armchair (metallic) SWNT, with corresponding diameters of 3.9, 5.5, 7.0, and 6.8 Å, were investigated. The adsorption binding energy of H atoms depends on H occupancy, tube diameter, and helicity (or chirality), as well as endohedral (interior) vs exohedral (exterior) binding. Exohedral binding energies are substantially higher than endohedral binding energies due to easier sp2-sp3 transition in hybridization of carbon on exterior walls upon binding. A binding energy as low as -8.9 kcal/mol is obtained for 2H atoms on the exterior wall of a (5, 0) SWNT. The binding energies of H atoms on the metallic SWNT are significantly weaker (about 23 kcal/mol weaker) than that on the semiconductor SWNT, for both endohedral and exohedral adsorption. The binding energy is generally higher on SWNTs of larger diameters, while its dependence on H occupancy is relatively weak except at very low occupancies. Experimental results at 298 K and for pressures up to 10 MPa with a carbon-bridged composite material containing SWNTs demonstrate the presence of multiple adsorption sites based on desorption hysteresis for the spiltover H on SWNTs, and the experimental results were in qualitative agreement with the molecular orbital calculation results. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Binding energy; Carbon nanotubes; Composite materials; Pressure effects; Hydrogen storage; Multiple adsorption; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs); Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645833397

In the automotive sector, reduction of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from the power plant is one of the main objectives of car manufacturers and innovative technologies are under active consideration to achieve this goal. One technology that has been proposed and vigorously pursued in the past decade is the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, an electrochemical device that reacts hydrogen with oxygen to produce water, electricity and heat. Since today there is no existing extensive hydrogen infrastructure and no commercially viable hydrogen storage technology for vehicles, there is a continuing debate as to how the hydrogen for these advanced vehicles will be supplied. In order to circumvent the above issues, power systems based on PEM fuel cells can employ an on-board fuel processor that has the ability to convert conventional fuels such as gasoline into hydrogen for the fuel cell. This option could thereby remove the fuel infrastructure and storage issues. However, for these fuel processor/fuel cell vehicles to be commercially successful, issues such as start time and transient response must be addressed. This paper discusses the role of transient response of the fuel processor power plant and how it relates to the battery sizing for a gasoline fuel cell vehicle. In addition, results of fuel processor testing from a current Renault/Nuvera Fuel Cells project are presented to show the progress in transient performance. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Filter-based methods such as the Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP) are most commonly used to quantify aerosol light absorption aloft. This paper reports first measurements of aerosol light absorption aloft with photoacoustic instrumentation (PA). Three examples of aerosol light absorption are presented. The first one illustrates a case of detached layers aloft arising from intercontinental, interoceanic transport of smoke from wildland fires in Siberia to the North American continent and the measurement campaign held at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Climate Research Facility in north central Oklahoma. Then, two examples of intense local fire smoke light absorption from the Coastal Stratocumulus Imposed Perturbation Experiment near Marina, California, USA, are presented. The first local fire was an oil fire burning in a storage tank near Moss Landing, California, USA, and smoke from this fire was very dark, indicating a low single scattering albedo. By contrast, the second local fire was predominantly burning wood, vegetation, and structures near Fort Ord in Marina, California, USA, and the smoke was very bright, indicating a high single scattering albedo. In all examples, PA measurements at 676 nm were compared with those from a PSAP modified to measure at three wavelengths, including 660 nm.

The influence of the electron population is taken into account assuming Boltzman-like quasi-equilibrium distribution in the electrostatic field, which can lead to a sharp peak in the electron current density in the center of the current sheet. We include the contribution of non-adiabatic O+ ions in our model as one of the terms in the Grad-Shafranov-like system of equations describing the quasi-equilibrium configuration.

Strong molecular two-photon absorption (inducing the reversible photoisomerization) is a necessary feature for this application due to the need for high 3D spatial resolution. Here, the one- and two-photon absorption (OPA and TPA) characteristics of the open- and closed-ring isomers of 1-3 have been investigated using time-dependent density functional theory. It was determined that the excited states populated by two-photon absorption were nearly 1 eV higher in energy than the lowest energy excited state populated by one-photon absorption. The electronic structures of the TPA and OPA accessed states were then compared utilizing natural transition orbital analysis. There, it was found that states excited by OPA had ππ* character about the C-C framework associated with the bond formation/scission of the central C-C bond. In contrast, the states populated by TPA have ππ* character along the C-C skeletal periphery, including phenyl excitations. It is postulated that these differences in excited state electronic structure may lead to reaction pathways alternative to photoisomerization about the central C-C bond, impacting the utility of these compounds as 3D information storage media. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectra; Photoisomerization; Photoswitching; Time-dependent density functional theory; Chemical bonds; Electron energy levels; Energy absorption; Isomerization; Photochemical reactions; Probability density function; Spectrum analysis; Chromophores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645522076

The method has been applied to investigate the radiative decay of the n p3 P 1 2 2 levels of Te- (n=5) and Se- (n=4) and the 3 p3 D2 state of Si- for which the J=3 2 and 5 2 levels were unresolved. All of these states are metastable and decay primarily by emission of E2 and M1 radiation. Multi Configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations of rates for the transitions in Te- and Se- yielded lifetimes of 0.45 s and 4.7 s, respectively. The measured values agree well with these predicted values. In the case of the D2 state of Si-, however, our measurement was only able to set a lower limit on the lifetime. The upper limit of the lifetime that can be measured with our apparatus is set by how long the ions can be stored in the ring, a limit determined by the rate of collisional detachment. Our lower limit of 1 min for the lifetime of the D2 state is consistent with both the calculated lifetimes of 162 s for the D 3 2 2 level and 27.3 h for the D 5 2 2 level reported by O'Malley and Beck and 14.5 h and 12.5 h, respectively, from our Breit-Pauli calculations. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,"Collisional detachment; Heavy-ion storage ring; Metastable states; Radiative decay; Calculations; Electron transitions; Negative ions; Radiation; Silicon; Tellurium; Electron energy levels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644689874

This chapter describes the current knowledge on these closed field structures and how they lead to CMEs. After describing the specific magnetic structures observed in the CME source region we compare the substructures of CMEs to what is observed before eruption. Evolution of the closed magnetic structures in response to various photospheric motions over different time scales (convection differential rotation meridional circulation) somehow leads to the eruption. We describe this pre-eruption evolution and attempt to link them to the observed features of CMEs. Small-scale energetic signatures in the form of electron acceleration (signified by nonthermal radio bursts at metric wavelengths) and plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs. We survey these pre-eruptive energy releases using observations taken before and during the eruption of several CMEs. Finally we discuss how the observations can be converted into useful inputs to numerical models that can describe the CME initiation. © Springer Science+Business Media Inc. 2006.","Active regions; Closed and open magnetic fields; Coronal mass ejections; Energy storage and release; Filaments; Flares; Helicity; Pre -eruption signatures; Prominences; Radio bursts; Solar magnetism; Streamers","Energy storage; Magnetic field effects; Mathematical models; Plasma heating; Radio waves; X rays; Coronal mass ejection (CME); Flares; Radio bursts; Solar magnetism; Streamers; Sun",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751546877

Here, the performance of the urban tile is evaluated in two urban areas: the historic core of downtown Mexico City and a light industrial site in Vancouver, Canada. The sites differ in terms of building structures and mean building heights. In both cases vegetation cover is less than 5%. The evaluation is based on surface energy balance flux measurements conducted at approximately the blending height, which is the location where the surface scheme passes flux data into the atmospheric model. At both sites, MOSES 2.2 correctly simulates the net radiation, but there are discrepancies in the partitioning of turbulent and storage heat fluxes between predicted and observed values. Of the turbulent fluxes, latent heat fluxes were underpredicted by about one order of magnitude. Multiple model runs revealed MOSES 2.2 to be sensitive to changes in the canopy heat storage and in the ratio between the aerodynamic roughness length and that for heat transfer (temperature). Model performance was optimum with heat capacity values smaller than those generally considered for these sites. The results suggest that the current scheme is probably too simple, and that improvements may be obtained by increasing the complexity of the model. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Model evaluation; Sensitivity analysis; Surface scheme; Urban energy balance","Aerodynamics; Computer simulation; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Sensitivity analysis; Specific heat; Surface energy balance; Urban tile; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Aerodynamics; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Computer simulation; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Sensitivity analysis; Specific heat; energy balance; heat flux; model validation; sensitivity analysis; surface energy; urban area; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746209330

Data were collected over a temperature range of -10°C to +60°C. A distinct acoustic noise transient marked the freezing temperature of the samples. A positive absorption transient and a brief period of oxygen uptake marked the thermal denaturing temperature of the samples. Between these extremes, the effects of temperature on light absorption, oxygen evolution, and photochemical energy storage were quantified quickly and easily. Oxygen evolution could be measured as low as -5°C and showed a broad temperature peak that was 10°C lower under limiting light intensity than under saturating light intensity. Photochemical energy storage showed a narrower temperature peak that was only slightly lower for limiting light intensities than for saturating light intensities. In a survey of diverse plants, temperature response curves for oxygen evolution were determined readily for a variety of leaf types, including ferns and conifer needles.

Analyses of the long term drying process of 2.75 mm diameter samples of cement-bentonite grouted soils from Dover, Del. in an environmental chamber maintained at a temperature of 25°C and relative humidity of 30% indicate that for most samples, the water-filled porosity (0.02-0.033) varied in a quasi-sinusoidal pattern with respect to drying time. Measurements of ultrasonic wave transit time with a James V-Meter correlated in time, with moisture loss determinations by weight loss measurements, show that in the initial 0-65 day drying period, the escape of moisture and consequent increase in air-filled porosity is responsible for the decrease in ultrasonic pulse velocity. Thereafter, increases in pulse velocity values ranging from 50 to 260m/s observed for the reaction products at sustained drying at 25°C, provide enough activation energy for continuation of cement hydration and cement-bentonite reactions. Continuation of drying beyond reasonably complete moisture loss, to 200 days, generally produced decreases in pulse velocity that are herein attributed to microcracking.

As discovered by Volta, this contraption was capable of producing an electrical shock when its ends were touched. In a broad sense, batteries can be defined as devices that convert chemical into electrical energy using electrodes, immersed in media (liquids, gels, and even solids) that support the transport of ions, or electrolyte. This mode of operation is fundamentally different from that associated with conventional solid-state capacitors, invented about half a century earlier in Leyden, The Netherlands, in which charge is physically stored in nonreactive electrodes separated by a dielectric, or insulating material. However, the latter shares important commonalities with yet another class of devices developed much later known as electrochemical capacitors, which, as described later in this article, rely on charge separation at electrode|electrolyte interfaces to store energy.",,"Electrical energy; Electrical shock; Electrochemical capacitors; Solid-state capacitors; Dielectric materials; Electric batteries; Electric charge; Electric energy storage; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Insulating materials; Metal analysis; Zinc; Capacitors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646692013

They consist of an electrolyte medium sandwiched between two electrodes (Fig. 1). One electrode (called the anode) facilitates electrochemical oxidation of fuel, while the other (called the cathode) promotes electrochemical reduction of oxidant. Ions generated during oxidation or reduction are transported from one electrode to the other through the ionically conductive but electronically insulating electrolyte. The electrolyte also serves as a barrier between the fuel and oxidant. Electrons generated at the anode during oxidation pass through the external circuit (hence generating electricity) on their way to the cathode, where they complete the reduction reaction. The fuel and oxidant do not mix at any point, and no actual combustion occurs. The fuel cell therefore is not limited by the Carnot efficiency and, theoretically (although not practically), can yield 100% efficiency. Fuel cells are primarily classified according to the electrolyte material. The choice of electrolyte material also governs the operating temperature of the fuel cell.

Setting: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Methods: Six patients with 3-piece silicone lenses presented with optic cloudiness as early as a few hours after implantation. The lenses were implanted in 4 locations in Brazil and in France. The lenses in Brazil were stored at the same location before implantation. Gross and microscopic analyses were performed (dry and hydrated states). One half of each specimen underwent gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis and/or extraction by isopropyl alcohol or acetonitrile. One lens also underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The IOLs were examined for the presence of contaminants or deposits that could cause fast optic opacification. Results: The IOLs showed a white optic discoloration in the hydrated state but became transparent on complete dehydration. Suspect exogenous chemical compounds were identified in GC/MS analyses; general classes included terpenes and ketones, typically found in industrial cleaning agents and fumigants. Surface analysis (SEM and EDS) did not show any significant deposits on the external surfaces and sagittal cut in 1 of the specimens. Conclusions: Most IOLs are enclosed in semipermeable packages to allow sterilization by ethylene oxide gas. During cleaning or disinfection of storage rooms, aerosolized solutions may introduce chemicals through the package and onto the IOLs.

We investigate the cost of forest-based carbon sequestration by analyzing econometrically micro-data on revealed landowner preferences, modeling six major private land uses in a comprehensive analysis of the contiguous United States. The econometric estimates are used to simulate landowner responses to sequestration policies. We treat key commodity prices as endogenous and predict carbon storage changes with a carbon sink model. Our estimated sequestration costs exceed those from previous engineering cost analyses and sectoral optimization models. Our estimated sequestration supply function is similar to the carbon abatement supply function from energy-based analyses, suggesting that forest-based carbon sequestration merits consideration in a cost-effective portfolio of domestic US climate change strategies. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This source utilizes a novel reentrant shaped plasma inductively coupled plasma generator for improved radial plasma density uniformity and a dynamic magnetic field for improved static etch uniformity. It has the capability of reproducibly generating extremely uniform ion beams from 500 to 1500 eV with divergence angle <3° and high directionality [Kanarov (patent pending)]. For a 150 mm diameter wafer, an etch uniformity of <1% σ /mean in static condition or <0.5% with wafer rotation is obtained over an ion incident angle range of 0°-65°. Recently, we have investigated extending the operation of this source to the critical low energy range, 100-500 eV, required for fabricating thin film magnetic head sensors. It was found that, under optimum operating conditions, excellent static etch uniformity (1%-1.5% σ /mean) could be obtained at high ion beam current densities, up to 0.5 mA cm2, over the entire low-energy range while still achieving low divergence angles (<5°) and high beam directionality. The ion beam performance was consistent with results obtained by simulation and by experiment using a 19-hole array ion optic test stand with scanning ion probe [E. Wåhlin (unpublished)].

Recently, it was shown that, in the relaxor ferroelectric PMN-PT single crystals, a very high longitudinal electromechanical coupling factor (&gt;90%) can be obtained. This paper investigates energy harvesting using 1-3 composites of PMN-PT single crystals in a soft epoxy matrix. It is shown that 1-3 composites enable the single crystals operating in the longitudinal mode to achieve high efficiency for energy harvesting, and the soft-polymer, matrix-supported single-crystal rods maintain high mechanical integrity under different external loads. For comparison, 1-3 composites with piezoceramic PZT also are investigated in energy-harvesting applications, and the results show that the high coupling factor of single crystal PMN-PT 1-3 composites leads to much higher electric energy output for similar mechanical energy input. The harvested energy density of 1-3 composite with single crystal (22.1 mW/cm 3 under a stress of 40.4 MPa) is about twice of that harvested with PZT ceramic 1-3 composite (12 mW/cm 3 under a stress of 39 MPa).

We develop estimates of the prevalence of luxus consumption and its environmental consequences using US food supply, agricultural, and environmental data and using procedures modeled after energetics analysis and ecological footprint analysis. Between 1983 and 2000, US food availability (food consumption including waste) increased by 18% or 600 kcal (2.51 MJ) per person. This luxus consumption required 0.36 hectares (ha) of land and fishing area per capita, 100.6 million ha for the US population, and 3.1% of total US energy consumption. Luxus consumption increased more for particular foods, such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), 22% of which was used in carbonated beverages. As an example, the luxus consumption of sweetened soda, 31.8 l per capita, used 0.8% of the US corn crop (230,555 ha of land); 33.6 million kg of nitrogen fertilizer; 175,000 kg of Atrazine herbicide; 34 million kg of nitrogen fertilizer; 2.44 trillion kcal (10.2 PJ) for production inputs and post-harvest handling; and led to 4.9 million metric tons of soil erosion. Diet soft drink luxus consumption was 43.9 l/capita. Assuming half of US soft drink luxus consumption was bottled in plastic, the energy cost for plastics would have been 2.49 trillion kcal (10.4 PJ) in 2000. Total HFCS availability above baseline in 2000 required 4.6 times the resources used for soft drinks alone. This analysis suggests the utility and applicability of the concept of luxus consumption to environmental analysis and for estimating the effects of excess food utilization. © Springer 2006.","Caloric analysis; Carbonated beverage consumption; Ecological impact analysis; Environment; Food waste; High fructose corn syrup; Luxus consumption; Obesity; Overeating; US food supply data","Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644907768

Respondents rated the same 22 food names and descriptions in terms of weight-gain potential and hunger satisfaction. Half of the 22 snacks included foods from the lower two tiers of the USDA Food Guide Pyramid (fruits, vegetables, and grains: FV&G) and the other half from the upper two tiers (meats, dairy, fats, and sweets: MDF&S). FV&G and MDF&S snack names and descriptions were paired for data analyses based on energy content. Name and description ratings for weight-gain potential were not correlated, while these ratings for hunger satisfaction were strongly correlated. For weight-gain potential, fat and fiber content predicted snack-name ratings, while energy and sugar content predicted description ratings. For perceived hunger satisfaction, protein content predicted snack name ratings while energy and fat content predicted description ratings. The MDF&S snack named in each pair was always considered a greater weight gain promoter compared to its corresponding FV&G snack named. However, the description of the FV&G snack in each pair was often judged to promote greater weight-gain than the description of its corresponding MDF&S snack. Also, MDF&S names were generally judged as more filling than FV&G foods named with similar calorie content; however, a trend in the opposite direction was evident when rating the nutrient descriptions of these same foods.

A more cost-effective adiabatic buncher and phase-energy rotator has been proposed to replace the induction linac system (D. Neuffer, A.

Phytases are enzymes that catalyze the removal of these minerals from phytic acid, improving their bioavailability. The objective of the present study was to determine the ability of dietary phytase to affect body weight, body composition, and bone strength in growing rats fed a high phytic acid, low Zn diet. Rats (n = 20) were fed either a control (AIN-93) or phytase supplemented (Natuphos, BASF, 1,500 phytase units (FTU)/kg) diet for a period of 8 weeks. Phytase supplementation resulted in increased (P<.05) bone and plasma Zn, but no change in plasma inorganic phosphorous or bone levels of Ca, Fe, or Mg. The addition of phytase to the diets resulted in a 22.4% increase (P<.05) in body weight at the end of the study as compared with rats fed a control diet. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) revealed that phytase supplementation resulted in increase lean body mass (LBM, P<.001) and increased bone mineral content (BMC, P<.001) as compared with feeding the control diet. Bone studies indicated that femurs and tibias from phytase supplemented rats had greater mass (P<.05) and were stronger (P<.05) than rats fed the control diet. This data suggest that the addition of phytase to low Zn diets results in improved Zn status, which may be responsible for beneficial effects on growth, body composition, and bone strength. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We use Zaozhuang, a city in eastern China heavily dependent on coal, as a case study to quantify the impacts that air pollution in eastern China had on public health in 2000 and the benefits in improved air quality and health that could be obtained by 2020, relative to business-as-usual (BAU), through the implementation of best available emission control technology (BACT) and advanced coal gasification technologies (ACGT). We use an integrated assessment approach, utilizing state-of-the-science air quality and meteorological models, engineering, epidemiology, and economics, to achieve this objective. We find that total health damages due to year 2000 anthropogenic emissions from Zaozhuang, using the ""willingness-to-pay"" metric, was equivalent to 10% of Zaozhuang's GDP. If all health damages resulting from coal use were internalized in the market price of coal, the year 2000 price would have more than tripled. With no new air pollution controls implemented between 2000 and 2020 but with projected increases in energy use, we estimate health damages from air pollution exposure to be equivalent to 16% of Zaozhuang's projected 2020 GDP. BACT and ACGT (with only 24% penetration in Zaozhuang and providing 2% of energy needs in three surrounding municipalities) could reduce the potential health damage of air pollution in 2020 to 13% and 8% of projected GDP, respectively. Benefits to public health, of substantial monetary value, can be achieved through the use of BACT; health benefits from the use of ACGT could be even larger. Despite significant uncertainty associated with each element of the integrated assessment approach, we demonstrate that substantial benefits to public health could be achieved in this region of eastern China through the use of additional pollution controls and particularly from the use of advanced coal gasification technology. Without such controls, the impacts of air pollution on public health, presently considerable, will increase substantially by 2020. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It consists of the simple alkyl esters of fatty acids, most typically the methyl esters. We have developed a computer model to estimate the capital and operating costs of a moderately-sized industrial biodiesel production facility. The major process operations in the plant were continuous-process vegetable oil transesterification, and ester and glycerol recovery. The model was designed using contemporary process simulation software, and current reagent, equipment and supply costs, following current production practices. Crude, degummed soybean oil was specified as the feedstock. Annual production capacity of the plant was set at 37,854,118 l (10 × 10 6 gal). Facility construction costs were calculated to be US$11.3 million. The largest contributors to the equipment cost, accounting for nearly one third of expenditures, were storage tanks to contain a 25 day capacity of feedstock and product. At a value of US$0.52/kg ($0.236/lb) for feedstock soybean oil, a biodiesel production cost of US$0.53/l ($2.00/gal) was predicted. The single greatest contributor to this value was the cost of the oil feedstock, which accounted for 88% of total estimated production costs. An analysis of the dependence of production costs on the cost of the feedstock indicated a direct linear relationship between the two, with a change of US$0.020/l ($0.075/gal) in product cost per US$0.022/kg ($0.01/lb) change in oil cost. Process economics included the recovery of coproduct glycerol generated during biodiesel production, and its sale into the commercial glycerol market as an 80% w/w aqueous solution, which reduced production costs by ≈6%. The production cost of biodiesel was found to vary inversely and linearly with variations in the market value of glycerol, increasing by US$0.0022/l ($0.0085/gal) for every US$0.022/kg ($0.01/lb) reduction in glycerol value. The model is flexible in that it can be modified to calculate the effects on capital and production costs of changes in feedstock cost, changes in the type of feedstock employed, changes in the value of the glycerol coproduct, and changes in process chemistry and technology.","Biodiesel; Cost estimate; Economic analysis; Soybean oil","Costs; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Glycerol; Industrial economics; Oils and fats; Biodiesel; Cost estimate; Economic analysis; Soybean oil; Diesel fuels; diesel fuel; ester; glycerol; petroleum; soybean oil; vegetable oil; biofuel; apparatus, equipment and supplies; aqueous solution; article; capital; computer model; computer program; cost; nonhuman; plant; priority journal; process model; statistical model; transesterification; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Bioreactors; Computer Simulation; Models, Economic; Soybean Oil; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28844502244

Six resin disks (15 mm in diameter×1 mm in thickness) were prepared from each copolymer blend and were stored in deionised water at 23, 37 and 55°C. Water sorption and solubility of the resin disks were measured before and after water immersion and desiccation. Multiple regression analysis of water sorption was performed on two independent variables, copolymer hydrophilicity and temperature. Maximum water sorption increased significantly with Hoy's total cohesive energy density (δt), Hoy's solubility parameter for polar forces (δp) and hydrogen bonding (δh), but was not influenced by temperature. However, a significant positive relationship was observed between diffusion coefficients (obtained using Fick's law of diffusion) and temperature. The water absorption activation energy was 10 kJ/mol for the most hydrophilic copolymer blend R5 and 35-51 kJ/mol for copolymer blends R1-R4. The positive relationship between maximum water uptake and copolymer hydrophilicity suggests that water molecules diffuse through the polymer matrices by binding successively to the polar sites via hydrogen bonding. Such water sorption may determine the durability of resin-dentine bonds. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Electricity from wind provides an alternative to conventional generation that could, in principle, be used to achieve deep reductions (&gt; 50 %) in carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel use. Estimates of the average cost of generation - now roughly 4 ¢/kWh - do not address costs arising from the spatial distribution and intermittency of wind. The greenfield analysis presented in this paper provides an economic characterization of a wind system in which long-distance electricity transmission, storage, and gas turbines are used to supplement variable wind power output to meet a time-varying load. We find that, with somewhat optimistic assumptions about the cost of wind turbines, the use of wind to serve 50% of demand adds ∼ 1-2 ¢/kWh to the cost of electricity, a cost comparable to that of other large-scale low carbon technologies. Even when wind serves an infinitesimal fraction of demand, its intermittency imposes costs beyond the average cost of delivered wind power. Due to residual CO2 emissions, compressed air storage is surprisingly uncompetitive, and there is a tradeoff between the use of wind site diversity and storage as means of managing intermittency. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Odum's energy systems language as programmed in an iconographic simulation software (i.e., Extend®) to provide dynamic valuation of a wetland stormwater management system (WSMS). The solar emergy (i.e., ultimate amount of solar energy required to produce another form of energy) and emdollar (EM$, value an energy flow contributes to an economy based on its proportion of total emergy flow) values of watershed transpiration (a measure of productivity), surface discharge and change in landscape water storage were quantified for various ratios of wetland to upland areas, valuing wetlands in EM$ ha-1 y -1. Simulation results indicated that integrating a WSMS into the watershed increased landscape productivity, decreased surface discharge and increased surface water storage. The eco-hydrological value of watershed productivity was 367 EM$ ha-1 y-1 when 10% of the watershed was wetland, which was an increase of 65 EM$ ha-1 y-1 (based on Florida's emergy-to-dollar ratio in 1985, 2 × 1012 sej $-1). The annual contribution of this extra ecological productivity to public welfare was 12 million EM$, which was estimated from the product of eco-hydrological value and local emergy investment ratio of south Dade County (18:1). Average emdollar value of water saved per unit of wetland was 343 EM$ ha-1 y-1. Dynamic emergy accounting provided distributions of solar transformities of hydrologic variables as opposed to more commonly used point estimates.

This represents an excellent example of how bioinformatics can be used to guide experimental research. However, progress in this direction has been slowed by the lack of a publicly available resource suitable for general use. Results: The precomputed Magnum database offers a solution to this problem for ca. 1,800 full-length protein families with at least one crystal structure. The Magnum deliverables include 1) multiple sequence alignments, 2) mapping of alignment sites to crystal structure sites, 3) phylogenetic trees, 4) inferred ancestral sequences at internal tree nodes, and 5) amino acid replacements along tree branches. Comprehensive evaluations revealed that the automated procedures used to construct Magnum produced accurate models of how proteins divergently evolve, or genealogies, and correctly integrated these with the structural data. To demonstrate Magnum's capabilities, we asked for amino acid replacements requiring three nucleotide substitutions, located at internal protein structure sites, and occurring on short phylogenetic tree branches. In the cellular retinoid binding protein family a site that potentially modulates ligand binding affinity was discovered. Recruitment of cellular retinol binding protein to function as a lens crystallin in the diurnal gecko afforded another opportunity to showcase the predictive value of a browsable database containing branch replacement patterns integrated with protein structures. Conclusion: We integrated two areas of protein science, evolution and structure, on a large scale and created a precomputed database, known as Magnum, which is the first freely available resource of its kind. Magnum provides evolutionary and structural bioinformatics resources that are useful for identifying experimentally testable hypotheses about the molecular basis of protein behaviors and functions, as illustrated with the examples from the cellular retinoid binding proteins. © 2006 Bradley and Benner; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Biological information; Cellular retinol-binding proteins; Comprehensive evaluation; Ligand binding affinity; Multiple sequence alignments; Nucleotide substitution; Retinoid-binding proteins; Structural bioinformatics; Amino acids; Binding energy; Bioinformatics; Biology; Database systems; History; Trees (mathematics); Proteins; amino acid; retinoid binding protein; cellular retinol binding protein; protein binding; retinol binding protein; accuracy; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; article; automation; binding site; crystal structure; genealogy; Magnum database; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; prediction; protein binding; protein database; protein function; protein localization; protein structure; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; structure analysis; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; data base; genetics; information retrieval; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; pedigree; procedures; protein conformation; Gekko; Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Computer Simulation; Database Management Systems; Databases, Protein; Evolution, Molecular; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Chemical; Molecular Sequence Data; Pedigree; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Retinol-Binding Proteins; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744901670

Noninoculated, side-matched controls were employed in the tests to serve as references, and solid wood samples of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) inoculated with T. versicolor were included as positive controls. Potential changes in storage and loss moduli because of fungal colonization and moisture were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis, whereas weight loss and visual observation served as indicators of fungal decay. Severe losses in storage modulus (E′) and loss modulus (E″) following incubation of yellow-poplar with T. versicolor were observed. However, the E′ of the two wood-plastic composite (WPC) formulations increased after 24 days of incubation with T. versicolor. The same effect was observed for G. tra beum, but only in one formulation. The increase of E′ was attributed to a reinforcing effect of the fungal hyphae present in the interfacial gaps between the wood filler and the polymer matrix. Dynamic temperature scans revealed a peak in E″ between 30°C and 63°C, depending on the frequency and fungal treatment. The peak temperature of E″ represents the a-transition of HDPE. Increased activation energies were required for the α-transition in WPC samples incubated with T. versicolor for 77 days as compared to controls. This observation confirmed that incubation of WPC with T. versicolor improved interfacial adhesion and reinforced the composite under the assay conditions. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Activation energy; Composites; Degradation; Extrusion; Polyethylene (PE)","Fungal colonization; Trametes versicolor; White-rot fungus; Wood-polyethylene (HDPE) composite; Activation energy; Assays; Extrusion; Fungus attack; Moisture; Polyethylenes; Composite materials; Composites; Extrusion; Wood; composite; degradation; extrusion; plastic; polyethylene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644538914

For this purpose, a laboratory-scale SBR was operated with a synthetic feed containing acetate as the sole carbon source. The experiments were conducted in four different Runs to ensure a range of different phosphate/acetate ratios in the influent. Model evaluations were carried out using concentration profiles measured throughout a representative cycle at steady state. An iterative calibration methodology was developed based on sensitivity analysis and applied to four different sets of experimental data on relevant model parameters reflecting SBR performance. ASM2d was able to predict the steady state behavior of the SBR system receiving variable influent phosphate loads only with the recalibrated parameter set. The regular changing pattern of the coefficients could be interpreted with the ability of the SBR system to sustain glycogen accumulating microorganisms, GAOs, which can store substrate under anaerobic conditions without polyphosphate energy, but deriving energy from the degradation of glycogen. Thus they are capable of prevailing at lower P/Ac ratios. The results indicate the need to include glycogen and GAOs as model components for processes involving both phosphate accumulating organisms, (PAOs) and GAOs, in order to obtain a better prediction of XPHA and oxygen uptake rate (OUR) profiles in the system. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Activated sludge; Activated Sludge Model No. 2d; Enhanced biological phosphate removal; Glycogen accumulating organisms; Microbial storage; Model calibration; Phosphate accumulating organism; Sequencing batch reactor","Calibration; Carbon; Iterative methods; Microorganisms; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Sensitivity analysis; Activated sludge; Activated Sludge Model No. 2d (ASM2d); Enhanced biological phosphate removal; Glycogen accumulating organisms; Microbial storage; Model calibration; Phosphate accumulating organism; Sequencing batch reactor (SBR); Activated sludge process; acetic acid; carbon; glycogen; phosphorus; polyphosphate; activated sludge; anaerobic capacity; article; bioremediation; calibration; concentration response; energy resource; enhanced biological phosphorus removal; evaluation; glycogen accumulating microorganism; microorganism; model; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; parameter; performance; phosphate accumulating organism; prediction; sensitivity analysis; sequencing batch reactor; steady state; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Models, Biological; Phosphorus; Sewage; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645558194

Water reclamation, recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies. The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous. Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water, co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including: The need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel applications; the need for public education and increased public acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians. Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting water reuse globally. Current trends include addressing emerging pollutants of concern, the use of advanced wastewater treatments including membranes, indirect potable reuse, public perception, understanding the economics of water reuse, groundwater recharge and aquifer storage and recovery, salinity management (including concentrate disposal), increase in the use of ""alternative sources"", environmental or natural system restoration, innovative uses of nonpotable water reuse, and decentralized and satellite systems. Since these trends are emerging developments in the field of water reclamation and reuse, there are a number of research needs associated with these topics. Research is needed to better understand the issues, to develop innovative technologies, and to develop tools and other assistance for communities and water agencies to implement successful water reclamation and reuse projects. © 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Desalination; Integrated concepts; Water reclamation; Water reuse","Contamination; Effluents; Groundwater pollution; Wastewater reclamation; Water quality; Water recycling; Water resources; Water supply systems; Global water needs; Integrated concepts; Water reuse; Desalination; Contamination; Desalination; Effluents; Groundwater pollution; Wastewater reclamation; Water quality; Water recycling; Water resources; Water supply systems; recycling; wastewater; water management; water supply; water technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344456443

Coupled with this is the reality that current practices of treating the total water demands of communities to levels required for human consumption are not indefinitely sustainable. Viable alternative strategies that integrate more effective water recovery for potable reuse with improved means for production and delivery of higher quality water for human consumption are thus essential. Given the inherent advantages of flexibility and responsiveness associated with decentralization of complex functions and operations, the strategic dispersal of flexible advanced treatment and control technologies throughout water transport and storage networks is one logical alternative to consider. Integration of advanced technology satellite systems with cost-critical components of current water infrastructures would facilitate optimal cost-effective applications of highly sophisticated advanced technologies within the context of existing treatment and distribution/collection systems.

Analysis of the (coat) protein shell of recombinant versions of MS2 that lack the A protein revealed dramatic differences compared to wild-type MS2 in solution. Specifically, A protein-deficient virus particles form a protein shell of between 31(±1) Å and 37(±1) Å. This is considerably thicker than the protein shell formed by either the wild-type MS2 or the RNA-free MS2 capsid, whose protein shells have a thickness of 21(±1) Å and 25(±1) Å, respectively. Since the A protein is known to separate from the intact MS2 protein shell after infection, the thin shell form of MS2 represents the pre-infection state, while the post-infection state is thick. Interestingly, these A protein-dependent differences in the virus protein shell are not seen using crystallography, as the crystallization process seems to artificially compact the wild-type MS2 virion. Furthermore, when the A protein is absent from the virus shell (post-infection), the process of crystallization exerts sufficient force to convert the protein shell from the post-infection (thick) state to the pre-infection (thin) conformation. In summary, the data are consistent with the idea that RNA content or amount does not affect the structure of the MS2 virus shell. Rather, the A protein influences the global arrangement of the virus coat dramatically, possibly by mediating the storage of energy or tension within the protein shell during virus assembly. This tension may later be used to eject the MS2 genomic RNA and A protein fragments into the host during infection.","Bacteriophage MS2; Contrast variation; MS2 A protein; RNA ejection; Small-angle neutron scattering","coat protein; article; crystal structure; crystallization; crystallography; MS2 virus; neutron scattering; priority journal; protein analysis; protein conformation; protein structure; structure analysis; thickness; virus particle; virus recombinant; wild type; Miridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29444451856

To reduce power dissipation in the datapath, the resource allocations can be dynamically adjusted based on the demands of applications. We propose a mechanism to dynamically, simultaneously, and independently adjust the sizes of the issue queue (IQ), the reorder buffer (ROB), and the load/store queue (LSQ) based on the periodic sampling of their occupancies to achieve significant power savings with minimal impact on performance. Resource upsizing is done more aggressively (compared to downsizing), using the relative rate of blocked dispatches to limit the performance penalty. Our results are validated by the execution of the SPEC 2000 benchmark suite on a substantially modified version of the Simplescalar simulator, where the IQ, the ROB, the LSQ, and the register files are implemented as separate structures, as is the case with most practical implementations. We also use actual VLSI layouts of the datapath components in a 0.18 micron process to accurately measure the energy dissipations for each type of access. For a 4-way superscalar CPU, an average power savings of about 42 percent within the IQ, 74 percent within the ROB (integrating the register file), and 41 percent within the LSQ can be achieved with an average performance penalty of about 5 percent. © 2006 IEEE.","Dynamic instruction scheduling; Energy-efficient datapath; Power reduction; Superscalar processor","Dynamic instruction scheduling; Energy efficient datapath; Power reduction; Superscalar processor; Buffer storage; Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Program processors; Queueing networks; VLSI circuits; Data structures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947129173

Oxidized single-walled carbon nanotubes were dispersed in a polycarbonate matrix using a solution mixing technique. To characterize the damping response, the material storage and loss modulus was measured by application of dynamic (sinusoidal) load to the nanocomposite in the uniaxial direction. A static pre-strain (in 0.35-0.85% range) was then superimposed on the dynamic strain to quantify its effect on the material response. The results indicate that application of pre-strain facilitates the activation of interfacial slip at the nanotube-polymer interfaces at relatively low dynamic strain amplitudes. This is because pre-strain raises the interfacial shear stress for the nanotube inclusions allowing the critical stress for tube-matrix interfacial slip to be reached at lower strain amplitudes. In this way pre-strain significantly improves the effectiveness of the nanotube-matrix sliding energy dissipation mechanism for damping enhancement in composite structures.

The contribution of the eating process itself to health and well-being, however, has not been questioned until most recently. Biology has linked eating to appetitive motivational processes with their underlying neurophysiology, including CNS reward circuitries: Eating uses the pleasure-reward physiology to motivate us to eat. Endogenous opiates, such as morphine, insure our survival by helping us to make eating motivational via pleasure induction. After taking in enough food, we become satisfied, i.e., tolerant to food. Our appetite, and so is our appetence, are then low and need a certain time span to reach their former levels for then inducing food-seeking behaviors, food intake, etc. again. When tolerance passes, we once more engage in this pleasurable process related to positive behavioral motivation. Opioid receptor agonists, however, may induce energy intake even beyond an actual need. This interesting potential of opioidergic signaling may have its roots in biological mechanisms that insured the intake and storage of high energy foods, hence preparing for future famines. In our world of today, however, such neurobiological pathways may pose a threat on our health. Thus, feedback mechanisms, such as tolerance, aversion and satiety, have to be finely tuned. Therefore central autoregulation that involves, for example, limbic mu receptor signaling and other endogenous signaling compounds comes into the focus of modern science. The time where research recognizes the importance of neurobiological pathways such as endogenous opiate autoregulation or CNS reward circuitries for examining the physiology of food intake has yet begun. Many questions remain open and have to be answered through future scientific inquiry. © Neuroendocrinology Letters.","Alcohol; Brain; Cocaine; Eating; Endogenous morphine; Food; Health; Nicotine; Pleasure; Reward; Stress; Wellness","endorphin; morphine; mu opiate receptor; opiate agonist; opiate receptor; appetite; autoregulation; caloric intake; central nervous system; emotion; feedback system; feeding behavior; food aversion; food intake; health status; human; hunger; motivation; neurophysiology; review; reward; satiety; satisfaction; signal transduction; survival; wellbeing; Diet; Eating; Food; Humans; Motivation; Receptors, Opioid, mu; Reward; Satiety Response",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745676984

IMCL was measured by 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and body composition was assessed with computed tomography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and magnetic resonance imaging. Plasma lipid profile and markers of glucose homeostasis were obtained. IMCL was significantly increased in tibialis anterior [135.0 ± 11.5 vs. 85.1 ± 13.2 institutional units (IU); P = 0.007] and soleus [643.7 ± 61.0 vs. 443.6 ± 47.2 IU, P = 0.017] of HIV-infected subjects compared with controls.

Triglycerides (r = 0.39, P = 0.05) and extremity fat as percentage of whole body fat by DEXA (r = -0.51, P = 0.01) correlated significantly with IMCL in the HIV but not the control group. Extremity fat (β = -633.53, P = 0.03) remained significantly associated with IMCL among HIV-infected patients, controlling for visceral abdominal fat, abdominal subcutaneous fat, and antiretroviral medications in a regression model. These data demonstrate increased IMCL in HIV-infected women with a mixed lipodystrophy pattern, being most significantly associated with reduced extremity fat. Further studies are necessary to determine the relationship between extremity fat loss and increased IMCL in HIV-infected women.

S, Jacksonville, FL 32224, United States","Fuel cell technology has in recent years won the favor of all major car manufacturers as a likely future replacement of the internal combustion engine. This has been driven by the potential for high efficiency and low emissions. Still, fuel cell engines must overcome major hurdles before being introduced into the market. One such hurdle is systems integration; in particular, with fuel cell engines that do not use hydrogen as their primary fuel. In these engines, fuels, such as methanol, are employed instead of hydrogen because of their high-energy density and ease of storage. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by the need to reform these fuels on-board the fuel cell vehicle, thus substantially increasing the complexity of the fuel cell engine. Through the course of operating a 30 ft methanol-fueled phosphoric acid fuel cell bus, repeated overheating of the steam-reformer catalyst bed at low engine power outputs was noted. For the purpose of better understanding these overheating events, relevant data was obtained from the bus. Bus operation at low-power outputs was found to have low hydrogen consumption (∼40% to ∼60% of the stack's incoming hydrogen) due to low electrical demands and reformate flow rate constraints. In the bus, the anode flue gas is burned in the reformer burner, which provides the heat required for the endothermic methanol steam reforming reaction (see Fig. 1 later). At low engine power, the flue gas is the reformer burner's only fuel, but the energy carried by the flue gas is much greater than the energy required for the reforming reaction and consequently causes reformer overheating at low power. This case serves as an example of how appropriate fuel cell system integration is crucial in order to harness fuel cell benefits. To study such system integration problems, a steady-state model of the fuel cell bus engine was developed. Using this model the bus reformer overheating problem was understood and several possible imnrovements for utilization of the flue gas were conceited.

Imidazolium salts are a subset of the general class of molten salts. They are termed ionic liquids because many have freezing points at or below room temperature. This class of salts was selected for initial study because there were many examples that were reported to be stable at high temperatures. These reports were usually based on the results of standard thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. Work by our subcontractor at the University of Alabama and at NREL showed that slow heating rates or when the temperature is held constant for long times resulted in decomposition temperatures that are much lower than those found with the usual TGA methods. We have used a TGA technique that allows calculation of the rates of thermal decomposition as a function of temperature. The results lead us to the conclusion that the imidazolium salts known to be the most thermally stable would not have useful lifetimes above about 200°C. At present this determination is based on the rough approximation that the fluid in a solar trough system experiences a constant, high temperature. Better estimates of the useful lifetime will require a system model that takes into account the time at temperature distribution of a fluid moving through the different components in a solar plant.

A well-designed sunroom has the potential to reduce the annual heating loads by one-third or more. By integrating phase change materials (PCMs) into building elements, such as floor tile and wallboard, the benefits of the sunroom can be further enhanced by providing enhanced energy storage. To maximize benefits from PCMs, an engineering analysis tool is needed to provide insight into the most efficient use of this developing technology. Thus far, modeling of the PCMs has been restricted to finite difference and finite element methods, which are not well suited to inclusion in a comprehensive annual building simulation program such as BLAST or EnergyPlus. Conduction transfer functions (CTFs) have long been used to predict transient heat conduction in such programs. Phase changes often do not occur at a single temperature, but do so over a range of temperatures. The phase change energy can be represented by an elevated heat capacity over the temperature range during which the phase change occurs. By calculating an extra set(s) of CTFs for the phase change properties, the CTF method can be extended to include the energy of phase transitions by switching between the two (or more) sets of CTFs. This method can be used to accurately predict the internal and external temperatures of PCM-containing building elements during transient heat conduction. The amount of energy storage and release during a phase transition can also be modeled with this method, although there may be some degree of inaccuracy due to switching between two or more sets of CTFs. CTFs have the potential to provide an efficient method of modeling PCMs in annual building simulation programs, but more work is needed to reduce errors associated with their use.

Due to constraints on the allowable instantaneous electrical power draw, most electric water heating systems incorporate a sizable thermal storage component. The inherently unsteady storage component therefore has an over-whelming impact on the system behavior. In this investigation, a residential-scale electric storage water heater was tested across a range of flow rates for both powered and nonpowered discharge processes as well as for charge processes with no throughflow. The flow dynamics internal to the storage volume is shown to be strongly multidimensional and transient, especially when the internal heating elements are energized. Comparison of the measured data to the performance limits of a system with a fully mixed or a perfectly stratified storage element reveals that the conventional system operates relatively near to the fully mixed limit. As a result, there appears to be significant potential for improvements in system performance through reductions in the level of thermal mixing internal to the storage volume.

Understanding the dynamics and potential adverse effects of tritium in exposed organisms is critical to evaluating risks of tritium releases at such sites. Previous studies estimated the biological half-life of tritium in mice to be approximately 1.13 d; however, these laboratory studies were not conducted under environmentally realistic conditions. In this study, designed to be more representative of environmental exposure, mice were allowed to drink water containing tritium (activity about 300 Bq/ml) for a period of 2 wk. The induction of oxidative stress from tritium exposure was evaluated by comparing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) in exposed and control mice. From this experiment, the biological half-life of tritium was determined to be 2.26 ± 0.04 d, almost double previous estimates. While positive controls (x-ray irradiated mice) showed responses in antioxidant enzyme activity, there was no indication of oxidative stress induction in mice exposed to tritium at this concentration.

Instead, adipocytes are also endocrine organs, with multiple metabolic roles in regulating whole-body physiology. Small adipocytes in lean individuals promote metabolic homeostasis; the enlarged adipocytes of obese individuals recruit macrophages and promote inflammation and the release of a range of factors that predispose toward insulin resistance. Exercise activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in muscle and other tissues, a pathway that increases fat oxidation and glucose transport. Importantly, the adipocyte hormones leptin and adiponectin also activate AMPK; remarkably, the same pathway is activated by certain antidiabetic agents such as thiazolidinediones.

To mitigate the impact of compromised nodes, we propose a suite of location-based compromise-tolerant security mechanisms. Based on a new cryptographic concept called pairing, we propose the notion of location-based keys (LBKs) by binding private keys of individual nodes to both their IDs and geographic locations. We then develop an LBK-based neighborhood authentication scheme to localize the impact of compromised nodes to their vicinity. We also present efficient approaches to establish a shared key between any two network nodes. In contrast to previous key establishment solutions, our approaches feature nearly perfect resilience to node compromise, low communication and computation overhead, low memory requirements, and high network scalability. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of LBKs in counteracting several notorious attacks against sensor networks such as the Sybil attack, the identity replication attack, and wormhole and sinkhole attacks. Finally, we propose a location-based threshold-endorsement scheme, called LTE, to thwart the infamous bogus data injection attack, in which adversaries inject lots of bogus data into the network.

One method of proof of this result (the ""lurking isometry"" method) identifies a solution U of the problem as a unitary extension of a partially defined isometry V determined by the problem data. Reformulated in terms of the graphs of V and U, solutions are identified with embeddings of an isotropic subspace of a certain Krein space K constructed from the problem data into a Lagrangian subspace (maximal isotropic subspace of K). The contribution here is the observation that this reformulation applies to other types of realization problems as well, e.g., realization of positive-real or J-contractive operator-valued functions over the unit disk (respectively over the right half plane) as the transfer function of a discrete-time (respectively, continuous-time) conservative system, i.e., an input-state-output system for which there is a quadratic storage function on the state space for which all system trajectories satisfy an energy-balance equation with respect to the appropriate supply rate on input-output pairs. The approach allows for unbounded state dynamics, unbounded input/output operators and descriptor-type state-space representations where needed in a systematic way.

Contrary to the previous view of adipose tissue as simply an inert tissue devoted to energy storage, studies over the past decade have shown that adipose tissue is actively involved in regulating physiological processes and participates in disease. Adipose tissue secretes factors that exert local and systemic effects. Leptin, pro-inflammatory cytokines, resistin and proteins involved in haemodynamic regulation and coagulation are increased in obesity while adiponectin is reduced. The production of active corticosteroids is also increased in obesity. There is now growing evidence that adipocyte secretory factors regulate energy homoeostasis, as well as cardiovascular and immune systems. Some adipocyte hormones, most notably leptin, act in the brain to influence the neuroendocrine axis and energy balance, whereas adiponectin and resistin exert opposing effects on glucose and lipids.

To elucidate these roles, we introduced a POMC transgene (Tg) that selectively restored peripheral melanocortin and corticosterone secretion in Pomc-/- mice. Rather than improving energy balance, the genetic replacement of pituitary POMC in Pomc-/-Tg+ mice aggravated their metabolic syndrome with increased caloric intake and feed efficiency, reduced oxygen consumption, increased subcutaneous, visceral, and hepatic fat, and severe insulin resistance. Pair-feeding of Pomc-/-Tg+ mice to the daily intake of lean controls normalized their rate of weight gain but did not abolish obesity, indicating that hyperphagia is a major but not sole determinant of the phenotype. Replacement of corticosterone in the drinking water of Pomc -/- mice recapitulated the hyperphagia, excess weight gain and fat accumulation, and hyperleptinemia characteristic of genetically rescued Pomc-/-Tg+ mice. These data demonstrate that CNS POMC peptides play a critical role in energy homeostasis that is not substituted by peripheral POMC. Restoration of pituitary POMC expression to create a de facto neuronal POMC deficiency exacerbated the development of obesity, largely via glucocorticoid modulation of appetite, metabolism, and energy partitioning.",,"corticosterone; glucocorticoid; insulin; proopiomelanocortin; water; animal experiment; animal model; article; body fat; body fat distribution; caloric intake; controlled study; dietary intake; disease exacerbation; disease severity; energy balance; female; fluid intake; food intake; hormone release; hyperleptinemia; hyperphagia; hypophysis; insulin resistance; lean body weight; lipid storage; liver; male; metabolic disorder; metabolism; mouse; nerve cell; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; priority journal; proopiomelanocortin deficiency; protein expression; protein function; subcutaneous fat; transgene; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32444449631

Many such systems require portability and wireless communication capabilities, and thus face severe limitations in size and power consumption. This places a premium on integration and efficiency, and favors software solutions for video functionality over specialized hardware. Apart from computation, an equally important problem in video decoding is the data bandwidth and the need to insure adequate data supply. MPEG data sets are very large, and generate significant amounts of excess memory traffic for standard data caches, up to 100 times the amount required for decoding. Yet MPEG data has locality which caches can exploit if properly optimized, providing fast, flexible, and automatic data supply. We propose a set of enhancements which target the specific needs of the heterogeneous types within the MPEG decoder working set. These optimizations significantly improve the efficiency of small caches, reducing cache-memory traffic by almost 70%, and can make an enhanced 4-kB cache perform better than a standard 1 MB cache. This performance improvement can enable high-resolution, full frame rate video playback in cheaper, smaller systems than would otherwise be possible. © 2006 IEEE.","Cache memories; Multimedia computing; Video codecs; Video coding; Video signal processing","Multimedia computing; Power consumption; Video codecs; Video playback; Bandwidth; Buffer storage; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Image coding; Optimization; Wireless telecommunication systems; Video signal processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344451327

Somma-Vesuvius volcano produced from 25 ky BP to 1944 AD are part of an extensive database documenting the geochemical evolution of this classic region. Volcanic rocks include silica undersaturated, potassic and ultrapotassic lavas and tephras characterized by variable mineralogy and different crystal abundance, as well as by wide ranges of trace element contents and a wide span of initial Sr-isotopic compositions. Both the degree of undersaturation in silica and the crystal content increase through time, being higher in rocks produced after the eruption at 472 AD (Pollena eruption). Compositional variations have been generally thought to reflect contributions from diverse types of mantle and crust. Magma mixing is commonly invoked as a fundamental process affecting the magmas, in addition to crystal fractionation. Our assessment of geochemical and Sr-isotopic data indicates that compositional variability also reflects the influence of crustal contamination during magma evolution during upward migration to shallow crustal levels and/or by entrapment of crystal mush generated during previous magma storage in the crust. Using a variant of the assimilation fractional crystallization model (Energy Conservation-Assimilation Fractional Crystallization; [Spera and Bohrson, 2001.

Somma-Vesuvius in the last 8 ky BP. Contamination in the mid- to upper crust occurred repeatedly, after the magma chamber waxed with influx of new mantle- and crustal-derived magmas and fluids, and waned as a result of magma withdrawal and production of large and energetic plinian and subplinian eruptions. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Positive ions are attracted to electron beams and create a nonlinear potential in the vicinity of the beam which can lead to beam halo, particle loss, optical errors or transverse and longitudinal instabilities. In an energy recovery linac (ERL) where beam-loss has to be minimal, and where beam positions and emittances have to be very stable in time, these ion effects have to be avoided. Here we investigate three measures of avoiding ion accumulation: (a) A long gap between linac bunch trains that allows ions to drift out of the beam region, a measure regularly applied in linacs; (b) a short ion clearing gap in the beam that leads to a time varying beam potential and produces large excited oscillations of ions around the electron beam, a measure regularly applied in storage rings; (c) Clearing electrodes that create a sufficient voltage to draw ions out of the beam potential, a measure used for DC electron beams and for antiproton beams.

Since spider silks are known as energy dissipating materials, we investigated this trap to find out where the energy is stored. Using previously measured material properties, we modeled the gumfoot thread as a damped harmonic oscillator and compared it to high speed video analysis of prey capture. These measurements show that the gumfoot thread is plastically deformed during prey capture and cannot be the site of energy storage. We then measured the material properties of scaffolding silk that makes up the upper portion of the cob web. Scaffolding silk is highly resilient (90%) at strains less than 3%. This energy storage is sufficient to drive the oscillations seen in prey capture and is consistent with the measured kinematics.

In addition, dealing with the possibility of intentional (i.e., a terrorist act) or accidental release of radioactive material in a populated area requires an accurate understanding of the nature of the association of such material with structural surfaces. These surfaces must also be considered in the context of repeated contamination, and the importance of atmospheric exposure, interaction with other possible contaminants, and corrosion or surface degradation due to such exposure must be taken into account. Complementary spectroscopic techniques, especially surface spectroscopies, are essential in developing models for the interaction of contaminants with surfaces and interfaces. In this review (which also presents new data on uranium association with corroding steel surfaces), we collect models of this association as determined by spectroscopic techniques, assess the important considerations in the development of more accurate models, and address some of the questions which remain. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Operating cost savings were attained with the proposed control approach compared with conventional building control; however, the savings are lower than for the case of model-based predictive optimal control As for the case of model-based predictive control, the performance of the hybrid controller is largely affected by the quality of the training model, and extensive real-time learning is required for the learning controller to eliminate any false cues it receives during the initial training period. Nevertheless, compared with standard reinforcement learning, the proposed hybrid controller is much more readily implemented in a commercial building. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

When reheated, the original shape can be recovered. Relatively little work in the literature has addressed the constitutive modeling of the unique thermomechanical coupling in SMPs. Constitutive models are critical for predicting the deformation and recovery of SMPs under a range of different constraints. In this study, the thermomechanics of shape storage and recovery of an epoxy resin is systematically investigated for small strains (within ±10%) in uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression. After initial pre-deformation at a high temperature, the strain is held constant for shape storage while the stress evolution is monitored. Three cases of heated recovery are selected: unconstrained free strain recovery, stress recovery under full constraint at the pre-deformation strain level (no low temperature unloading), and stress recovery under full constraint at a strain level fixed at a low temperature (low temperature unloading). The free strain recovery results indicate that the polymer can fully recover the original shape when reheated above its glass transition temperature (Tg). Due to the high stiffness in the glassy state (T &lt; Tg), the evolution of the stress under strain constraint is strongly influenced by thermal expansion of the polymer. The relationship between the final recoverable stress and strain is governed by the stress-strain response of the polymer above Tg. Based on the experimental results and the molecular mechanism of shape memory, a three-dimensional small-strain internal state variable constitutive model is developed. The model quantifies the storage and release of the entropic deformation during thermomechanical processes. The fraction of the material freezing a temporary entropy state is a function of temperature, which can be determined by fitting the free strain recovery response. A free energy function for the model is formulated and thermodynamic consistency is ensured. The model can predict the stress evolution of the uniaxial experimental results. The model captures differences in the tensile and compressive recovery responses caused by thermal expansion. The model is used to explore strain and stress recovery responses under various flexible external constraints that would be encountered in applications of SMPs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Both protect the surface of the magnetic layer from contact with the read-write head flying over the disk surface. Although the most commonly used carbon films are amorphous hydrogenated carbon, a-CH x, it has been suggested that the thermal properties of amorphous fluorinated carbon films, a-CF x, might be superior. This work has probed the interaction of small fluorinated ethers and alcohols with the surfaces of a-CF x films to understand the effects of carbon film fluorination on the interaction of the lubricant with its surface. Temperature-programmed desorption was used to measure the desorption energies of small fluorocarbons from the a-CF x surface and to compare their desorption energies with those from the surfaces of a-CH x films. These measurements reveal that, similarly to a-CH x films, a-CF x films expose a heterogeneous surface on which fluorocarbons adsorb at sites with a range of binding energies. The fluorocarbon ethers all have lower heats of adsorption than their hydrocarbon counterparts, suggesting that the ethers adsorb by donation of electron density from the oxygen lone-pair electrons to sites on the surface. Fluorinated alcohols have roughly the same heats of adsorption as their hydrocarbon counterparts. There is little significant difference between the interactions of fluorinated ethers (or alcohols) with the surfaces of either a-CF x or a-CH x films. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Fluorinated ethers; Fluorocarbon ethers; Temperature-programmed desorption; Alcohols; Amorphous materials; Ethers; Fluid structure interaction; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogenation; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33344469033

The simulation reproduces the dependence of luminosity on bunch current that is measured in the storage ring, at both high-energy (5.3 GeV/beam) and in the wiggler-dominated low energy (CESR-c) configuration (1.9 GeV/beam). Dynamics are determined entirely by the physics of propagation through the individual guide field elements with no free parameters. Energy dependence of the compensation of the transverse coupling introduced by the experimental solenoid is found to significantly degrade specific luminosity. The simulation also indicates a strong dependence of limiting beam-beam tune shift parameter on the geometric mean of synchrotron tune and bunch length. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32044436516

The catalyst-doped magnesium was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Catalysts of nano-meter size were uniformly deposited on the outer surface of the magnesium particles. The hydrogen storage and hydrogen release properties of magnesium and catalysts-doped magnesium were measured in situ by the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), and also by the volumetric method. Both the hydrogen absorption and hydrogen release kinetics of magnesium were significantly improved by doping the nano-particle catalysts. Among the three metals-doped and examined, palladium showed the best catalytic effect.

The composites were characterized by FT-TR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (X-EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and three-point bending flexural tests. TriSilanolPhenyl-POSS was throughly dispersed into uncured liquid PT-15 resin. After curing, XRD, SANS, and X-EDS measurements were consistent with partial molecular dispersion of a portion of the POSS units in the continuous matrix phase while the remainder forms POSS aggregates. Larger aggregates are formed at higher loadings. SANS, SEM, and TEM show that POSS-enriched nanoparticles are present in the PT-15/POSS composites. The storage bending moduli, E′, and the glass transition temperatures, T g, of PT-15/POSS 99/1, 97/3, and 95/5 composites are higher than those of the pure PT-15 over the temperature range from 35 to 350 °C. The E′ values for all these composites (except for the 15 wt % POSS sample) are significantly greater than that of the pure resin at T &gt; T g. Therefore, small amounts (&lt;5 wt%) of TriSilanolPhenyl-POSS incorporated into cyanate ester resin PT-15 can improve the storage modulus and the hightemperature properties of these cyanate ester composites versus the pure PT-15 resin. The flexural strength and flexural modulus are also raised by POSS incorporation. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Cyanate ester composites; Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS); Bending strength; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Nanostructured materials; Oligomers; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray scattering; Esters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644560298

While triacylglycerols, the primary storage lipid of terrestrial animals, are found in almost all zooplankton species, wax esters are the dominant storage lipid in many deep-living and polar zooplankton taxa. Phospholipids and diacylglycerol ethers are the unique storage lipids used by polar euphausiids and pteropods, respectively. In zooplankton with large stores of wax esters, triacylglycerols are more rapidly turned over and used for short-term energy needs, while wax esters serve as long-term energy deposits. Zooplankton groups found in polar, westerlies, upwelling and coastal biomes are characterized by accumulation of large lipid stores. In contrast, zooplankton from the trades/tropical biomes is mainly composed of omnivorous species with only small lipid reserves. Diapausing copepods, which enter deep water after feeding on phytoplankton during spring/summer blooms or at the end of upwelling periods, are characterized by large oil sacs filled with wax esters. The thermal expansion and compressibility of wax esters may allow diapausing copepods and other deep-water zooplankton to be neutrally buoyant in cold deep waters, and they can thus avoid spending energy to remain at these depths. Lipid droplets are often noted in zooplankton ovaries, and a portion of these droplets can be transferred to developing oocytes. In addition to lipid droplets, zooplankton eggs have yolks with lipovitellin, a lipoprotein with approximately equal amounts of protein and lipid. The lipovitellin lipid is predominantly phosphatidylcholine, so during reproduction females must convert a portion of their storage lipid into this phospholipid. Developing embryos use their lipovitellin and lipid droplets for energy and materials until feeding begins. The various functions storage lipids serve during the different life history stages of zooplankton are very complex and still not fully understood and hence offer a multitude of fascinating research perspectives. © Inter-Research 2006.","Biomes; Diapause; Lipids; Ontogeny; Reproduction; Triacylglycerols; Wax esters; Zooplankton","diapause; ontogeny; Animalia; Copepoda; Euphausiidae; Pteropoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644512475

The dianions were stored in an electrostatic ring and their decay by electron emission was measured up to 1 s after injection. While C70 2- ions are stable on this time scale, except for a small fraction of the ions which have been excited by gas collisions, most of the C60 2- ions decay on a millisecond time scale, with a lifetime depending strongly on their internal temperature. The results can be modeled as decay by electron tunneling through a Coulomb barrier, mainly from thermally populated triplet states about 120 meV above a singlet ground state. At times longer than about 100 ms, the absorption of blackbody radiation plays an important role for the decay of initially cold ions. The tunneling rates obtained from the modeling, combined with WKB estimates of the barrier penetration, give a ground-state energy 200±30 meV above the energy of the monoanion plus a free electron and a ground-state lifetime of the order of 20 s. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Dianions; Electrospray; Gas collisions; Monoanions; Absorption; Coulomb blockade; Electron emission; Electron tunneling; Electrostatics; Negative ions; Sodium; Vapors; Fullerenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30744433850

We find 14 candidates consistent with Bs decays into final states with a J/ψ or a Ds(*)-. The probability that we have observed a background fluctuation is less than 8×10-10. We have established that at the energy of the Υ(5S) resonance Bs production proceeds predominantly through the creation of Bs*B̄s* pairs. We find σ(e+e-→Bs*B̄s*)=[0.11-0.03+0.04(stat)±0.02(syst)]nb, and set the following limits: σ(e+e-→BsB̄s)/σ (e+e-→Bs*B̄s*)<0.16 and [σ(e+e-→BsB̄s*) +σ(e+e-→Bs*B̄s)]/σ(e+e-→Bs*B̄ s*)<0.16 (90% C.L.). The mass of the Bs* meson is measured to be MBs*=[5.414±0.001(stat)±0.003(syst)]GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,"Bs decays; Bs Production; Cornell Electron Storage Ring; Elementary particles; Probability; Resonance; High energy physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32844473847

The calculated binding energies of 0.2-0.6eV/H2 is suited for reversible hydrogen storage at near standard conditions. The calculated H2 sorption process is barrierless, which could also significantly simplify the kinetics for the storage. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,"Adsorption; Doping (additives); Fullerenes; Kinetic theory; Molecules; Monte Carlo methods; Light-element-doped fullerenes; Nondissociative adsorption; Quantum the; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32644466194

We have observed betatron resonances in an ultracold-atom storage ring and found these resonances to cause the near-elimination of the longitudinal dispersion of atomic beams propagating at resonant velocities. This effect can improve atom-interferometric devices.

The analysis of kinetic properties presented here is based on the method of exponential peeling. It is seen that the presence of misch metal (Mm) in the alloy samples dramatically decreases their rate of decrepitation and increases their cyclic stability. However, the increased concentration of misch metal in the samples has an adverse effect on their hydrogen storage capacity and their reaction rate. The hydrogen storage properties also vary with reaction temperature. The best hydrogen absorption kinetics are observed at temperatures around 300 °C and the desorption kinetics are quite fast at temperatures of 400 °C and above. The hydrogen desorption activation energy of Mg-x wt.% Mm hydride is much lower than that of MgH2. The pressure-composition- isotherm (P-C-T) plots of the samples at 300-420 °C indicate that the alloys possess good cyclic stability but very poor reversibility, making the study of their thermodynamic properties difficult. The P-C-T plots also indicate that the increase of the concentration of the misch metal's rare earths leads to an increase of the hydrogen equilibrium pressure and decrease of hydrogen storage capacity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The detailed CB model is determined based on its material, geometry, speed and preload using the nonlinear Hertzian load-deflection formula, and the thermal growths of bearing components during the rotor drop are estimated using a 1D thermal model. A finite-element squeeze film damper provides the pressure profile of an annular oil film and the resulting viscous damping force. Numerical simulations of an energy storage flywheel with magnetic suspensions failed reveal that an optimal CB design using the detailed simulation models stabilizes the rotor drop dynamics and lowers the thermal growths while preventing the high-speed backward whirl.

This decision often involved a tradeoff between distant, but fertile, alluvial soils and nearby erosion-prone hillsides of relatively low fertility. The key role of travel and transportation costs in this case makes it well suited to analysis using central place foraging theory. The classical model of central place foraging developed within behavioral ecology assumes that animals that transport food to a secure area before consuming it tend to maximize the rate of delivery of energy to this central place; energy acquired after accounting for the costs of round-trip travel and transport. Central place foraging theory is used to structure a quantitative simulation of subsistence options available to a prehistoric group that used the Courthouse Rock shelter as a storage location. This simulation estimates the economic outcomes expected from alternative choices of crop species (Iva annua vs. Chenopodium berlandieri), ecological status (uncultivated vs. domesticated), and habitat (floodplain vs. upland) in a specific environmental setting. Results indicate that the floodplain habitat offers superior return rates for both plants when harvested seeds are transported to Courthouse Rock, despite the costs of travel. Iva annua (sumpweed) collected in the floodplain habitat is more profitable than chenopod at this distance, irrespective of whether the plants harvested are domesticated or wild. Greater distances favor a switch to hillside cultivation of chenopod, but not of sumpweed, which loses much of its competitive edge when it is grown in upland settings. These results suggest it is unlikely that either floodplain or hillside farming was consistently superior economically, and that in some situations, cultivation had no significant advantage over harvesting wild stands. © 2006 by The Regents of the University of California.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36749029507

Non-propulsion or parasitic loads in a large truck account for a significant percentage of overall engine load, leading to reductions in overall vehicle fuel economy. Electrification of parasitic loads offers a way of minimizing non-propulsion engine loads, using the full motive force of the engine for propulsion and maximizing vehicle fuel economy. This paper covers the integration and testing of electrified accessories, powered by a fuel cell auxiliary power unit (APU) in a Class 8 tractor. It is a continuation of the efforts initially published in SAE paper 2005-01-0016. Electrified accessories include the engine cooling system, complete with electric water pump and radiator fans; the cabin air conditioning system, including compressor, remote condenser, and fan; and the vehicle compressed air supply system. A 20 kW fuel cell APU supplies 42 VDC power for all electrified accessories. A 34.5 MPa compressed hydrogen storage and supply system, with a capacity of five kg of hydrogen, supplies the APU. Product water from the fuel cell is collected and used as an evaporative-cooling assist for the engine charge air cooler and radiator, thereby minimizing cooling fan-on time. A 42/14 dual-voltage high-efficiency alternator is used to replace the OEM alternator, to provide an alternate source of 42 VDC in the event that the fuel cell is inoperative. For each electrified accessory, a system description is provided detailing the physical configuration, subsystem design, control strategies, and a summary of energy savings. An overall summary of energy savings during an unloaded (bobtail) cross-country trip is provided.

These platforms include electric vehicles, high altitude airships, and electrically powered unmanned aerial vehicles all of which have the potential to significantly affect the United States commercial and military economies. Mobile Energy Products Inc. (MEPI) is developing advanced bipolar lithium ion cell chemistry that has the potential to bring into being batteries that have a specific energy greater than 400 watt hours per kilogram. MEPI is working with the Energy Storage Research Group (ESRG) of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey to develop such a chemistry based on nanocomposite materials. The cell chemistry when incorporated into MEPI bipolar lithium ion technology is expected to yield batteries that can produce power over a wide temperature range at reasonable current rates. Although initial testing indicates that cells with a moderate cycle life will be initially produced, it is expected that the nanocomposite material has the potential with further development to produce cells which have long cycle life and good shelf life which will allow the batteries to have a long useful life. Because the bipolar lithium ion fabrication technology is based on proven commercial processes and utilizes inexpensive raw materials the batteries are expected to be cost competitive in the commercial and military markets. This paper will present design data that will show the characteristics and the capabilities of the advanced bipolar lithium ion cells to meet the requirements for developing batteries which can enable batteries with a specific energy greater than 400 watt-hours per kilogram over a range of temperatures.

There are several challenges that must be overcome in order to establishing a ""hydrogen economy"", including the development of a practical, efficient, and cost-effective power conversion device. Using hydrogen as a fuel for internal combustion engines is a huge step toward developing a large-scale hydrogen infrastructure. This paper summarizes the testing of a hydrogen powered pick-up truck on a chassis dynamometer. The vehicle is powered by a port-injected 8-cylinder engine with an integrated supercharger and intercooler. The 4-wheel drive chassis dynamometer is equipped with a hydrogen delivery, metering and safety system as well as hydrogen specific instrumentation. This instrumentation includes numerous sensors, includes a wide-band lambda sensor and an exhaust gas hydrogen analyzer. This analyzer quantifies the amount of unburned hydrogen in the exhaust indicating the completeness of the combustion. Transient analysis of efficiency and emissions trends in dynamic engine behavior is possible since all the data is recorded at a frequency of 10 Hz. The standard emissions bench provides information on the transient emissions behavior, for hydrogen engines, NOx values are of specific interest. The vehicle was tested on a variety of drive cycles. The performance was measured by running accelerations at wide open throttle while recording vehicle speed. The unique properties of hydrogen as a fuel make it possible for the engine to be operated in a wide range of air/fuel ratios. This paper focuses on the influence of the global air/fuel ratio in a constant-phi lean burn operating strategy. Air/fuel ratio is also known to have crucial influence on engine efficiency and emissions. In order to quantitatively define the influence on efficiency and emissions, the same drive cycle was run at different air/fuel ratios. The cycle-based emission and efficiency data is also compared to the performance at each air/fuel ratio.

The gradient of sulfur deposit, together with different L/R cycling combinations for the deSOx mode was critical to develop the efficient sulfur removal strategies. The model considered energy and mass balances during sulfur adsorption and desorption modes to predict the catalyst temperature and the amount of sulfur adsorbed and removed. HC and CO oxidation reactions as well as the oxygen storage were considered to estimate heat generated by the exothermic reactions.

Although ultracapacitors are becoming cost competitive with NiMH batteries, the technology is not yet capable of replacing the battery alone. However, the combination of an inexpensive lead acid battery and an ultracapacitor may indeed become competitive with the NiMH in performance and cost. Although lead acids have a lower energy density, their main problem for HEV usage has been the issue of sulfation during partial-state-of-charge operation. However, in this new system the lead acid battery can be maintained close to 100% state of charge to reduce sulfation and thus lengthen the lifetime of the battery. Two different methods for charging the battery are also shown along with experimental results.

The vehicle's powertrain consists of an Engine-Generator Unit (EGU), a buffer for energy storage (such as an electric battery), and a traction motor driving the wheels. The control strategy is developed so that to ensure gradual operation of the EGU along the steady-state Optimal Operating Points Line (OOP-Line) in the engine speed-torque map. The strategy functions as follows. It first determines a set-point for the state of charge of the energy buffer to minimize the probability of either discharging or overcharging it. This probability is estimated based on the statistics derived from the past history of the state of charge. Based on the difference between this set-point and estimated state of charge, the strategy calculates the power demand from the EGU which is then translated into engine torque and engine rotation speed demand so that the engine operation is maintained on the OOP-Line while delivering the requested power. The torque demand is delivered by the engine management system through the control of an engine electronic throttle while the generator voltage is adjusted to control the engine speed to the desired value. A simulation study, based on a control-oriented model of a series hybrid powertrain, is reported to illustrate the basic ideas. We also demonstrate via theoretical analysis that by periodically modulating the power output of the EGU the fuel consumption can be improved in the region where this fuel consumption is a concave function of the EGU power output. The series hybrid powertrain configuration is also relevant for fuel cells applications, and some of our considerations also extend to that case.

The introduction of computer controlled electro-mechanical valves, radiator fans, and coolant pumps require mathematic models and real time algorithms to implement intelligent thermal control strategies for prescribed engine temperature tracking. Smart butterfly valves can replace the traditional wax-based thermostat to control the coolant flow based on both engine temperature and operating conditions. The electric water pump and radiator fan replace the mechanically driven components to reduce unnecessary engine loads at high speeds and provide better cooling at low speeds. However, implementation of electro-mechanical actuators including the alternator and electrical storage devices introduces inefficiencies in mechanical to electrical energy conversion (and electrical to mechanical energy conversion), which may require increased fuel consumption over pure mechanical components. Empirical models can provide realistic component data used in simulation tools during the development process, and also define the basis for cooling system control algorithms. In this paper, a general framework to derive these empirical models is investigated for thermal management systems where the engine temperature must be accurately controlled in both steady state and transient operation. The evolution of automotive cooling systems also requires a paradigm shift in the engine block design. The design changes include isolated cylinder water jackets, temperature sensor arrays, and distributed smart valves to enable distinct cylinder-by-cylinder temperature maintenance for optimum combustion. This paper explores the introduction of a 'coolant rail' to accommodate specific cylinder temperature control defined by an on-demand cylinder dependent cooling strategy.

One of the projects under the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels - Diesel Emission Controls (APBF-DEC) activity focused on the development of a light-duty passenger car with an integrated NOx (oxides of nitrogen) adsorber catalyst (NAC) and diesel particle filter (DPF) technology. Vehicle emissions tests on this platform showed the great potential of the system, achieving the Tier 2 Bin 5 emission standards with new, but degreened emission control systems. The platform development and control strategies for this project were presented in 2004-01-0581 [1]. The main disadvantage of the NOx adsorber technology is its susceptibility to sulfur poisoning. The fuel- and lubrication oil-borne sulfur is converted into sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the combustion process and is adsorbed by the active sites of the NAC. As a result, they are unavailable for NOx storage. This leads to a drop in system performance. In order to recover the active sites, the bound sulfates need to be released. The necessary conditions for sulfate release are relatively high temperatures in combination with rich exhaust gas conditions. This process is often referred to as desulfurization. After the completion of the development phase, the emission control system was aged with 15-ppm sulfur diesel fuel to a full useful life (120,000 miles) condition. During the course of this aging, intermittent desulfurizations were carried out. The desulfurizations were preceded and followed by evaluation procedures to allow a detailed analysis of the desulfurization effects. Desulfurizations were performed every 150 hours up to 300 hours, every 100 hours up to 1,600 hours, and every 50 hours to the end of aging at 2,200 hours. This paper analyzes the effects on gaseous emissions, before and after desulfurization, over transient driving cycles such as the light-duty Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75). The results indicate a high degree of recovery, maintaining a low level of tailpipe emissions over the useful lifetime (120,000 miles) of the emission control system.

These advantages make the bipolar NiMH a logical choice for Army Silent Watch applications, where it is essential to maximize energy and minimize weight and volume. Through programs with Army Cecom EEI has successfully built a high energy battery system that would replace existing lead acid batteries and provide silent watch operation for an extended period of time. In addition, the bipolar Silent Watch battery offers reduced volume and weight over fuel cells considered for this application. EEI's internal safety/control system allows the battery to serve as a drop-in replacement for many applications requiring silent watch operation. By monitoring cell pressures and module temperatures, the individual battery packs within the modules are controlled and dropped in and out of use, resulting in safe operation and limited down time.

As an excellent Hydrogen gas sorbent, it increases the usable storage capacity of a gas cylinder by ∼25% at 3500 PSI and by ∼150% at 500 PSI. Our ongoing NASA Langley funded study shows that when a sorbent-filled tank is charged with hydrogen, it provides shielding superior to polyethylene against most types of ionizing particles. Even as hydrogen is consumed, the carbon and tank ensure that significant radiation shielding capability is maintained. Vastly improved radiation shielding is a clear requirement for a potential manned mission to Mars or a long-duration base on the surface of the Moon. However, current shielding technologies are predicated upon systems dedicated solely to the task of shielding. Such single-use material adds substantially to the mass, and therefore expense, of space operations, without otherwise helping to accomplish mission objectives. One approach to remedy these conflicting constraints is to modify other ship (or EVA suit) systems to maximize their radiation shielding properties, while still serving their primary purposes. Our carbon sorbent material takes this approach. Its performance in this key energy system application is excellent and the carbon itself is a better radiation shield against GCR's and SEP's than the excess Aluminum it can replace.

However, a major obstacle for vehicle utilization of hydrogen as a main fuel is onboard storage. Due to the low mass density, hydrogen has the lowest energy per unit volume among all potential fuels. One of the typical methods to store hydrogen is in very high pressure storage tanks. The high pressure (35 MPa and higher) combined with small size of hydrogen molecules makes the tanks and adjacent fittings prone to leakage, which may cause important potential safety issues, given the wide combustion range and easy ignition of hydrogen. Our research focuses on characterizing the relative importance of basic modes of hydrogen leakage at the joints of commercial stainless steel fittings. Two types of fittings that include National Pipe Thread Standard (NPT) screw treads and standard compression fitting ferrules are modeled as a capillary duct with the same hydraulic diameter (height of the duct). The flow rate through the contacting faces is determined and correlated to the differential pressure drop, thread treatment, torque, and temperature. The analytical models from the viscous flow regime to free-molecular flow regime are derived. We compare the analytical formulation in the slip flow regime with previous experimental results for nitrogen and helium, and then apply this analytical model to predict the hydrogen leakage at the high pressure ratio condition. An experiment extending these results to hydrogen is also reported in the paper, and the results are compared with the analytical prediction.

Using this design approach, Electro Energy Inc. is developing and demonstrating batteries for multiple transportation applications including electric scooters, peaking batteries for hybrid electric vehicles, and high energy batteries for plug-in hybrids and various configurations of electric buses. For the hybrid peaking battery application the Toyota Prius was used as the test bed.

For the plug-in hybrid application the Toyota Prius is also being used as the test bed. The bipolar battery consists of six modules containing 7.5 kWh of energy storage, and gives the vehicle an all-electric range of approximately 25 miles. Through programs with the Department of Energy and Sandia National Laboratories, and collaborations with utility companies, EEI has successfully built high voltage power and energy battery systems and integrated them with existing UPS and inverter systems. EEI's unique safety/control system allows relatively seamless integration with existing applications.

Advances in storage ring technology, as explained in the Guest Editorial for this special New Source issue by Kwang-Je Kim, is rapidly approaching the point of diminishing returns. It is expected that within a few years storage ring technology will have matured to the point where it will become exceptionally difficult and expensive to make further significant improvements to the X-ray beam quality. In contrast, linac-based sources such as energy recovery linacs (ERLs) and X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) are at an early stage of development, and provide a clear path for dramatically improving X-ray beam qualities that is likely to continue for many years. ERLs promise to generate bright electron beams, and thus X-rays, with dramatically smaller emittances and pulse durations than those available from storage rings, the present workhorse technology for all existing hard X-ray synchrotron radiation sources.

This paper projects energy use and GHG emissions from different FC vehicle configurations and compares these values to the projected characteristics of similarly sized and performing gasoline and diesel fueled automobiles on a life cycle, well to wheels and cradle to grave basis. Our analysis suggests that for the next 20 or more years, new internal combustion engine (ICE) hybrid drive train vehicles can achieve similar levels of reduction in energy use and GHG emissions compared to hydrogen FC vehicles, if the hydrogen is derived from natural gas. The fleet impact of more fuel-efficient vehicles depends on the time it takes for new technology to (i) become competitive, (ii) increase its share of the new vehicles produced, and finally (iii) penetrate significantly into the vehicle fleet. Since the lead times for bringing improved ICE vehicle technology into production are the shortest, its impact on vehicle fleet energy use and emissions could be significant in 20-30 years, about half the time required for hydrogen FC vehicles to have a similar impact. Full emission reduction potential of FC vehicles can only be achieved when hydrogen is derived from zero or very low-carbon releasing production processes on a large scale-an option that further increases the impact leadtime. Thus, a comprehensive short- and long-term strategy for reducing automobile energy use and emissions should include both the continuous improvement of ICE vehicles and simultaneous research and development of hydrogen FC cars. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this scheme, only nucleic acids actually contain information that is encoded in the specific sequence of nucleotides that make up the DNA or RNA. Cells can construct proteins from the information contained in nucleic acids, but the transfer of information is one way; cells do not have the capacity to reproduce nucleic acid sequence information from proteins alone. While it is known that RNA performs more than just information functions,2 proteins are still thought to be the primary working molecules in a cell carrying out diverse functions related to energy management, immune response, structure, transport and storage, signal transduction, cell division, etc. Thus, implicit in the Central Dogma are mechanisms for the tightly controlled regulation of mRNA and thus protein amount, one of several mechanisms through which the cell maintains strict control over the final activity of a protein. On a grander scale, the integrated transcriptional activity of the entire genome (the entire DNA sequence in an organism) to a great extent determines the nature of a cell and its interactions with other cells in an organism or with the environment. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057684258

For this reason circuit components commonly used at lower frequencies, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, are not readily available above 10 GHz. The available microwave frequency lumped elements have dimensions of around 1 mm. The relationship between the wavelength and physical dimensions enables new classes of distributed components to be constructed that have no analogy at lower frequencies. Components are realized by disturbing the field structure on a transmission line, resulting in energy storage and thus reactive effects. Electric (E) field disturbances have a capacitive effect and the magnetic (H) field disturbances appear inductive. Microwave components are fabricated in waveguide, coaxial lines, and strip lines. The majority of circuits are constructed using strip lines as the cost is relatively low and they are highly reproducible due to the photolithographic techniques used. Fabrication of waveguide components requires precision machining but they can tolerate higher power levels and are more easily realized at millimeter-wave frequencies (30 to 300 GHz) than either coaxial or microstrip components. © 2006 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056933208

The quality of processed foods depends not only upon the initial integrity of the raw materials but also on the changes occurring during processing and subsequent storage that may result in potential losses and decreased bioavailability. Emphasis is growing in the area of nutraceuticals and fortified high-energy foods (Giese, 1995; Molyneau and Lee, 1998; Sloan, 1999, 2005). Trends also indicate that fortification of food products has increased tremendously in the past years in multiple categories, including beverages, meals, biscuits, etc. Not only is the nutritional quality important to the food processor, but also the general appearance of the food, its flavor, color, and texture, factors which are highly dependent upon the target consumer. It is, therefore, of critical importance to the food industry to minimize losses of quality in food products during processing and subsequent storage. It is through the development of mathematical models to predict behavior of food components and optimization of processes for maximum product quality that continued advancement can be achieved. To obtain these goals, extensive information is needed on the rates of destruction of quality parameters and their dependence on variables such as temperature, pH, light, oxygen, and moisture content. A food engineer can then develop new processing techniques to achieve optimum product quality based on an understanding of reaction rates and mechanisms of destruction of individual quality factors combined with heat and mass transfer information. The need for this type of information has become critically important to the food industry with required nutritional labeling for food products. © 2006 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Biochemistry; Food storage; Mass transfer; Processed foods; Quality control; Reaction rates; Consumer demands; Food components; Food processors; Heat and mass transfer; Nutritional qualities; Processing technique; Quality parameters; Versatile methods; Thermal processing (foods)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034644373

It also continues to play an important role in the diagnosis and management of breast cancers. X‐ray mammography has relied on the use of high resolution screen/film combinations. Such techniques, although improved over the years, have the drawbacks of all the inconveniences and inflexibility associated with the use of film for image acquisition, storage and display. Motivated by search for better image quality and a general move towards filmless radiology, various digital mammography techniques have been developed, investigated and commercialized. These techniques can be largely divided into four types: amorphous silicon and selenium flat panel detector, amorphous silicon and cesium iodide flat panel detector, CCD and cesium iodide based slot scanning system, and storage phosphor imaging technique with dual‐side image read out. Each of these systems has its unique advantages and disadvantages and achieves various degrees of clinical implementation. Typical of all digital mammography techniques is the potential compatibility with digital image archival, retrieval and distribution systems. Furthermore, the acquisition of breast images in digital format has begun to facilitate the development and investigation of many advanced imaging techniques. Among them, dual‐energy mammography techniques have been developed to quantify breast tissue composition or to separate calcifications from the overlying tissue structures. Stereo‐mammography has been developed to use two projection views to provide a 3‐D perspective of the breast tissue structures, thus reducing the problem of overlapping structures. Tomosynthesis imaging pushes the idea of 3‐D imaging further by acquiring 10–25 projection views and use them to synthesize images to depict the breast structures as a number of thick layers. More recently, cone beam breast CT has been developed and investigated to scan the breast in a dedicated manner and provide true 3‐D images of the breast. Along a different direction, the development and investigation of various contrast mammography techniques have allowed x‐ray imaging to be used to image and study breast vasculatures as possible indication of breast cancer. In this presentation, we will try to achieve the following educational objectives: 1. Review the development and investigation of major digital mammography techniques. 2. Review the development and investigation of various advanced breast x‐ray imaging techniques.

The challenge of setting priorities, whether in the corporate board room or in government, comes down to the capability of estimating vulnerabilities of critical services and the risks that these vulnerabilities might be exploited to generate consequences. Assessment methods for threat, vulnerability, consequence, and overall risk thus must have a very high priority in a national strategy for critical infrastructure protection. As noted in the previous chapter, as early as 1998 the Department of Energy began investing the talents of its national laboratories in the development and fielding of such methods. This chapter explores some of the progress that has been made in the quest for useful assessment methods through the eyes of one such laboratory. Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, discussed in the previous chapter, identified the Department of Energy (DOE) as the lead agency for security in the electric power and oil and gas production and storage sectors. In response to the directive, the DOE Office of Energy Assurance established a vulnerability assessment program in 1998. This program was staffed by technical experts from DOE's National Laboratory complex and tasked with following up on the work the laboratories had done over the previous two years in support of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection and PDD 63, with field assessments in the assigned sectors. © Cambridge University Press 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927042239

It is required by most cells for oxidative and nonoxidative ATP production and serves as a precursor for other carbon-containing compounds. It is the primary fuel used for several specialized cells and is the major fuel used by the brain. Its storage in the liver as glycogen provides a means by which glucose homeostasis can be maintained, particularly during the neonatal period. The fetal requirement for glucose is met almost, if not entirely, by transplacental transport from the mother to the fetus.1, 2 At birth, there is an abrupt loss of the maternal supply of substrates and nutrients and the newborn has to mobilize glucose and other substrates to meet its energy needs. A number of studies in a variety of species, including humans, have shown that fetal plasma glucose concentrations are significantly lower than that of the mother.3-5 Furthermore, there is a direct relationship between maternal and fetal plasma glucose concentrations and the supply of glucose to the fetus is highly dependent upon maternal glycemia.6-12 Thus, the supply of glucose to the fetus is likely to be diminished in the case of maternal hypoglycemia and to be increased in the case of maternal hyperglycemia. However, the placenta has a large capacity for glucose storage in the form of glycogen which blunts glucose transfer to the fetus when significant maternal hyperglycemia occurs. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926962109

We investigate the effect on required CO2 emission reduction efforts, both in terms of how much and when, of our present uncertain knowledge of the climate sensitivity to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. We use a top-down integrated assessment model in which there are two competing energy sources, fossil and non-fossil. Technological change is represented endogenously through learning curves, and modest but non-zero demand exists for the relatively expensive carbon-free energy resource. We find that during the forthcoming two decades the relative roles of carbon-free energy and energy savings are similar, while in the long run the importance of carbon-free energy deployment becomes predominant, independent of the assumed climate sensitivity, but dependent on some of our model's characteristic features. We also find that, in the absence of the realisation of drastic energy efficiencies or a massive deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies, non-carbon energy resources should provide 10-30% and 80-90% of total energy supply, in 2020 and 2100, respectively. Finally, we observe that in our model the timing of the emissions reduction effort is nearly linear and close to independent of either the climate sensitivity or policy target. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental data showed that the Future Truck averaged 15.9 mpg operating non-hybrid whereas the PBM predicted 16.8 mpg for a non-hybrid set-up over the same drive cycle, a 5% difference.

While these systems have always been heavily impacted by coastal storms, increases in population density, infrastructure, and personal and business merchandise have exacerbated the economic and personal impacts of these events over the past half century. As such there has been increased focus on the need for more timely and accurate forecasts of impending events. Traditionally model forecast architectures for coastal storm surge, flooding and inundation of coastal and inland areas have taken the approach of dealing with each system separately: rivers, estuaries, harbors and offshore facing areas. However, given advances in coupled modeling and the availability of real-time data, the ability to accurately predict and project coastal, estuary and inland flooding related to the passage of high energy and wet atmospheric events is rapidly emerging and requires a new paradigm in system architecture. No longer do monthly averaged winds or river discharge or water levels have to be invoked in developing hindcasts for planning purposes or for real-time forecasts. In 1999 a hurricane associated flood on the North Carolina coast took 56 lives and caused more than $6 billion in economic impacts. None of the models existing at that time were able to properly forecast the massive flooding and clearly called for a new model paradigm. Here we propose a model system that couples atmospheric information to fully three dimensional, non-linear time dependent ocean basin, coastal and estuary hydrodynamic models coupled to interactive river models with input of real or modeled winds, observed or modeled precipitation, measured and modeled water levels, and streamflow. The river and estuarine components must both be capable of going into modes of storage or accelerated discharge. Spatial scales must downscale in the horizontal from thousands to tens meters and in the vertical from hundreds to several centimeters. Topography and elevation data should be of the highest resolution available, necessary for highly accurate predictions of the timing and location of the inundation and retreat of flood waters. Precipitation information must be derived from the optimal mix of direct radar, satellite and ground-based observations. Creating the capability described above will advance the modernization of hydrologic services provided by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration and provide more accurate and timely forecasts and climatologies of coastal and estuary flooding. The goal of these climatologies and improved forecasts is to provide better information to local and regional planners, emergency managers, highway patrols and to improve the capacity of coastal communities to mitigate against the impacts of coastal flooding.",,"Alarm systems; Architecture; Climatology; Computer architecture; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Estuaries; Forecasting; Population statistics; Rivers; Storms; Water levels; Water resources; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric administration; Coastal communities; Ground-based observations; Highest resolutions; Modeling paradigms; Population densities; Real-time forecasts; System architectures; Floods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349336596

In addition to providing40%-50%of the total calories inhumanmilk or formula, fats are an integral part of all cellmembranes, provide fatty acids necessary for brain development, and are the sole vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins and hormones in milk.1 Furthermore, these energy-rich lipids can be stored in the body in nearly unlimited amounts, in contrast to the limited storage capacity for carbohydrates and proteins. Before birth, glucose is the major energy source for the fetus, with the fetal requirement for fatty acids supplied mainly as free fatty acids from the maternal circulation. After birth, fat is supplied chiefly in the form of milk or formula triglycerides.2 Lipids are nonpolar or amphipathic substances that are insoluble in aqueous media (Figure 23.1). Absorption of fat permits the efficient assimilation of a great number of hydrophobic (fat-soluble) chemicals, some beneficial (such as the fat-soluble vitamins) and some detrimental (such as hydrophobic xenobiotics, drugs, and food additives). 3 Major lipids in infant nutrition The major lipid classes are glycerides, phospholipids, sterols (cholesterol), and free fatty acids (Figure 23.1). Glycerides are nonphosphorus-containing lipids that result fromthe esterification of glycerolandfatty acids (Figure 23.1).

He must also reduce energy expenditure when food is scarce and efficiently and accurately restore lost adipose stores when food is again available. These processes are dependent on information relayed to a distributed central network of metabolic sensing neurons through hard-wired neural, metabolic, and hormonal signals from the periphery. These sensing neurons engage neuroendocrine, autonomic, and motor processes involved in arousal, motor activity, and the ingestion, absorption, assimilation, storage, and expenditure of calories. A raised threshold in these metabolic sensors for detecting inhibitory signals from increasing adipose stores allows continued intake of excess calories when they are readily available. Unfortunately, this mechanism for surviving periods of feast and famine predisposes the perfect survivor to become obese when highly palatable, energy dense foods are readily available at low energetic cost. It further assures that raised adipose stores are metabolically defended against attempts to lower them. Thus, effective treatment of obesity will only come with a better understanding of the physiological, metabolic, and neurochemical processes that ensure this defense of an elevated body weight.",,"brain; caloric intake; energy metabolism; genetic predisposition; genetics; homeostasis; human; metabolism; nutritional value; obesity; physiology; review; Brain; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Homeostasis; Humans; Nutritive Value; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549072788

This has resulted in increased studies of the usefulness of different indicators as a measure of stressors and contaminants. This paper presents a review of bioindicators since 1970 by using four journals: Science of the Total Environment, Environmental Science and Technology, Environmental Pollution, and Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety. The overall objective was to examine temporal trends in publications on bioindicators, the species used as bioindicators, the contaminants of concern, and what they indicated (e.g., pollution or air quality). Overall, there has been a steady rise in the publication of papers about indicators since 1970, with nearly 35% of the indicator papers published in the last 5 years. Most papers that use the term indicator or bioindicator deal with some form of pollution, environmental quality, or human health. The greatest percent of indicator papers dealt with metal pollution and other chemical pollution, and the least dealt with oil. Despite the recent attention the developed countries have given to radioactive radiation and nuclear waste storage, only 5% of the papers were describing bioindicators of radiation. Plants accounted for over 40% of the indicator papers, followed by invertebrates and then fish. Of the total indicator papers, less than 2% each were attributable to sediments, reptiles, amphibians, and ecosystems. These data indicate that indicators have not been developed equally for different contaminants or with the use of different species. Mammals and birds, which often represent top-trophic levels, are clearly underrepresented. Although the choice of journals examined clearly affected the results, these data indicate a disproportionate emphasis on plants, overall pollution, and metals. To design an adequate biomonitoring plan, managers and public policy makers require more information on a suite of species from the same location. Only with such information can the best accumulators for particular contaminants be selected.

To study the feasibility of recovering methane from the offshore southern Taiwan region and its impact on many geological processes, it is necessary to know the total amount of hydrate in the region; something that is still unclear. Here we take the first step using a bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) to estimate the total volume of the stability field that can hold hydrates in the sediments offshore of southern Taiwan. We used a dense grid of 6-channel and 120-channel reflection profiles to study the distribution and sub-bottom depth of a BSR. BSRs are marked by a reversed polarity reflector that increases in sub-bottom depth with increasing water depth, suggesting that BSRs mark the base of methane hydrate stability zones. For offshore Taiwan a BSR is located in offscraped sediments derived from the Taiwan orogen and the Chinese continental margin. These sediments may have high amounts of organic carbon, thereby providing a source for the methane. We document the areal extent and subbottom depth of BSRs covering a 45000 km2-wide region. The BSRs were classified into three categories based on how well they fit the seismic characteristics of the BSR associated with hydrates. Q1 BSR fits with all the expected seismic attributes to be found at the base of a hydrate boundary, while Q2 and Q3 BSRs are possible and probable reflectors resulting from such a boundary. We then estimate the volume of the hydrate stability zone bounded between the seafloor and the mapped BSRs in the offshore region. At least 1023 km3 of the hydrate stability field is underlain by the highest quality BSRs while as much as 11522 km3 is underlain by all mapped BSRs. We then speculated on the total amount of hydrate stored in the region using published regional porosity-depth relations and assuming a range of saturation values of hydrates in the pore spaces. Hydrate storage can be better estimate once additional porosity and saturation information becomes available.","Bottom-simulating reflector; Methane hydrate; Taiwan","gas hydrate; hydrocarbon resource; methane; porosity; recovery; water depth; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846913693

These are simple array memory structures that are directly addressed and explicitly managed by software. Compared to hardware caches of the same data capacity, they are smaller, have shorter access times and consume less energy per access. Access times are also easier to predict with simple memories since there is no possibility of a ""miss."" On the other hand, they are more difficult for the programmer to use since they are not automatically managed. In this paper, we present a software system that allows all or part of an SRAM or scratchpad memory to be automatically managed as a cache. This system provides the programming convenience of a cache for processors that lack dedicated caching hardware. It has been implemented for an actual processor and runs on real hardware. Our results show that a software-based instruction cache can be built that provides performance within 10% of a traditional hardware cache on many benchmarks while using a cheaper, simpler, SRAM memory. On these same benchmarks, energy consumption is up to 3% lower than it would be using a hardware cache.

This heat flux is a significant but understudied component of the urban surface energy balance (SEB). Direct measurement of this SEB term at the local scale (horizontal length scale ∼102-104 m) is practically unattainable primarily because of the complex array of materials and the three-dimensionality of urban systems. Results of an 8-day summertime observational study at a site in the center of Marseille, France, are presented. This locale is an ideal environment for such research because of the warm, dry climate (hence the SEB is dominated by sensible heat exchanges) and the high density of tall buildings with thick walls (hence it has a large thermal mass that favors heat storage as a component of the SEB). Estimates of △QS derived as residuals in the SEB, after the remaining terms are measured directly, (termed RES) are compared with those calculated from a parameterization scheme [objective hysteresis model (OHM)], a local-scale numerical model [Town Energy Balance model (TEB)], and a bulk heat transfer method [thermal mass scheme (TMS)]. Inputs to the methods include observed meteorological data and morphometric properties of the urban site. All approaches yield a similar diurnal course. The OHM and TEB methods tend to slightly overestimate storage uptake by day when compared with the RES, whereas TMS slightly underestimates it. All methods underestimate heat storage release at night when compared with RES and show some sensitivity to wind speed, especially above about 5 m s-1. OHM estimates perform satisfactorily in the mean but miss short-term variability and are poor at night. TEB simulations show the best agreement with RES results, particularly at night. TMS values are comparable to those from the other methods, but its extensive input requirements render it almost impractical. Overall, the convergence of results is reassuring but the lack of a standard for quantifying heat storage and the spread of results mean this term remains a source of imprecision in urban energy balance measurement and modeling. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Convergence of numerical methods; Heat flux; Mathematical models; Wind; Heat storage fluxes; Surface energy balance (SEB); Thermal mass; Urban heat storage; Heat storage; energy balance; estimation method; numerical model; parameterization; sensible heat flux; urban climate; Bouches-du-Rhone; Eurasia; Europe; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846185958

CO2 at 5–50% concentrations was passed through a gas-exchange membrane and transferred into liquid media—tap water or simulated brine. When using water, capture efficiencies exceeded 50% and could be enhanced by adding base (e.g., sodium hydroxide) or the combination of base and carbonic anhydrase, a catalyst that speeds the conversion of CO2 to carbonic acid. The transferred CO2 formed ions, such as bicarbonate or carbonate, depending on the amount of base present. Adding precipitating cations, like Ca++, produced insoluble carbonate salts. Simulated brine proved nearly as efficient as water in absorbing CO2, with less than a 6% reduction in CO2 transferred. The CO2 either dissolved into the brine or formed a mixture of gas and ions. If the chemistry was favorable, carbonate precipitate spontaneously formed. Energy expenditure of pumping brine up and down from subterranean depths was modeled. We conclude that using brine in a gas-exchange membrane system for capturing CO2 from a gas stream to liquid is technically feasible and can be accomplished at a reasonable expenditure of energy. © 2006 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Chemical reactors; Greenhouse effect; Mixtures; Precipitation (chemical); Sodium compounds; Carbon dioxide capture; Gas stream; Gas-exchange membranes; Simulated brine; Carbon dioxide; calcium ion; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; carbonic acid; sodium hydroxide; article; energy expenditure; feasibility study; gas exchange; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; priority journal; reactor; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845928603

Silica filled compounds were prepared by adding n-octyl-triethoxyl or mercatopropyl-trimethoxyl silane. Both silanes are capable of retarding filler flocculation upon heating and give compounds with less developed filler networks either by reducing F-F interactions or by screening filler networks through P-F attachments. The filler network is shown to mediate the low-temperature hysteresis due to the polymer glass transition (Tg) by changing the temperature dependence of the compound dynamic storage modulus (G′). At temperatures far above the Tg, the compound tan δ is governed by mechanisms that control the degree of filler networking. Compounds with less developed networks show weaker strain dependence on G′ and tan δ. Both reduced F-F and increased P-F interactions will give a compound with a less developed network. However, significant reduced tan δ is only found in a system that shows strong P-F interaction due to less energy loss upon deformation by fewer network breakage and increased P-F crosslinks. This is exemplified by comparing the compound loss moduli (G″) of various stocks with corresponding G′ in G-plot (G″ vs. G′).",,"Crosslinking; Functional polymers; Hysteresis; Plastic deformation; Plastics fillers; Strain measurement; Thermal effects; Dynamic storage modulus; Low-temperature hysteresis; Temperature dependence; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845755443

The resonators exhibit controllable impedance and energy storage behaviors during an alternating charging and discharging process. It is discovered that these unique characteristics of switched resonators can lead to novel RF envelope signal processing functions. The paper discusses the basic theory of switched resonators and the designing methodology of relevant RF signal processing applications. Two applications are presented as examples. The first example is a variable, reflective attenuator which uses the controllable impedance of the switched resonators to achieve different attenuation/reflection levels. In the second example, a simple, compact and efficient RF pulse compression technique based on the switched resonator concept is introduced. It utilizes the charging/discharging characteristics of the circuit resonator by varying the resonator's Q-factor. The approach compresses the duration of the modulated pulse without changing the phase characteristics of the RF carrier. The pulse compression technique can also be implemented with other type of resonators including distributed resonators, as demonstrated through the experiments. © 2006 IEEE.","Envelope-based RF signal processing; Pulse compression; Pulse generator; Switched resonators; Variable RF attenuators","Electric attenuators; Electric impedance; Energy storage; Pulse generators; Signal processing; Pulse compression; RF attenuators; Switched resonators; Resonators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845742597

Pitch-based carbon foams exhibit high thermal conductivities and porosities up to 90%. This allows the possibility of infiltrating the foam with a relatively large volume of phase-change material. Phase-change thermal energy storage devices offer potential weight savings by allowing thermal control systems to use a smaller heat sink by absorbing the thermal energy quickly and storing it in the phase-change material. The thermal energy can then be released to a heat sink and the process repeated. Tests are conducted on samples of infiltrated foam. The results show the transient temperature response of the foam samples before, during, and after phase change. A theoretical prediction of the transient response is developed and compared with the experimental results.",,"Heat losses; Heat sinks; Infiltration; Temperature distribution; Thermal conductivity; Thermal effects; Phase change materials; Transient response; Foams; Foams; Heat losses; Heat sinks; Infiltration; Temperature distribution; Thermal conductivity; Thermal effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751008069

Since sustainable weight loss is only achieved by bariatric surgery, medicine has seen an explosion in the diversity and number of bariatric procedures performed over the past few years. Systematic studies of postoperative outcomes and investigations into the physiology and biology of weight loss provide a more comprehensive understanding of the sequelae of bariatric surgery. Adipose tissue is the predominant site of fat stores. Increasing obesity results in an overload of lipids within the body's natural storage sink (i.e., the adipocyte) followed by the necessary deposition of fat within ectopic sites such as muscle, liver, and pancreas. The resulting metabolic derangements are associated with insulin resistance, central obesity, and chronic inflammation as adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ, producing and secreting a host of biologic mediators. Whereas there are conflicting data on the cardiovascular effects of peripheral, subcutaneous liposuction, malabsorptive bariatric procedures result almost universally in significant amelioration of insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis.

In the field, Se was mostly present in the young leaves and reproductive tissues of both hyperaccumulators. Microfocused scanning x-ray fluorescence mapping revealed that Se was hyperaccumulated in trichomes in young leaves of A. bisulcatus. None of 10 other elements tested were accumulated in trichomes. Micro x-ray absorption spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that Se in trichomes was present in the organic forms methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys; 53%) and γ-glutamyl-MeSeCys (47%). In the young leaf itself, there was 30% inorganic Se (selenate and selenite) in addition to 70% MeSeCys. In young S. pinnata leaves, Se was highly concentrated near the leaf edge and surface in globular structures that were shown by energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis to be mainly in epidermal cells. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed both MeSeCys (88%) and selenocystathionine (12%) inside leaf edges. In contrast, both the Se accumulator Brassica juncea and the nonaccumulator Arabidopsis thaliana accumulated Se in their leaf vascular tissues and mesophyll cells. Se in hyperaccumulators appears to be mobile in both the xylem and phloem because Se-treated S. pinnata was found to be highly toxic to phloem-feeding aphids, and MeSeCys was present in the vascular tissues of a S. pinnata young leaf petiole as well as in guttation fluid. The compartmentation of organic selenocompounds in specific storage areas in the plant periphery appears to be a unique property of Se hyperaccumulators. The high concentration of Se in the plant periphery may contribute to Se tolerance and may also serve as an elemental plant defense mechanism. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Fluorescence; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Selenium; Tissue; X ray spectroscopy; Astragalus bisulcatus; Hyperaccumulator plants; Spatial imaging; Stanleya pinnata; Plants (botany); Cells; Leaves; Liquid Chromatography; Microanalysis; Phloem; Selenium; X Ray Spectroscopy; Xylem; Aphididae; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Astragalus bisulcatus; Brassica; Brassica juncea; Stanleya pinnata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748807207

The transuranic elements (TRUs) in temporary storage, the TRUs sent to permanent repositories, and the system cost are taken as key figures of merit. The CONFU strategy (standard LWRs plus CONFU LWRs) is shown to reduce the TRU accumulation by ∼34%, relative to the reference once-through fuel cycle strategy, while the ABR strategy (standard LWRs plus ABRs) exhibits a smaller reduction (by 9%). The CONFU fuel assembly was designed to stabilize the TRU inventory in LWRs with zero TRU incineration rate. Nevertheless, deployment of this concept limits the ex-core TRU inventory. The actinide production in the CONFUs is also reduced by virtue of the loading of 20% of the core with nonfertile actinide fuel pins. On the other hand, the ABR burner, designed to consume the actinides in fertile-free fuel (FFF), has a large net TRU incineration rate and therefore a potential for faster TRU depletion from storage facilities. However, it suffers from a likely delay of deployment, compared to the CONFU, due to the need for more extensive research and development effort. Even when extending the time frame to 100 yr, the fast ABR cannot overcome the disadvantage of its late deployment compared to the thermal CONFU. In part, this is due to the fact that the ABR has a lower TRU destruction rate per gigawatt(electric) than the CONFU because of its higher thermal efficiency. Both strategies greatly reduce the total TRU mass destined to the permanent repositories, thus alleviating the burden of licensing a large number of such repositories, and the risk from deliberate or accidental excavation of TRUs from the repositories. The implementation of these strategies requires development of FFF pins for both CONFU cores and fast reactors. Economic analyses show that both closed fuel cycles are more expensive than the reference once-through scheme. The total busbar cost of electricity production is expected to be 4 to 5 mills/kW·h(electric) (∼10 to 12%) larger than the once-through cycle case if the spent-fuel separation is paid for by electricity sales from the separated fuel.

One set of constraints eliminates memory leaks observed in composite overloaded expressions with three current Fortran 95/2003 compilers. A second set of constraints ensures economical memory recycling. The constraints are preconditions, postconditions and invariants on overloaded operators and the objects they receive and return. It is demonstrated that systematic run-time assertion checking inspired by the formal constraints facilitated the pinpointing of an exceptionally hard-to-reproduce compiler bug. It is further demonstrated that the interplay between OCL's modeling capabilities and Fortran's programming capabilities led to a conceptual breakthrough that greatly improved the readability of our code by facilitating operator overloading. The advantages and disadvantages of our memory management rules are discussed in light of other published solutions [11,19]. Finally, it is demonstrated that the run-time assertion checking has a negligible impact on performance. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

In the United States, two thirds of adults are overweight and one third are considered obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2). Visceral obesity, as a central component of the metabolic syndrome, contributes to an elevation in the risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and, in turn, increased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs, especially in elderly populations. This manuscript examines the impact and current management of obesity and other aspects of the metabolic syndrome, as well as emerging treatment options, with a focus on the role of abnormalities in the endocannabinoid system. The foundation for this publication was a live symposium event at AMDA's national meeting in Dallas, Texas, March 16-19, 2006. The endocannabinoid receptor CB1 is involved in the regulation of energy balance and it has been identified in tissues related to the pathogenesis of obesity. Moreover, dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system is common in obese individuals. Further, recent clinical studies have shown that the novel, selective CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant yields sustained reduction in weight and waist circumference, as well as improvements, independent of weight loss, in other aspects of the metabolic syndrome. Novel agents, such as rimonabant, that target fundamental pathogenic processes related to nutrient intake and fat storage, in conjunction with appropriate lifestyle changes, may efficiently treat obesity and related cardiometabolic disturbances. © 2006 American Medical Directors Association.","cardiometabolic disturbances; endocannabinoids; metabolic syndrome; Obesity; rimonabant","2 arachidonoylglycerol; 4 chloro n [[3 (4 chlorophenyl) 4 phenyl 2 pyrazolin 1 yl](methylamino)methylene]benzenesulfonamide; anandamide; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; aod 9604; apd 356; atl 962; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist; cannabinoid receptor antagonist; cannabis; cetillistat; cp 946598; endocannabinoid; metformin; placebo; pyy 3 36; rimonabant; sibutramine; tetrahydrocannabinolic acid; tetrahydrolipstatin; unclassified drug; abdominal pain; anorexia; anxiety disorder; article; bloating; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical assessment; clinical trial; constipation; cost control; defecation urgency; depression; diarrhea; diet therapy; dietary intake; disease association; dizziness; drug cost; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug safety; drug tolerability; dyspepsia; early diagnosis; energy balance; exercise; fatigue; flatulence; gastrointestinal toxicity; headache; health care cost; health program; high risk patient; human; hypertension; insomnia; insulin resistance; lifestyle; lipid storage; long term care; meta analysis; metabolic disorder; mood disorder; morbidity; mortality; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; population research; receptor blocking; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; tachycardia; treatment outcome; vomiting; waist circumference; weight reduction; xerostomia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748414754

The coefficient of variation (CV) of the median T1p of the agarose phantom was 0.44%, which shows excellent reproducibility. The reproducibility of in vivo 3D-T 1p maps was also investigated in three healthy subjects. The CV of the median T1p of the patellar cartilage varied between ∼1.1% and 4.3%.

Animal models have allowed us to investigate the independent consequences of altering the pre- versus post-natal environments on a variety of metabolic, physiological and neuroendocrine functions as they effect the development in the offspring of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia (the 'metabolic syndrome'). During gestation, maternal malnutrition, obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes and psychological, immunological and pharmacological stressors can all promote offspring obesity. Normal post-natal nutrition can reduce the adverse impact of some of these pre-natal factors but maternal high-fat diets, diabetes and increased neonatal access to food all enhance the development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome in offspring. The outcome of these perturbations of the perinatal environmental is also highly dependent upon the genetic background of the individual. Those with an obesity-prone genotype are more likely to be affected by factors such as maternal obesity and high-fat diets than are obesity-resistant individuals. Many perinatal manipulations appear to promote offspring obesity by permanently altering the development of central neural pathways, which regulate food intake, energy expenditure and storage. Given their strong neurotrophic properties, either excess or an absence of insulin and leptin during the perinatal period are likely to be effectors of these developmental changes. Because obesity is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality and because of its resistance to treatment, prevention is likely to be the best strategy for stemming the tide of the obesity epidemic. Such prevention should begin in the perinatal period with the identification and avoidance of factors which produce permanent, adverse alterations in neural pathways which control energy homeostasis. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Development; Diabetes; Genetics; Hypothalamus; Obesity","diabetes; genetics; homeostasis; hypertension; lactation; malnutrition; maternal effect; maternal health; pregnancy; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748328554

We documented changes in lipid, protein, moisture, and ash in body tissues of adult female Pacific Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) and modeled the energetic costs of wintering. Birds were collected at the extremes of their winter range, in Alaska and Baja California, Mexico. Body lipids decreased over winter for birds in Alaska but increased for those in Baja California. Conversely, body protein increased over winter for Brant in Alaska and remained stable for birds in Baja California. Lipid stores likely fuel migration for Brant wintering in Baja California and ensure winter survival for those in Alaska. Increases in body protein may support earlier reproduction for Brant in Alaska. Predicted energy demands were similar between sites during late winter but avenues of expenditure were different. Birds in Baja California spent more energy on lipid synthesis while those in Alaska incurred higher thermoregulatory costs. Estimated daily intake rates of eelgrass were similar between sites in early winter; however, feeding time was more constrained in Alaska because of high tides and short photoperiods. Despite differences in energetic costs and foraging time, Brant wintering at both sites appeared to be in good condition. We suggest that wintering in Alaska may be more advantageous than long-distance migration if winter survival is similar between sites and constraints on foraging time do not impair body condition. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2006.","Body composition; Energy storage; Geese; Lipid; Protein; Winter","Aves; Branta bernicla nigricans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748079778

For example, hydrocarbon contamination and mechanical impact promoted by being dropped during transportation. While the number of these incidents is minuscule compared to the number of systems used in the field, the effect is significant when such an ignition occurs. The kindling chain and initial ignition point of these fires, however, is poorly understood. Although made from more oxygen compatible metallic materials, the cylinder valves attached to these aluminum cylinders contain nonmetallic materials and are in direct contact with the cylinder threads, which are the thinnest cross section of the cylinder. A mechanical impact test was developed to investigate the conditions required to cause ignition of a cylinder and valve assembly by this ignition mechanism, with and without a wide range of controlled contaminants. Specially prepared small cylinders were assembled with commonly used brass cylinder valves and positioned under a drop tower capable of delivering energies up to 434 J (320 ft-lb). Cylinder assemblies were tested with various orientation and impact points including the cylinder valves and no ignitions were recorded in a total of 23 tests.

Particle strikes that directly affect memory are known as single event upsets (SEUs), while strikes that affect combinational logic and spread to memory are called single event transients (SETs). In this paper, we propose two novel approaches to hardening integrated circuits against SEUs and SETs. The proposed approaches are fully-differential dual-interlocked storage cell (DICE) and triple path DICE (TPDICE). The fully-differential DICE and TPDICE approaches are compared against two existing approaches, which are triple modular redundancy (TMR) and basic SET-tolerant DICE. All approaches except for the basic SET-tolerant DICE scheme share a common theme, which is the ability to bypass SEUs and SETs. This is critical for performance, as it allows the system to proceed with subsequent operations while a cell is recovering from the effects of a particle strike. SET pulse widths can be substantial (up to 2 ns), and so high-performance systems cannot afford to pause operations while these pulses are present. The minimum clock periods obtained for the basic SET-tolerant approach were 515 ps with no SET, and 1310 ps with a 500 ps SET (in 0.18 μm CMOS). In contrast, the clock periods for the bypass-capable approaches with no SET/500 ps SET were 628/749 ps for TMR, 348/480 ps for fully-differential DICE, and 434/552 ps for TPDICE. Among the approaches that bypass transient pulses, TPDICE is the most balanced. TMR suffers from overhead due to its need for external voting circuitry. In addition to this, fully-differential DICE cannot be used with combinational logic, while TPDICE can. © 2006 IEEE.","Hardened by design; Radiation effects; Single-event transients; Single-event upsets; Soft errors","CMOS integrated circuits; Combinatorial mathematics; Electric network analysis; Error analysis; High energy physics; Radiation effects; Hardened by design; Single-event transients; Single-event upsets; Soft errors; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746326467

Currently, natural gas is transported to the markets by pipelines as LNG. Transporting the natural gas by pipelines is convenient and economically attractive onshore. For the offshore transport of natural gas, pipelines become challenging as the water depth and transporting distance increase. LNG, an effective means of transporting gas for long distances across the seas, constitutes 25% of the world gas movement. But LNG projects require large investments, along with substantial natural-gas reserves, and are economically viable for distances of 2,500 miles and beyond. CNG provides an effective way for shorter-distance transport. The technology is aimed at monetizing offshore reserves that cannot be produced because of the unavailability of a pipeline or because the LNG option is very costly. Technically, CNG is easy to deploy, with lower requirements for facilities and infrastructure. ""Coselle"" and ""Votrans"" are two would-be commercial, high-pressure gas-storage and -transport technologies for CNG. Technical and economic analyses of these two technologies were done in this study, and a comparison is provided. The results show that for distances up to 2,500 miles, natural gas can be transported as CNG at prices ranging from U.S. $0.93 to $2.23 per MMBtu compared to LNG, which can cost anywhere from $1.5 to $2.5 per MMBTU depending on the actual distance. At distances beyond 2,500 miles, the cost of delivering gas as CNG becomes higher than the cost for LNG because of the disparity in the volumes of gas transported with the two technologies.

Although a variety of experimental techniques are available to test the properties of energetic materials, computational screening techniques can harness the convenience of modern computers to reduce the cost of destructive tests. In this paper quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) based on quantum mechanical calculations were employed to correlate the measured impact sensitivities from shock or impact tests with molecular properties. Molecular descriptors were evaluated using both the Hartree-Fock method with a STO-3G basis set and the semiempirical method PM3. Equations that correlate impact sensitivities to the energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ), energy of highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ), midpoint potential (MPP), ionization potential (IP), dipole moment (DM), and total energy (E) of the molecules were developed.","Impact sensitivity; Molecular descriptors; Molecular orbital calculations; QSPR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745740037

Therefore, processes involved in the regulation and synthesis of storage compound accumulation during seed development bear relevance to germination and seedling establishment. The wrinkled1 (wri1) mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is impaired in seed oil accumulation. The WRI1 gene encodes an APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein transcription factor involved in the control of metabolism, particularly glycolysis, in the developing seeds. Here we investigate the role of this regulatory factor in seed germination and seedling establishment by comparing the wri1-1 mutant, transgenic lines expressing the WRI1 wild-type cDNA in the wri1-1 mutant background, and the wild type. Plants altered in the expression of the WRI1 gene showed different germination responses to the growth factor abscisic acid (ABA), sugars, and fatty acids provided in the medium. Germination of the mutant was more sensitive to ABA, sugars, and osmolites, an effect that was alleviated by increased WRI1 expression in transgenic lines. The expression of ABA-responsive genes AtEM6 and ABA-insensitive 3 (ABI3) was increased in the wri1-1 mutant. Double-mutant analysis between abi3-3 and wri1-1 suggested that WRI1 and ABI3, a transcription factor mediating ABA responses in seeds, act in parallel pathways. Addition of 2-deoxyglucose inhibited seed germination, but did so less in lines overexpressing WRI1. Seedling establishment was decreased in the wri1-1 mutant but could be alleviated by sucrose. Apart from a possible signaling role in germination, sugars in the medium were required as building blocks and energy supply during wri1-1 seedling establishment. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Metabolism; Synthesis (chemical); Arabidopsis thaliana; Element-binding protein transcription; Seed germination; Storage compound accumulation; Seed; Metabolism; Seeds; Synthesis; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745657877

Fetal lipid uptake gradually increases towards term and is primarily used to produce fat in adipose tissue, with essential fatty acid uptake providing necessary structural and functional elements in membranes of cells in the central nervous system. Fetal glucose uptake and utilization rates are nearly twice as high at 23–26 weeks gestation as they are at term, contributing primarily to energy production and glycogen formation. Amino-acid uptake by the fetus is two-to threefold greater at 23–26 weeks gestation than at term and is required to meet the very high fractional protein synthesis and growth rates at this gestational period; amino acids also contribute significantly to fetal energy production. In contrast, after birth most of the very preterm infants are fed more lipid and glucose and less amino acids and protein than they need. Not surprisingly, therefore, very preterm infants accumulate fat but remain relatively growth restricted at term gestational age compared to those infants who grew normally in utero, and this postnatal growth restriction has long-term adverse growth, development, and health consequences. More thorough understanding of the unique nutritional, metabolic, and growth requirements of the normally growing fetus and the very preterm infant, once born, are needed to determine optimal nutritional strategies to improve the outcome of preterm infants. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

The development, maintenance, and improvement of technology, defined anthropologically as physical devices and mental knowledge of how to employ such devices, requires energy. New technologies provide powerful and flexible means for organising subsequent system structure and function, and nourish opportunity for more discovery and technical innovation. From a systems ecology perspective, technology development is an evolutionary process, which implies that it is a self-organising, autocatalytic process driven by energy and resource availability, population size, economic development, scientific knowledge and previous innovation, Understanding how the dynamics of technology development were related to historical resource use (i.e., national metabolism) is important in a world operating mostly on finite resources because it can offer some perspective on the effects of future resource limitations on technology development. Emergy (with an 'm') evaluation, a physically based environmental accounting system that tracks the total amount of resources required to produce something by tracing all resource flows back to the Earth's ultimate energy source of solar radiation, was employed to measure national metabolism of the United States during the past two centuries and to estimate the national metabolism required to develop and maintain the broad-use of four communication technologies. National metabolism of the US grew exponentially from 1790 to 2000, increasing 1600 per cent during those 210 years. The national metabolism required to develop and maintain use of satellites, radios, televisions and telephones approached a minimum, indicating that limits to efficiency improvements exist and that the ubiquity of large-scale technologies surviving under future resource limitations is doubtful. © 2006 The White Horse Press.","Emergy evaluation; Fossil fuels; Natural resources; Technological innovation; U.S. energy use","economic development; energy resource; energy use; historical geography; resource development; technological development; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745477657

Developmental expression profiles for 794 protein spot groups were established and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed 12 different expression trends. Tryptic peptides from each spot group were analyzed in duplicate using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizatiori time-of-flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The identity of 517 spot groups was determined, representing 289 nonredundant proteins. These proteins were classified into 14 functional categories based upon the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome classification scheme. Energy and metabolism related proteins were highly represented in developing seed, accounting for 24.3% and 16.8% of the total proteins, respectively. Analysis of subclasses within the metabolism group revealed coordinated expression during seed filling. The influence of prominently expressed seed storage proteins on relative quantification data is discussed and an in silico subtraction method is presented. The preponderance of energy and metabolic proteins detected in this study provides an in-depth proteomic view on carbon assimilation in B. napus seed. These data suggest that sugar mobilization from glucose to coenzyme A and its acyl derivative is a collaboration between the cytosol and plastids and that temporal control of enzymes and pathways extends beyond transcription.

Austin Energy, who will own and operate this plant, selected Burns and McDonnell as their packaged plant integrator. Austin Energy has signed an energy services agreement to provide the new hospital with power, chilled water and steam. The plant is the first of its kind in the State of Texas using the CHP module to generate primary power for the Dell Children’s Medical Center of Central Texas with the grid providing backup power. The packaged and modular CHP plant will utilize the state-of-the-art Solar Turbines Mercury 50 combustion turbine, which has a simple cycle heat rate efficiency of 38 percent and produces less than 5 ppm NOx and meets the Texas 2005 emission mandate without the need for a catalyst, counting the thermal benefits of steam and chilled water. In addition, the hybrid plant will utilize a heat recovery steam generator, packaged chiller plant and boiler, absorption cooling and thermal energy storage to maximize system efficiency, operational flexibility and reliability of services to the hospital and the campus district cooling system. The hybrid energy plant control system will allow the system to be remotely monitored and operated from an off-site operational control center. This article will provide insight into the design of the hybrid energy plant and present features and benefits to this type of packaged and modular system approach. In addition to hospitals that have a need for grid independence, universities, airports, and other critical facilities, such as data centers, will benefit from this type of packaged hybrid energy plant approach. © 2006 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Combustion turbine; Hybrid energy plant; Solar turbines; Combustion; Cooling systems; Energy storage; Reliability; Steam generators; Turbines; Waste heat utilization; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745454461

Laser beam-generated pinhole depressions form dot-matrix alphanumerical characters that etch in the required price-look-up information. Pinhole depressions can disrupt the cuticular and epidermal barriers, potentially weakening the natural protection against pathogens. In the present study we describe the anatomical and morphological characteristics of the pinhole depressions in the cuticle/epidermis, and the changes taking place during storage of two fruits: avocado (Persea americana) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). These fruits represent the extremes from a thick, non-edible peel to a thin edible peel. On both tomato and avocado, etching depressions were fairly similar in diameter and depth, averaging 200 μm and 25 μm, respectively, for energy impact durations of 30 μs for tomato and 45 μs for avocado. Immediately after etching, the two- to five-cell-deep depressions contained cuticle/wax deposits. Additional cuticle/wax material was deposited in and around the depressions during storage as demonstrated by confocal, fluorescent, and light microscopy. In addition, the cells underlining the etch depression increased phenolic and lignin deposits in their walls, creating a potential barrier against pathogenic organisms.","Fruit wax; Laser labels; Lignification; Lycopersicon esculentum; Persea americana; Phenolics; PLU; Postharvest","Lycopersicon esculentum; Persea americana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745438640

As a result, architectural/circuit-level techniques such as block buffering and sub-banking have been proposed and shown to be very effective in reducing the energy consumption of on-chip caches. While there has been some work on evaluating the energy and performance impact of different block buffering schemes, we are not aware of software solutions to take advantage of on-chip cache block buffers. This article presents a compiler-based approach that modifies code and variable layout to take better advantage of block buffering. The proposed technique is aimed at a class of embedded codes that make heavy use of scalar variables. Unlike previous work that uses only storage pattern optimization or only access pattern optimization, we propose an integrated approach that uses both code restructuring (which affects the access sequence) and storage pattern optimization (which determines the storage layout of variables). We use a graph-based formulation of the problem and present a solution for determining suitable variable placements and accompanying access pattern transformations. The proposed technique has been implemented using an experimental compiler and evaluated using a set of complete programs.

Types of large applications include campus cooling networks and district cooling utility developments, where TES provides demand management for energy users, as well as turbine inlet cooling (TIC) applications for hot weather power enhancement of power plants for electric energy generators. Systems are often designed for lower than traditional supply temperatures, or dual-designed for initially conventional supply temperatures but also lower future temperatures with higher storage capacities. The energy efficiency of TES systems, both on-site at the energy user and at-source energy power plants, is explored. Economics are examined to document how large TES installations, when applied at times of either new facility construction or chiller plant capacity expansion/rehabilitation, often provide not only major operating cost benefits but even dramatic capital cost savings versus conventional (non-TES) chiller plant capacity.

CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done, biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat, electricity or hydrogen) to society. Here we present estimates of the costs and conversion efficiency of electricity, hydrogen and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass with CO2 capture and storage. We then insert these technology characteristics into a global energy and transportation model (GET 5.0), and calculate costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration at 350 and 450 ppm. We find that carbon capture and storage technologies applied to fossil fuels have the potential to reduce the cost of meeting the 350 ppm stabilisation targets by 50% compared to a case where these technologies are not available and by 80% when BECS is allowed. For the 450 ppm scenario, the reduction in costs is 40 and 42%, respectively. Thus, the difference in costs between cases where BECS technologies are allowed and where they are not is marginal for the 450 ppm stabilization target. It is for very low stabilization targets that negative emissions become warranted, and this makes BECS more valuable than in cases with higher stabilization targets. Systematic and stochastic sensitivity analysis is performed. Finally, BECS opens up the possibility to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. But this option should not be seen as an argument in favour of doing nothing about the climate problem now and then switching on this technology if climate change turns out to be a significant problem. It is not likely that BECS can be initiated sufficiently rapidly at a sufficient scale to follow this path to avoiding abrupt and serious climate changes if that would happen. © Springer 2006.",,"Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Costs; Earth atmosphere; Electricity; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Carbon capture; Neutral energy; Stabilisation targets; Storage technologies; Transportation models; Carbon; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; fossil fuel; heat production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646819015

This ideal, three-dimensional instability also provided a straightforward explanation for the subsequent fast release of energy, as the rapid growth of the mode eventually results in a state of turbulent magnetic reconnection. Earlier studies of the secondary instability were limited to systems with relatively simple perturbations, viz., resistive stability eigenmodes. A current sheet in the Sun is likely to be subject to much more complex perturbations involving a waves of various wavelengths and amplitudes. We describe the evolution of three-dimensional electric current sheets disturbed by random 3D perturbations. We find that the significant characteristics of secondary instability are also observed in this case.

Here, we discuss the importance and role of nonlinear interactions in the heating of the solar corona, which relies on the transfer, storage and dissipation of the mechanical energy present in photospheric motion [Einaudi, G., Velli, M., Phys. Plasmas 6, 4146, 1999]. Nonlinear interactions including the coupling of coronal fields to the motions and emerging flux through the photosphere determine both the rate of heating and the topology of coronal magnetic fields. We present the first results of a 3D reduced MHD simulation that models the small-scale magnetic activity of coronal flux tubes. The equations are solved inside a box of dimensions l × l × L (axial direction), with an aspect ratio L/l of the order of 10. The box is initially threaded by a constant sinusoidal velocity field at one base (corresponding to one photospheric footpoint of the loop), of amplitude 1 km/s, (the axial Alfvén speed is about 1000 km/s), whereas the other footpoint is anchored, i.e., no photospheric motions are present. In the transverse directions, periodicity is assumed. Our numerical calculations show that the magnetic field lines change their topology continuously and often reconnect at small scales, forming typical coronal loop-like structures. Energy release events which provide a steady supply of energy are associated with the reconnection. © 2006.","Coronal heating; Magnetohydrodynamics; Numerical simulations; Secondary Instability","Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Energy transfer; Magnetic field effects; Magnetohydrodynamics; Nonlinear control systems; Plasmas; Problem solving; Topology; Coronal heating; Helmet streamers; Nonlinear interactions; Secondary Instability; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646708977

All spring migrant WRSA (n = 124) and BASA (H = 111), and all but 2 of 99 SESA we collected were ≥2 years old. Male and female BASA migrated through North Dakota concurrently, male SESA averaged earlier than females, and WRSA males preceded females. Fat indices (ratio of fat to FFDM) of male and female SESA and WRSA averaged approximately twice those of male and female BASA. Total body fat of male and female BASA increased with date in spring 1980, but not in 1981; slopes were similar for both sexes each year. Male and female SESA arrived lean in 1980 and 1981, and total body fat increased with date in both years, with similar slopes for all combinations of sex and year. Male and female WRSA arrived lean in 1980-1981 and 1981, respectively, and total body fat increased with date, whereas females arrived with fat reserves already acquired in 1980. Interspecific and sex differences in migration schedules probably contributed to variation in fat storage patterns by affecting maintenance energy costs and food availability.

We have found that the dinuclear ruthenium complexes [(phen)2Ru(tatpp)Ru(phen)2]4+ (P) and [(phen)2Ru(tatpq) Ru(phen)2]4+ (Q) undergo photodriven 2- and 4-electron reductions, respectively, in the presence of a sacrificial reductant. Importantly, these processes are completely reversible upon exposure to air, and consequently, these complexes have the potential to be used catalytically in multi-electron transfer reactions. A localized molecular orbital description of the ligands and complexes is used to explain both the function and spectroscopy of these complexes. In both complexes, the reducing equivalents are stored in the π* orbitals of the bridging ligands and depending on the solution pH, various protonation states of the reduced species of P and Q are obtained. Under basic conditions, the photochemical pathway favors sequential single-electron reductions, while neutral or slightly acidic conditions give rise to proton-coupled multi-electron transfer. In fact, at sufficiently acidic pH, only a coupled two-electron, 2-proton process is seen. Few molecular photocatalysts are capable of proton-coupled multi-electron transfer, which is believed to be a fundamental component of light-activated energy storage in nature. © Springer 2006.","Acceptor ligands; Multi-electron; Photochemistry; Proton-coupled electron transfer; Ruthenium polypyridyl","ruthenium; chemistry; dimerization; electrochemistry; electron; oxidation reduction reaction; photon; review; Dimerization; Electrochemistry; Electrons; Oxidation-Reduction; Photons; Ruthenium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646544073

We simulate a 3-D whole-body time-of-flight PET scanner with a complete modeling of spatial and energy resolutions. The scanner is based on LaBr3 Anger-logic detectors with which 300ps timing resolution has been achieved. Multiple simulations were performed for 70-cm long uniform cylinders with 27-cm and 35-cm diameters, containing hot spheres (22, 17, 13, and 10-mm diameter) in a central slice and 10-mm diameter hot spheres in a slice at 1/4 axial FOV. Image reconstruction was performed with a list-mode iterative TOF algorithm and data were analyzed after attenuation and scatter corrections for timing resolutions of 300, 600, 1000 ps and non-TOF for varying count levels. The results show that contrast recovery improves slightly with TOF (NEMA NU2-2001 analysis), and improved timing resolution leads to a faster convergence to the maximum contrast value. Detectability for 10-mm diameter hot spheres estimated using a nonprewhitening matched filter (NPW SNR) also improves nonlinearly with TOF. The gain in image quality using contrast and noise measures is proportional to the object diameter and inversely proportional to the timing resolution of the scanner. The gains in NPW SNR are smaller, but they also increase with increasing object diameter and improved timing resolution. The results show that scan times can be reduced in a TOF scanner to achieve images similar to those from a non-TOF scanner, or improved image quality achieved for same scan times. © 2006 IEEE.","Contrast; Image quality; Lesion detectability; LSO; Noise; NPW; Time-of-flight PET; TOF","Data reduction; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Lanthanum compounds; Mathematical models; Optical resolving power; Lesion detectability; NPW; Time-of-flight PET; Positron emission tomography; algorithm; article; biological model; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; evaluation; image enhancement; image quality; information retrieval; instrumentation; methodology; positron emission tomography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; whole body imaging; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Biological; Phantoms, Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Whole Body Imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646388372

Taub of General Motors Corp. on November 28, 2005, at the Materials Research Society Fall Meeting in Boston. Fuel economy requirements, emissions regulations, and the push for energy independence are key factors driving the auto industry to increase vehicle efficiency. The main avenues to efficiency improvement are powertrain enhancements and mass reduction. This presentation details how General Motors is developing advanced propulsion systems and using lightweight materials to achieve greater vehicle efficiency. Taub, who is executive director of General Motors Research and Development, outlines GM's strategy for advancing propulsion technology, from improvements in the internal-combustion engine to hybridization to full vehicle electrification. He then describes the company's efforts to use lightweight materials such as aluminum and magnesium alloys, high-strength steels, and composites to reduce vehicle weight. Also highlighted is GM's success in employing novel materials in the development of advanced vehicle and powertrain systems to achieve additional efficiencies. One example is the application of smart materials, which enable new features and functions by way of mechamatronic solutions (the integration of smart materials with mechanical systems and electronics). Key technical hurdles that must be overcome to increase the use of these materials by the automotive industry are also discussed.","Composite; Energy storage; Environmentally protective; H; Nanoscale; Nanostructure; Polymer","Automotive industry; Fuel economy; Intelligent materials; Polymers; Regulatory compliance; Strategic planning; Composite; Environmentally protective; Nanoscale; Nanostructure; Materials science",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646194026

We successfully generated compensatory growth to time stress and transient food stress in the damselfly Lestes viridis and studied the physiological correlates of the resulting reduced ability to cope with starvation. We found evidence for both mechanisms proposed to underlie the physiological trade-off: compensatory growth was associated with (1) a higher metabolic rate, as indicated by a higher oxygen consumption and a faster depletion of energy storage molecules (glycogen and triglycerides), and (2) a smaller investment in energy storage. The former may also explain why storage molecules after emergence were negatively affected by time stress and food stress, despite the successful compensation before emergence. These deferred physiological costs of rapid growth have the potential to couple larval stresses to adult fitness irrespective of age and size at emergence, and they may partly explain why many animals do not show their maximum achievable growth rate. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Carry-over costs; Damselfly; Energy storage; Lestes viridis; Life history plasticity; Physiological trade-off; Rapid growth; Time stress","fly; food; growth rate; starvation; stress; time; Animalia; Chalcolestes viridis; Zygoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646162370

Under these low growth conditions, endogenous processes have a significant influence on the amount of active biomass and therefore, the overall system performance. In enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) systems endogenous processes can also influence the levels of the internal storage compounds of the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO), directly affecting phosphorus removal performance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of different endogenous processes that occur during the long-term starvation of EBPR sludge under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Activated sludge obtained from a laboratory sequencing batch reactor was used to perform a series of batch starvation experiments. Under aerobic starvation conditions we observed a significant decay of PAO (first-order decay rate of 0.15/d) together with a rapid utilization of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and a slower utilization of glycogen and polyphosphate to generate maintenance energy. On the other hand, anaerobic starvation was best described by maintenance processes that rapidly reduce the levels of polyphosphate and glycogen under starvation conditions while no significant decay of PAO was observed. The endogenous utilization of glycogen for maintenance purposes is currently not included in available EBPR models. Our experimental results suggest that mathematical models for in EBPR should differentiate between aerobic and anaerobic endogenous processes, as they influence active biomass and storage products differently. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to domestic livestock species, cryogenic storage of poultry semen is not reliable enough for germplasm preservation. The relatively low fertilizing ability of frozen/thawed poultry sperm most likely results from physiological sensitivity to the cryogenic process coupled with the requirement for prolonged sperm functionality in the hen reproductive tract; however, the concept of defining these physiological challenges has been underemphasized. For example, alterations in membrane carbohydrate content and diminished energy production in frozen/thawed sperm have important implications for successful gamete interaction. Recent data suggests that both glycoconjugate content and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation are affected by cryopreservation. Moreover, susceptibility to the cryogenic process seems to vary among lines and strains of birds, as illustrated by line-specific differences in ATP concentrations of frozen/thawed sperm from pedigreed commercial layers. Research based on biochemical and molecular comparisons of sperm among lines may lead to identification of factors that influence the freezability of poultry semen. ©2006 Poultry Science Association, Inc.","Cryopreservation; Fertility; Poultry; Semen","Aves; adenosine triphosphate; cryoprotective agent; glycerol; animal; animal disease; article; chemistry; cryopreservation; female; fertility; genetics; heat; male; methodology; pedigree; physiology; poultry; sperm preservation; spermatozoon; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cryopreservation; Cryoprotective Agents; Female; Fertility; Glycerol; Heat; Male; Pedigree; Poultry; Semen Preservation; Spermatozoa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645748063

To circumvent the experimental limitation, a first-principles quantum-mechanical code based on the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method was used to compute the elastic constants and the theoretical stress-strain curves of Ni2Cr and Ni2Mo. The theoretical mechanical properties were then correlated with charge-density distributions of the stressed oI6 unit cell to identify the critical conditions at the onset of fracture.

Isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been widely used to detect autocatalytic decomposition of energetic materials. However, isothermal DSC tests are time consuming and the choice of experimental temperature is crucial. This paper shows that an automatic pressure tracking calorimeter (APTAC) can be a reliable and efficient screening tool for the identification of autocatalytic decomposition behavior of energetic materials. Hydroxylamine nitrate (HAN) is an important member of the hydroxylamine family. High concentrations of HAN are used as liquid propellants, and low concentrations of HAN are used primarily in the nuclear industry for decontamination of equipment. Because of its instability and autocatalytic decomposition behavior, HAN has been involved in several incidents. This paper presents calorimetric measurements for the thermal decomposition of 24 mass% HAN/water. APTAC heat-wait-search and heat-soak-search modes are used to characterize the thermal decomposition of HAN. By comparing the kinetic analysis for the two modes, it is concluded that HAN shows strong autocatalytic decomposition behavior. The most likely decomposition pathway of HAN is proposed to explain the observed autocatalytic behavior. © 2006 Akadémiai Kiadó.","APTAC; Autocatalytic reactions; Energetic materials; Hydroxylamine nitrate","Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy storage; Isotherms; Nitrates; Pyrolysis; APTAC; Autocatalytic reactions; Hydroxylamine nitrates; Explosives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644880856

The site was selected because the building style (surface cover and morphology) is typical of European cities, yet distinct from the majority of cities where energy balance observations have been studied thus far. The multi-year dataset permits consideration of temporal changes in energy balance partitioning over a wide range of seasonal and synoptic conditions and of the role of heat storage and anthropogenic fluxes in the energy balance. Partitioning of net radiation into the turbulent fluxes is consistent in the two years, with the largest differences occurring due to differing precipitation. The monthly ensemble diurnal cycles of the turbulent fluxes over the two years are similar. The largest differences occur during the July-September period, and are attributable to greater net radiation and lower rainfall in 2002. The latent heat flux accounts for approximately 40% of the turbulent heat transfer on an annual basis. The average daily daytime Bowen ratio and its variability are slightly reduced during the summer (growing) season. Anthropogenic heat is a significant input to the urban energy balance in the winter.

The technical aspect of treatment has been described and may include large-scale treatment of bulk potatoes as they are moving along a system of conveyors either to or from storage. The objective of the study was to evaluate the use of a linear accelerator for long-term sprout control under commercial storage conditions and the effects on tuber quality. An 18-MeV linear accelerator was used to provide sprout-inhibiting irradiation to various lots of 'Russet Burbank' potatoes. Successful sprout suppression was achieved with doses of 40 to 50 Gy (0 g sprout weight after 9 months of storage at 7.2 C) while higher doses caused undesirable increases in reducing sugars in the tubers. Glucose concentrations of treated tubers (0.25% fresh tuber weight) were higher after treatment than the untreated controls (0.08%), but returned to control levels after 2 to 6 months in storage. Glucose concentrations in treated tubers were significantly reduced with storage management for reconditioning by increasing the storage temperature for one month (from 7.2 C to 14.4 C) resulting in glucose concentrations near control concentrations. By increasing the dose-rate from the accelerator, recovery of tuber glucose concentration due to radiation treatments was significantly faster than when the dose was given more slowly. Potato tubers irradiated with high rates (100 Gy) of high-energy electrons exhibited an increase in soft rot and dry rot incidence in storage. Disease development in potatoes treated with sprout inhibiting doses of radiation (50 Gy) increased in lots with a high rot potential. Treated lots with low rot potential were successfully stored for 8 months or more without an increase in rot potential or shrinkage. Selection of lots for irradiation treatment should include some preliminary evaluation for development of disease in long-term storage.","Linear accelerator; Long-term storage; Reducing sugars","Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644680530

Appeasing this growing energy demand without irreparably damaging the environment is of primary concern. With rising fuel prices and environmental concerns, alternative fuels could satisfy the need for renewable energy with low environmental impact. Some of the more popular alternative fuels for new vehicles are ethanol, hydrogen, and biodiesel. Although gasoline engines are expected to be replaced by hydrogen-powered fuel cells, compression-ignition engines, the diesel engines, are expected to remain in use for high-power applications because of limitations of hydrogen-storage densities. The viable environmental friendly alternative fuel for compression-ignition engines is methyl esters (commonly known as biodiesel), which is derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Using biodiesel instead of conventional diesel fuel reduces emissions such as the overall life cycle of carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and unburned hydrocarbons significantly. However, biodiesel increases nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, mostly NO and NO2, which are considered as zone A hazardous compounds.

Brine pH has a significant effect on this conversion and can thus be adjusted to induce calcite precipitation using a laboratory scale reactor operated at temperatures of 75 and 150 °C and pressures of 600 and 1500 psi.

In our experiments, electron cooling, a well-established method at low energies (<500MeV/nucleon) , was carried out in a new region of beam parameters, requiring a multi-MeV dc electron beam and an unusual beam transport line. In this Letter, we present the results of the longitudinal cooling force measurements and compare them with theoretical predictions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,"Cooling; Electrons; Protons; Storage rings; Beam transport lines; Electron cooling; High energy physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33144460817

Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, United States","An overview is presented of the use of a single-domain model for developing an understanding of the switching of two coupled magnetic free layers for toggle MRAM (magnetic random access memory). The model includes the effects of length, width, thickness, magnetization, thickness asymmetry, intrinsic anisotropy, exchange coupling, dipole coupling, and applied magnetic field. First, a simple perturbative approach is used to understand the basic phenomena at low fields, including the critical switching curve and activation energy. Then the more general model is applied in order to understand the effects of saturation at large field, and thickness asymmetry. The major results are that toggle MRAM should have a larger margin for half-select and full-select switching fields than Stoner-Wohlfarth MRAM, and that the activation energy should increase upon half-select, thus eliminating the half-select activated-error problem. ©Copyright 2006 by International Business Machines Corporation.",,"Anisotropy; Magnetic couplings; Magnetic domains; Magnetic field effects; Magnetization; Mathematical models; Perturbation techniques; Magnetic random access memory (MRAM); Single-domain model; Switching curve; Random access storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32944465352

We use 232×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the Υ(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- asymmetric-energy storage rings. The results include the 90% confidence interval 1.34×10-6<B(B0→X(3872)K0, X→J/ψπ+π-)<10.3×10-6 and the branching fraction B(B-→X(3872)K-,X→J/ψπ+π-)=(10.1±2.5±1.0) ×10-6. We observe a (2.7±1.3±0.2)MeV/c2 mass difference of the X(3872) produced in the two decay modes. Furthermore, we search for the Y(4260) in B decays and set the 95% C.L. upper limit B(B-→Y(4260)K-,Y(4260) →J/ψπ+π-)<2.9×10-5. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32644473644

Previously, we have quantified the quality of retrieval of genomic and abiotic information in simulation by comparison to state-of-the-art symbolic methods available, such as LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis). Their performance is poor when the evaluation criterion for DNA-affinity is a simple approximation of the Gibbs energy that governs duplex formation for retrievals. Here, we use a more realistic approximation of the Gibbs energy to improve semantic retrievals in DNA memories. Their performance is much closer to that of LSA, according to human expert ratings. With more realistic approximations of DNA affinity, performance is expected to improve for other, more adaptive associative memories with compaction in silico, and even more so with actual DNA molecules in vitro. © 2006 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.",,"Computer simulation; Genes; Gibbs free energy; Semantics; Abiotic information; DNA-affinity; DNA-based memories; Semantic retrieval; DNA; DNA; chemistry; comparative study; conference paper; human; information retrieval; molecular computer; semantics; theoretical model; thermodynamics; Computers, Molecular; DNA; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Theoretical; Semantics; Thermodynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32344437884

A shipboard power distribution system is a stiff isolated power system that is vulnerable to voltage sags, which arise due to faults or pulsed loads, which can cause interruptions of critical loads. A series voltage injection type flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is used to mitigate voltage sags and maximize the survivability of the ship. The basic circuit consists of an energy storage system, power electronic interface, and a series injection transformer. In this case, the energy storage system consists of a flywheel coupled to an induction machine. The stored energy is used for sag correction for the critical load. Indirect field-oriented control (IDFOC) with space-vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) is used to control the induction machine. Sinusoidal PWM is used for controlling the power system side converter.

Effects on other processes affecting energy balance (energy expenditure, fuel partitioning, gut nutrient uptake) remain poorly understood. We examined whether s.c. infusion of 1 mg/(kg·d) PYY[3-36] (for up to 7 d) increased metabolic rate, fat combustion, and/or fecal energy loss in obese mice fed a high-fat diet. PYY[3-36] transiently reduced food intake (e.g., 25-43% lower at d 2 relative to pretreatment baseline) and decreased body weight (e.g., 9-10% reduction at d 2 vs. baseline) in 3 separate studies. Mass-specific metabolic rate in kJ/(kg·h) in PYY[3-36]-treated mice did not differ from controls. The dark cycle respiratory quotient (RQ) was transiently decreased. On d 2, it was 0.747 ± 0.008 compared with 0.786 ± 0.004 for controls (P < 0.001); light cycle RQ was reduced throughout the study in PYY[3-36]-treated mice (0.730 ± 0.006) compared with controls (0.750 ± 0.009; P < 0.001). Epididymal fat pad weight in PYY[3-36]-treated mice was ∼50% lower than in controls (P < 0.01). Fat pad lipolysis ex vivo was not stimulated by PYY[3-36]. PYY[3-36] decreased basal gallbladder emptying in nonobese mice. Fecal energy loss was negligible (∼2% of ingested energy) and did not differ between PYY[3-36]-treated mice and controls. Thus, negative energy balance after PYY[3-36] administration in diet-induced obese mice results from reduced food intake with a relative maintenance of mass-specific energy expenditure. Fat loss and reduced RQ highlight the potential for PYY[3-36] to drive increased mobilization of fat stores to help meet energy requirements in this model. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.","Gut peptide; Lipid; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; β-oxidation","peptide YY; peptide YY[3-36]; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; body weight; comparative study; conference paper; controlled study; drug effect; energy balance; energy expenditure; epididymis fat; fatty acid oxidation; feces; food intake; gallbladder emptying; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; male; metabolic rate; metabolic syndrome X; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; obesity; respiratory quotient; weight reduction; Animalia; Rodentia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31544480051

As an alternative to recycling or disposal in repositories, many countries are proceeding successfully with the process of developing clearance guidelines that allow solids and building rubble containing traces of radioisotopes to be cleared from regulatory control and unconditionally released to the commercial market after a specific storage period. With the emergence of new clearance standards, we took the initiative to compare U.S. to European and other international limits. This exercise is proving valuable in understanding the differences between the clearance standards and their implications for the radwaste management of fusion power plants. While clearance standards now exist for most radionuclides that are mainly important to the fission industry, no such standards are in place for many radionuclides of interest to fusion facilities. Before fusion penetrates the energy market, fusion-specific standards should be developed to address the safe release of fusion materials with trace levels of radioactive contamination.","Clearance standards; Fusion power plant; Radwaste management","Radioactive wastes; Radioisotopes; Regulatory compliance; Standards; Clearence standards; Fusion waste management; Radwaste management; Power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344480640

This paper proposes a simple circuit technique that adaptively trades off overhead energy for maximum leakage savings under severe leakage variations. The proposed run-time leakage reduction technique for on-die SRAM caches considers architectural access behavior to determine how often the SRAM blocks should enter a sleep mode. A self-decay circuit generates a periodic sleep pulse with an adaptive pulse period, which puts the SRAM array into a sleep mode more frequently at high leakage conditions (fast process, high temperature) and vice versa. An 0.18-/spl mu/m 1.8-V 16-kbyte SRAM testchip shows 94.2% reduction in SRAM cell leakage at a performance penalty less than 2%. Measurement results also indicate that our proposed memory cell improves SRAM static noise margin by 25%.","Architectural access behavior; Maximum leakage savings; On-die SRAM caches; Overhead energy; Periodic sleep pulse; PVT-aware leakage reduction; Read stability improvement; Run-time leakage reduction technique; Self-decay circuit; Sleep mode","Leakage currents; Networks (circuits); Self adjusting control systems; Stability; Static random access storage; Switching circuits; Architectural access behavior; Maximum leakage savings; On-die SRAM caches; Overhead energy; Periodic sleep pulse; PVT-aware leakage reduction; Read stability improvement; Run-time leakage reduction technique; Self-decay circuit; Sleep mode; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344463249

Because this class of biopolymers has plastic-like properties, it has attracted considerable interest for biomedical applications and as a biodegradable commodity plastic. Current flow cytometric techniques to quantify intracellular PHB are based on Nile red. Here, an improved cytometric technique for cellular PHB quantification utilizing BODIPY 493/503 staining was developed. This technique was then automated using an automated flow cytometry system. Materials: Using flow cytometry, the fluorescence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cupriavidus necator with varying PHB content after staining with BODIPY 493/503 and Nile red was compared, and automated staining techniques were developed for both cultures. Results: BODIPY 493/503 staining had less background staining, higher sensitivity and specificity to PHB, and higher saturation values than did Nile red staining. The developed automated staining procedure was capable of analyzing the PHB content of a bioreactor sample every 25 min and measured the average PHB content with accuracy comparable to offline GC analysis. Conclusion: BODIPY 493/503 produced an overall better staining for PHB than did Nile red. When combined with the automated system, this technique provides a new method for the online monitoring and control of bioreactors. © 2005 International Society for Analytical Cytology.","Automated bioreactor monitoring; BODIPY 493/503; Nile red; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Ralstonia eutropha","biopolymer; boron derivative; boron dipyrromethane; carbon; plastic; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); unclassified drug; article; biodegradability; bioreactor; carbon storage; Cupriavidus necator; energy resource; flow cytometry; microbial growth; nonhuman; online monitoring; priority journal; prokaryote; quantitative analysis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sensitivity and specificity; staining; Wautersia eutropha; Boron Compounds; Coloring Agents; Cupriavidus necator; Flow Cytometry; Hydroxybutyrates; Oxazines; Polyesters; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Staining and Labeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30344453985

Summary Background Data: Accelerated lipolysis in severely burned children has been shown to play an important role in the accumulation of hepatic TGs. Severely burned children who survive 10 days or more after injury commonly have enlarged livers often twice or more normal size for their sex, age, and weight. Methods: Ninety-eight children, 2 to 18 years of age, with burns covering more than 40% of their body surface and who received either propranolol (β-adrenergic blockade) or placebo were studied. Liver weights were measured by ultrasonic scanning. Body composition changes were identified by dual-image x-ray absorptiometry and validated by whole-body potassium-40 scintillation counting. Discarded abdominal cutaneous adipose tissue was collected before and after propranolol or placebo for microarray analysis. Results: In 80% of severely burned children studied not receiving propranolol, liver sizes increased by 100% or more while 86% of burned children receiving propranolol showed a decrease or no change in liver size over the same period of time after injury. Gene expression patterns of adipose tissue after propranolol treatment showed that all of the identified genes related to lipid metabolism were down-regulated. Conclusions: Data reported here support the hypothesis that β-adrenergic blockade can reduce delivery of fatty acids to the liver and hepatic congestion commonly found in severely burned children by inhibiting lipolysis and reducing hepatic blood flow.

We estimate the shape by matching the projections of a 3-D global shape model with the micrographs; we choose the global model as a 3-D filament with a B-spline skeleton and a specified radial profile. The active contour algorithm iteratively updates the B-spline coefficients, which requires us to evaluate the projections and match them with the micrographs at every iteration. Since the evaluation of the projections of the global model is computationally expensive, we propose a fast algorithm based on locally approximating it by elongated blob-like templates. We introduce the concept of projection-steerability and derive a projection-steerable elongated template. Since the two-dimensional projections of such a blob at any 3-D orientation can be expressed as a linear combination of a few basis functions, matching the projections of such a 3-D template involves evaluating a weighted sum of inner products between the basis functions and the micrographs. The weights are simple functions of the 3-D orientation and the inner-products are evaluated efficiently by separable filtering. We choose an internal energy term that penalizes the average curvature magnitude. Since the exact length of the DNA molecule is known a priori, we introduce a constraint energy term that forces the curve to have this specified length. The sum of these energies along with the image energy derived from the matching process is minimized using the conjugate gradients algorithm. We validate the algorithm using real, as well as simulated, data and show that it performs well. © 2006 IEEE.","Active contour; Cryo; Microscopy; Ridge; Separable filtering; Spline; Steerable","Algorithms; DNA; Electron microscopy; Fourier transforms; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Molecules; Optimization; Three dimensional; Active contour; Global model; Projection-steerable; Separable filtering; Shape estimation; Stereo cryo-electron micro-graphs; Three-dimensional parametric active contour algorithm; Image segmentation; DNA; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; conformation; cryoelectron microscopy; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; three dimensional imaging; ultrastructure; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Cryoelectron Microscopy; DNA; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photogrammetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30144441093

Microparticles are phospholipid microvesicles of 0.05 to 1.5 μm in size, containing certain membrane proteins of their parental cells. Thus, different phenotypes of MPs derived from platelets, blood cells, endothelial cells, and some other cell types have been identified in plasma. Microparticles are released by various stimuli including shear stress, complement attack, or proapoptotic stimulation. Microparticle release is a highly controlled process and likely independent from metabolic energy. Elevated MPs in various diseases indicate their diagnostic importance, particularly in vascular pathologies. Moreover, MPs in blood possess a broad spectrum of biologic activities. Microparticles may facilitate cell-to-cell interactions, induce cell signaling, or even transfer receptors between different cell types. The physiological roles of MPs in various tissue defense processes have been suggested and the pathophysiologic implications of MPs in thrombosis, inflammation, cancer metastasis, or response to pathogens have been proposed. This is important for transfusion medicine because MPs are present in both plasma and cellular blood products. Thus, the investigation of potentially pathogenic effects of MPs in blood products and of MP release associated with blood product processing and storage have yet to come. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The transient discharge experiments were conducted in an undivided and equally divided 126 l rectangular storage vessel, which has a height to depth aspect ratio of 9.3:1 and is inclined at 30° to the horizontal. A 240-tube copper heat exchanger with a total surface area of 2.38 m2 was immersed in the storage fluid. For the divided storage, the heat exchanger flow path was in series through the two compartments. Water flow rate through the heat exchanger was varied from 0.05 to 0.15 kg/s to demonstrate the effect of varying the number of transfer units (NTU) from 2.2 to 7 on the relative performance of undivided and divided storage vessels. Reported measurements include transient storage temperature distribution, heat exchanger outlet temperature, delivered energy, and exergy of the divided and undivided storage. The divided storage provides higher energy delivery rates and higher heat exchanger outlet temperatures during most of the discharge. The magnitude of these benefits depends on NTU and the extent of discharge. For a flow rate of 0.05 kg/s, corresponding to a nominal NTU of 7, the divided storage delivers a maximum of 11% more energy than the undivided storage when 100 l of hot water or 55% of the stored energy has been delivered. For a flow rate of 0.15 kg/s, corresponding to a nominal NTU of 2.5, the divided storage delivers a maximum of 5% more energy at the same level of discharge.

The graphite, having been subject to a fast-neutron fluence from ∼1017 to ∼1020 n cm-2 over the life time of the reactor at temperatures not exceeding 100 °C, exhibits Wigner energies ranging from 25 to 572 J g-1 and a Wigner energy accumulation rate of ∼7 × 10-17 J g-1/n cm-2. The shape of the rate-of-heat-release curves, e.g., maximum at ca. 200 °C and a fine structure at higher temperatures, varies with sample position within the inner thermal column, i.e., the distance from the reactor core. Crystal structure of samples closest to the reactor core (fast-neutron fluence &gt;1.5-5.0 × 1019 n cm-2) is destroyed while that of samples farther from the reactor core (fast-neutron fluence &lt;1.5-5.0 × 1019 n cm-2) is intact, with marked swelling along the c-axis.

The performance of 15-day aeration of liquid manure with initial total solids (TS) content from 0.5% to 4.0% was examined at low-intensity aeration rates, i.e., +35 mV oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), 1.0 mg O2/l and 3.0 mg O 2/l dissolved oxygen (DO). Odor generation potential was evaluated using VFAs. The aeration process contributed remarkably to the decomposition of TS, total volatile solids (TVS), BOD5 and VFAs. Moreover, the stabilization of manure due to aeration could last up to 190 days. The TS reduction on day 190 ranging from 6.3% to 32.7%, 20.2% to 39.1%, 19.0% to 41.0% were realized under the intensities of +35 mV ORP, 1.0 and 3.0 mg O 2/l, respectively. At the same time, the reduction of BOD5 and VFAs reached around 7.8% to 69.5%, 17.2% to 79.9% and 21.9% to 91.1%; 0.4% to 91.0%, 60.4% to 95.0% and 70.4% to 94.1%. The liquid manure with low solids (e.g., TS of 0.5% and 1.0%) offered an advantageous condition for aeration treatment, particularly for biodegradation of BOD5 and VFAs. The odor generation potential could also be evaluated by the levels of solids and BOD5 in the manure. Increasing aeration intensity would significantly diminish the odor generation potential for given levels of solids and/or BOD5. Fifteen-day aeration with intensity of 1.0 mg O2/l may be recommended at farm level for both odor control and energy savings. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
