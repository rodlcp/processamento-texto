In this paper, a new method has been introduced to obtain optimal size of hybrid energy system, including wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV) panels and storage battery (SB). Optimization has considered two objective functions; total net present worth (TNPW) as cost function and energy index of reliability (EIR) as technical criteria. Because of complexity of problem and possibility of local minimum, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed. First of all, by using GA, the possibility of local minimum reduces and after specified iterations, PSO is used to improve optimization's speed and local tuning ability. © 2015 IEEE.","genetic algorithm; hybrid algorithm; multiobjective optimization; particle swarm optimization; photovoltaic panel; renewable energy; wind turbine","Cost functions; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Wind turbines; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Multi-objective design; Photovoltaic panels; Renewable energies; Standalone applications; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943809985

Therefore investing for installing new DGs in a micro-grid is needed. This paper investigates DG expansion planning for a micro-grid.

Each device in the media cloud is usually a mobile system consisting of several heterogeneous Processing Elements (PE). Energy efficiency has always been a challenge in this environment. In this paper, we propose a unified energy efficient algorithm for mapping multimedia applications on a media cloud infrastructure. The algorithm considers the distribution of tasks at two levels: among devices in the cloud and PEs of each device. The proposed algorithm heuristically finds the most energy efficient device for each task at the first stage. In the second stage, the least energy consuming PE among all available PEs is chosen for mapping. The efficiency of the proposed scheme has been evaluated by mapping H.264/AVC decoder on a media cloud. Simulation results indicate that by offloading application tasks on more power efficient PEs, the overall energy consumption for this application would be reduced by up to 12 times in a typical scenario in comparison to local processing. Meanwhile, the performance of the heuristic has been compared to the optimal solution. © 2015 IEEE.","Mapping algorithms; Media Cloud; MPSoC; Multimedia application","Conformal mapping; Energy utilization; Power management; System-on-chip; Distributed processing; Energy efficient algorithms; H.264/AVC decoders; Heterogeneous processing; Mapping algorithms; Media clouds; MPSoC; Multimedia applications; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940977821

Since this storage may be related to the use of sports drinks, this study evaluated the changes in liver, skeletal muscle and kidney glycogen content of rats supplemented with maltodextrin and submitted to aerobic exercise at maximum lactate steady state or high-intensity anaerobic exercise. Sixty-nine male Wistar rats, 60 days old at the beginning of the experiment, were used. The training protocol consisted of 8 weeks of continuous aerobic (60 min/day) or intermittent swimming (two periods of 30 min/day at an interval of 10 min and an exercise/rest ratio of 15 seconds), with overloads corresponding to 5% and 10% of body weight, respectively. The animals were supplemented for 37 days with a daily dose of 0.48 g/kg maltodextrin dissolved in water or received pure water. Factorial ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for data analysis. Aerobic training resulted in a significant increase in blood glucose (p<0.02) and in a decline in hepatic glycogen content (p<0.02), while anaerobic exercise promoted a significant increase in lactate concentration (p<0.001) and a decrease in skeletal muscle (p=0.02) and kidney (p<0.03) glycogen content. Maltodextrin supplementation significantly increased muscle (p=0.008) and kidney (p<0.02) glycogen content in rats submitted to aerobic exercise. Eight weeks of aerobic and anaerobic exercise caused changes in liver, skeletal muscle and kidney glycogen content, as well as in blood glucose and blood lactate. Maltodextrin supplementation was effective in increasing skeletal muscle and kidney glycogen stores in rats submitted to aerobic exercise. © 2015, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

However, successful utilization of conducting polymers relies on a fundamental understanding of their inherent possibilities and limitations. In this report we studied the temperature dependence of the self-discharge in polypyrrole and show that the rate of self-discharge is kinetically controlled by a polymer intrinsic endergonic electron transfer reaction forming a reactive intermediate. We further show that this intermediate is intimately linked to a process known as overoxidation. This process is general for most, if not all, p-doped conducting polymers irrespective of medium.

The cell resistance was found to be dominated by the electrolyte and current collector resistances while the contribution from the composite electrode material was negligible. Due to the electrolyte within the porous electrodes thin separators could be used in combination with thick composite electrodes without loss of performance. The paper separator contributed with a resistance of ∼1.5 Ω mm-1in a 1.0 M NaNO3electrolyte and the tortuosity value for the separator was about 2.5. The contribution from the graphite foil current collectors was about ∼0.4-1.1 Ω and this contribution could not be reduced by using platinum foil current collectors due to larger contact resistances. The introduction of chopped carbon fibres into the electrode material or the application of pressure across the cells, however, decreased the charge transfer resistance significantly.

A novel circuit for detecting the amplitude of the active part of the fundamental load current is also proposed. The detection time of the current is not more than 1/4 cycle. Its transient response is superior to the other conventional techniques. Moreover, the proposed algorithm avoids the use of mains voltage signal in the calculation of reference compensation current. Therefore, the mains current after compensation still has a purely sinusoidal waveform even when the mains voltage is distorted. In addition, a simple control scheme, based on the energy balance concept, is proposed to control the voltage of an energy-storage capacitor. Because the energy change in the energy-storage capacitor can be fast compensated, a small energy-storage capacitor is required. The advantages of the proposed active power filter are low cost, small size and fast transient response. Finally, some simulation results are presented for verification. © 2014 IEEE.","active power filter; energy balance; energy-storage capacitor","Energy balance; Energy storage; Power control; Signal processing; Transient analysis; Active power Filter; Control schemes; Conventional techniques; Energy storage capacitor; Fast transient response; Reference compensation currents; Sinusoidal waveforms; Voltage signals; Active filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921675316

We put particular focus on how, conceptually, plasmonic resonances can be used to study metal-hydrogen interactions at the nanoscale, both at the ensemble and at the single-nanoparticle level. Such efforts are motivated by a fundamental interest in understanding the role of nanosizing on metal hydride formation processes in the quest to develop efficient solid-state hydrogen storage materials with fast response times, reasonable thermodynamics, and acceptable long-term stability. Therefore, a brief introduction to the thermodynamics of metal hydride formation is also given. However, plasmonic hydrogen sensors not only are of academic interest as research tool in materials science but also are predicted to find more practical use as all-optical gas detectors in industrial and medical applications, as well as in a future hydrogen economy, where hydrogen is used as a carbon free energy carrier. Therefore, the wide range of different plasmonic hydrogen sensor designs already available is reviewed together with theoretical efforts to understand their fundamentals and optimize their performance in terms of sensitivity. In this context, we also highlight important challenges to be addressed in the future to take plasmonic hydrogen sensors from the laboratory to real applications in devices, including poisoning/deactivation of the active materials, sensor lifetime, and cross-sensitivity toward other gas species. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","hydrogen; localized surface plasmon resonance; metal hydride; nanoparticles; nanowires; palladium; sensing; sensors; surface plasmon resonance","Free energy; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Industrial research; Medical applications; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Nanowires; Oil field equipment; Palladium; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Plasmons; Resonance; Sensors; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Long term stability; Metal hydrides; Nanostructured metals; Plasmonic resonances; sensing; Single nanoparticle; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Surface plasmon resonance",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919725921

To attenuate this problem, there are solutions that involve data reuse strategies using on-chip SRAM memories. The main advantage of these solutions is the fact that they can achieve high external memory bandwidth reduction on reading operations. This paper presents an evaluation of the impact of the memory accesses and energy consumption considering a Level C+ data reuse scheme for four different fast algorithms and the Full Search algorithm. Our results show that the energy consumption for the traditional method, when no memory bandwidth reduction strategy is used, becomes impractical for most of the considered Motion Estimation algorithms. However, when the data reuse scheme Level C+ is used, the energy consumption related to the memory suffers a great reduction, making it possible for fast algorithms to be used in real-time video coding systems. The reduction reached is up to 97% when considering fast Motion Estimation algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.","data reuse; energy consumption analysis; Motion estimation","Algorithms; Bandwidth; Codes (symbols); Data reduction; Energy utilization; Image coding; Integrated circuit design; Motion analysis; Real time systems; Signal encoding; Static random access storage; Video signal processing; Data reuse; Energy consumption analysis; Fast motion estimation algorithm; Full Search algorithm; Motion estimation algorithm; Performance bottlenecks; Real time video coding; Video coding systems; Motion estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949146738

The existing cache partitioning algorithms assume Least Recently Used (LRU) as underlying replacement policy. We propose old Tree-based PLRU on two-level caches with higher speed up or performance matching of LRU at GPUs. The algorithm is based on Pseudo LRU that uses binary tree to reduce area overhead. Also, it uses set-dueling to dynamically adapt its insertion and promotion. We evaluate effect of this policy on both L1 and L2 caches in GPUs. We propose a high accuracy profiling logic and a cache partitioning hardware for our scheme. We evaluate the hardware costs in terms of performance, miss rates, DRAM locality, area, energy, and compare them with LRU and FIFO partitioning algorithms. We define a set of machine models to discuss our scheme on some general purpose workloads. The results show that our solutions impose negligible performance degradation comparing LRU. Then, we use insertion and promotion vectors to compensate for drop of performance. On compute workloads, the technique reduces L2 miss rate about 10.11%. © 2014 IEEE.","GPU; Insertion and promotion vector (IPV); Tree-based PLRU","Binary trees; Buffer storage; Program processors; Trees (mathematics); Cache partitioning algorithms; Insertion and promotion vector (IPV); Least recently used; Multi-core processor; Partitioning algorithms; Performance degradation; Performance matching; Tree-based; Graphics processing unit",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921033398

In this study, the oxidation stability of biodiesel treated with three prominent antioxidants, namely pyrogallol, propyl gallate and tert-butylhydroxyquinone was evaluated. The induction period of biodiesel with or without antioxidant was measured according to the EN14112 standard using a Rancimat instrument. Antioxidants were added at 500 ppm, which in general improved the induction period. The samples were kept for 70 days and different properties that change during storage, namely induction period, density and kinematic viscosity were monitored.

Paraffin wax is the core material and polyaniline is the shell in this preparation. These materials are environment-friendly. The chemical structure, surface morphologies, thermal properties and thermal stability of the encapsulated paraffin wax are determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetry analysis, respectively. The field-emission scanning electron microscopic results indicate that the paraffin wax is encapsulated well and that the capsules are spherical in shape. The differential scanning calorimetric analysis shows that the encapsulated paraffin wax has a large energy storage and releases capacity (22-121 J g-1) depending on the different ratios of the paraffin wax and polyaniline. The thermogravimetric analysis results indicate that polyaniline can improve the thermal stability of encapsulated paraffin wax because of the synergistic effect between the two (paraffin wax and polyaniline).

The NiS box-in-box hollow structures constructed by ultrathin nanosheets are evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitors. As expected, the NiS box-in-box hollow structures exhibit excellent rate performance and impressive cycling stability due to their unique nano-architecture. More importantly, the synthetic method can be easily extended to synthesize other transition metal sulfides box-in-box hollow structures.

This energy is stored for transmission of data packets which arrive at the link layer of an energy harvesting transmitter. Since the data and energy arrival processes are independent and random, the data packets wait in a queue for the accumulation of sufficient amount of energy and for service completion of previously arrived packets. Thus, the energy arrival process and the data service process jointly impact the data queue dynamics. This makes the queueing analysis of an energy harvesting communication system challenging. In this paper, we formulate a two stage virtual queueing system which decouples the wait stages for the energy arrival process and the service process. This virtual queueing system leads to closed-form expressions for the average packet delay and the probability of data packet loss due to buffer overflow. We assume that the data and energy arrivals are independent Poisson processes and the service time for data packets may have any general distribution. The expressions for the average packet delay and the probability of buffer overflow are shown to be exact when the service time becomes negligible, and the packet delay gets dominated by data packets waiting for arrival of sufficient energy. These expressions are compared with Monte Carlo simulations and are shown to be robust even when the service time is increased up to sixty percent of the average packet delay. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Buffer storage; Energy harvesting; Monte Carlo methods; Poisson distribution; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Arrival process; Average packet delays; Buffer overflows; Closed-form expression; Data packet loss; Queueing analysis; Service process; Transmission of data; Packet networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921030484

If Brazil still wants to generate 80% of its electricity from hydropower, there is the need to increase the country's energy storage capacity so that the excess generation coming from the dams in the Amazon region during the wet period can be used during the dry period. This article presents four ways to increase the storage capacity of a watershed. The most innovative alternative involves a large-scale pumped-storage site combined with a series of hydropower dams in cascade, which could store energy by pumping water to a new reservoir during the wet period and generate energy by releasing the stored water during the dry period. Even though pumped storage schemes have an average efficiency of around 75%, it has been calculated that the combination of a pumped storage site and a series of hydroelectric dams in cascade can increase the overall storage efficiency up to 90% and double the storage capacity of a watershed.

In this paper, we describe the use of a combination of scratch testing and KPFM analysis to evaluate the electrostatic effect induced by silver nanoparticles incorporated as clusters in diamond-like carbon (DLC) films, as well as its correlation with the rubbing process. KPFM was used for mapping of the potentials on the surfaces of DLC-Ag films subjected to nanoscale scratching. The procedure was also conducted at the microscale in order to analyze the way in which silver nanoparticles were spread in the track. After scratching, the track was analyzed using backscattered electrons (BSE) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX). The BSE images highlighted bright domains of metallic nanoparticles dispersed in the amorphous coating and EDX confirmed the presence of silver nanoparticles in the scratched track. Micro Raman spectroscopy was used to check the DLC signature. The electric potentials of DLC films with and without silver nanoparticles were also analyzed. The results indicated that the incorporation of silver nanoparticles in amorphous materials could offer new option for electrostatic energy storage on the surfaces of materials. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Adhesion; DLC film; KPFM; Scratch testing; Silver; Voltage mapping","Adhesion; Amorphous materials; Carbon films; Coatings; Diamond like carbon films; Electric potential; Electrostatics; Mapping; Metal nanoparticles; Silver; Silver metallography; Well testing; Backscattered electrons; DLC film; Energy dispersive x-ray diffractions; Kelvin probe force microscopy; KPFM; Micro Raman Spectroscopy; Scratch testing; Tribological applications; Silver nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918778414

Because of such huge amounts of digital transmission over digital devices, data centers have to consume a great deal of effectiveness to increase the efficiency of energy utilization for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. In Named Data Networking (NDN), the hierarchical name structure is beneficial for applications to reflect the data interrelationships. Every data packet has its own independent meaning, including content distribution, multicast, mobility, delay tolerance, packet source and packet destination, and each of which is stored in the router to meet the subsequent demands. The router can re-use the data and limit the size of the Pending Interest Table (PIT) to attain the most efficient data transmission. When network congestion occurs, data retransmission can be completed by means of cache. The copy in the data cache ensures the optimal path from the client to the closest content storage location and guarantees high-efficiency data transmission. In this paper, to make improvements on NDN routing mechanism, we propose to integrate IP with NDN routing over IP infrastructure, and therefore present a simple and practical strategy that allows NDN to perform the best performance and achieve energy efficiency in the network lifecycle. © 2014 IEEE.","CCN; NDN; PIT","Data transfer; Digital devices; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Life cycle; Carbon emission reductions; Content distribution; Data retransmission; Digital transmission; IP infrastructure; Named data networkings; Network congestions; Routing mechanism; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921024528

For tracking the maximum point, the proposed ANFIS was trained by the optimum values. The simulation results showed that the ANFIS controller of grid-connected mode could easily meet the load demand with less fluctuation around the maximum power point. Moreover, pitch angle controller, which was based on fuzzy logic with wind speed and active power as the inputs, could have faster responses, thereby leading to flatter power curves, enhancement of the dynamic performance of wind turbine and prevention of both frazzle and mechanical damages to PMSG.

The main objectives include water supply, hydropower generation and sediment flushing. In addition to some physical constraints such as the reservoir storage and the outlet flow, maximum flushing outflow and non-flushing in irrigation seasons, the environmental constraints as fish migration and spawning are taken into an account. After obtaining the Pareto optimal solutions by means of the weighted objective functions and non-symmetric Nash bargaining, various scenarios are defined. Then these scenarios are analyzed by introducing a new sustainability index. Furthermore, the different percentages of downstream water demand are considered in order to achieve a better evaluation of the scenarios. The results of study indicate that the optimal solutions are more sustainable than those of the current operation of Sefidrud reservoir, which increase the sediment flushing by 37 million tons compared to the current operation, with the same hydroelectric energy and downstream water supply.

However, the IO-channel power of a TSV-based 3D DRAM represents a significant portion of the 3D DRAM power. In this paper, we propose a built-in self-test (BIST) -assisted tuning scheme to adjust the driving capability of programmable drivers to fit the number of stacked 3D DRAM dies such that the IO-channel power can be minimized. A BIST design supporting specific test patterns and test flow for the driver tuning is proposed as well. Simulation results show that about 6.16×10 - 2 J energy saving can be achieved for a logic-DRAM stack with 150fF/die TSV load under 100s write operations if the proposed BIST-assisted tuning scheme is implemented in the logic die. © 2014 IEEE.","3D IC; at-speed test; BIST; DRAM; low power; through silicon via","Built-in self test; Dynamic random access storage; Electronics packaging; Energy conservation; Integrated circuit interconnects; At-speed test; Channel power; Driving capability; Low Power; Three-dimensional dynamics; Through-Silicon-Via; Through-Silicon-Via (TSV); Write operations; Three dimensional integrated circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920057599

Before spiropyran modification, the peak wavelength from PS was approximately 600 nm. Subsequent spiropyran modification strongly quenched the PL intensity, from 15,000 to 2000 counts. However, under UV light irradiation, the PL intensity from spiro-PS was increased gradually to 20,000 counts because of the photoinduced ring opening from a colorless spiropyran (SP-form) to a colored merocyanine (MC-form). Furthermore, the resulting peak wavelength of the PL of an MC-PS sample red-shifted from 600 to 650 nm, and the PL intensity was higher than that of unmodified PS. Because the fluorescence emission band (500-700 nm) of PS substantially overlapped the absorption band (500-700 nm) of the MC-form of spiropyran, the energy transfer from the PS (donor) to the open-ring-state MC-form (acceptor) occurs efficiently. The intensity of the PL from spiro-PS can be reversibly modulated using a heat stimulus. The current demonstrations have potential in reversible solid-state lighting or data storage applications. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Porous silicon; Reversible photoluminescence; Spiropyran","Digital storage; Energy transfer; Lighting; organic-inorganic materials; Photochromism; Photoluminescence; Data storage applications; Fluorescence emission; Modified Porous Silicon; Organic-inorganic hybrid materials; Photoinduced ring opening; Solid state lighting; Spiropyrans; UV-light irradiation; Porous silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915737524

The effects of the molecular structures on the charge mobility and OFET memory characteristics were systematically investigated in terms of the related frontier energy levels and morphologies. All the devices showed bistable nonvolatile memory characteristics but with a distinct charge storage behavior. The OFET memory devices using the PI(BPDA-DAP) electret exhibited a larger memory window of 81 V compared to those of PI(PMDA-DAP) and PI(ODPA-DAP), mainly attributed to its low-lying LUMO energy level that results from its more extended conjugation. Both the high retention time (around 104 s for the ON/OFF states) and steady write-read-erase-read (WRER) cycles suggested good stability and read/write properties of the studied devices. As the aliphatic spacer length increased from PI(PMDA-DAP) to PI(PMDA-DAH) and PI(PMDA-DAD), the memory characteristics changed from flash to WORM (write once read many times) behaviour. Furthermore, the memory window was reduced with the increased aliphatic spacer length, due to the reduced density of the conjugated electron-trapping sites. This study demonstrated that the electrical characteristics and charge mobility of transistor memory devices can be effectively modulated through the extent of conjugation of the electron accepting moiety and spacer length in polymer electrets. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,"Electrets; Nonvolatile storage; Organic field effect transistors; Polyetherimides; Polyimides; Charge mobilities; Electrical characteristic; Electron-accepting; Electron-accepting moieties; Extended conjugation; LUMO energy levels; Non-volatile memory; Write-once read-many-times; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908491632

In order to stabilize the shape and enhance the thermal conductivity of PA, the effects of adding nitrogen-doped graphene (NDG) as a carbon nanofiller were examined experimentally. NDG was dispersed in liquid PA at various mass fractions (1-5. wt%) using high power ultrasonication. The dropping point test shows that there was clearly no liquid leakage through the phase change process at the operating temperature range of the composite PCMs. The thermal stability and thermal properties of composite PCM were investigated with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), respectively. The thermal conductivity of the PA/NDG composite was determined by the laser flash method. The thermal conductivity at 35. °C increased by more than 500% for the highest loading of NDG (5. wt%). The electrical conductivity of composite PCMs was increased significantly by using NDG. The thermal cycling test proved that the PA/NDG composites PCMs had good thermal reliability and chemical durability after 1000 cycles of melting and freezing. The thermal effusivity of the PA/NDG composite PCMs was larger than that of pure PA, which is advantageous for latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Graphene; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy storage","Differential scanning calorimetry; Doping (additives); Durability; Graphene; Heat storage; Latent heat; Liquids; Nitrogen; Palmitic acid; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Composite phase change materials; Differential scanning calorimeters; Electrical conductivity; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Operating temperature ranges; Properties of composites; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermogravimetric analyzers; Thermal conductivity; carbon; composite; durability; energy efficiency; latent heat flux; thermal conductivity; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907163721

However, existing works focused mainly on single-level cell (SLC) design while the potential of multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM has not yet been fully explored. It is expected that MLC STT-RAM can achieve 2× the storage density of SLC and thus improves system performance. Unfortunately, at the device level, the two-step read/write scheme introduces performance and energy overhead. In this paper, we propose an architectural design to dynamically reconfigure the cache block size for a MLC STT-RAM last-level cache. Our approach place certain hot data chunks in smaller blocks so as to benefit from the lower latency and energy, while keeping the rest in larger blocks to maintain an overall hit rate. Experiment shows that our strategy reduces the performance and energy penalty of MLC STT-RAM caches with a slightly higher miss rate. On average, IPC is increased by 4.6% while energy consumption is reduced by 23.5% compared to the conventional MLC STT-RAM cache. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Energy utilization; Cache blocks; Energy overheads; Energy penalties; Last-level caches; Multi level cell (MLC); On-chip cache; Single level cells; Storage densities; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919704807

Sweet potato roots were randomly chosen from each replicate and evaluated for measurement of weight loss, sugar content analysis, and sprouting after 0, 14, 24, 48, 56, 70, 84, and 98 days of storage. Fresh sweet potato roots were baked at 200 °C for 60 min then samples were taken for sugar analysis. After 14 days of ambient condition storage, the sprouting percentages for TNG57, TNG66, and TNG73 were 100, 85, and 95 % respectively. When sweet potatoes were stored at 15 °C, the weight loss became less and no sweet potato root sprouted after 14 days of storage. Because manufacturers can store sweet potatoes at 15 °C for almost 2 month without other treatments, the supply capacity shortage in July and September can be reduced. The total sugar content slowly increased along with increasing the storage time. After baking, the total sugar content of sweet potatoes significantly increased due to the formation of maltose. Maltose became the major sugar of baked sweet potatoes. Raw sweet potatoes stored at 15 °C had higher total sugar contents after baking than those stored under ambient conditions.

Results: After that morphometric, functional and biochemical parameters were measured. The echocardiographic study showed enlargement of the left atria, increase in the left ventricular systolic volume and reduced systolic function. Within the cardiac metabolism, exposure to CS decreased beta hydroxy acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenases and citrate synthases and increased lactate dehydrogenases. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) were expressed similarly in both groups. CS increased serum lipids and myocardial triacylglycerols (TGs). These data suggest that impairment in fatty acid oxidation and the accumulation of cardiac lipids characterize lipotoxicity. CS group exhibited increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defense. Finally, the myocyte cross-sectional area and active Caspase 3 were increased in the CS group. Conclusion: The cardiac remodeling that was observed in the CS exposure model may be explained by abnormalities in energy metabolism, including lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. © 2014 Santos et al.",,"3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; caspase 3; cigarette smoke; citrate synthase; lactate dehydrogenase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; triacylglycerol; citrate synthase; enoyl coenzyme A hydratase; lactate dehydrogenase; lipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; Ppargc1a protein, rat; transcription factor; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cardiomyopathy; controlled study; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; heart atrium enlargement; heart left ventricle volume; left ventricular systolic volume; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; rat; adverse effects; animal; biosynthesis; blood; cardiomyopathy; chemically induced; drug effects; echocardiography; heart muscle; lipid metabolism; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathology; smoking; Animals; Cardiomyopathies; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Echocardiography; Enoyl-CoA Hydratase; Lactate Dehydrogenases; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Myocardium; Oxidative Stress; PPAR alpha; Rats; Smoking; Transcription Factors; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914703496

Recently, it has been used as an ingredient in poultry feed. Mycotoxin contamination of PKC due to inappropriate handling during production and storage has increased public concern about economic losses and health risks for poultry and humans. This concern has accentuated the need for the evaluation of mycotoxins in PKC. Furthermore, a method for quantifying mycotoxins in PKC has so far not been established. The aims of this study were therefore (1) to develop a method for the simultaneous determination of mycotoxins in PKC and (2) to validate and verify the method. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using an electrospray ionisation interface (ESI) in both positive- and negative-ion modes was developed for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisins (FB1 and FB2), T-2 and HT-2 toxin in PKC. An optimum method using a 0.2 ml min–1 flow rate, 0.2% formic acid in aqueous phase, 10% organic phase at the beginning and 90% organic phase at the end of the gradient was achieved. The extraction of mycotoxins was performed using a solvent mixture of acetonitrile–water–formic acid (79:20:1, v/v) without further clean-up. The mean recoveries of mycotoxins in spiked PKC samples ranged from 81% to 112%. Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) for mycotoxin standards and PKC samples ranged from 0.02 to 17.5 μg kg−1 and from 0.06 to 58.0 μg kg−1, respectively. Finally, the newly developed method was successfully applied to PKC samples. The results illustrated the fact that the method is efficient and accurate for the simultaneous multi-mycotoxin determination in PKC, which can be ideal for routine analysis. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","LC-MS/MS; multi-mycotoxins; optimisation; palm kernel cake; simultaneous determination","Agriculture; Electrospray ionization; Formic acid; Health risks; Losses; Mass spectrometry; Negative ions; Organic solvents; Public risks; LC-MS/MS; multi-mycotoxins; Optimisations; Palm kernel cake; Simultaneous determinations; Liquid chromatography; acetonitrile; aflatoxin B1; aflatoxin B2; aflatoxin G1; aflatoxin G2; formic acid; fumonisin B1; fumonisin B2; mycotoxin; ochratoxin; trichothecene derivative; vomitoxin; water; zearalenone; carcinogen; industrial waste; mycotoxin; Article; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography; plant product; tandem mass spectrometry; analysis; animal; animal food; Arecaceae; calibration; chemical structure; chemistry; comparative study; economics; electrospray mass spectrometry; food contamination; food control; food industry; high performance liquid chromatography; industrial waste; Malaysia; microbiology; plant seed; poultry; prevention and control; procedures; reproducibility; tandem mass spectrometry; validation study; Animal Feed; Animals; Arecaceae; Calibration; Carcinogens, Environmental; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Food Contamination; Food Inspection; Food-Processing Industry; Industrial Waste; Limit of Detection; Malaysia; Molecular Structure; Mycotoxins; Poultry; Reproducibility of Results; Seeds; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914104297

This paper reviews global shale gas resources and considers both the opportunities and challenges for their development. It then provides a review of the literature on opportunities to store CO2 in shale, thus possibly helping to mitigate the impact of CO2 emissions from the power and industrial sectors. The studies reviewed indicate that the opportunity for geologic storage of CO2 in shales is significant, but knowledge of the characteristics of the different types of shale gas found globally is required. The potential for CO2 sorption as part of geologic storage in depleted shale gas reservoirs must be assessed with respect to the individual geology of each formation. Likewise, the introduction of CO2 into shale for enhanced gas recovery (EGR) operations may significantly improve both reservoir performance and economics. Based on this review, we conclude that there is a very good opportunity globally regarding the future of geologic storage of CO2 in depleted shale gas formations and as part of EGR operations. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","CO2 storage in geological formations; EGR; Natural gas production; Shale formations; Shale gas","Carbon dioxide; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Geology; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Petroleum reservoirs; Shale gas; Enhanced gas recoveries; Geological formation; Global carbon emission; Industrial sector; Natural-gas production; Reservoir performance; Shale formation; Shale gas reservoirs; Shale; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate effect; enhanced oil recovery; environmental economics; hydrocarbon reservoir; industrial emission; mitigation; performance assessment; shale gas; sorption",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948951936

More specifically, the incorporation of thermal energy storage makes it possible to store the collected solar thermal energy and use it during off-sun periods, for multiple domestic needs (e.g. cooking, heating, etc). For this to happen, heat must be extracted from the storage to the utility. In order for the extraction process to be done in an efficient way, thermal stratification of heat storage is beneficial. Through comparison of hourly temperature profiles of three different rock-bed heat storages, this paper discusses the influence of length and cross-sectional area of the storage on its thermal stratification. Preliminary findings suggest that by increasing length and reducing diameter of the storage, its thermal stratification is enhanced. © 2014 IEEE.","heat storage; prototype; renewable; rock bed; solar thermal energy; stratification; Temperature gradient","Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermal energy; Thermal gradients; Thermal stratification; Cross sectional area; Extraction process; prototype; renewable; Solar thermal energy; Temperature profiles; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936764017

Polycrystalline GdOx film with a thickness of 17 nm and a small via-hole size of 0.4 μm are observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) image. All elements and GdOx film are confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Repeatable resistive switching characteristics at a current compliance (CC) of 300 μA and low operating voltage of ±4 V are observed. The switching mechanism is based on the oxygen vacancy filament formation/rupture through GdOx grain boundaries under external bias. After measuring 50 RRAM devices randomly, the 8-μm devices exhibit superior resistive switching characteristics than those of the 0.4-μm devices owing to higher recombination rate of oxygen with remaining conducting filament in the GdOx film as well as larger interface area, even with a thinner GdOx film of 9 nm. The GdOx film thickness dependence RRAM characteristics have been discussed also.

The thermal unstable bond (O-O) of OPs is easily decomposed releasing amounts of heat based on external thermal source and catalytic substance such as acid, base, or metal ions, resulting in the unexpected fire and explosion. Our aim was to explore the incompatible hazard for TBPO mixed with common inorganic acid or base such as HCl, H3PO4, HNO3, H2SO4, or Mg(OH)2, by non-isothermal calorimeter, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal calorimeter, thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) and typical kinetic model, obtaining various thermal stability parameters such as exothermic onset temperature (T0), exothermic maximum temperature (Tmax), heat of decomposition (ΔHd), and activation energy (Ea) that can be used to evaluate the fundamental incompatible hazard information for TBPO. According to experimental results, when TBPO is mixed with 6 N HNO3 and 6 N NaOH, it indeed increases thermal hazard than pure TBPO. Therefore, we avoid using or mixing HNO3 and NaOH under abnormal conditions during TBPO's storage, transportations, manufacturing and discard process.","Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Fire and explosion; Tert-Butyl-peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate (TBPO); Thermal activity monitor III (TAM III)","calorimetry; ethylene; organic compound; polymerization; reaction kinetics; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928161314

Standardized protocols have been developed for determining critical figures of merit, such as the electrochemical surface area, mass activity and specific activity. Even so, when new and more active catalysts are reported, the catalyst stability tends to play a minor role. In this work, we monitor corrosion on RuO2 and MnOx by combining the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We show that a meaningful estimation of the stability cannot be achieved based on purely electrochemical tests. On the catalysts tested, the anodic dissolution current was four orders of magnitude lower than the total current.

The major challenges of designing this cloud storage system are to provide a better privacy guarantee and ensure the integrity of data at untrusted servers in distributed cloud storage system. To achieve this goal, we propose a threshold encryption scheme and integrate it with a secure decentralized erasure code to form a secure cloud storage system, where the user generates a secret parameter participated in system encryption and decryption of plaintext blocks in the combine process.

In typical risk analysis, systems are usually modeled as discrete and Boolean variables with constant failure rates via fault trees. Nevertheless, in many cases, it is not possible to perform an efficient analysis using only discrete and Boolean variables. The approach put forward by the proposed methodology makes use of BNs and incorporates recent developments that facilitate the use of continuous variables whose values may have any probability distributions. Thus, this approach makes the methodology particularly useful in cases where the available data for quantification of hazardous events probabilities are scarce or nonexistent, there is dependence among events, or when nonbinary events are involved. The methodology is applied to the risk analysis of a regasification system of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on board an FSRU (floating, storage, and regasification unit). LNG is becoming an important energy source option and the world's capacity to produce LNG is surging. Large reserves of natural gas exist worldwide, particularly in areas where the resources exceed the demand. Thus, this natural gas is liquefied for shipping and the storage and regasification process usually occurs at onshore plants. However, a new option for LNG storage and regasification has been proposed: the FSRU. As very few FSRUs have been put into operation, relevant failure data on FSRU systems are scarce. The results show the usefulness of the proposed methodology for cases where the risk analysis must be performed under considerable uncertainty. © 2014 Society for Risk Analysis.","Bayesian networks; FSRU; LNG regasification; Reliability analysis; Risk analysis","Bayesian networks; Digital storage; Failure analysis; Floating liquefied natural gas; Gas fuel purification; Iterative methods; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Probability distributions; Proven reserves; Reliability analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Constant failure rate; Continuous variables; Efficient analysis; Floating storage and regasification units; FSRU; Hybrid Bayesian networks; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); LNG regasification; Liquefied natural gas; natural gas; Bayes theorem; risk assessment; Bayes Theorem; Natural Gas; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921019888

Here, we detect the phase transitions of individual palladium nanocrystals during hydrogen absorption and desorption, using in situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy in an environmental transmission electron microscope. In contrast to ensemble measurements, we find that palladium nanocrystals undergo sharp transitions between the Î± and Î 2 phases, and that surface effects dictate the size dependence of the hydrogen absorption pressures. Our results provide a general framework for monitoring phase transitions in individual nanocrystals in a reactive environment and highlight the importance of single-particle approaches for the characterization of nanostructured materials. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"Characterization; Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron scattering; Energy dissipation; Life cycle; Nanocrystals; Nanostructured materials; Palladium; Thermodynamics; Transmission electron microscopy; Bulk counterpart; Energy and information; Environmental transmission electron microscopes; Hydrogen absorption; In-situ detections; Induced phase transition; Sharp transition; Single particle; Phase transitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919726924

We show the benefits of energy cooperation in this regime. When the renewable energy and demand profiles are stochastic and only causally known at the BSs, we propose an online energy cooperation algorithm and show the optimality properties of this algorithm under certain conditions.

In many countries PV systems generate electricity directly from sunlight at a cost that is lower than the price of retail electricity. PV technology has become a viable option for large-scale low-cost electricity generation. Due to the intermittent supply of solar electricity by PV, the load management, demand response, and storage techniques together with intelligent power management are developed to facilitate matching of the electricity supply and demand.

It provides a higher-level abstraction that is easier to program, and that enables software composition. Transactions are defined by programmers, but the runtime system is responsible for detecting conflicts and avoiding race conditions. Phase Change Memory (PCM) is a new technology that is being developed to replace Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAMs) in large datacenters. PCM write operations are much more expensive than reads in both energy and time. In this paper, we analyze performance, energy consumption, and write patterns in software transactional memories (STMs) to determine the potential of optimization for PCM scenarios. As the write operations are more expensive both in time and energy in PCMs, benchmarks from the STAMP suite were instrumented to count bits swapped due to store instructions, and experiments were executed using TinySTM. Our results showed a pattern of few bits being flipped for each memory write, and performance was inversely proportional to the number of writes. For most benchmarks, there was a small increase in energy consumption with more threads, which may be explained by the timid contention manager used by TinySTM. © 2014 IEEE.","parallel programming; phase change memory; Software trasactional memory; transactional memory","Computer architecture; Energy utilization; Parallel programming; Phase change memory; Storage allocation (computer); Technology transfer; Dynamic random access memory; Higher-level abstraction; Lock-based synchronization; Phase change memory (pcm); Software composition; Software transactional memory; Synchronization method; Transactional memory; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919460703

In this study, physical, thermal and water-sorption properties of passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims f. flavicarpa Degener) seeds were determined. The knowledge of such properties is useful to design equipment or operations for storage or processing purposes. The physical properties of bulk density, particle density and bulk porosity, and the thermal properties of conductivity, diffusivity and specific heat were determined between water and mass fractions of 0.126 and 0.493. The thermal properties were determined for packed beds of seeds (effective properties), by means of which the thermal properties of the seeds (particle properties) were estimated. Different empirical models were evaluated for modeling the physical and thermal properties as function of moisture content. Physical and thermal properties were successfully described by a second-order polynomial, except by the specific heat which was described by a second-order logarithmic relationship. The isosteric heat, the differential entropy and the Gibbs free energy of water sorption were estimated using the Henderson model, which best fitted the experimental desorption isotherms at temperatures between 30°C and 70°C and relative humidities between 2% and 90%. © 2014 by De Gruyter 2014.","Passiflora edulis, modeling; physical properties; thermal properties; thermodynamic properties","Free energy; Fruits; Gibbs free energy; Packed beds; Physical properties; Specific heat; Thermodynamic properties; Desorption isotherms; Differential entropy; Effective property; Logarithmic relationship; Particle densities; Particle properties; Passiflora; Second-order polynomial; Sorption; Passiflora edulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84917740513

They also have good thermal resistivity as well as mechanical properties which result in their usage in many applications such as sewer pipes, solvent storage tanks, and mining and other industrial equipments. In the present work, nanosized silica was employed as reinforcement to improve VE mechanical properties. Hence, to study the influence of nanosilica particles on the tensile strength, Young's modulus and toughness of mentioned nanocomposites, nanosilica-vinyl ester nanocomposites with different silica weight percentages (0·3, 0·75, 1) were fabricated. Moreover, the effects of nanosilica particles on the tensile fracture surfaces and VE deformation mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that increasing the nanosilica fillers results in tensile strength deterioration as well as Young's Modulus increasing. Adding nanosilica reinforcements up to 0·3 (%wt) improves the fracture toughness while decreasing the fracture energy. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Deformation mechanism; Nanosized SiO2; Vinyl ester","Deformation; Deterioration; Elastic moduli; Esters; Fracture toughness; Nanocomposites; Reinforcement; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Vinyl resins; Deformation mechanism; Hostile environments; Industrial equipment; Nanosilica particles; Nanosized SiO2; Strength deterioration; Tensile fracture surfaces; Vinyl esters; Tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916597493

In this work, the relationship between the nanotubular aspect ratio and electrochemical performance of LIBs is elucidated for the first time. The stirring hydrothermal method was used to control the aspect ratio of viscous titanate nanotubes, which were used to fabricate additive-free TiO2-based electrode materials. We found that the battery performance at high charging/discharging rates is dramatically boosted when the aspect ratio is increased, due to the optimization of electronic/ionic transport properties within the electrode materials. The proof-of-concept LIBs comprising nanotubes with an aspect ratio of 265 can retain more than 86% of their initial capacity over 6000 cycles at a high rate of 30C.

Separating the clock network voltage requires amendments in the standard cell library and physical designs. Here, the experiments used a 65-nm technology that exhibited considerable OCVs, which caused write and retention errors in clocked storage cells and limited the voltage scaling of microcontrollers. Using the SCNV provides an extraordinary operability to correct errors in the low-voltage clocked storage cells. In addition, the area overhead of the proposed implementation is negligible. Applying the SCNV, the measurement results indicate that the microcontrollers can be operated below 0.3 V, over 0.15-V extension in voltage scaling, and achieve the optimal energy consumption at 0.34 V. Separating the clock network voltage has tradeoff issues in system timing and energy consumption based on the measurement results, and this brief discusses proper applications. © 2014 IEEE.","Digital clocking; dynamic voltage scaling (DVS); flip-flop; process variation; subthreshold circuit.","Controllers; Electric clocks; Energy utilization; Flip flop circuits; Separation; Voltage scaling; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Digital clocking; Dynamic voltage scaling; flip-flop; Process Variation; Sub-threshold circuits; Random errors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914703547

Modification of phase change materials by impurity doping has been proved to be an effective way to improve phase change memory device performance. In this study, the most common phase change material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), was employed, and its intrinsic properties were modified using boron-ion implantation. The GST films were implanted with 20 keV boron ions to fluences of 5 × 1014 and 5 × 1015 ions/cm2. The characteristics of the virgin and boron-implanted GST films were investigated by SIMS, XRD, and in situ resistance measurement. The kinetics of the thermally activated phase transition was also analyzed on the basis of the Arrhenius relationship. The results revealed that both crystallization temperature and activation energy of crystallization increase with increasing the boron fluence. The data retention capability is also enhanced from 83 to 88 °C, corresponding to a criterion of 10-year archival lifetime. In addition, the XRD spectra indicated that high-fluence boron-ion implantation partially inhibits the transition of the GST films from face-centered cubic phase to hexagonal close-packed phase. In conclusion, the thermal stability of the GST films can be improved through boron-ion implantation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Crystallization temperature; Data retention; Ion implantation; Phase change material","Activation energy; Antimony compounds; Boron; Germanium compounds; Ion implantation; Ions; Phase change materials; Semiconductor doping; Semiconductor storage; Thermodynamic stability; Thin films; X ray diffraction; Activation energy of crystallization; Boron Ion implantation; Crystallization temperature; Data retention; Face centered cubic phase; Hexagonal close packed; Nonvolatile semiconductor memory; Situ resistance measurements; Phase change memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912151068

Experimental data from open circuit measurements of the individual electrode potentials of charged symmetrical two-electrode energy storage devices as a function of time were evaluated based on three different self-discharge models. This evaluation clearly showed that the self-discharge process of the positive electrode is governed by a previously undetected activation-controlled faradaic reaction while the self-discharge of the negative electrode is due to diffusion controlled oxidation involving oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte. Potentiostatic three-electrode measurements and spectroelectrochemical experiments also showed that protons as well as maleimide were released from positively polarized polypyrrole electrodes. These new findings clearly show that the self-discharge of the cells originate from two different types of reactions on the positive and negative electrodes and that the main contribution to the self-discharge of the cells comes from an activation controlled reaction involving the positive electrode.

In reservoir operation simulations, there are iterative procedures (feedback loops) due to the dependency of reservoir release on both initial and final reservoir storage. System dynamics can successfully satisfy this need. Given the complex implicit and nonlinear relationships that exist in hydropower reservoirs, the system dynamics approach can be efficient in the planning and management of those reservoirs. This paper develops a system-dynamics simulation model using Vensim for the operation of a hydropower reservoir system (Khersan 1, Karoon 4, and Karoon 3) that is located in series and in parallel in the Karoon river basin, Iran. Steps of the model design include definition of decision variables, formulation of model, and method of solution to compute the output of the hydropower reservoirs. To assess the effects of the reservoirs on each other and the importance of each reservoir, operational scenarios are considered. Reservoir performance criteria (reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability) and mean energy production over a 44-year simulation period are calculated for each operational scenario. The results show that addition of the Khersan 1 reservoir to the system composed of Karoon 4 and Karoon 3 reservoirs increases the average amount of energy production by 20% without a significant loss in performance criteria. The sensitivity analysis for Khersan 1 is conducted in two states. The amounts of installed capacity of the power plant and maximum storage volume of the reservoir are increased by 20% and decreased by 20%, respectively. The results show that, in terms of energy production, the effect of increasing the installed power-plant capacity of Khersan 1 is greater than that of increasing the maximum reservoir storage volume of this reservoir. Therefore, by considering the same percentage increase (20%) in both installed capacity and maximum storage volume, it is preferable to increase the installed capacity of the power plant at Khersan 1 reservoir. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Hydropower; Operation; Reservoir systems; Simulation; System dynamics","Feedback; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Iterative methods; Reservoirs (water); Sensitivity analysis; System theory; Water management; Hydropower; Operation; Reservoir systems; Simulation; System Dynamics; Reservoir management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910661101

So far, the only practical way to store such large amounts of energy is in the form of a chemical energy carrier, i.e., a fuel. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells offer the ability to convert solar energy directly into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is being investigated for photoelectrochemical solar water splitting since it has a band gap of 2.0 eV with favorable energy band positions for water cleavage; it is abundant and environmentally friendly. A major challenge with Cu2O is its limited chemical stability in aqueous environments. We present a simple and low-cost treatment to create a highly stable photocathode configuration for H2 production, consisting of steam treatment of the multilayer structures.

The redox conversion of the pendant groups is found to be limited by the quinone redox kinetics in thin films, rather than by the conduction through the polypyrrole backbone. Rate constants for the elementary steps involved in this 2e-, 2H+ process are reported. As the films are made thicker, a gradual transition to a diffusion limited reaction is observed. The origin of the diffusion process, as well as the elementary reaction steps limiting the pendant group redox conversion is analyzed using DFT computations. The fact that the electron transport through the thin film conducting polymer backbone is not limiting the quinone reaction kinetics should allow for design of battery electrodes with high rate capabilities based on the studied material. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To understand how such responses differ in recently isolated populations (<11,000 years), we studied four Baltic populations of the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius L.) from coastal locations (seasonal temperature range, 0-29°C) and from colder, more thermally stable spring-fed ponds (1-19°C). Salinity and predation pressure also differed between these locations. We acclimatized wild-caught fish to 6, 11, and 19°C in common garden conditions for 4-6 months and determined their aerobic scope and hepatosomatic index (HSI). The freshwater fish from the colder (2-14°C), predator-free pond population exhibited complete temperature compensation for their aerobic scope, whereas the coastal populations underwent metabolic rate reduction during the cold treatment. Coastal populations had higher HSI than the colder pond population at all temperatures, with cold acclimation accentuating this effect. The metabolic rates and HSI for freshwater fish from the pond with higher predation pressure were more similar to those of the coastal ones. Our results suggest that ontogenic effects and/or genetic differentiation are responsible for differential energy storage and metabolic responses between these populations. This work demonstrates the metabolic versatility of the nine-spined stickleback and the pertinence of an energetic framework to better understand potential local adaptations. It also demonstrates that instead of using a single acclimation temperature thermal reaction norms should be compared when studying individuals originating from different thermal environments in a common garden setting. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"fresh water; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; environment; Estonia; female; genetic variability; genetics; liver; male; metabolism; physiology; population migration; predation; salinity; Smegmamorpha; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Migration; Animals; Environment; Estonia; Female; Fresh Water; Genetic Variation; Liver; Male; Predatory Behavior; Salinity; Smegmamorpha; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909594929

In other regions where fossil energy is more expensive and not subsidized, seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) is the most common desalination technology but it is still energy-intensive (3-4kWh_e/m3). Both processes therefore lead to the emission of significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Moreover, MSF and SWRO technologies are most often used for large desalination facilities serving urban centers with centralized water distribution systems and power grids. While renewable energy (RE) sources could be used to serve centralized systems in urban centers and thus provide an opportunity to make desalination greener, they are mostly used to serve rural communities off of the grid. In the KSA, solar and geothermal energy are of most relevance in terms of local conditions. Our group is focusing on developing new desalination processes, adsorption desalination (AD) and membrane distillation (MD), which can be driven by waste heat, geothermal or solar energy. A demonstration solar-powered AD facility has been constructed and a life cycle assessment showed that a specific energy consumption of &lt;1.5kWh_e/m3 is possible. An innovative hybrid approach has also been explored which would combine solar and geothermal energy using an alternating 12-h cycle to reduce the probability of depleting the heat source within the geothermal reservoir and provide the most effective use of RE without the need for energy storage.

Combining this system with a double-effect H2O/LiBr absorption system could reduce the investment costs for cooling purposes. These systems require generation temperatures higher than 150°C. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in the desired temperature range have previously not been thoroughly studied and the integration of an LHTS system into this absorption system has not previously been reported. In this paper a numerical investigation was carried out for a shell-and-tube LHTS system, combined with a solar driven H2O/LiBr double-effect absorption system. The numerical model of the LHTS system was coupled with a mathematical model of the absorption system, and the estimation of the cooling demand and the solar energy. The phase change process was numerically solved using the enthalpy method. Hydroquinone was identified as a suitable PCM. Results indicated that for this configuration of the LHTS system, natural convection cannot be neglected in the modelling of the solidification process. With a LHTS system of 12.55m3, it was possible to fulfil the considered 100kW peak cooling demand for the 2400m2 office building without external energy input.

A deep understanding of their behaviour with regard to variations in the degree of saturation is of significance for such applications. With the aim to establish a sound protocol for shale retention behaviour analysis, this paper presents an experimental methodology that takes into account the specificities of shales such as small pore size dimensions and the large variations in water potential to be applied to induce significant changes in the degree of saturation. The technique involves the direct control of the shale water content and the subsequent measurement of the suction at equilibrium by a psychrometer. A fluid displacement technique with a non-polar liquid is also used to assess the volume changes of the shale and to compute the degree of saturation. Selected test results are presented for various shale samples that have been cored at different depths. The results indicate that important features of the retention behaviour of geomaterials are fundamental aspects to be considered when analysing the retention behaviour of shales, such as the existence of main wetting and drying paths, the hysteresis domain, and the dependency of the air entry value on the void ratio. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Nuclear waste disposal; Opalinus Clay; Shales; Suction; Water retention behaviour","Pore size; Radioactive wastes; Supersaturation; Waste disposal; Degree of saturations; Engineering applications; Experimental analysis; Experimental methodology; Nuclear waste storage; Opalinus clay; Suction; Water retention; Shale; pore space; radioactive waste; saturation; shale; suction; void ratio; volume change; waste disposal; water retention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907601741

Safety performance of energy systems can have important implications on the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability as well as availability, acceptability and accessibility aspects of energy security. Therefore, this study provides a broad comparison of energy technologies based on the objective expression of accident risks for complete energy chains. For fossil chains and hydropower the extensive historical experience available in PSI's Energy-related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD) is used, whereas for nuclear a simplified probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) is applied, and evaluations of new renewables are based on a combination of available data, modeling, and expert judgment. Generally, OECD and EU 27 countries perform better than non-OECD. Fatality rates are lowest for Western hydropower and nuclear as well as for new renewables. In contrast, maximum consequences can be by far highest for nuclear and hydro, intermediate for fossil, and very small for new renewables, which are less prone to severe accidents. Centralized, low-carbon technology options could generally contribute to achieve large reductions in CO2-emissions; however, the principal challenge for both fossil with Carbon Capture and Storage and nuclear is public acceptance.

Grid-connected and stand-alone microgrid scenarios were modeled, utilizing measured wind speed and solar irradiation data, real time manufacturer data for technology components, and a bottom-up approach to model a flexible demand from demand response. The modeled results show that there is a very high potential for renewable electricity at the site, which can make this drink water treatment plant's electricity consumption between 70% and 96% self-sufficient with renewable electricity from solar PV and wind power production. The results show that wind production potential is very high onsite and can meet 82% of onsite demand without adding solar PV. However, PV production potential is also substantial and provides a more balanced supply which can supply electricity at times when wind production is insufficient. Due to the supplemental supply over different parts of the day, adding solar PV also increases the benefits gained from the demand response strategy. Therefore, a solar-wind system combination is recommended over a wind only system. A 100% renewable system would require extremely large battery storage, which is not currently cost effective. Ultimately, even at the low wholesale electricity and sell-back price for large electricity consumers, grid-connection and the ability to trade excess electricity is extremely important for the cost-effectiveness of a microgrid system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed generation; Drinking water plant; Energy storage; Microgrid; Renewable energy","Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Industrial research; Water treatment plants; Wind power; Drinking water plants; Electricity consumers; Electricity-consumption; Micro grid; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Wholesale electricity; Wind power production; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; demand analysis; demand-side management; drinking water; economic analysis; energy efficiency; feasibility study; renewable resource; solar power; technical efficiency; water treatment; wind power; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906498281

Therefore, it is beneficial if the renewable energy sources can continue to supply without any voltage and frequency violation during islanded operation. In this paper, islanded operation of photovoltaic systems is enabled with the aid of a droop controlled bidirectional inverter. A control algorithm is developed to control the inverter so that it is able to stabilize the voltage and frequency by minimizing the power mismatch at the inception of islanding, allowing the photovoltaic systems to operate in the islanded mode.

The nature characteristic of wind generator is nonlinear which leads to variable power output generation. In addition, the demanded load power is subjected to a change due to any disturbances may happen in the load voltage or current. Therefore, it is essential to integrate the WECS with a suitable storage element to either, act as a source of compensating the inadequate in power, or act as a load to absorb the excess power generated by the wind generator. Although the AC rectified voltage of the wind generator is proportional to the wind speed which is variable, however, the DC-bus voltage is usually regulated by the bidirectional converter at a specified value. Hence, the output power of the system can be investigated by means of the output currents from the WECS and the ultracapacitor.

After a proper thermal treatment, a CoO wire-void-CoSnO3 tube was formed with the decomposition of Co2(OH)2CO3 and its simultaneous reaction with the outer SnO2 layer. In this unique wire-in-tube structure, both CoO and CoSnO3 are promising materials for lithium ion battery anodes with high theoretical capacities, and the porous + hollow feature is essential for better electrode/electrolyte contact, shorter ion diffusion path and better structure stability.

However, large configuration design spaces require prohibitive design space exploration time (e.g., due to lengthy design space analyses, simulations, and/or evaluations) to determine the best configuration given these requirements and goals. To significantly reduce design space exploration time, we evaluate a design space subsetting method that removes energy-redundant configurations (i.e., configurations that provide similar energy savings as other configurations), thus significantly reducing the design space while still providing high-quality, energy-saving configurations. Prior work verified design space subsetting's efficacy, however, prior work required extensive design-time effort and complete a priori knowledge of the system's anticipated applications. In this work, we alleviate these limitations and significantly broaden the usability of design space subsetting.

Specific control of power plants in a VPP pool lead to a redefinition of their dynamic constraints. Interactions between them and the rest of the grid are complex. System level model and simulation of such grid featuring VPP is necessary and must be used for research as well as for the design phase. This paper illustrates by time domain simulations a situation with a VPP consisting of wind power (200MW), photovoltaic power (100MW) and pumped storage (+/- 250MW), integrated into an islanded grid with a thermal power plant for base load (1300MW). Different control strategies of the pumped storage power plant show how it can improve the overall power quality of the VPP. © 2014 IEEE.","frequency control; hydro power plant; Islanded power network; Photovoltaic Power plant; power balance; power quality; pumped storage; Renewable Energy; Virtual Power Plant; wind farm","Electric frequency control; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power quality; Pumped storage power plants; Quality control; Thermoelectric power plants; Time domain analysis; Wind power; Hydropower plants; Photovoltaic power plant; Power balance; Power networks; Pumped Storage; Renewable energies; Virtual power plants; Wind farm; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916227755

However, these materials can only absorb UV radiation, which is approximately 5% of the incident solar radiation on Earth. The doping of TiNTs with metals or nonmetals, such as nitrogen, is one strategy that is used to make these materials sensitive to visible light. Here, we obtained TiNTs by hydrothermally treating anatase powder in a NaOH aqueous solution. The TiNTs were subsequently doped with nitrogen via an ion exchange process using different concentrations of NH4NO3 (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 mol L-1) as the nitrogen source. After the ion-exchange process, the samples were calcined at 200 and 400 °C, which produced nitrogen-doped titanate nanotubes (NTiNTs) and nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanotubes (NTiO2NTs), respectively. All of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and various spectroscopic techniques. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to identify and quantify the defects created in the nanotube structures from doping and the calcination process. Our analysis revealed that the number of defects in the NTiO 2NTs depended on the nominal NH4NO3 concentration, which formed paramagnetic NO species and single electron-trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOVs). As proof of this concept, the nanotubes were used as photocatalysts with visible light for the degradation of methylene blue (MB). The degradation rate significantly improved depending on the NH 4NO3 concentration when the NTiO2NTs were used as the photocatalyst. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Nitrogen doping; Photocatalysis and EPR; Titanate nanotubes","Aromatic compounds; Calcination; Defects; Degradation; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysis; Ion exchange; Magnetic materials; Magnetic resonance; Nitrogen; Paramagnetism; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Titanium dioxide; Virtual storage; X ray diffraction; Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR); Energy conversion and storages; Ion exchange process; Nitrogen-doping; Spectroscopic technique; TiO; Titanate nanotubes; Visible-light photocatalytic activities; Nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904915844

Herein, we present a new sodium ion intercalation material, NaxCo2/3Mn 2/9Ni1/9O2, which has been synthesized by a sol-gel route in air followed by a heat treatment at 800 °C for 12 h. Its structure has been studied by X-ray diffraction showing that the material crystallized in a P2-type structure (space group P63/mmc). As far as the electrochemical properties of NaxCo2/3Mn 2/9Ni1/9O2 as positive electrode are concerned, this compound offers a specific capacity of 110 mAh g-1 when cycled between 2.0 and 4.2 V vs. Na+/Na. The electrodes exhibited a good capacity retention and a coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.4%, as well as a reversible discharge capacity of 140 mAh g-1 when cycled between 2.0 and 4.5 V.

The remarkable efficiency reached in transferring the energy between the collection and storage events recently has been attributed to long-lived electronic coherence present in such antennae systems. We present numerical simulations indicating that the spectroscopic transients that supported this hypothesis are not induced by electronic coherence but instead are caused by vibrational (nuclear) motion in the electronic ground state potential. Besides emphasizing the significance of such nuclear modes, our findings stimulate a reconsideration of the role of electronic coherence in promoting energy transfer in natural photosynthesis. Furthermore, they require us to rethink how energy transfer efficiency is reflected in spectral signals.

A battery consisting of P25Py coupled to a lithium metal disc is assembled and the electrochemical performance and cycling stability of the conjugated polymer is analyzed. In all electrolyte combinations P25Py is conductive and shows reversible redox chemistry between -1.0 and -2.0 V vs ferrocene with capacitive response characteristics. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy response of the material can be described by a Randles equivalent circuit with a finite length Warburg diffusion element in which the diffusion coefficient of the cations increases with increasing doping level of the polymer. In the battery cell configuration the polymer shows reversible cycling with no capacity fading during the first 100 cycles without conducting additives.

Finding the best amounts of DRAM and NVM in hybrid main memory systems is a nontrivial design-time issue, the best solution to which depends on many factors. Such resource partitioning between DRAM and NVM can be framed as an optimization problem where the minimum of a target metric is sought, trends matter more than absolute values, and thus the precision of detailed modeling is overkill. Here we present Crystal, an analytic approach to early and rapid design-time resource partitioning of hybrid main memories. Crystal provides first-order estimates of system-level execution time and energy, sufficient to enable exhaustive search of the best amount and type of NVM for given workloads and partitioning goals. Crystal thus helps system designers to quickly find the most promising hybrid configurations for detailed evaluation. E.g., Crystal shows how for specific workloads higher system-level performance and energy efficiency can be achieved by employing an NVM with the speed and energy consumption of NAND Flash instead of a much faster and more energy efficient NVM like phase-change memory. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Crystals; Dynamic random access storage; Ecology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Flash memory; Integrated circuit design; Analytic approach; Detailed modeling; Hybrid configurations; Hybrid main memory; Non-volatile memory technology; Optimization problems; Resource partitioning; System-level performance; Phase change memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932636642

However, the research on novel Na-storage electrode materials is still in its infancy, and the cycling stability, specific capacity, and rate capability of the reported electrode materials cannot satisfy the demands of practical applications. Herein, a high performance Sb2O3 anode electrochemically reacted via the reversible conversion-alloying mechanism is demonstrated for the first time. The Sb2O3 anode exhibits a high capacity of 550 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and 265 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. A reversible capacity of 414 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 is achieved after 200 stable cycles. The synergistic effect involving conversion and alloying reactions promotes stabilizing the structure of the active material and accelerating the kinetics of the reaction.

To complicate matters, a November 2013 decision by the United States Court of Appeals (2013) in Washington, DC eliminated the very fee designed to finance used-fuel storage - which had accumulated over $30 billion so far - introducing a further obstacle (Nuclear Energy Institute, 2014a). It was not supposed to be this way. The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act bound the federal government by law to take custody of all civilian waste from power companies for final disposal, under the assumption that the waste would be permanently stored in a deep geological repository at Nevada's Yucca Mountain and overseen by the Energy Department. The Act obligated the US government to begin accepting waste by 1998, but the government was unable to fulfill this promise, forcing it to remunerate the utility companies for continuing to store the waste and assume liability. This situation cannot continue. As a solution, the commission argues that the US government should establish a widely distributed series of regional, government-run sites that would take in the used fuel from the cooling pools of several reactors, thereby consolidating the interim storage of used fuel and putting this nuclear waste into stronger, safer, more secure, more manageable - and ultimately more affordable - dry casks, as a first step toward ultimate disposal. Dry casks have withstood earthquakes and floods, and are designed to withstand the heat of fires and the impact of airplanes; the 100-ton structures are hard to steal or damage, and require no cooling systems or power supplies. These are some of the many reasons why making the transition to dry cask-based interim storage should be made as quickly as possible, regardless of one's opinion of civilian nuclear power. © The Author(s) 2014.","Canister; Disposal; Dry cask; Interim storage; Nuclear waste; Permanent storage; Used fuel",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909578755

The converter consists of two stages: a DC-DC stage implemented with a bidirectional half-bridge converter that operates on buck or boost mode (during charge or discharge of the ESS, respectively), and a DC-AC full-bridge three-phase bidirectional inverter. The two stages are connected through a DC link, which also works as a power-decoupling element. Isolation from the microgrid is obtained with a Δ-Y low frequency transformer. A control strategy is proposed where the DC-DC stage regulates the DC link voltage level while the DC-AC controls the three-phase output voltage and frequency, therefore acting as a grid-forming converter (GFC). A modified droop strategy is implemented to control the power generated inside the microgrid to avoid overcharging the ESS. Voltage unbalance reduction capabilities were implemented in order to deal with unbalanced loads. A 15kW prototype was successfully built and tested in different situations and the experimental results are shown. © 2014 IEEE.",,"DC-DC converters; Microgrids; Bi-directional inverters; Control strategies; DC-link voltages; Energy storage systems; Half-bridge converters; Power decoupling; Unbalanced loads; Voltage unbalances; Electric inverters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934326288

It is therefore suitable for energy storage elements in UPS, renewable energy system, vehicle, and micro-grid applications. The proposed novel secondary-modulation technique forces the currents through the primary side (low voltage side) devices to reverse its direction resulting in zero current switching (ZCS) or natural commutation of current-fed low voltage side devices. Secondary side (high voltage side) devices are turned-on with zero voltage switching (ZVS). In addition, the resonance between the device parasitic capacitance and transformer leakage inductance achieves ZVS turn-on of the primary side devices. Thus, the converter maintains a zero voltage-zero current switching (ZVZCS) of the current-fed low voltage devices and ZVS of high voltage devices. As the applications requires high voltage conversion ratio, the current-fed technology achieves better voltage boost with reduced transformer turns ratio. Also, high current applications needs short circuit protection and that is built-in the converter inherently. It limits the peak current and circulating current through the devices resulting in low kVA rating devices. Steady-state operation, analysis, design of the proposed converter and the soft-switching conditions have been studied and explained. The proposed topology has been compared with current-fed three phase half bridge (CF-DAB3) analytically. The Simulation results using PSIM 9.3 have been illustrated to verify the analysis and design.

Large-scale directional declines in vegetation greenness may indicate decreases in carbon uptake and substantial changes in the energy balance of the Amazon. We use improved estimates of surface reflectance from satellite data to show a close link between reductions in annual precipitation, El Niño southern oscillation events, and photosynthetic activity across tropical and subtropical Amazonia. We report that, since the year 2000, precipitation has declined across 69% of the tropical evergreen forest (5.4 million km2) and across 80% of the subtropical grasslands (3.3 million km2). These reductions, which coincided with a decline in terrestrial water storage, account for about 55% of a satellite-observed widespread decline in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). During El Niño events, NDVI was reduced about 16.6% across an area of up to 1.6 million km2 compared with average conditions. Several global circulation models suggest that a rise in equatorial sea surface temperature and related displacement of the intertropical convergence zone could lead to considerable drying of tropical forests in the 21st century. Our results provide evidence that persistent drying could degrade Amazonian forest canopies, which would have cascading effects on global carbon and climate dynamics.","Amazon; Climate change; MAIAC; MODIS; NDVI; Precipitation","carbon; rain; Article; canopy; climate; cloud; contamination; drought; El Nino; evergreen rain forest; grassland; land use; leaf area; photosynthesis; precipitation; rain forest; sea surface temperature; tropical rain forest; vegetation; vegetation dynamics; biological model; Brazil; climate change; grassland; Brazil; Climate Change; Grassland; Models, Biological; Rain; Rainforest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909619338

In the same way as other types of storage, e.g. pumped-hydro units, this new type of storage equipment can improve the use of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Additionally, the stationary batteries location in the grid is not as physically constrained as other storage systems and can be optimally selected to maximize its overall benefits. This paper proposes a new methodology to represent the unique stochastic behavior of stationary batteries while integrated into an electrical power system. This methodology includes not only the technical restrictions of this type of storage system but also how its operation strategy affects its lifetime. The methodology was tested on a small test system, which is based on the IEEE-RTS 79, using sequential Monte Carlo simulation as its core to accurately reproduce the chronology of events of stationary batteries. The results of the simulation are focused on the potential impacts of these storage devices not only in terms of renewable energy used but also in the adequacy of supply. © 2014 IEEE.","composite system adequacy assessment; sequential Monte Carlo simulation; stationary batteries; wind power","Electric power systems; Natural resources; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Virtual storage; Wind power; Electrical power system; Operation strategy; Probabilistic analysis; Renewable energy source; Sequential Monte Carlo simulation; Stationary batteries; Stochastic behavior; Use of renewable energies; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915747173

The nanochannels of the AAO template, which is covered on one side with a conducting Au layer, were filled by using Catalytic Ni nanowires (Ni-NWs). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX) and Raman spectroscopy were used to prove the formation of coiled CNTs on Ni-NWs. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and impedance spectroscopy were used to investigate the capacitive behavior of the coiled CNT/Ni-NW. Electrochemical analysis revealed that as electrodes for supercapacitors the coiled CNT/NW porous structured materials exhibit a high specific capacitance (202 F g-1 at a current density of 10 A g-1) as well as excellent cycle stability and can retain more than 92% of the initial response after 6000 cycles. On the other hand as prepared coiled CNT/Ni-NW electrode worked over a wide potential window (2.1 V) in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at room temperature. Combining the specific capacitance with the large electrochemical window ensures the superior energy and power densities of nanostructure electrodes, which would be useful to improve the performance of new energy storage technologies.

In order to realize all these advantages, we first review the key requirements for storage materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). STT-switching current is too high for low-power application due to low-energy efficiency. Among different types of alternative switching methods, electric field (EF) assisted switching is the most promising candidate. We proposed Oersted field guided EF switching and EF pulse width controlled switching for ellipse cells. Our experimental results show that even with an external field of ±5 Oe, the magnetization switching can be realized through applying an electric field. Our simulation results show that for ellipse cells, the bi-state switching can be controlled by EF pulse width without any external field.

One of the most famous porous absorbents which has been used for separation and storage of several gases is called metal organic framework (MOF). These kinds of absorbents have been intensely studied in recent years. In this study, the experimental data related to methane adsorption on and desorption from five absorbents, namely, MOF-5, MOF-177, MOF-200, MOF-205 and MOF-210 have been adopted. Then, the methane sorption has been modeled by applying Perturbed Hard Sphere Chain Equation of State (PHSC EoS). PHSC equation of state has three molecular-based parameters, r, σ and ε which are the number of segments per molecule, the hard-sphere diameter and the non-bonded interaction energy, respectively. These three parameters have been calculated using the group contribution (GC) method. The amount of methane uptake in the adsorbents has been obtained through gas-absorbents phase equilibrium calculations at temperature 298K and various pressures up to 90×105Pa. Finally, results have been compared with the experimental data to show the precision of PHSC equation of state in predicting the methane sorption trend. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Methane; PHSC Equation of State; Porosity; Sorption; Zn-based MOF","Porosity; Sorption; Equation of state; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908311763

The first step in the chain from grown biomass-to-energy conversion is the process of harvesting. When wood needs to be harvested from mountainous or hilly landscapes, cable haulers are used, as vehicles with wheels or tracks cannot safely move through such steep forests. For the harvest of rice, wheat, or other cereals with a resulting by-product straw, in most modern farming systems, a so-called combine is used. This machine combines cutting and threshing. Harvesting of microalgae, which consist of bioparticles in suspension, means separating them from the aqueous production medium. Systems for storing biomass can be subdivided into two types: outdoor and indoor storage. The type of biomass packing morphology mainly determines the storage solution. The main techniques used for size reduction of biomass are chunking, chipping, crushing, and milling/pulverization.

This chapter discusses the key issues both from a point of view of global socioeconomics and ecological sustainability. It describes the global energy situation in terms of expected population development, associated demand for energy supply, and implications of energy supply schemes on the environmental development. Biomass is abundantly available stored solar energy, which is thus indirectly used. In order to enable the large-scale introduction of sustainably produced bioenergy and biomass-derived products, a number of technical and nontechnical issues have to be addressed and solved, such as the configuration of the production technology chain, storage and transportation options, integration into the existing energy system, and social acceptance. There is a wide international debate on certification, dealing with the quality of biomass products and related practices; this determines availability and thus pricing. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Inc.","Biomass conversion; Ecological sustainability; Energy supply; Global energy demand; Socioeconomic sustainability","Bioconversion; Ecology; Economics; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Biomass conversion; Ecological sustainability; Energy supplies; Environmental development; Global energy demand; Production technology; Socioeconomic aspects; Storage and transportations; Biomass",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926396698

The WirelessHART protocol was created in 2007, and it's the first open wireless communication standard specifically designed for industrial environments. This protocol has been gaining increasing applicability in industry due to its high reliability and robustness. Because it is a recent protocol, there are still many ongoing researches. One of them is related to tools for analyzing and monitoring the network. Such tools have the main objective to capture the messages that travel on the network, acting as a sniffer. However, the WirelessHART protocol has some peculiarities as compared to other wireless networks, such as the use of 15 different channels. Because of this, many sniffers already proposed for wireless networks can not be applied, because its capture data on only one frequency. This paper proposes a new tool, which has advantages such as: data capture in 15 channels using only one radio receiver, local storage of captured data using a memory card and measuring the energy in the channels for getting information about interference in the network. In addition, an offline application presents statistics and analysis about the captured data. The results show that the tool is working properly as a sniffer and it's performing the interference detection in the network. A case study shows the behavior of the WirelessHART network coexisting with IEEE 802.11 standard. © 2014 IEEE.","coexistence in wireless networks; network analyzer; WirelessHART","Digital storage; Electric network analyzers; Industrial informatics; Wireless networks; High reliability; IEEE 802.11 standards; Industrial environments; Interference detection; Off-line applications; Statistics and analysis; Wireless communication standards; WirelessHART; IEEE Standards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914126675

Recent studies discovered that the double-layers of Cu2O/TiO2 films possess such capacity. In order to investigate this specific phenomenon, we use a DC magnetron reactive sputtering to deposit a double-layer of Ag2O/TiO2 films on glass substrate. The film thicknesses of the double-layer are 300 nm and 200 nm respectively. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and UV-VIS-NIR photospectrometer and photoluminance tests were used to study the structure, morphology, optical absorption and band gaps of the stacked films. From XRD and SEM, we can confirm the microstructures of each layer. The UV-VIS-NIR spectrum revealed that the optical absorption of Ag2O/TiO2 fell in between the single film of Ag2O and TiO2. Further, two band gaps were estimated for Ag2O/TiO2 films based on the Beer-Lambert law and Tauc plot. Photoluminance and photoelectrochemical tests indicated that delayed emission by electron-hole recombination and photoelectrical current was effectively support the mechanism of electrons transfer from Ag2O to TiO2 at Ag2O/TiO2 interface in the double-layer films. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Ag2O TiO2 thin film; DC magnetron reactive sputtering; Optical absorption; Photoelectrical current","Absorption spectroscopy; Copper oxides; Electrochemistry; Electrons; Energy gap; Infrared devices; Light absorption; Magnetrons; Morphology; Oxide minerals; Reactive sputtering; Scanning electron microscopy; Silver oxides; Substrates; Titanium dioxide; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; DC magnetron reactive sputtering; Double-layer films; Electron-hole recombination; Photoelectrochemicals; Photoexcited electrons; Photospectrometer; TiO2 thin films; UV-VIS-NIR spectra; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912014049

Here, we investigated whether diagonal stride cross-country roller skiing (DIA) utilizes similar mechanisms. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that running and DIA would share similar phase relationships and magnitudes of kinetic energy (KE), and gravitational potential energy (GPE) fluctuations, indicating elastic energy storage and return, as if roller skiing is like 'running on wheels'. Experienced skiers (N=9) walked and ran at 1.25 and 3ms-1, respectively, and roller skied with DIA at both speeds on a level dual-belt treadmill that recorded perpendicular and parallel forces. We calculated the KE and GPE of the center of mass from the force recordings. As expected, the KE and GPE fluctuated with an out-of-phase pattern during walking and an in-phase pattern during running. Unlike walking, during DIA, the KE and GPE fluctuations were in phase, as they are in running. However, during the glide phase, KE was dissipated as frictional heat and could not be stored elastically in the tendons, as in running. Elastic energy storage and return epitomize running and thus we reject our hypothesis.

Mitigation of this increase by storage of CO2 in abandoned marine oil and gas reservoirs is seen as an interesting cost effective solution. However, this involves a risk of CO2 loss causing localised reductions in seawater pH. In this paper we report on the effects of CO2 enhancement on the growth of the bivalve Cerastoderma edule in mesocosms. The experiments show significant reductions in shell length, shell weight and cockle flesh dry weight at increased CO2 level suggesting both direct (shell erosion) and indirect (metabolic) effects.

Measurements of firmness have traditionally been carried out according to the Magness Taylor (MT) procedure; using a texture analyzer or penetrometer in reference texture tests. In this study, a non-destructive method using Laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) technology was used to estimate texture firmness of pears. This technique was employed to detect responses to imposed vibration of intact fruit using a shaker. Vibration transmitted through the fruit to the upper surface was measured by LDV. A fast Fourier transform algorithm was used to process response signals and the desired results were extracted. Multiple Linear Regression models using fruit density and four parameters obtained from modal tests showed better correlation (R2 = 0.803) with maximum force in Magness Taylor test compared to the models that used only modal parameters (R2 = 0.798). The best polynomial regression models for pear firmness were based on elasticity index (EI) and damping ratio (η) with R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.64, respectively. This study shows the capability of the LDV technique and the vibration response data for predicting ripeness and modeling pear firmness and the significant advantage for commercially classifying of pears based on consumer demands. © 2012, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).","Firmness; Laser doppler vibrometer; Multivariate linear regression; Non-destructive measurement; Storage","Classifiers; Digital storage; Doppler effect; Energy storage; Fast Fourier transforms; Food storage; Laser Doppler velocimeters; Linear regression; Modal analysis; Nondestructive examination; Polynomial regression; Textures; Fast Fourier transform algorithm; Firmness; Laser Doppler vibrometers; Multiple linear regression models; Multivariate linear regressions; Non-destructive measurement; Nondestructive methods; Polynomial regression models; Fruits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920254842

One common feature of different midbrain regions is that they all express the long form of leptin receptor (LepRb). Leptin is mainly produced and secreted by white adipose tissue, informing the brain centers via LepRb about the amount of fat storage in the body. In this way, leptin exerts its action in the midbrain to regulate different functions. First, this review deals with the basic information of leptin and its signaling. Then, attention is given to various interactions of leptin with the midbrain regions, including ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), rostral linear raphe (RLi) and centrally-projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWcp). Also, the projection areas of these midbrain regions are discussed.

Recently, many researchers have used combinatorial designs as key predistribution schemes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Previous studies on security of WSNs are mainly concentrated on those networks containing nodes with the same capabilities. Further, investigations reveal that high reliability and lifetime on networks can be achieved through hierarchical heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, where a small number of sensor nodes have more energy, memory, and transmission capability. Inspired by scheme due to Lee and Stinson, we propose a key predistribution scheme for a clustered heterogeneous WSN using transversal designs. This proposed scheme assigns key chains to sensor nodes before deployment and separates key pool of each cluster by adding a pseudo-random generated number after deployment. The performance evaluation and security analysis show that our proposed scheme can provide better security with significant reductions on communication overhead and storage space than other key management schemes without compromising connectivity. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Combinatorial design; Heterogeneous wireless sensor network; Key predistribution; Resilience; Security; Transversal design","Network security; Combinatorial design; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Key pre-distribution; Resilience; Security; Transversal designs; Sensor nodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910669603

This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the topology and flywheel size, which are the key design parameters of a mechanical hybrid powertrain. The topology is optimized from a limited set of over 20 existing mechanical hybrid powertrains described in the literature. After a systematic classification of the topologies, a set of four competitive powertrains is selected for further investigation. The fuel-saving potential of each hybrid powertrain is computed using an optimal energy controller and modular component models, for various flywheel sizes and for three certified driving cycles. The hybridization cost is estimated based on the type and size of the components. Other criteria, such as control complexity, clutch wear, and driving comfort are qualitatively evaluated to put the fuel-saving potential and the hybridization cost into a wider perspective. Results show that, for each of the four investigated hybrid powertrains, the fuel-saving benefit returns the hybridization investment well within (about 50%) the service life of passenger vehicles. The optimal topology follows from a discussion that considers all the optimization criteria. The associated optimal flywheel size has an energy storage capacity that is approximately equivalent to the kinetic energy of the vehicle during urban driving (50 km/h). © 2014 IEEE.","Continuously variable transmission (CVT); flywheel; hybrid powertrain; optimal control","Costs; Economics; Flywheels; Fuel economy; Fuels; Hybrid powertrains; Investments; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Topology; Transportation; Vehicle transmissions; Wheels; Continuously variable transmission; Control complexity; Energy storage capacity; Key design parameters; Mechanical transmission; Optimal controls; Optimization criteria; Passenger vehicles; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909606656

Two orientations of hydrogen were used on the concave and convex sides of corannulene. It was seen that binding to the concave face is favored relative to the convex face. The average binding energy was calculated and corrected for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) using the counterpoise method. Results showed that binding energy varies depending upon the site and side of absorption. The electronic density, charge transfer and spatial prohibition of the substituted groups affects the binding energy. The increment of the electronic density because of the substitution of electron donor groups facilitates hydrogen adsorption and leads to larger binding energies than when H atoms are substituted by electron acceptor groups. Substitution of H atoms with each of the considered groups leads to decreasing of the HOMO-LUMO energy gap and so decreasing of the kinetic stability and increasing of the reactivity.

In this Minireview, we summarise existing knowledge on double-function bioelectrodes, that is, single electrodes concurrently manifesting bio-electrocatalytic and charge-storage features, and describe important historical aspects and achievements in this area. We also discuss a recently proposed method for concomitant electric power generation and storage, which is exemplified by fabricated and characterised self-charging bio-supercapacitors, also termed charge-storing biofuel cells. The electric power in these hybrid devices is uninterruptedly generated by direct transformation of chemical energy into electric energy, as occurs in biofuel cells. The power is simultaneously and directly stored within a single device, relying on different types of capacitance based on reversible charge-transfer reactions (pseudocapacitance) and/or electric double-layer capacitance, as in electrochemical capacitors. We also present some unpublished results on both dual-feature electrodes and hybrid biodevices and briefly highlight the prospects for their application. Anyone can hit an uncovered object! This Minireview covers aspects of hybrid electric power devices that use biocatalyst-coupled electrodes and attempts to introduce some classification to this research area. Examples are discussed in the contexts of bio-electrocatalysis, self-charging and charge-storage properties, and their applications.

On the one hand, supply voltage scaling down to the near-threshold (near-V\rm T ) or even to the subthreshold (sub-V\rm T) domain is a commonly used, efficient technique to reduce both leakage power and active energy dissipation. On the other hand, emerging CMOS-compatible device technologies such as Resistive Memories (ReRAMs) enable non-volatile, on-chip data storage and zero-leakage sleep periods. For the first time, we present and compare ReRAM-based Non-Volatile Flip-Flop (NVFF) topologies which are optimized for low-voltage operation (including near-V\rm T and sub-V\rm T operation). Three low-voltage NVFF circuit topologies are proposed and evaluated in terms of energy dissipation and reliability. Using topologies with two complementary programmed ReRAM devices, Monte Carlo simulations accounting for parametric variations confirm reliable data restore operation from the ReRAM devices at a sub-V\rm T voltage as low as 400 mV. A topology using a single ReRAM device exhibits lower write energy, but requires a near-V\rm T voltage for robust read. Energy characterization is performed at nominal, near-V\rm T, and sub-V\rm T supply voltages.

It is shown that Si preamorphization increases the average anode voltage and slightly reduces the volume expansion of the anode during the insertion of the metal atoms. Analysis of computed formation energies of Li, Na, and Mg defects in a-Si and c-Si suggests that the insertion energetics of single atoms into a-Si are thermodynamically more favorable. For instance, the lowest defect formation energies of Li, Na, and Mg defects in a-Si are respectively 0.43, 1.42, and 1.52 eV lower compared to those in c-Si. Moreover, the defect formation energies of Li, Na, and Mg defects (vs. vacuum reference states) in a-Si are comparable with the metal cohesive energies and consequently the insertion of the metal atoms might be possible with appropriate control of charging process. This is in contrast to c-Si, where the storage of Na and Mg atoms is limited due to high energy cost of Na and Mg insertion into c-Si. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Storage within several deep Cambrian sandstone aquifers, sealed by a thick sequence of Ordovician and Silurian limestone and marlstone, was investigated. Stratigraphic and structural traps were considered within the Faludden, När and Viklau reservoirs. Effective CO2 storage capacities and associated uncertainty were calculated probabilistically, using methods outlined by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Geological Survey. Detailed characterisation of porosity, reservoir thickness, top reservoir structure, CO2 density and storage efficiency factor was performed. A Monte Carlo approach was adopted to generate distributions of effective storage capacity for the scenarios considered. Within the study area, the most suitable structural trap is the S41/Dalders structure, located in the southeastern part of the Swedish sector, with estimated low, mid and high storage capacities of 85Mt, 145Mt and 224Mt, respectively. The regional Faludden stratigraphic pinch out trap was assessed to have low, mid and high effective storage capacities of 4330Mt, 5579Mt and 6962Mt, respectively.

Biodiesel is an alternative energy source that can contribute to a reduction in environmental pollution. The aim of the present work was to evaluate biodegradation of diesel, biodiesel, and a 20% biodiesel-diesel mixture in oxisols from southern Brazil, using two bioremediation strategies: natural attenuation and bioaugmentation/biostimulation. Fuel biodegradation was monitored over 60 days by dehydrogenase activity, CO2 evolution and gas chromatography. The bacterial inoculum employed for bioaugmentation/biostimulation consisted of Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and PCR-DGGE using 16S RNAr primers showed that some members of this consortium survived in the soil after 60 days. The biodegradation of pure biodiesel was higher for bioaugmentation/biostimulation than for natural attenuation, suggesting that the addition of the microbial consortium, together with adjustment of the macronutrient ratio, increased biodiesel degradation. The results of dehydrogenase and respiratory activity, together with GC analysis, suggested that the presence of biodiesel may, by stimulating general microbial degradative metabolism, increase the biodegradation of petroleum diesel. The microbial community was altered by both treatments, with natural attenuation producing a lower diversity index than the amended soil. The bioaugmentation/biostimulation strategy was showed to have a high potential for cleaning up soils contaminated with diesel and biodiesel blends. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Bioaugmentation/biostimulation; Biodiesel; Diesel; Natural attenuation; PCR-DGGE","Natural attenuation; Bio-augmentation; Diesel; PCR-DGGE; Southern Brazil; Biodiesel; alternative energy; bacterium; bioremediation; diesel; electrokinesis; environmental fate; enzyme activity; Oxisol; polymerase chain reaction; soil pollution; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908204862

Among all, epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O) excels for its high-energy storage density and vast availability. However, in practical applications, the slow kinetics and evident structural changes during hydration and dehydration significantly jeopardise the heat storage/recovery rate. A molecular dynamics (MD) study is carried out to investigate the thermal properties and structural changes in the thermal dehydration process of the epsomite. The MD simulation is carried out at 450 K and a vapour pressure of 20 mbar, in accordance with experimental heat storage conditions. The study identifies the dehydration as multiple stages from the initial quick water loss and collapse of the crystal framework to the adsorption of water molecules, which inhibits complete dehydration. Further, the anisotropic diffusion behaviour supports the important role of the porous matrix structure in the heat and mass transfer process. The enthalpy changes, partial densities, mass diffusion coefficients of water and radial distribution functions are calculated and compared with corresponding experimental data to support the conclusions. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"Digital storage; Distribution functions; Heat storage; Hydration; Magnesium compounds; Mass transfer; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Adsorption of water; Anisotropic Diffusion; Heat and mass transfer process; High energy storage densities; Mass diffusion coefficients; Radial distribution functions; Storage condition; Thermal dehydration; Dehydration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907580486

The O457 city bus is considered as the benchmark vehicle. At first, the design process for each hybrid powertrain which is based on the power requirements of the bus in any driving condition is presented. Then, the powertrains modelling using MATLAB/Simulink as a powerful simulating tool is presented. The models are feed-forward and resemble the real world driving conditions. Each model has the blocks for the main components of the corresponding propulsion system. The most important stage in the modeling process is implementing of the components efficiency in each powertrain. Moreover, there is a block in each hybrid powertrain model for the energy management.

Among all the available battery technologies, Redox Flow Battery (RFB) is one of the most feasible options for large-scale energy storage. Different species of vanadium ions in the battery diffuses at different rates across the membrane and this limits the capacity of the battery over long period of operation. In this paper, the concentration change of different species of vanadium ion is modeled with temperature influence for each of these vanadium ion variants. The concentration change of different vanadium ions due to diffusion is simulated for different temperatures. The change in capacity of the battery is calculated for different temperature profiles and the total loss was partially contributed by intrinsic loss and partly due to diffusion. It was also observed that the difference in the loss at different temperatures is higher during the initial 50% of the total lifecycle and stabilizes as it proceeds. At the end of 200 cycles, the capacity loss at 40oC was higher (14.23%) than that of 30oC (13.37%) and 20oC (12.67%) of which a major part was contributed due to diffusion in the first 100 cycles of operation. © 2014 IEEE.","Capacity loss model; Energy storage; Temperature dependence; Vanadium redox flow battery","Diffusion; Energy storage; Ions; Life cycle; Temperature distribution; Vanadium; Battery technology; Capacity loss; Concentration change; Intrinsic loss; Temperature dependence; Temperature influence; Temperature profiles; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931003427

The value of storage is defined as the consumer's net benefit obtained by optimally operating the storage. We formulate the operation problem as a dynamic program. For a general setting with random electricity prices and stochastic demand, we show that by solving a sequence of (deterministic) convex optimization problems one can obtain an optimal operation policy as well as the value of storage. For an important special case where the consumer is faced with deterministic time-variant prices and (deterministic) inelastic demand, we propose a simple greedy algorithm that simultaneously computes the optimal operation policy and the economic value of a finite-capacity electric storage.

The consensus control is achieved by deploying sparse and band-limited communication networks such that neighbouring DICs can communicate each other. Two droop control schemes, including (i) the uniform droop gain ratio scheme and (ii) the non-uniform droop gain ratio scheme, are examined. It will shown that the non-uniform droop gain ratio can indeed simplify the droop gain setting while maintaining more accurate power sharing. Modelling issues related to renewable generators and energy storage systems are also considered. Both DC-link voltage control for DICs with intermittent power input and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) inductor current control for DICs are proposed. In order to capture dynamical behaviours of large deviations, non-linear Transient Energy Functions (TEFs) of the micro-grid are constructed to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system and accurate active/reactive power sharing even under large variations of loads/generations or even line outages. Real-time simulations of a 14-bus/6-converter micro-grid system with wind generations and energy storage systems are performed.

Unfortunately, demand and storage units have operational constraints comprising power, energy and on/off duty-cycles. One solution to overcome these limitations is to split the AGC signal into (a) a component which has low ramp rate requirements but does not ensure energy neutral behavior, and (b) a component with high ramp rate requirements but short duration in any direction. This paper presents two methodologies which are implementable in real-time operation and evaluates the requirements in the AGC signal of the Swiss power system.

The energetics of the H-removal from these clusters is also investigated and the results show that the hydrogen release is substantially less energy demanding for the superhalogen moieties. The energy cost for H-removal decreases from 3.72 eV in Na(AlH4) to 0.49 eV in Na(AlH4)2, and from 4.63 eV in Mg(BH4)2 to 0.37 eV in Mg(BH4)3. For the closed shell clusters, the alanates have superior performance with respect to the release of hydrogen as compared with the boranates. For the superhalogens, the energy cost for H-removal from Na(AlH4)2 is half of that one for the Na(BH4)2 cluster, whereas for the Mg clusters Mg(AlH4)3 and Mg(BH4)3 it is nearly equivalent (0.41 eV and 0.37 eV, respectively). This arises from the formation of an insurgent dimerized unit where the H atoms exhibit considerable loss of bonding charge. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Alanate; Boranate; Density functional theory; Hydrogen storage; Superhalogen","Calculations; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Electronic properties; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium compounds; Sodium compounds; Alanates; Boranate; Closed shells; First-principles calculation; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen release; Superhalogen; Superhalogens; Aluminum compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913555221

This observation has prompted the reclassifications of body mass index thresholds for the definitions of ""overweight"" and ""obese"" in East Asians. However, the question remains over what evolutionary mechanisms have driven the differences in adiposity morphology between two population groups that shared a common ancestor less than 80,000 years ago. The Thrifty Gene hypothesis has been suggested as a possible explanation, where genetic factors that allowed for efficient food-energy conversion and storage are evolutionarily favoured by conferring increased chances of survival and fertility. Here, we leveraged on the existing findings from genome-wide association studies and large-scale surveys of positive natural selection to evaluate whether there is currently any evidence to support the Thrifty Gene hypothesis. We first assess whether the existing genetic associations with obesity and T2D are located in genomic regions that are reported to be under positive selection, and if so, whether the risk alleles sit on the extended haplotype forms. In addition, we interrogate whether these risk alleles are the derived forms that differ from the ancestral alleles, and whether there is significant evidence of population differentiation at these SNPs between East Asian and European populations. Our systematic survey did not yield conclusive evidence to support the Thrifty Gene hypothesis as a possible explanation for the differences observed between East Asians and Europeans.

This raises the question of potential groundwater quality impact. Here, we use laboratory column experiments to develop and calibrate a reactive transport model (PHREEQC) simulating the thermally induced (5-60 °C) water quality changes in anoxic sandy sediments. Temperature-dependent surface complexation, cation-exchange, and kinetic dissolution of K-feldspar were included in the model. Optimization results combined with an extensive literature survey showed surface complexation of (oxy)anions (As, B, and PO4) is consistently exothermic, whereas surface complexation of cations (Ca and Mg) and cationic heavy metals (Cd, Pb, and Zn) is endothermic. The calibrated model was applied to simulate arsenic mobility in an ATES system using a simple yet powerful mirrored axi-symmetrical grid. Results showed that ATES mobilizes arsenic toward the fringe of the warm water bubble and the center of the cold water bubble. This transient redistribution of arsenic causes its aqueous concentrations in the cold and warm groundwater bubbles to become similar through multiple heating cycles, with a final concentration depending on the average injection temperature of the warm and cold ATES wells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"anion; arsenic; boron; cadmium; calcium; carbonic acid; cation; deoxycorticosterone; ground water; hot water; lead; magnesium; phosphate; proton; silicon dioxide; zinc; ground water; heavy metal; water; aquifer; building; calibration; concentration (composition); endothermy; groundwater; heating; heavy metal; ion exchange; numerical model; phosphate; temperature effect; water quality; aquifer; aquifer thermal energy storage; Article; cation exchange; chemical structure; cold; complex formation; dissolution; enthalpy; heating; hydrolysis; leaching; proton transport; sediment; storage; surface property; temperature dependence; water quality; chemistry; heat; microclimate; temperature; theoretical model; water pollution; water quality; water supply; Anions; Arsenic; Cations; Environment, Controlled; Geologic Sediments; Groundwater; Hot Temperature; Metals, Heavy; Models, Theoretical; Temperature; Water; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908140987

By straightforward compression of the composites, compact capacitive storage devices with improved space utilization are obtained without significantly compromising the electrochemical performance of the devices. This indicates that the compression unlike other methods previously used to vary the porosity of these composites does not affect the distribution of the mesopores which mainly determines the electrochemical performance of the material. When used to manufacture green supercapacitors comprising entirely of environmentally friendly materials, the freestanding and binder-free porous yet dense electrodes yield an areal capacitance of 5.66 F cm-2, a device volumetric energy density of 3.7 W h L-1 (based on the volume of the entire device) and the largest volumetric electrode capacitance of 236 F cm-3 so far reported for conducting polymer-based electrodes. The presented results for symmetric supercapacitors containing aqueous electrolytes represent significant progress in the development of inexpensive and environmentally friendly high-performance paper-based energy storage devices.

However, the detailed physical modelling of GEANT4 is highly computationally demanding, especially when tracking particles through voxelized phantoms. To circumvent the relatively slow simulation of voxelized phantoms in GATE, another efficient Monte Carlo code can be used to simulate photon interactions and transport inside a voxelized phantom. The simulation system for emission tomography (SimSET), a dedicated Monte Carlo code for PET/SPECT systems, is well-known for its efficiency in simulation of voxel-based objects. An efficient Monte Carlo workflow integrating GATE and SimSET for simulating pinhole SPECT has been proposed to improve voxelized phantom simulation. Although the workflow achieves a desirable increase in speed, it sacrifices the ability to simulate decaying radioactive sources such as non-pure positron emitters or multiple emission isotopes with complex decay schemes and lacks the modelling of time-dependent processes due to the inherent limitations of the SimSET photon history generator (PHG). Moreover, a large volume of disk storage is needed to store the huge temporal photon history file produced by SimSET that must be transported to GATE. In this work, we developed a multiple photon emission history generator (MPHG) based on SimSET/PHG to support a majority of the medically important positron emitters. We incorporated the new generator codes inside GATE to improve the simulation efficiency of voxelized phantoms in GATE, while eliminating the need for the temporal photon history file. The validation of this new code based on a MicroPET R4 system was conducted for 124I and 18F with mouse-like and rat-like phantoms. Comparison of GATE/MPHG with GATE/GEANT4 indicated there is a slight difference in energy spectra for energy below 50 keV due to the lack of x-ray simulation from 124I decay in the new code. The spatial resolution, scatter fraction and count rate performance are in good agreement between the two codes. For the case studies of 18F-NaF (124I-IAZG) using MOBY phantom with 1 × 1 × 1 mm3voxel sizes, the results show that GATE/MPHG can achieve acceleration factors of approximately 3.1 × (4.5 ×), 6.5 × (10.7 ×) and 9.5 × (31.0 ×) compared with GATE using the regular navigation method, the compressed voxel method and the parameterized tracking technique, respectively. In conclusion, the implementation of MPHG in GATE allows for improved efficiency of voxelized phantom simulations and is suitable for studying clinical and preclinical imaging. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","GATE; Monte Carlo simulation; preclinical PET; simSET","Application programs; Codes (symbols); Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Intelligent systems; Photons; Positron emission tomography; Positrons; Single photon emission computed tomography; Tomography; Count rate performance; GATE; Geant4 application for tomographic emissions; Monte Carlo simulators; simSET; Simulation efficiency; Simulation system for emission tomographies; Time-dependent process; Monte Carlo methods; animal; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; computer program; devices; electron; image quality; mouse; photon; procedures; rat; sensitivity and specificity; Animals; Electrons; Mice; Phantoms, Imaging; Photons; Rats; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907484110

Reliable operation of DC microgrids mainly depends on proper control method to cope with bus voltage variations due to renewable sources intermittency and load changes. The main objectives of the control method are to maintain the operating bus voltage and the power balance. This control method is applied in battery energy storage (BES) component. By charging and discharging power to and from BES the control objectives can be achieved. Sliding mode control (SMC) method is implemented because of its robustness for sudden variations of power sources and loads. SMC is also of fast response in dynamics.

Despite the various potential benefits that energy storage may bring to the grid, DES could significantly affect the aggregate load curve and create a load spike at the time when electricity price is lowest if the percentage of the active capacity of DES in all loads is too high. It is thus of crucial importance to model and analyse the effect that DES brings to the deregulated electricity market. In this paper we consider a deregulated electricity market where RTP is the only signal for load control and varies with load to reflect actual cost. We investigate a method for joint load rescheduling and energy storage operation planning under given price, and analyse the impact of increasing penetration of distributed energy storage on optimal RTP and aggregated load curve. Results show that distributed profit-making energy storage below a certain penetration rate helps to flatten the aggregate load curve under RTP scheme and increase social welfare. If the penetration rate exceeds a threshold, new load peaks could be created suggesting that using RTP alone is insufficient for load control in such cases. © 2014 IEEE.","Demand response; distributed energy storage; real-time pricing; statistical modelling","Aggregates; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric load management; Industrial electronics; Power markets; Demand response; Deregulated electricity market; Distributed energy storages; Electricity prices; Potential benefits; Real time pricing; Statistical modelling; Storage operations; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912092039

The two components can also exert significant interaction on each other during their separate electrochemical reactions. In poly(pyrrol-3-ylhydroquinone), a polypyrrole derivative functionalized with hydroquinone units, the redox conversion of the pendant groups has a large impact on the polymer backbone. This interaction is manifested by a loss of bipolaron states during the hydroquinone oxidation, leading to a decreasing p-doping level with increasing potential, something which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been observed for a conducting polymer. Another effect is a contraction of the polymer film, and subsequent mass loss due to solvent expulsion upon hydroquinone oxidation, which counteracts the normal swelling of polypyrrole with increased potential. The conducting redox polymer under investigation has been synthesized via two routes, leading to different fractions of subunits bearing redox active hydroquinone groups. While the redox potentials are unaffected by the synthesis route, the backbone/pendant group interaction varies notably depending on the degree of quinone functionalization. This type of polymers could find use in, e.g., organic energy storage materials, since the polymer backbone both increases the electronic conductivity and prevents dissolution of the active material, as well as in actuator application, due to polymer contraction over the relatively narrow potential region where the pendant group redox chemistry occurs. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Conducting polymers; Polymer films; Polypyrroles; Redox reactions; Semiconducting films; Semiconductor doping; Electrochemical reactions; Electrochemical surfaces; Electronic conductivity; Energy storage materials; Functionalizations; Hydroquinone oxidation; Intrinsic conductivity; Polypyrrole derivatives; Phenols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949117055

Like other advanced porous materials, COFs can potentially be designed to meet the needs of a variety of applications, from energy, to security, to human health. In this work, we construct in silico a database of hypothetical three-dimensional, crystalline COFs. In constructing this library we generate novel COFs using only established synthetic routes, previously utilized tetrahedral building units, and commercially available bridging ""linker"" molecules. This ensures that there are no known chemical barriers to synthesizing all materials in our database. We relaxed all materials in our database through semiempirical electronic structure calculations. In addition, for those structures that allow interpenetration, we designed interpenetrated versions of the basic structure. Then, we characterized the porosity of each of these structures. The final set of 4147 structures (based on 620 unique noninterpenetrated structures) and their computed properties are publicly available and can be screened to identify promising materials for a wide variety of applications. Here, we assess the suitability of our COFs for vehicular methane storage by performing molecular simulations to predict the equilibrium methane uptake. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Crystalline materials; Database systems; Electronic structure; Methane; Organometallics; Polymers; Porous materials; Chemical barriers; Covalent organic frameworks; Crystallinities; Electronic structure calculations; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Molecular simulations; Organic Chemistry; Synthetic routes; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949115498

This necessitates the requirement of energy storage elements between the input and output to decouple the unbalance of power. The location of the decoupling element can be either at the PV-side or the AC-side. The traditionally used energy storage element is the electrolytic capacitor. Due to its fast degradation, it is often replaced by film capacitors with active decoupling schemes that perform better at higher temperatures with less degradation, however at significantly higher cost. From an economic perspective, both electrolytic and film capacitors have similar lifetimes, which are substantially lower than the typical warranty of the solar module (20-25 years) though. An inductor, in contrast, is an energy storage element with aging of less than 0.5 percentage over a 20-year lifecycle. Further, the reduced temperature drift compared to a capacitor makes it a highly suitable candidate for storage of power ripple in solar photovoltaic power converters. This paper demonstrates a proof-of-concept decoupling scheme using an inductor as the energy storage element at the PV-side of a DC-AC single stage power converter. © 2014 IEEE.","Inductive ripple storage; Lifetime; Micro-inverter; Power decoupling","Electrolytic capacitors; Energy storage; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Economic perspective; Lifetime; Micro inverters; Photovoltaic panels; Power decoupling; Solar photovoltaic power; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaics; Electric inverters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912124840

The objective of this project is to evaluate the benefits and limitations of using storage with a grid-connected PV system. Specifically to evaluate injecting the energy stored in batteries charge by the PV into the electric grid in order to flatten the peak of the load curve of a feeder system (with evening peak-electricity consumption experienced in this area). The PV/storage system is being installed in the football stadium Arena do Jacare, located in Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais. Initial studies have been performed to define the characteristics of the PV array, including surveys of the region characteristics, and solar resource/ climate data. Additionally, the characteristics of the optimum PV generator configuration and module technology have been evaluated, taking into consideration the stadium's limited available area and defined orientation - and the major design criterion to eliminate any shadow projection on photovoltaic modules that could reduce its performance. With the initial design of the PV generator structure and geometry, the system was performance was simuulated under projected conditions. An innovative feature of this project is a bidirectional conversion and connection unit, which has the capacity to store the energy coming from the PV generator and/or the electrical network in a battery bank. The unit can deliver the energy to the grid (a feeder operated by CEMIG in our tests) at specific defined times - such as the peak time in this area between 18:30 and 20:30. At the conclusion of this protype project, a larger scale of the system (photovoltaic system connected to the network with storage) will be installed at GREEN-IPUC/PUCMinas, utilizing the lessons learned and experiences and the equipment developed at the Minas Gerais Arena do Jacare Stadium. © 2014 IEEE.","conversion and connection unit; grid-connected system; photovoltaic systems; PV/storage system","Electric batteries; Materials handling equipment; Photovoltaic cells; Recreation centers; Stadiums; Connection units; Grid connected PV system; Grid connected systems; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Photovoltaic modules; Photovoltaic systems; PV/storage system; Region characteristics; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912082387

Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies that are denser and more energy efficient, this assumption is no longer valid. For example, STT-RAMs are known to have high write latencies and limited write endurance which the virtual memory is unaware of. A popular architecture is a hybrid cache that uses both SRAM and NVM. There are a number of proposals for such architectures at nearly all the levels of the cache. However, these proposals are often self-contained with monitoring and management schemes implemented with special hardware at the level where the cache is deployed.With moves to use NVM at several levels of the memory hierarchy, such solutions may lead to duplication and higher overheads. Worse, because the management algorithms implemented can be different at different levels of memory, it may lead to negative interference between them resulting in impaired efficiency. In this paper, we propose a virtual memory design, EnVM, that takes into consideration the idiosyncrasies of NVM-based hybrid caches. The new virtual memory layout is implicitly used to allocate data to NVM and SRAM at any level of the memory hierarchy and is not dependant on the particular arrangements of the two partitions. The proposed design successfully filters out write operations and allocates them to SRAM.

In this context, active cell balancing techniques improve the lifetime and capacity of battery packs significantly by equalizing charge at runtime. Modern balancing circuits rely on switching schemes to transfer charge between cells via energy storage elements such as inductors or capacitors. Verifying correct functionality of complex architectures can become a non-trivial task where circuit and control have to be considered concurrently. For this purpose, we provide a framework for the verification of balancing architectures, using a methodology that takes advantage of graph search algorithms. While this paper focuses on inductor-based architectures, the proposed Happroach might also be extended to other storage elements such as capacitors or transformers. The experimental results based on several case studies give evidence that a manual verification becomes impractical and our framework is capable of either proving correctness or delivering a counter-example.

Development of hydrogen-related technologies is a top priority for advancing the hydrogen industry. However, hydrogen storage technologies vary based on energy savings and safety, making it difficult for decision makers to select appropriate technologies. Hence, research efforts have focused on selecting suitable hydrogen storage technologies. The purpose of this research is to develop an evaluation model to enable decision makers to select the most appropriate technology for development in Taiwan on the basis of 14 evaluation criteria. The weights of criteria and the ratings of technologies are collected by a seven-point linguistic scale using a Delphi questionnaire survey. The linguistic scores are then converted into fuzzy numbers and the consensus of decision makers' opinions on weights and ratings are derived mathematically using fuzzy Delphi methodology. We used the model to perform an evaluation of four different types of hydrogen storage technologies. The results of the assessment model revealed that chemical hydride technology is the most feasible for investment in Taiwan, and, as such, it should be given top priority for further development to realize industrialization. © 2014 PICMET.",,"Chemical industry; Decision making; Energy conservation; Fuzzy sets; Investments; Linguistics; Scales (weighing instruments); Surveys; Appropriate technologies; Assessment models; Emerging technologies; Evaluation criteria; Evaluation modeling; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Hydrogen storage technologies; Questionnaire surveys; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910123562

However, a commonly accepted understanding or theoretical reproduction of this effect remains challenging. Numerical reproduction of observations, shown herewith, confirms that water skin supersolidity [Zhang et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., DOI: 10.1039/C1034CP02516D] enhances the local thermal diffusivity favoring heat flowing outwardly in the liquid path. Analysis of experimental database reveals that the hydrogen bond (O: H-O) possesses memory to emit energy at a rate depending on its initial storage. Unlike other usual materials that lengthen and soften all bonds when they absorb thermal energy, water performs abnormally under heating to lengthen the O: H nonbond and shorten the H-O covalent bond through inter-oxygen Coulomb coupling [Sun et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2013, 4, 3238]. Cooling does the opposite to release energy, like releasing a coupled pair of bungees, at a rate of history dependence. Being sensitive to the source volume, skin radiation, and the drain temperature, the Mpemba effect proceeds only in the strictly non-adiabatic ' source-path-drain’ cycling system for the heat “emission-conduction-dissipation” dynamics with a relaxation time that drops exponentially with the rise of the initial temperature of the liquid source. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908079398

We demonstrate their potential use in ultralow voltage driving organic field-effect transistors (FETs) characterized by the high performance and great stability. Using the CSDE dielectrics, organic FETs with a pentacene active layer can deliver adequate performance and excellent operational stability at ultralow operating voltage in air. The linear field-effect mobility of pentacene-based FETs can be as high as 1.5 cm2 V-1 s-1 at only 0.1 V.

This phenomenon caused by the formation of TiON interfacial layer can be well explained by using the energy band diagram. The TiON interfacial layer will be a tunneling barrier during the first forming process when a negative voltage applied on the device, while it will breakdown when applying a positive voltage. Besides, due to the double forming process, an asymmetric conductive filament with narrower size at ZrO2/HfO2 interface is formed in the device. The point for formation and rupture of the conductive filament can be confined at the ZrO2/HfO2 interface, and it will suppress the consumption of oxygen ions during endurance test. Therefore, high speed (40 ns) and large endurance (107 cycles) characteristics are achieved in this device structure. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Nonvolatile storage; Zirconium alloys; Conductive filaments; Energy-band diagram; Interfacial layer; Negative voltage; Resistive random access memory; Resistive switching memory; Switching mechanism; Tunneling barrier; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919924849

Aspects of interest are product quality, energy efficiency, stack gas composition, carbon dioxide emissions, and possible benefits related to carbon dioxide capture. The method used is based on multicomponent chemical equilibrium calculations to predict process conditions. A generic model of a rotary kiln for lime production was validated against operational data and literature. This predicting simulation tool is used to calculate chemical compositions for different recirculation cases. The results show that an oxyfuel process could produce a high-quality lime product. The new process would operate at a lower specific energy consumption thus having also a reduced specific carbon dioxide emission per ton of product ratio. Through some processing, the stack gas from the new process could be suitable for carbon dioxide transport and storage or utilization.

It has promising features, including non-volatile storage, byte addressability, fast read and write operations, and supports random accesses. However, there are challenges in designing algorithms for PCM-based memory systems, such as longer write latency and higher energy consumption compared to DRAM. In this paper, we propose a new predictive B+-tree index, called the B p -tree, which is tailored for database systems that make use of PCM. Our Bp-tree reduces data movements caused by tree node splits and merges that arise from insertions and deletions. This is achieved by pre-allocating space on PCM for near future data. To ensure the space are allocated where they are needed, we propose a novel predictive model to ascertain future data distribution based on the current data. In addition, as in [4], when keys are inserted into a leaf node, they are packed but need not be in sorted order. We have implemented the Bp-tree in PostgreSQL and evaluated it in an emulated environment. Our experimental results show that the Bp-tree significantly reduces the number of writes, therefore making it write and energy efficient and suitable for a PCM-like hardware environment. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Bp-tree; non-volatile storage; Phase change memory (PCM); predictive model","Data reduction; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Flash memory; Forestry; Nonvolatile storage; Trees (mathematics); Data distribution; Energy efficient; Hardware environment; Insertions and deletions; Non-volatile; Phase change memory (pcm); Predictive modeling; Write operations; Phase change memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938418792

As the battery's lifetime ends, the pacemaker needs to be replaced. This surgical re-intervention is costly and bears the risk of complications. Thus, a pacemaker without primary batteries is desirable. The goal of this study was to test whether transcutaneous solar light could power a pacemaker. Methods and results: We used a three-step approach to investigate the feasibility of sunlight-powered cardiac pacing. First, the harvestable power was estimated. Theoretically, a subcutaneously implanted 1 cm2 solar module may harvest ∼2500 μW from sunlight (3 mm implantation depth). Secondly, ex vivo measurements were performed with solar cells placed under pig skin flaps exposed to a solar simulator and real sunlight. Ex vivo measurements under real sunlight resulted in a median output power of 4941 μW/cm2 [interquartile range (IQR) 3767-5598 μW/cm2, median skin flap thickness 3.0 mm (IQR 2.7-3.3 mm)]. The outputpower strongly depended on implantation depth (rSpearman = 20.86, P &lt; 0.001). Finally, a batteryless single-chamber pacemaker powered by a 3.24 cm2 solar module was implanted in vivo in a pig to measure output power and to pace. In vivo measurements showed a median output power of &lt;3500 μW/cm2 (skin flap thickness 2.8-3.84 mm). Successful batteryless VVI pacing using a subcutaneously implanted solar module was performed. Conclusion: Based on our results, we estimate that a few minutes of direct sunlight (irradiating an implanted solar module) allow powering a pacemaker for 24 h using a suitable energy storage. Thus, powering a pacemaker by sunlight is feasible and may be an alternative energy supply for tomorrow's pacemakers. Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Several workloads - like social and service monitoring - often include attributes with implicit clustering because of their time-dependent nature. In addition, solid state disks (SSD) (using flash or other low-level technologies) emerge as viable competitors of hard disk drives (HDD). Capacity and access times of storage devices create a trade-off between SSD and HDD. Slow random accesses in HDD have been replaced by efficient random accesses in SSD, but their available capacity is one or more orders of magnitude more expensive than the one of HDD. Indexing, however, is designed assuming HDD as secondary storage, thus minimizing random accesses at the expense of capacity. Indexing data using SSD as secondary storage requires treating capacity as a scarce resource. To this end, we introduce approximate tree indexing, which employs probabilistic data structures (Bloom filters) to trade accuracy for size and produce smaller, yet powerful, tree indexes, which we name Bloom filter trees (BF-Trees). BF-Trees exploit pre-existing data ordering or partitioning to offer competitive search performance. We demonstrate, both by an analytical study and by experimental results, that by using workload knowledge and reducing indexing accuracy up to some extent, we can save substantially on capacity when indexing on ordered or partitioned attributes. In particular, in experiments with a synthetic workload, approximate indexing offers 2.22x-48x smaller index footprint with competitive response times, and in experiments with TPCH and a monitoring real-life dataset from an energy company, it offers 1.6x-4x smaller index footprint with competitive search times as well. © 2014 VLDB Endowment 21508097/14/10.",,"Competition; Data handling; Data structures; Economic and social effects; Hard disk storage; Horizontal drilling; Indexing (of information); Virtual storage; Analytical studies; Available capacity; Orders of magnitude; Probabilistic data; Service monitoring; Solid state disks (SSD); Storage technology; Synthetic workloads; Trees (mathematics)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926658576

Materials and Methods Patients with bladder outlet obstruction proved by urodynamics who underwent PVP with the lithium triborate laser were followed for 6 months with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. Moderate-to-severe storage LUTS were defined as IPSS storage domain score >8 and/or a score for an IPSS question on urgency >3. Predictive values of DO, IPSS domains, urgency, prostate volume, bladder outlet obstruction grade, and energy used were tested by logistic regression analysis. Results Seventy-six men at the age of 66.4 ± 6.8 years underwent PVP, including 36 (47.4%) with DO. Incidence of moderate or severe storage LUTS was decreasing from 60.5% to 48.7% at week 6 and 11.8% at month 6 postoperatively. At a univariate analysis, urgency score and storage domain score were significantly associated with bothersome storage LUTS at month 6. Multivariate analysis confirmed predictive value of preoperative urgency having an odds ratio of 5.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-23.16; P =.014). DO was not associated with the defined outcome. Conclusion In our group, DO was not useful in predicting persistent storage symptoms after PVP. Patients with severe preoperative urgency should be informed about a risk of such outcome. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The core of the project is an underground pumped-storage power plant that is under construction. This will pump water from Lake Limmern at 1,800 m ASL to the higher Lake Mutt at 2,500 m ASL from where, utilising a maximum head of 709 m, it will again be used for the generation of electricity as required. The new power plant will have a pump and turbine output of 1,000 MW; the construction period is scheduled to extend over six years. Such a complex construction project at a high-altitude setting involving huge volume flows (i.e. around half a million cubic metres of solid excavated material) can only be completed successfully with the sparing use of resources. This involves, in particular, the on-site processing of excavated limestone into aggregates for concrete. Amongst other equipment, two powerful gravel processing plants, one using wet processing (at 1,874 m ASL) and the other dry processing (at 2,436 m ASL) were erected on site; these plants process the excavated material as needed for on-site concrete production. This allowed a closed materials cycle to be established, in turn allowing the site to operate self-sufficiently. The challenges associated with using excavated tunnel material as a resource are tremendous.

Lightweight polyimide film hinges were previously integrated into a compliant flapping-wing mechanism to reduce friction. However, these were not stiff enough to fully recover wing's inertial energy into elastic energy. To store adequate elastic energy using film hinges, we develop a compliant thoracic mechanism with nonlinear stiffness characteristics by mimicking a Dipteran insect's flight thorax. This thoracic mechanism consists of rigid plates and polyimide film hinges connected to form a closed shell structure. It has a nonlinearly increasing stiffness so that it can slow the wings down rapidly toward the end stroke and subsequently help reverse the wings. It demonstrates almost full recovery of inertial power for 10-cm span flapping wings up to 25 Hz. As a result, it only expends 2% of the total mechanical power on inertial power at 25 Hz. In contrast, the rigid-body mechanism with no elastic storage expends 23% of the total mechanical power on inertial power when the same wings beat at the same frequency. With the capability of elastic energy storage, this compliant thoracic mechanism saves power expenditure ranging from 20 up to 30% to produce the same thrust, in comparison with the rigid-body flapping mechanism. This study shows that power saving is effective only if elastic energy storage is well tuned to recover the wing inertial power. © 2014 IEEE.","Bio-inspiration; compliant mechanism; flapping wing; micro aerial vehicles","Automobile bodies; Elasticity; Energy storage; Hinges; Light weight vehicles; Mechanisms; Micro air vehicle (MAV); Polyimides; Recovery; Rigid structures; Rigid wings; Stiffness; Wings; Bio-inspiration; Elastic energy storage; Flapping wing; Flapping wing flight; Flapping wing micro air vehicle; Flapping-wing mechanism; Micro aerial vehicle; Non-linear stiffness; Compliant mechanisms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907812506

We investigated whether the relationship between melanocortin system activity and energy expenditure (EE) is mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity. Therefore, female APOE∗3-Leiden.CETP transgenic mice were fed a Western-type diet for 4 weeks and infused intracerebroventricularly with the melanocortin 3/4 receptor (MC3/4R) antagonist SHU9119 or vehicle for 2 weeks. SHU9119 increased food intake (+30%) and body fat (+50%) and decreased EE by reduction in fat oxidation (-42%). In addition, SHU9119 impaired the uptake of VLDL-TG by BAT. In line with this, SHU9119 decreased uncoupling protein-1 levels in BAT (-60%) and induced large intracellular lipid droplets, indicative of severely disturbed BAT activity. Finally, SHU9119-treated mice pair-fed to the vehicletreated group still exhibited these effects, indicating that MC4R inhibition impairs BAT activity independent of food intake. These effects were not specific to the APOE∗3-Leiden.CETP background as SHU9119 also inhibited BAT activity in wild-type mice. We conclude that inhibition of central MC3/4R signaling impairs BAT function, which is accompanied by reduced EE, thereby promoting adiposity. We anticipate that activation of MC4R is a promising strategy to combat obesity by increasing BAT activity.

At the same time, environmental concerns have led to increasingly stricter emission standards. In this context, transit authorities have become strongly focused on making their bus fleets more efficient and cleaner, by incorporating new alternative fuels and clean propulsion technologies. This has led to increased interest in electric driven technologies, with their intrinsic efficient, quiet and environment friendly features. Trolleybuses, a well proven mature electric technology already adopted in some cities, although efficient and clean, are burdened by high infrastructure costs and operational inflexibility. Hydrogen fuel cell buses, an infant technology, currently on a precommercial status, still presents some hurdles on hardware durability and hydrogen supply, which need to be surpassed before reach commercial status. At the same time, there has been significant technical progress into development of the electromobility concept for transit bus systems, through the use of pure electric drivetrains supported by the improvement of range, durability, charging procedures and cost of energy storage systems - ESS (batteries or/and supercapacitors), considered the core components of the so called pure electric buses. In this scenario, pure electric driven bus technology has aroused interest of transit industry, as a strategy for improving efficiency and environmental performance of transit bus fleets. Although not yet commercially competitive with diesel buses, there has been significant technical progress in development of pure electric buses, notably with improvements observed in the so called Lithium Ion battery (with their variants), supercapacitors technology and charging procedures, both under a technical and cost perspective. This work is supposed to present an overview of pure electric traction bus technology, with a focus on technical, operational, environmental and economical features, highlighting the pathways to be followed to reach commercial feasibility in order to comply with stricter environmental targets already scheduled and consolidate the electromobilty concept for transit bus industry. Moreover, it will be presented an overview of the main ongoing electromobility bus experiences in some important cities around the world.

The storage system is part of the Wireless Sensor Energy Harvesting to store and amplify the energy harvested from the surroundings. The proposed method must be consumes very little power and suitable for ambient environmental sources such as vibration, wind and RF energy and be able to boost up the energy for storage system. The output of the harvested voltage is insufficient for most applications, therefore the system will boost up the input voltage level using DC to DC converter topology to higher dc voltage. The DC to DC converter shall be designed to suit the types of storage required. The output voltage of this DC converter should be sufficient to charge either capacitor or supercapacitor that will be use in this system as the energy storage system. The supercapacitor will provide power to energize any system such as in this case wireless sensor network [1]. In the case of wireless sensor network for example, the node would require the energy during transmitting and receiving data only whereas during standby mode or sleep mode, the amount of energy required would be very small [2]. Therefore the storage system will make use of this standby time or sleep mode of the sensor node to store as much energy as possible.

In this paper, a sensitivity analysis is accomplished on a double-effect absorption chiller with 100 t of cooling capacity to study the effect of different parameters on auxiliary energy. The input parameters taken into account in the sensitivity analysis are the volume of storage tank, area of evacuated tube collector, and mass flow rates of water passing through the collector and generator. It is also supposed that the evacuated tube collector is mounted at the monthly optimum angle to get as much solar radiation as possible. Two objective functions are considered for the genetic algorithm namely the auxiliary energy and the net profit obtained from the solar system. An economical analysis is required to calculate the optimum area of collector. The computer code is developed to minimize the auxiliary energy, and maximize the profit. Since the auxiliary energy costs money, it is advantageous to use the same system with minimum auxiliary energy. However, the results show that the optimum mass flow rates of hot water passing through the generator and collector have an important role on reducing the auxiliary energy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Symmetric two-electrode capacitor cells assembled using micropore-rich activated mesophase pitch (aMP) and activated carbon fiber (aCF) carbons show a standard capacitive behavior in cyclic voltammetry analysis, whereas cells featuring templated mesoporous carbon (tMC) show ion-intercalating peaks in high-voltage scans. Impedance analysis performed at high voltages reveals that the aMP and aCF cells show lower charge-storage resistance than the tMC, although tMC facilitates ion transport more efficiently than aMP and aCF. The experimental results indicate that micropore-rich aMP and aCF accommodate single ions at high voltages, whereas the carbon structure is destroyed in micropore-deficient tMC because of graphitic-layer intercalation. The aMP carbon, which contains hierarchically connected micropores and mesopores, is effective in storing charge at a high rate at high voltages. Because of the compact feature of aMP, incorporating ionic liquids with aMP represents a very promising strategy for assembling capacitors of ultrahigh volumetric energy densities. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,"Cyclic voltammetry; Electrolytic capacitors; Intercalation; Ionic liquids; Microporosity; Capacitive behavior; Carbon structures; Electric double layer capacitor; Impedance analysis; Incorporating ionic liquids; Mesoporous carbon; Volumetric energy; Volumetric energy densities; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906280617

The key step in the synthesis of the materials is the preparation of different nitrogen-functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silicas with tunable density of organoamine groups using a simple solvent-assisted post-grafting method, and the use of the resulting materials both as hard templates as well as N-doping agents for the carbon materials forming inside the pores of SBA-15 via nanocasting. Accordingly, the carbonization of common carbon sources within the organoamine-functionalized SBA-15 produces mesostructured carbons containing different densities of nitrogen dopant atoms. Specifically, a polar protic solvent (ethanol) and a non-polar solvent (toluene) are used for grafting the organoamine groups, ultimately producing two different nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons, labelled here as N-MC-E and N-MC-T, respectively. These materials possess not only different amounts of nitrogen dopant atoms (0.6 and 2.4 atomic%, respectively) but also distinct electrochemical and charge storage properties. Nitrogen sorption measurements indicate that both materials have mesoporous structures with a high surface area (typically, ∼800 m2 g-1) and nanometer pores with an average pore size of ∼5 nm. Electrochemical measurements at 0.5 A g -1 reveal that the N-MC-E and N-MC-T exhibit high capacitance (152.4 F g-1 and 190.2 F g-1, respectively). These values are either better or comparable to some of the highest capacitance values recently reported for related materials synthesized via other methods. In addition, N-MC-E and N-MC-T retain up to 98% of their stored charges or initial capacitance after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 2.0 A g-1. These results clearly show N-MCs' good electrochemical stability as well as potential application in energy storage. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,"Atoms; Capacitance; Carbon; Carbonization; Doping (additives); Nitrogen; Organic solvents; Solvents; Charge storage capacity; Charge-discharge cycle; Different densities; Electrochemical measurements; Electrochemical stabilities; Mesoporous structures; Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Mesoporous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906232018

Reversible, non-catalytic gas-solid reactions are used to convert thermal into chemical energy during endothermic charging and vice versa during exothermic discharging. To assist the experimental investigation of such reactors, a numerical model of the heat and mass transfer in a packed-bed tubular reactor has been developed. The fluid serves as both heat-transfer medium and gas-reactant supplier and is modeled as a homogeneous phase using unsteady one-dimensional mass and energy conservation equations. Solid reactants are modeled as porous spherical granules. The unsteady energy and mass conservation equations are solved in the granules. This allows for the accurate treatment of larger granules with a diameter in the range of mm to cm in which radial gradients may occur. The temperature profile within a granule is calculated from an energy balance, whereas mass balances track the local concentration of the gases within the pores, affected by diffusion and a mass source/sink due to the gas-solid reaction. The fluid and granule phases are coupled through local mass and energy exchange terms including interphase resistances. Our approach allows for temporal changes of internal porosity and granule volume as a function of solid conversion, the incorporation of a particle size distribution, variable fluid properties and velocity, as well as accounting for the pressure drop in the bed. The numerical implementation of the model is tested through a code-verification study and a general assessment of mass and energy conservation within the coupled fluid and granule phases. The model is validated through comparison with experimental data from the literature for a non-reactive and a reactive packed bed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Mathematical modeling; Packed bed; Reaction engineering; Solar energy","Diffusion in liquids; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Packed beds; Particle size analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Experimental investigations; Mass and energy conservation; Mass conservation equations; Non-catalytic gas-solid reactions; Packed-bed tubular reactors; Reaction engineering; Thermochemical energy storage; Variable fluid properties; Granulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907350001

Among the difficulties to be faced is the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which requires a suitable choice of catalysts and electrolytic solution. This can only be achieved if the kinetics and mechanism of this reaction are known in detail. In this study, we determined the rate constants for each elementary step of ORR for a platinum electrode in 0.1 mol·L-1LiClO4/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), using a kinetic model in the frequency domain. We found that the energy storage capacity of lithium-air batteries can be increased by converting a large amount of lithium superoxide into lithium peroxide during the electrochemical step in comparison with chemical disproportionation. The mechanisms for ORR were supported by data from an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM): ORR could be distinguished from parasitic reactions induced by solvent degradation, and agglomerates of LixO2(1 ≤ x ≤ 2) were adsorbed on the electrode. The rate-limiting step for ORR was the electron transfer to the oxygen molecules strongly adsorbed onto platinum sites, particularly as a large amount of reaction product (Li2O2) adsorbed onto the electrode. Even though Pt sheets are likely to be impracticable for real applications due to their low surface area, they were useful in making it possible to determine the kinetics of ORR steps. This can now be employed to devise more involved electrodes, such as those containing dispersed Pt nanoparticles. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electrolytic reduction; Frequency domain analysis; Kinetics; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Oxygen; Platinum; Quartz; Quartz crystal microbalances; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Solvents; Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance; Electrolytic solution; Energy storage capacity; Kinetics and mechanism; Lithium-oxygen batteries; Non-aqueous solvents; Oxygen reduction reaction; Rate-limiting steps; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949116507

The latter issue can be overcome by producing convenience foods; the first may be alleviated by employing a genotype with higher meatiness. To quantitatively compare two common layer genotypes in production performance, meat yield and sausage quality, 2200 57 weeks old Institut de Sélection Animale (ISA) Warren and Dekalb White hens each were investigated during the last 60 days of egg laying. The hens were housed in an aviary system in 2×10 compartments (10 compartments/each genotype). Measurements included feed intake, laying performance, egg weight and feed conversion ratio as measured per compartment. BW was determined twice on 10 animals per compartment. Finally, two sub-groups of five hens per compartment were slaughtered, meat yield was recorded and bratwurst-type sausages were produced (n=20 per genotype). Fat proportion, cooking loss, connective tissue properties and Kramer shear energy were measured. After 1, 4, 7 and 10 months of frozen storage, oxidative stability (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)) and microbiological status were determined as shelf-life related criteria. ANOVA was performed considering genotype as the main effect. The ISA Warren hens were inferior in laying performance (-11%) and feed conversion ratio (+10%) compared with Dekalb White, but had the same feed intake. The ISA Warren had higher BW and carcass weight than the Dekalb White. Carcass yield was higher by 5.9%. There were 80 g (23%) more meat available for sausage production from ISA Warren compared with Dekalb White. Sausages prepared from meat of ISA Warren hens contained less fat than those from Dekalb White, but showed the same cooking loss. Although the collagen proportion of the sausages produced from ISA Warren was lower than from Dekalb White, collagen solubility was lower and shear energy was higher. During the 10 months of frozen storage, TBARS increased continuously, but not to an extent that would prevent its use as food. The sausages from the ISA Warren genotype had marginally higher TBARS levels during storage. Total colony counts decreased with storage time, with slightly lower values found in the non-spiced sausage material from the ISA Warren hens. In conclusion, when intending to use spent hens as food, ISA Warren are clearly superior to Dekalb White in meat and sausage yield. When processing the meat to sausages, the higher shear energy is probably advantageous. © 2014 The Animal Consortium.","genotype; Laying hen; lipid oxidation; meat; sausage","thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; animal; body weight; chicken; egg laying; female; food handling; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; meat; physiology; standards; Animals; Body Weight; Chickens; Female; Food Handling; Genotype; Meat; Oviposition; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921611727

Two functionally different fat pads are present in mammals: white adipose tissue, the primary site of triglyceride storage, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is specialized in heat production. In this context, new strategies capable of modulating the development and function of white and BAT become relevant. In the present study, we analyzed the influence of resveratrol (sirtuin activator) on energy balance and the expression of thermogenesis markers.Methods: Mice were divided into two groups: standard diet (ST) and standard diet plus resveratrol (ST + RSV).Results: After 2 months of treatment, ST + RSV mice presented significantly decreased fat accumulation in adipose tissue, with diminished total cholesterol and glucose plasma levels. Additionally, increased oxygen consumption was observed in ST + RSV group. Analyses of mRNA of thermogenesis-related genes showed significant increase in UCP1, SIRT1, PTEN and BMP-7 expression in BAT.Conclusion: Our data suggest that improved metabolism produced by oral administration of resveratrol is, at least in part, associated with increased thermogenesis followed by high expression of UCP1 and SIRT1, which can mediate higher energy expenditure and decreased fat accumulation in adipose tissue. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adipose tissue; PTEN; SIRT1; Thermogenesis; UCP1","adiponectin; cholesterol; glucose; high density lipoprotein; osteogenic protein 1; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; resveratrol; sirtuin 1; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 3; bmp7 protein, mouse; ion channel; mitochondrial protein; mitochondrial uncoupling protein; osteogenic protein 1; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; Pten protein, mouse; resveratrol; Sirt1 protein, mouse; sirtuin 1; stilbene derivative; animal experiment; Article; brown adipose tissue; brown adipose tissue thermogenesis; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diet; energy balance; energy expenditure; food intake; gene expression; glucose blood level; lipid storage; locomotion; male; mouse; muscle mass; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; skeletal muscle; thermogenesis; animal; brown adipose tissue; diet; drug effects; energy metabolism; genetics; metabolism; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue; Mammalia; Mus; Rice stripe virus; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Ion Channels; Male; Mice; Mitochondrial Proteins; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Sirtuin 1; Stilbenes; Thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914678932

The temperature-programmed desorption results showed that the addition of 10 wt% K2TiF6 to the MgH2 exhibited a lower onset desorption temperature of 245 °C, which was a decrease of about 105 °C and 205 °C compared with the as-milled and as-received MgH2, respectively. The dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation kinetics of 10 wt% K2TiF6-doped MgH2 were also significantly improved compared to the un-doped MgH2. The results of the Arrhenius plot showed that the activation energy for the hydrogen desorption of MgH2 was reduced from 164 kJ/mol to 132 kJ/mol after the addition of 10 wt% K2TiF6. Meanwhile, the X-ray diffraction analysis showed the formation of a new phase of potassium hydride and titanium hydride together with magnesium fluoride and titanium in the doped MgH2 after the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation process. It is reasonable to conclude that the K2TiF6 additive doped with MgH2 played a catalytic role through the formation of active species of KH, TiH2, MgF2 and Ti during the ball milling or heating process. It is therefore proposed that this newly developed product works as a real catalyst for improving the hydrogen sorption properties of MgH2. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Unlike conventional approaches using ionic precursors in which morphological control is realized by structure-directing molecules, the β-Co(OH)2flower-like superstructures were first grown by a nanoparticle-mediated crystallization process, which results in large 3D superstructure consisting of ultrathin nanosheets interspaced by polydimethoxyaniline (PDMA). Thereafter, β-Co(OH)2nanoflowers were chemically exfoliated by surface-active GO under hydrothermal conditions into unilamellar single-crystal nanosheets. In this reaction, GO acts as a two-dimensional (2D) amphiphile to facilitate the exfoliation process through tailored interactions between organic and inorganic molecules. Meanwhile, the on-site conjugation of GO and Co(OH)2promotes the thermodynamic stability of freestanding ultrathin nanosheets and restrains further growth through Oswald ripening. The unique 2D structure combined with functionalities of the hybrid ultrathin Co(OH)2nanosheets on rGO resulted in a remarkably enhanced lithium-ion storage performance as anode materials, maintaining a reversible capacity of 860 mA h g−1for as many as 30 cycles. Since mesocrystals are ubiquitous and rich in morphological diversity, the strategy of the GO-assisted exfoliation of mesocrystals developed here provides an opportunity for the synthesis of new functional nanostructures that could bear importance in clean renewable energy, catalysis, photoelectronics, and photonics. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, directly uploading all GTPs wastes battery energy and network bandwidth on the mobile device, because GTPs are highly redundant. To reduce the redundancies, we propose in this paper the Corner Extraction Technique (CET) to extract the corner points from the GTPs of individual users that can be used to characterize and reconstruct the routes that the user has traveled. Storing corner GTPs requires much less storage space, and transmitting them allows saving in both network bandwidth and energy consumption, leading to optimized GPS-enabled mobile applications. We have conducted both trace-driven simulations and real experiments to demonstrate the merits of the proposed CET approach.

Graphical targeting procedures based on the Time Slices (TSLs) have been proposed in previous works to handle the energy supply/demand variability in TSHI. The targeting procedures for TSHI with TSLs include the construction of Composite Curves, Grand Composite Curve and Total Site Profile for each time interval. Heat Integration analysis utilising a numerical algorithm typically offers higher precision and more rapid calculations as compared to the graphical approach. This paper introduces an algorithm to efficiently perform utility targeting for a large-scale TSHI system involving renewable energy and variable energy supply/demand to include TSL. The presented tool is an extension of the Total Site Problem Table Algorithm (TS-PTA), which has been previously used for processes with steady energy supply/demand. Due to its algorithmic nature, the technique presented enables the accurate and rapid determination of the stream origins, and can be embedded into larger algorithms. Optimised heat storage facilities are used to manage the variable energy supply and demand. The Total Site Heat Storage Cascade (TS-HSC) is the core of the algorithm. The new developed tool is incorporated with the heat losses for the thermo-chemical energy storage systems. The process start-up and continuous operations are considered in the novel methodology.

The electrode degradation is evaluated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), measured separately on electrodes harvested from the cells, and by using a physics-based impedance model for aging evaluation. Additional capacity measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are used in the evaluation. At 55 °C the LiFePO4 electrode shows increased particle/electronic conductor resistance, for both stored and cycled electrodes. This differs from results obtained at 22 °C, where the electrode suffered lowered porosity, particle fracture, and loss of active material. For graphite, only cycling gave a sustained effect on electrode performance at 55 °C due to lowered porosity and changes of surface properties, and to greater extent than at low temperature. Furthermore, increased current collector resistance also contributes to a large part of the pouch cell impedance when aged at increased temperatures. The result shows that increased temperature promotes different degradation on the electrode level, and is an important implication for high temperature accelerated aging. In light of the electrode observations, the correlation between full-cell and electrode impedances is discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","battery aging; EIS modeling; electrode impedance; temperature","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Graphite; Lithium alloys; Porosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; X ray spectroscopy; Battery aging; Electrode degradation; Electrode impedance; Electrode performance; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Impedance spectroscopy; Increased temperature; LiFePO; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905868311

With some assumptions, a newly discovered electroabsorption signature enables quantification of the electric field strength experienced by surface-anchored dye molecules. Here, it was found that the fields increased in the order Na+ &lt; Li+ &lt; Mg2+ &lt; Ca2+, with magnitudes of 1.1 MV/cm for Na+ and 2.2 MV/cm for Ca2+, values that were insensitive to whether the anion was iodide or perchlorate. The magnitude of the field was directly related to average TiO2(e-) + I3- → charge recombination rate constants abstracted from time-resolved kinetic data. Extrapolation to zero field provided an estimate of recombination dynamics when diffusion alone controlled I3- mass transport, k = 300 s-1. The decreased rate constants measured after excited-state injection were attributed to migration of I3- away from the TiO2. Cation transference coefficients were tabulated that ranged from t = 0.97 for Ca2+ to 0.40 for Na+ and represented the ability of the unscreened electric field to block the TiO2(e-) + I3- → charge recombination reaction. This data provides the first compelling evidence that the anionic nature of I3- inhibits unwanted charge recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","Energy and charge transport; Energy conversion and storage","Calcium; Digital storage; Dyes; Electric fields; Electrolytes; Energy conversion; Excited states; Inorganic compounds; Positive ions; Rate constants; Solar cells; Titanium dioxide; Charge recombination reactions; Charge recombinations; Electric field strength; Electro-absorption; Energy and charge transports; Energy conversion and storages; Recombination dynamics; Time-resolved kinetics; Dye-sensitized solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990220151

Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups: normal group (n=6), fed standard diet (control), and experimental group (n=18), fed a HFD. After 4-week induction, followed by 6-week WBV of 5 days per week, the 18 obese mice were divided into 3 groups (n=6 per group): HFD with sedentary control (HFD), HFD with WBV at relatively low-intensity (5.6 Hz, 0.13 g) (HFD+VL) or high-intensity (13 Hz, 0.68 g) (HFD+VH). A trend analysis revealed that WBV increased the grip strength in mice. WBV also dose-dependently decreased serum lactate, ammonia and CK levels and increased glucose level after the swimming test. WBV slightly decreased final body weight and dose-dependently decreased weights of epididymal, retroperitoneal and perirenal fat pads and fasting serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, CK, glucose, total cholesterol and triacylglycerol. Therefore, WBV could improve exercise performance and fatigue and prevent fat accumulation and obesity-associated biochemical alterations in obese mice.

The treatment system consisted of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor followed by UV disinfection and six HRPs covered with shading screens that blocked 9%, 18%, 30%, 60% and 80% of the solar radiation. The total lipid content does not vary significantly among the units, showing a medium value of 9.5%. The results show that blocking over 30% of the solar radiation has a negative effect on the lipid productivity. The units with no shading and with 30% and 60% of solar radiation blocking have statistically significant lipid productivities, varying from 0.92 to 0.96 g m-2 day-1. Besides radiation, other variables such as volatile suspended solids and chlorophyll-a are able to explain the lipid accumulation. The lipid profile has a predominance of C16, C18:1 and C18:3 acids. The unsaturation of fatty acids increases with the reduction in solar radiation. On the other hand, the effect of polyunsaturation is not observed, which is probably due to the presence of a complex and diverse biomass. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Lipids","Biomass; Lakes; Lipids; Productivity; Sewage; Sun; Lipid accumulations; Lipid characterizations; Lipid productivities; Solar radiation intensity; Treatment systems; Tropical conditions; Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors; Volatile suspended solids; Solar radiation; fatty acid; lipid; bacterium; biological production; biomass; bioreactor; cultivation; disinfection; domestic waste; fatty acid; light availability; lipid; microalga; solar radiation; article; biomass; fatty acid desaturation; lipid storage; microalga; pH; phytoplankton; reduction; sewage treatment; solar radiation; upflow reactor; algae; Bacteria; Biofuels; Biomass; Bioreactors; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Microalgae; Oxygen; Phytoplankton; Sewage; Solar Energy; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901485121

Different strategies have been applied for improving hydrogen storage, i.e. metal doping, boron substitution and functionalization. The metal atoms used for enhancing hydrogen adsorption include Li, Ca and Sc. It is found that the binding energy between these metal atoms and MOF is not enough to prevent clustering. Therefore a number of carbon atoms are substituted by boron atoms and it is indicated that boron substitution enhances the binding energies, significantly. Also the results reveal that boron substituted MOF doped by Sc atom has the maximum capacity of hydrogen storage compared to other dopants, with binding energies all in the favorable range of 0.2-0.4 eV. On the other hand the effect of functionalization of MOF with halogen atoms is investigated. One and four hydrogen atoms of benzene ring in MOF are replaced by F, Cl and Br atoms. It is found that only MOF functionalized with four Cl and Br atoms improve the hydrogen binding energy.

The requirements on wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove nitrogen and phosphorus are increasing and to meet these requirements, more energy and chemicals are needed by WWTPs. Separating the nutrient-rich wastewater fractions at source and recycling them to agriculture as fertiliser is an alternative to removing them at the WWTP. This study used life cycle assessment methodology to compare the environmental impact of different scenarios for recycling the nutrients in the human excreta as fertiliser to arable land or removing them in an advanced WWTP. Three scenarios were assessed. In blackwater scenario, blackwater was source-separated and used as fertiliser. In urine scenario, the urine fraction was source-separated and used as fertiliser and the faecal water treated in an advanced WWTP. In NP scenario, chemical fertiliser was used as fertiliser and the toilet water treated in an advanced WWTP. The emissions from the WWTP were the same for all scenarios. This was fulfilled by the enhanced reduction in the WWTP fully removing the nutrients from the excreta that were not source-separated in the NP and urine scenarios. Recycling source-separated wastewater fractions as fertilisers in agriculture proved efficient for conserving energy and decreasing global warming potential (GWP). However, the blackwater and urine scenarios had a higher impact on potential eutrophication and potential acidification than the WWTP-chemical fertiliser scenario, due to large impacts by the ammonia emitted from storage and after spreading of the fertilisers. The cadmium input to the arable soil was very small with urine fertiliser. Source separation and recycling of excreta fractions as fertiliser thus has potential for saving energy and decreasing GWP emissions associated with wastewater management. However, for improved sustainability, the emissions from storage and after spreading of these fertilisers must decrease. © 2014.","Blackwater; Cadmium; Fertilisers; Life cycle assessment; Urine; Wastewater treatment","Agriculture; Body fluids; Cadmium; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Global warming; Life cycle; Nutrients; Recycling; Separation; Source separation; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Agriculture; Body fluids; Cadmium; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Global warming; Life cycle; Nutrients; Source separation; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Blackwater; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Nitrogen and phosphorus; Potential sources; Urine; Wastewater management; Wastewater treatment plants; Fertilizers; Water recycling; blackwater; cadmium; fertilizer; toilet water; unclassified drug; water; sewage; waste water; ammonia; fertilizer; cadmium; emission; environmental impact; fertilizer; life cycle analysis; nutrient cycling; recycling; urine; waste treatment; wastewater; water treatment; acidification; agriculture; eutrophication; nutrient; sustainability; acidification; arable land; article; controlled study; energy conservation; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; eutrophication; feces; greenhouse effect; human; life cycle assessment; priority journal; soil property; urine; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; agriculture; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; procedures; sewage; waste water; agriculture; Article; environmental impact; pollution transport; recycling; waste water management; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902526135

Then, the hydrogen sorption is modeled by applying Perturbed Hard Sphere Chain Equation of State (PHSC EoS). PHSC equation of state has three molecular-based parameters, namely, the number of segments per molecule, the hard-sphere diameter and the non-bonded interaction energy, respectively. The amount of hydrogen uptake in the adsorbents is obtained through gas-adsorbents phase equilibrium calculations at temperature 77 K and various pressures up to 80 × 105 Pa.

We report a new strategy that is illustrated for the formation of magnesium boron hydrides, relevant compounds for instance for reversible solid state hydrogen storage. We started with small (5-10 nm) MgH2 nanoparticles inside the ∼10 nm pores of a carbon scaffold, and larger MgH2 crystallites on the exterior surface of the scaffold. The large difference in reactivity between the two types of MgH2 is used to selective react the small MgH2 particles inside the pores with B2H6 to form magnesium boron hydrides under mild conditions. In this way pore-confined magnesium boron hydrides are formed with MgB12H12 as the major phase. Hydrogen release from the confined magnesium boron hydrides starts just above the synthesis temperature of 120 °C. The addition of Ni brings about the reaction to proceed readily at temperatures as low as 30 °C. Furthermore, by Ni addition and tuning the synthesis temperature, the product distribution can be steered toward Mg(BH4)2 and other magnesium boron hydrides. This shows the suitability of our method to selectively form pore-confined complex metal hydrides, such as MgB12H12 for which no synthesis strategy had been reported until now. This strategy might also be relevant for other novel energy storage and conversion materials, which are difficult to nanostructure in a controlled manner by conventional methods. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Boron; Chemical elements; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium; Nanoparticles; Nickel; Scaffolds; Storage (materials); Complex metal hydrides; Confined synthesis; Conventional methods; Energy storage and conversions; Product distributions; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Synthesis strategy; Synthesis temperatures; Synthesis (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949115901

We thus predicted a new class of two-dimensional materials by performing structure relaxation, cohesive/formation energy and full phonon dispersion calculations. These materials exhibit strong ionic bonding character, as revealed by significant charge transfers. The superior charge donating/accepting abilities and the large specific area make these new materials promising for adsorption and catalytic reactions. We demonstrated adsorption and diffusion of Li on these materials, which are relevant for Li ion battery electrodes and hydrogen storage.

Metal sulfides with unique physical and chemical properties, as well as high specific capacity/capacitance, which are typically multiple times higher than that of the carbon/graphite-based materials, are currently studied as promising electrode materials. However, the implementation of these sulfide electrodes in practical applications is hindered by their inferior rate performance and cycling stability. Nanostructures offering the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratios, favourable transport properties, and high freedom for the volume change upon ion insertion/extraction and other reactions, present an opportunity to build next-generation LIBs and SCs. Thus, the development of novel concepts in material research to achieve new nanostructures paves the way for improved electrochemical performance.

The LEAP model results indicate that if Argentina fully implements the most feasible mitigation measures currently under consideration by official bodies and key academic institutions on energy supply and demand, such as the ProBiomass program, a cumulative incremental economic cost of 22.8 billion US$(2005) to 2050 is expected, resulting in a 16% reduction in GHG emissions compared to a business-as-usual scenario. These measures also bring economic co-benefits, such as a reduction of energy imports improving the balance of trade. A Low CO2 price scenario in LEAP results in the replacement of coal by nuclear and wind energy in electricity expansion. A High CO2 price leverages additional investments in hydropower. By way of cross-model comparison with the TIAM-ECN and GCAM global integrated assessment models, significant variation in projected emissions reductions in the carbon price scenarios was observed, which illustrates the inherent uncertainties associated with such long-term projections. These models predict approximately 37% and 94% reductions under the High CO2 price scenario, respectively. By comparison, the LEAP model, using an approach based on the assessment of a limited set of mitigation options, predicts an 11.3% reduction. The main reasons for this difference include varying assumptions about technology cost and availability, CO2 storage capacity, and the ability to import bioenergy. An emission cap scenario (2050 emissions 20% lower than 2010 emissions) is feasible by including such measures as CCS and Bio CCS, but at a significant cost. In terms of technology pathways, the models agree that fossil fuels, in particular natural gas, will remain an important part of the electricity mix in the core baseline scenario. According to the models there is agreement that the introduction of a carbon price will lead to a decline in absolute and relative shares of aggregate fossil fuel generation. However, predictions vary as to the extent to which coal, nuclear and renewable energy play a role. © 2016 The Authors, Battelle Memorial Institute","Argentina; CO2 control policies; Energy sector; Mitigation measures","Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Costs; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Wind power; Academic institutions; Argentina; Control policy; Emission constraints; Energy sector; Global integrated assessments; Mitigation measures; Primary energy consumption; Investments; bioenergy; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; pollution policy; Argentina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928182334

Using the insights from a long-term bottom-up energy systems model, and undertaking a sectoral assessment, we investigated the importance of CCS in the industrial sector. Under climate policy aimed at limiting atmospheric concentration of GHGs to 650 ppm CO2e, costs could increase fivefold when CCS is excluded from the portfolio of mitigation option measures in the industry sector as compared to when CCS is excluded in the power sector. This effect is driven largely by the lack of alternatives for deep emission reductions in industry. Our main policy conclusion is that a broader recognition of CCS in industrial applications in both current policy discussions and research, development, and demonstration funding programmes is justified. In recognition of the heterogeneity of the many types of industrial production processes, the size and location of industrial CO2 sources, the specific need for CCS-retrofitting, and the exposure of most industrial sectors to international trade, policies aimed at supporting CCS must distinguish between the different challenges faced by the power and industrial sectors. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","climate change mitigation; CO2 capture and storage (CCS); energy technology; industrial sector","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental policy; mitigation; pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911993828

The ADN also owns distributed electrical energy storage. We show that it is possible to use the same broadcast signal deployed for controlling loads to manage the distributed storage. To this end, we propose an appropriate control law to be embedded into the distributed electrical storage controllers that reacts to the defined broadcast signal in order to control both active and reactive power injections. We analyze, in particular, the case where electrical storage systems consist of supercapacitor arrays and where the ADN uses the grid explicit congestion notification (GECN) for real-time demand response that the authors have developed in a previous contribution. We estimate the energy reserve required for successfully performing voltage control depending on the characteristics of the network. The performance of the scheme is numerically evaluated on the IEEE 34-node test feeder. We further evaluate the effect, depending on the line characteristics, of reactive versus active power controlled injections. We find that without altering the demand-response signal, a suitably designed controller implemented in the storage devices enables them to successfully contribute to primary voltage control. © 2014 IEEE.","Active distribution network (ADN); ancillary services; broadcast signals; demand response; electrical energy storage systems; primary voltage control","Broadcasting; Data storage equipment; Electric energy storage; Real time systems; Virtual storage; Voltage control; Active distribution network (ADN); Ancillary service; Broadcast signals; Demand response; Electrical energy storage systems; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027919516

The proposed topology of the PEMFC along with a new model of WT reduces the initial costs of the hybrid isolated network. Due to power demand fluctuations in isolated networks, to maintain the balance between power generation and consumption, intelligent and flexible control methods must be applied. The variations of the solar irradiance, of the wind speed, and of the power consumption in hybrid isolated networks render the classic controllers and even fuzzy controllers inefficient. To overcome this problem, we use a novel intelligent fuzzy controller which is optimized by the teaching-learning-based optimization method. In the structure of the new proposed controller, the range and place of membership functions are optimized to reduce network frequency oscillations and improve network frequency stability. The designed control methodology is evaluated in the proposed isolated network and its performance is compared with the fuzzy controller, proportional integral (PI) controller, and optimal PI controller.

But more even more daring, traders are exploring the possibility of storing LNG on ships docked around the Southeast Asian city-state. However, the super-cooled gas tends to vaporize, leading to a limited storage window offshore. Traders can avoid this by storing the gas in the onshore hub as Singapore LNG (SLNG) guarantees to minimize boil-off loses. Pavilion Gas, owned by state-backed Pavilion Energy, imported the terminal's first spot LNG cargo from Indonesian national oil company Pertamina's Bontang plant in Kalimantan. Analysts expect the cargo could be sold for as much as $16 per million British thermal units (Btu) for winter delivery. Spot prices have been trending below $11/million Btu as soft demand and the early start-up of ExxonMobil's Papua New Guinea LNG project have weighed on prices. The wagers underscore Singapore's emergence as an Asian LNG trading hub, and highlight the country's ambition to kick-start a regional market. But given its role as Asia's leading oil trading hub, Singapore is keen to get a head start on aspiring marketplaces such as Shanghai, Tokyo or Hong Kong to establish Asia's first legitimate hub. Meanwhile, Singapore's Keppel Shipyard plans to start converting existing LNG tankers into floating LNG (FLNG) production units, instead of building a brand new floater, marking the first time such a project has been attempted. Keppel won a deal from London-based LNG shipper Golar to convert the Hilli LNG tanker to an FLNG unit for $735 million. The conversion could cut 25% off the cost and time to build a new FLNG ship, allowing the gas to move faster to market, said Black & Veatch, an engineering firm involved in the project, due to be finished by early 2017.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907148387

In the present study, an accelerated shelf-life testing by means of elevated temperatures 62, 72, and 82 °C was conducted to predict the oxidation stability of walnuts over a long-term storage. Peroxide value (PV) was employed to monitor the lipid oxidation progression in the walnuts. A range of 74.01-79.57 kJ mol-1 K-1 energy was required for formation of primary oxidation products. The reaction changes followed an apparent first-order kinetic. Formation of hydroperoxides in walnut kernels was found to be a temperature-dependent reaction with Q10 of 2.1. Walnut kernels were also kept in normal condition (temp: 20-30 °C; relative humidity (RH): 35-45%) for 12 months to validate the shelf-life estimation approach. The results showed that PV could provide a proper estimation for oxidative stability of the walnuts stored in ordinary condition.","accelerated shelf-life; oxidative stability; peroxide value; walnuts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905504841

The topic is introduced by selected examples on successful applications of metabolomics in the clinic. In the core part of the paper, the structural features of important analyte classes such as nucleotides, coenzyme A thioesters or carboxylic acids are linked to ""problematic hotspots"" along the analytical chain (sample preparation and-storage, separation and detection). We discuss these hotspots from a chemical point of view, covering issues such as analyte degradation or interactions with metals and other matrix components. Based on this understanding we propose solutions wherever available. A major notion derived from these considerations is that comprehensive carbon metabolomics inevitably requires multiple, complementary analytical approaches covering different chemical classes of metabolites. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Central carbon metabolism; Chemical degradation; Energy metabolism; Metal interaction","Biomolecules; Carbon; Degradation; Liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Analytical approach; Central carbon metabolisms; Chemical degradation; Chemical instability; Energy metabolism; Metal interactions; Technical challenges; Tricarboxylic acid cycle; Chemical analysis; acetoacetic acid; carbon; carboxylic acid; coenzyme A; dihydroxyacetone; glyceraldehyde; guanosine triphosphate; metal; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nucleotide; oxaloacetic acid; oxoacid; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; thioester; tricarboxylic acid; carbon; article; carbon metabolism; chemical analysis; chemical interaction; citric acid cycle; degradation; energy metabolism; glycolysis; isomerization; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolite; metabolomics; oxidation; physical chemistry; priority journal; animal; chemistry; human; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolism; procedures; Animals; Carbon; Chromatography, Liquid; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904618330

The heating of samples in most methods induces magnetic alteration-a process that is still poorly understood, but prevents obtaining correct field values. Here we show induced changes in magnetic domain state directly by imaging the domain configurations of titanomagnetite particles in samples that systematically fail to produce truthful estimates. Magnetic force microscope images were taken before and after a heating step typically used in absolute palaeointensity experiments. For a critical temperature (250, we observe major changes: distinct, blocky domains before heating change into curvier, wavy domains thereafter. These structures appeared unstable over time: after 1-year of storage in a magnetic-field-free environment, the domain states evolved into a viscous remanent magnetization state. Our observations qualitatively explain reported underestimates from otherwise (technically) successful experiments and therefore have major implications for all palaeointensity methods involving heating. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited .",,"estimation method; magnetic field; magnetization; paleomagnetism; article; electron microscopy; energy; environmental temperature; heating; magnetic field; magnetic force microscopy; magnetism; microscope; paleontology; qualitative analysis; rock; room temperature; scanning electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907340203

By comparing baseline and policy scenario results from two integrated assessment partial equilibrium models TIAM-ECN and GCAM and two general equilibrium models Phoenix and MEG4C, we provide an indication of future developments and dynamics in the Colombian energy system. Currently, the carbon intensity of the energy system in Colombia is low compared to other countries in Latin America. However, this trend may change given the projected rapid growth of the economy and the potential increase in the use of carbon-based technologies. Climate policy in Colombia is under development and has yet to consider economic instruments such as taxes and abatement targets. This paper shows how taxes or abatement targets can achieve significant CO2 reductions in Colombia. Though abatement may be achieved through different pathways, taxes and targets promote the entry of cleaner energy sources into the market and reduce final energy demand through energy efficiency improvements and other demand-side responses. The electric power sector plays an important role in achieving CO2 emission reductions in Colombia, through the increase of hydropower, the introduction of wind technologies, and the deployment of biomass, coal and natural gas with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Uncertainty over the prevailing mitigation pathway reinforces the importance of climate policy to guide sectors toward low-carbon technologies. This paper also assesses the economy-wide implications of mitigation policies such as potential losses in GDP and consumption. An assessment of the legal, institutional, social and environmental barriers to economy-wide mitigation policies is critical yet beyond the scope of this paper. © 2015 The Authors","Carbon taxes; Climate change mitigation; CO2 abatement targets; Energy modeling","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal storage; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Climate change mitigation; CO2 abatement; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy model; General equilibrium models; Partial equilibrium model; Social and environmental; Energy efficiency; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; demand-side management; economic growth; emission control; energy efficiency; energy market; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; general equilibrium analysis; pollution tax; Colombia; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930812264

The CNT addition resulted in both a decreased desorption temperature and improved sorption kinetics compared to the undoped MgH 2-FeCl3 composite. The desorption temperature of the 5 wt % CNT-added MgH2-FeCl3 composite was decreased to 230 °C compared with 275 °C for undoped MgH2-FeCl3. For the dehydrogenation kinetics, the 5 wt % CNT-added MgH2-FeCl 3 sample released about 4.3 wt % hydrogen at 320 °C after 4 min of dehydrogenation, while the MgH2-FeCl3 composite released about 3.1 wt % hydrogen under the same conditions. Meanwhile, for the rehydrogenation kinetics, the 5 wt % CNT-added MgH2-FeCl3 sample absorbed about 5.21 wt % hydrogen at 300 °C after 1 min of rehydrogenation, but the MgH2-FeCl3 composite only absorbed about 4.8 wt % hydrogen.

In this synthesis approach, the presence of hydrophobic 3DG promoted the Volmer-Weber growth of MoO2 nanoparticles (30-60 nm). The as-prepared MoO2-3DG nanocomposite was directly used as a binder-free anode electrode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) without additives and exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. It delivered high reversible capacities of 975.4 mA h g-1 and 537.3 mA h g-1 at the current densities of 50 and 1000 mA g-1, respectively. Moreover, the electrode also showed an increased capacity from 763.7 mA h g-1 to 986.9 mA h g-1 after 150 discharge and charge cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1.

The period chosen for this study consisted of 49 days between 28 April 2010 and 15 July 2010. This period was defined based on information from the Brazilian Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC), data collected in situ and the interpretation of remotely sensed images. To better understand the governing processes that drive changes in the heat balance, differential cooling and mixing dynamics, a simulation was performed that utilized a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model enforced with in situ and remote sensing data. The results showed that during a cold front passage over the reservoir, the sensible and latent heat fluxes were enhanced by approximately 77 and 16%, respectively. The reservoir's daily averaged heat loss was up to 167% higher on the days with cold front activity than on the days without activity. The cold front passage also intensified the differential cooling process; in some cases the difference between the water temperature of the littoral and pelagic zones reached up to 8 °C. The occurrence of cold front passages impacted the diurnal mixed layer (DML), by increasing the turbulent energy input (~54%) and the DML depth (~41%). Our results indicate that the cold front events are one of the main meteorological disturbances driving the physical processes within hydroelectric reservoirs located in tropical South America during the wintertime. Hence, cold front activity over these aquatic systems has several implications for water quality and reservoir management in Brazil. © Author(s) 2014.",,"Digital storage; Remote sensing; Water quality; Weather forecasting; Diurnal mixed layer; Hydroelectric reservoirs; Interpretation of remotely sensed images; Meteorological disturbance; Remote sensing data; Sensible and latent heat fluxes; Three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling; Tropical reservoirs; Tropics; cold front; heat balance; mixed layer; mixing; remote sensing; reservoir; satellite data; simulation; water; water temperature; weather forecasting; Brazil; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921442447

Among its several roles is the storage of lipids from food. In order to investigate the effect of lipids on the cell, especially on mitochondria and peroxisomes, the present study was aimed at examining the peroxisomal and mitochondrial population in the PPG of Atta sexdens rubropilosa after lipid supplementation by confocal laser scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Soybean oil provided as lipid supplement was not toxic for A. sexdens rubropilosa workers for the first 48. h and 120. h. However, the ultrastructural cytochemical analysis revealed an accumulation of lipid droplets in the PPGs of ants after lipid supplementation at 48. h and 120. h, and smaller lipid droplets in the basal membrane of the PPG epithelium, showing lipid mobilization from the PPG to the hemolymph. The lipid supplementation reduces the life expectancy of medium workers, probably due to the high lipid metabolism.

This study tested the hypothesis that obesity-related cardiomyopathy is caused by impaired cardiac energetics. In a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, we applied in vivo cardiac 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate cardiac energy status and function, respectively. The measurements were complemented by ex vivo determination of oxygen consumption in isolated cardiac mitochondria, the expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism, and markers of oxidative stress and calcium homeostasis. We also assessed whether HFD induced myocardial lipid accumulation using in vivo 1H MRS, and if this was associated with apoptosis and fibrosis. Twenty weeks of HFD feeding resulted in early stage cardiomyopathy, as indicated by diastolic dysfunction and increased left ventricular mass, without any effects on systolic function. In vivo cardiac phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio and ex vivo oxygen consumption in isolated cardiac mitochondria were not reduced after HFD feeding, suggesting that the diastolic dysfunction was not caused by impaired cardiac energetics. HFD feeding promoted mitochondrial adaptations for increased utilization of fatty acids, which was however not sufficient to prevent the accumulation of myocardial lipids and lipid intermediates. Myocardial lipid accumulation was associated with oxidative stress and fibrosis, but not apoptosis. Furthermore, HFD feeding strongly reduced the phosphorylation of phospholamban, a prominent regulator of cardiac calcium homeostasis and contractility. In conclusion, HFD-induced early stage cardiomyopathy in mice is associated with lipotoxicity-associated oxidative stress, fibrosis, and disturbed calcium homeostasis, rather than impaired cardiac energetics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Calcium homeostasis; Cardiac energetics; Cardiomyopathy; Diet-induced obesity; Lipotoxicity","caspase 3; caspase 9; citrate synthase; fatty acid; mitochondrial protein; phosphorus 31; procaspase 3; procaspase 9; reactive oxygen metabolite; triacylglycerol; troponin T; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; creatine phosphate; fatty acid; phospholamban; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; article; calcium homeostasis; cardiomyopathy; controlled study; diastolic dysfunction; endoplasmic reticulum; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; glucose assay; glucose blood level; glucose oxidation; heart left ventricle mass; heart mitochondrion; heart muscle fibrosis; insulin blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; male; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; obesity; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; priority journal; protein expression; animal tissue; Article; cardiac imaging; disease association; energy metabolism; energy transfer; ex vivo study; fibrosis; heart function; heart muscle metabolism; in vivo study; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; obesity; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; protein phosphorylation; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910067714

In order to balance the unpredicted wind and PV power variations, system operators need to schedule additional reserves. This paper presents the optimal integrated participation model of wind and PV energy including demand response, storage devices, and dispatchable distributed generations in microgrids or virtual microgrids to increase their revenues in the intra-market. This market is considered 3-7 h before the delivered time, so that the amount of the contracted energy could be updated to reduce the produced power deviation of microgrid. A stochastic programming approach is considered in the development of the proposed bidding strategies for microgrid producers and loads. The optimization model is characterized by making the analysis of several scenarios and simultaneously treating three kinds of uncertainty including wind and PV power, intra-market, and imbalance prices. In order to predict these uncertainty variables, a neuro-fuzzy based approach has been applied. Historic data are used to forecast future prices and wind and PV power production in the adjustment markets. Also, a probabilistic approach based on the error of forecasted and real historic data is considered for estimating the future IM and imbalance prices of wind and PV produced power. Further, a test case is applied to example the microgrid using the Spanish market rules during one week, month, and year period to illustrate the potential benefits of the proposed joint biding strategy.

However, recent studies have revealed that specific types of polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) could have a singlet biradical ground state and exhibit unique electronic, optical, and magnetic activities. With the appropriate stabilization, these new compounds could prove useful as molecular materials for organic electronics, nonlinear optics, organic spintronics, organic photovoltaics, and energy storage devices. However, before researchers can use these materials to design new devices, they need better methods to synthesize these molecules and a better understanding of the fundamental relationship between the structure and biradical character of these compounds and their physical properties. Their biradical character makes these compounds difficult to synthesize. These compounds are also challenging to physically characterize and require the use of various experimental techniques and theoretic methods to comprehensively describe their unique properties.In this Account, we will discuss the chemistry and physics of three types of PHs with a significant singlet biradical character, primarily developed in our group. These structures are zethrenes, Z-shaped quinoidal hydrocarbons; hydrocarbons that include a proaromatic extended p-quinodimethane unit; and periacenes, acenes fused in a peri-Arrangement. We used a variety of synthetic methods to prepare these compounds and stabilized them using both thermodynamic and kinetic approaches. We probed their ground-state structures by electronic absorption, NMR, ESR, SQUID, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography and also performed density functional theory calculations. We investigated the physical properties of these PHs using various experimental methods such as one-photon absorption, two-photon absorption, transient absorption spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and spectroelectrochemistry.These systematic studies revealed that aromaticity played a very important role in determining their singlet biradical character, which is critically related to both their physical properties and their chemical reactivity. In particular, we found that Clars aromatic sextet rule, which is useful for the closed-shell PAHs, can also predict the relative biradical character of benzenoid PH-based singlet biradicaloids. Other factors, such as structural flexibility of the biradical and quinoid resonance forms and the participation of the substitution in the π-conjugation, also influence the biradical character. These molecular materials demonstrate a number of unique properties such as near-infrared absorption, redox amphotericity, large two-photon absorption cross section, short excited state lifetime, stimuli-responsive magnetic activity, and singlet fission, which suggests promise for future applications. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906237759

Burning fossil fuels at a rate and scale that satisfy our near-term demand will irreversibly damage the living environment. Among the various sources of alternative and CO2-emission-free energies, the sun is the only source that is capable of providing enough energy for the whole world. Sunlight energy, however, is intermittent and requires an efficient storage mechanism. Sunlight-driven water splitting to make hydrogen is widely considered as one of the most attractive methods for solar energy storage. Water splitting needs a hydrogen evolution catalyst to accelerate the rate of hydrogen production and to lower the energy loss in this process. Precious metals such as Pt are superior catalysts, but they are too expensive and scarce for large-scale applications.In this Account, we summarize our recent research on the preparation, characterization, and application of amorphous molybdenum sulfide catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalysts can be synthesized by electrochemical deposition under ambient conditions from readily available and inexpensive precursors. The catalytic activity is among the highest for nonprecious catalysts. For example, at a loading of 0.2 mg/cm 2, the optimal catalyst delivers a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 at an overpotential of 160 mV. The growth mechanism of the electrochemically deposited film catalysts was revealed by an electrochemical quartz microcrystal balance study. While different electrochemical deposition methods produce films with different initial compositions, the active catalysts are the same and are identified as a ""MoS2+x"" species. The activity of the film catalysts can be further promoted by divalent Fe, Co, and Ni ions, and the origins of the promotional effects have been probed. Highly active amorphous molybdenum sulfide particles can also be prepared from simple wet-chemical routes. Electron transport is sometimes slow in the particle catalysts, and an impedance model has been established to identify this slow electron transport. Finally, the amorphous molybdenum sulfide film catalyst has been integrated onto a copper(I) oxide photocathode for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution. The conformal catalyst efficiently extracts the excited electrons to give an impressive photocurrent density of -5.7 mA/cm2 at 0 V vs RHE. The catalyst also confers good stability. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906224151

From this review, we find that recycling of computer HDDs is currently the most feasible pathway toward large-scale recycling of neodymium, even though HDDs do not represent the largest application of neodymium. We then use a combination of dynamic modeling and empirical experiments to conclude that within the application of NdFeB magnets for HDDs, the potential for loop-closing is significant: up to 57% in 2017.

However, such applications are still constrained by limitations in processing potentials, storage capacity and battery lifetime of the Smart Mobile Devices (SMDs). Therefore, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) leverages the application processing services of computational clouds for mitigating resources limitations in SMDs. Currently, a number of computational offloading frameworks are proposed for MCC wherein the intensive components of the application are outsourced to computational clouds. Nevertheless, such frameworks focus on runtime partitioning of the application for computational offloading, which is time consuming and resources intensive. The resource constraint nature of SMDs require lightweight procedures for leveraging computational clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a lightweight framework which focuses on minimizing additional resources utilization in computational offloading for MCC. The framework employs features of centralized monitoring, high availability and on demand access services of computational clouds for computational offloading. As a result, the turnaround time and execution cost of the application are reduced. The framework is evaluated by testing prototype application in the real MCC environment. The lightweight nature of the proposed framework is validated by employing computational offloading for the proposed framework and the latest existing frameworks. Analysis shows that by employing the proposed framework for computational offloading, the size of data transmission is reduced by 91%, energy consumption cost is minimized by 81% and turnaround time of the application is decreased by 83.5% as compared to the existing offloading frameworks. Hence, the proposed framework minimizes additional resources utilization and therefore offers lightweight solution for computational offloading in MCC. © 2014 Shiraz et al.",,"application service provider; article; client server application; computational offloading; controlled study; data extraction; data processing; information retrieval; information service; information system; information technology; Internet; mathematical computing; mobile application; mobile cloud computing; mobile phone; wireless communication; computer network; data storage device; evaluation study; Internet; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Storage Devices; Internet; Mobile Applications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924947109

To realize the desired stretchability and electromechanical sensitivity, cellular polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures with micrometer-sized voids are internally implanted with bipolar charges, which function as dipoles and respond promptly to diverse electromechanical stimuli. The resulting composite structures behave like rubber (with an elastic modulus about 300 kPa) and show strong piezoelectricity (with a piezoelectric coefficient d33 higher than 1500 pC/N). In the prototype demonstration, an autonomous heartbeat monitoring system utilizing stacked piezoelectric PDMS films is demonstrated.

Different SWNTs/PAni nanocomposites were prepared by varying the ratio of SWNT to aniline, and the samples were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The pseudo-capacitive behavior of the nanocomposites was evaluated by charge/discharge galvanostatic measurements. The presence of the SWNTs affected the electronic and vibrational properties of the polyaniline and also improved the pseudo-capacitive behavior of the conducting polymer. A very thin and flexible all-solid device was manufactured using two electrodes (polyethylene terephthalate-PET covered with the SWNT/PAni nanocomposite separated by a H2SO4-PVA gel electrolyte). The pseudo-capacitive behavior was characterized by a volumetric specific capacitance of approximately 76.7 F cm-3, even under mechanical deformation, indicating that this nanocomposite has considerable potential for application in new-generation energy storage devices. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The energy hub model consists of a mixed-integer linear programming problem that balances energy demand and supply between multiple energy carriers by determining the optimal conversion and storage schedule within certain constraints. The new formulations extend the model to account for performance constraints concerning system efficiencies, storage losses and operating limits. Each formulation allows a more accurate representation of real plant performance to be included in the optimisation, giving more accurate optimised schedules and carbon emissions totals. The first major innovation is a means of limiting the number of state changes (startups or shutdowns). This is achieved by specifying a minimum time for which the plant must operate once it is running. The second innovation is the use of stepwise approximations of efficiency curves, thus allowing part-load behaviour to be accurately simulated using a linear model. The third innovation adds a storage loss term that is a percentage of the current amount stored, rather than a fixed value. The new formulations are demonstrated in an example case, where the impact on the optimal schedule is observed. They are also analysed for each week of the heating season, and their impact on the time taken to find the optimal solution is also discussed. Overall changes in the predicted carbon emissions of up to 22% were found, highlighting the importance of accurate plant representation in energy hub models. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Constraints; Energy hub; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimisation","Carbon; Constraints; Energy hub modeling; Energy hubs; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming problems; Operational constraints; Optimisations; Performance constraints; Integer programming; carbon emission; energy efficiency; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; simulation; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905721641

Paraffin wax as a PCM and a nanocomposite of paraffin wax with 1.0. wt% of 20-nm nano-Cu particles were tested as the energy storage medium for TES. Three cases have been investigated, namely without PCM, with PCM, and with the Cu-PCM nanocomposite, at 10°, 20°, and 30° inclination angles of each case. The system performance was evaluated for water heating. The process involved a total change of the 60-l water tank at 7:00. PM and 7:00. AM. The use of water circulation of 0.5. kg/min and setting the collector at a 10° inclination angle was found to be the best operational condition. The measurement result of the tank water temperature at 7:00.

Among these compounds, carbohydrates have several functions other than as an energy source, including protection against drought and extreme temperatures. In this work, we analyzed the composition and tissue distribution of carbohydrates in the underground organs of four Asteraceae species from a preserved area of rocky fields in the Brazilian Cerrado. Soluble carbohydrates were quantified and analyzed by HPAEC–PAD, and starch was analyzed by an enzymatic assay. All species (Baccharis subdentata DC., Chresta curumbensis (Philipson) H.Rob., Lessingianthus floccosus (Gardner) H.Rob., and Strophopappus glomeratus (Gardner) R.Esteves) store long-chain inulin-type fructans. Among them, C. curumbensis presented the highest amount of soluble carbohydrates, comprising 25% of the reserve organ dry mass. Inulin sphero-crystals were visualized under polarized light, mainly in the vascular cylinder. Buds were found on the underground organs of B. subdentata and C. curumbensis, and secretory structures were identified in S. glomeratus, L. floccosus, and C. curumbensis. The occurrence of buds, secretory structures, and fructans in these organs is probably related to ecophysiological strategies used as defense and survival mechanisms in response to stress conditions, particularly drought and fire, that occur frequently in rocky fields. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

The MCFC can utilize CO 2 in combustion flue gas at the cathode as oxidant and concentrate it at the anode through the cell reaction and thereby simplifying capture and storage. However, combustion flue gas often contains sulfur dioxide which, if entering the cathode, causes performance degradation by corrosion and by poisoning of the fuel cell. The effect of contaminating an MCFC with low concentrations of both SO2 at the cathode and H2S at the anode was studied. The poisoning mechanism of SO2 is believed to be that of sulfur transfer through the electrolyte and formation of H2S at the anode. By using a small button cell setup in which the anode and cathode behavior can be studied separately, the anodic poisoning from SO2 in oxidant gas can be directly compared to that of H2S in fuel gas. Measurements were performed with SO2 added to oxidant gas in concentrations up to 24 ppm, both for short-term (90 min) and for long-term (100 h) contaminant exposure. The poisoning effect of H2S was studied for gas compositions with high- and low concentration of H2 in fuel gas. The H2S was added to the fuel gas stream in concentrations of 1, 2 and 4 ppm. Results show that the effect of SO2 in oxidant gas was significant after 100 h exposure with 8 ppm, and for short-term exposure above 12 ppm.

In this paper, colonial competitive algorithms are used to design the DERs controllers in a cooperative manner that these controllers can keep the MG stable. Artificial neural network tool trained by Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is used to generate controlling signal for every controller to keep the frequency and voltage in a desired range.

The main goal in these networks is to provide good data accessibility for participants. Because of the wireless nodes’ continuous movement, network partitioning occurs very often. In order to subside the negative effects of this partitioning and improve data accessibility and reliability, data is replicated in nodes other than the original owner of data. This duplication costs in terms of nodes’ storage space and energy. Hence, autonomous nodes may behave selfishly in this cooperative process and do not replicate data. This kind of phenomenon is referred to as a strategic situation and is best modeled and analyzed using the game theory concept. In order to address this problem we propose a game theory data replication scheme by using the repeated game concept and prove that it is in the nodes’ best interest to cooperate fully in the replication process if our mechanism is used. © 2014, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Among theses, Mg is regarded as a promising hydrogen storage material due to its high theoretical gravimetric, volumetric capacity and the full reversibility of its sorption reactions combined with low cost, low density and environmental friendliness. In previous studies, the superior catalytic effect of Nb2O5 was demonstrated and compared to other metal oxide catalysts. However, the nanocrystalline MgH2-Nb2O5 mixtures must be milled for more than 20 hours to obtain the outstanding sorption kinetics. Long milling time causes high production costs, and makes the system less attractive for commercial applications. In this way, ternary mixtures Mg-Nb2O5-SWCNT (molar ratio %=97.5:0.5:2.0) were prepared by high-energy ball milling and their hydrogen storage behaviors were investigated. The structural and phase evolution of SWCNT and Nb2O5 were investigated by using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

In this study, a localized corona charging method to obtain micro sized electret areas on non-patterned macro sized dielectric thin film has been proposed to solve the problem of low charging efficiency and fast charge decay of micro sized electrets. This method involves using a shadow mask to transfer charge patterns and a triode corona charging configuration to facilitate charge penetration. Charging efficiency of 93.6% is achieved on an electret area of 100 μ m×100μ m, and 87% of its initial surface potential remains on the shrunken area of 50μ m×50μ m after 240 days of storage.

These emissions are the major driver behind human induced global warming. Renewable electricity implementation is one way of reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. However, this transition is also accompanied by some problems. The intermittency of renewables demands for a more flexible electricity system. In existing electricity systems this lack of flexibility already leads to load balancing issues increasing costs and threatening energy security.Large scale storage facilities could provide the needed flexibility. This paper focuses on the economic and environmental system consequences of the application of power-to-gas, pumped hydro storage and compressed air energy storage in an electricity system at different wind power penetration levels.The study shows that the application of large scale energy storage techniques results in economic costs reducing effects on the electricity system. These are highest for pumped hydro storage, followed by the cost reducing effects of compressed air energy storage and power-to-gas. The impact on the fuel use and the emissions is less obvious. In some scenarios, the application of storage even resulted in an increase of the fuel use and the emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Buffering; Compressed air energy storage; Large scale energy storage; Power to gas; Pumped hydro storage; Wind power","Compressed air; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power system economics; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Pressure vessels; Wind power; Buffering; Electricity system; Environmental systems; Reducing effects; Renewable electricity; Storage facilities; Storage technique; Wind power penetration; Compressed air energy storage; buffering; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; electricity generation; emission control; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; global warming; greenhouse gas; heat transfer; renewable resource; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904198188

The analysis was performed for both priority of providing electricity (PE) and priority of providing heat (PH) operation strategies. Four scenarios (SELL-PE, SELL-PH, No SELL-PE, No SELL-PH) were followed to specify design parameters such as the number and nominal power of prime movers, heating capacities of both backup boiler and energy storage tank, and the cooling capacities of electrical and absorption chillers. By defining an objective function called the Relative Annual Benefit (RAB), Genetic Algorithm optimization method was used for finding the optimal values of design parameters. The optimization results indicated that two gas engines (with nominal powers of 3780 and 3930kW) in SELL-PE scenario, two gas engines (with nominal powers of 5290 and 5300kW) in SELL-PH scenario, one gas engine (with nominal power of 2440kW) in No SELL-PE scenario provided the maximum value of the objective function.

The results show that while the geometry of BNNT/Al(N or B)-CH 4 complexes is determined by weak electrostatic forces, the binding energy mainly determines by dispersion forces. For all complexes, the energy gaps, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, dipole moments, natural charge and density of state (DOS) diagrams were extracted. Finally, the applicability of BNNTs/Al(N) both as a medium for storage and gas sensor for methane detection were confirmed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum-doped; BNNT; Methane gas sensor; Methane storage","Aluminum; Atoms; Chemical bonds; Complexation; Density functional theory; Gas detectors; III-V semiconductors; Methane; Yarn; Average binding energy; BNNT; Density functional theory methods; Methane gas sensors; Methane storage; Natural bond orbital analysis; Single-walled boron nitride nanotubes; Technical applications; Binding energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901921548

So far the link between leptin and energy balance during sexual maturation in teleosts has been poorly investigated. In this study, seasonal gene expression changes in two leptin genes (lepa1 and lepa2) and the leptin receptor were investigated during early sexual maturation in male Atlantic salmon parr under fully fed (control) and feed restricted conditions from April through September. Both Atlantic salmon lepa1 and lepa2 in the liver and lepr in the brain were significantly down-regulated in non-maturing control males in early spring, coinciding with the start of the growth and fat accumulation. In maturing control males, hepatic leptin expression increased during mid-spermatogenesis and lepa1 and lepa2 mRNA levels were up-regulated by 7.7 and 49 times respectively during final maturation. For the first time in a fish species, a significant up-regulation of lepr expression was observed in the testis throughout mid to late spermatogenesis. Feed restriction decreased the incidence of sexual maturation by 53% and highly up-regulated both leptin genes in the liver and the leptin receptor in the pituitary. This study shows that hepatic lepa1 and lepa2 expression and lepr expression in the testis is affected by early sexual maturation in male Atlantic salmon parr. Fast growth and high fat stores are associated with low leptin levels while feed restriction has a stimulatory effect on hepatic leptin and leptin receptor gene expression in the pituitary, suggesting a role for leptin other than that as an adiposity signal. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Atlantic salmon; Leptin; Leptin receptor; Restricted feeding; Sexual maturation; Teleost","leptin; leptin receptor; luteinizing hormone beta subunit; leptin; leptin receptor; messenger RNA; article; Atlantic salmon; body fat; body weight; controlled study; diet restriction; down regulation; energy balance; fat content; gene expression regulation; gene location; gonad development; growth rate; incidence; lepa1 gene; lepa2 gene; LEPR gene; Lh b gene; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; sexual maturation; spermatogenesis; spring; upregulation; animal; Atlantic salmon; energy metabolism; food deprivation; genetics; growth, development and aging; hypophysis; liver; metabolism; obesity; physiology; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; season; sexual maturation; testis; Adiposity; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Food Deprivation; Gene Expression Regulation; Leptin; Liver; Male; Pituitary Gland; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptors, Leptin; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Salmo salar; Seasons; Sexual Maturation; Spermatogenesis; Testis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901479228

For that purpose the contents of 60 major, minor and TEs in high-temperature BAs produced at 500 °C were determined by inductively coupled plasma and laser ablation mass spectrometry, as well as scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyser. The phase-mineral composition of BAs was studied by light microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, differential-thermal and thermo-gravimetric analyses plus some leaching, precipitation, ashing (500-1500°C) and other procedures. The composition and properties of the biomass fuels studied and their ashes were characterized, and some general considerations about TEs in them are described. An elucidation of the TE contents in BAs and their ash types was conducted and a comparison with coal ashes was also performed.

In this work energy management in microgrids is addressed in light of economic and environmental restrictions through (a) development of an operational strategy for energy management in microgrids and (b) determination of type and capacity of distributed generation (DG) sources as well as the capacity of storage devices (SD) based on optimization. Net present value is used as an economic indicator for justification of investment in microgrids. The proposed NPV-based objective function accounts for the expenses including the initial investment costs, operational strategy costs, purchase of electricity from the utility, maintenance and operational costs, as well as revenues including those associated with reduction in non-delivered energy, the credit for reduction in levels of environmental pollution, and sales of electricity back to the utility. The optimal solution maximizing the objective function is obtained using a hybrid optimization method which combines the quadratic programming (QP) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms to determine the optimum capacity of the sources as well as the appropriate operational strategy for the microgrid. The fuzzy set theory is employed to account for the uncertainties associated with electrical power price. Application of the proposed method under different operational scenarios serves to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental pollution; Microgrid; Net present value (NPV); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quadratic programming (QP); Reliability","Electricity price forecasting; Environmental pollutions; Environmental restriction; Hybrid optimization method; Micro grid; Net present value; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Simultaneous optimization; Electricity price forecasting; Environmental pollutions; Environmental restriction; Hybrid optimization method; Micro grid; Net present value; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Simultaneous optimization; Costs; Distributed power generation; Economics; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Energy management; Investments; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Purchasing; Reliability; Virtual storage; Costs; Distributed power generation; Economics; Electric load forecasting; Electric power distribution; Energy management; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Investments; Pollution; Purchasing; Quadratic programming; Reliability; Virtual storage; Quadratic programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); algorithm; electrical power; energy planning; environmental economics; fuzzy mathematics; investment; optimization; pollution control; price determination; uncertainty analysis; algorithm; cost analysis; electricity generation; forecasting method; fuzzy mathematics; operations technology; optimization; pricing policy; reliability analysis; uncertainty analysis; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897879856

Four types of CSP plants with parabolic troughs (simple plants, plants with hybridization and plants with thermal energy storage) were simulated at two sites: Bom Jesus da Lapa and Campo Grande. Then, the main parameters obtained for each plant were expanded to other suitable Brazilian sites, as inputs in an optimization model for the expansion of the country's electric power grid. Findings indicate that the least-cost expansion of the Brazilian electricity system should be based on hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants fueled by natural gas and sugarcane bagasse. Hence, in the base scenario CSP plants would not be chosen. However, in an alternative scenario, specific auctions for CSP can be adopted. In this case, the first solar plants would be introduced in 2020 in place of natural gas-fueled thermoelectric plants, and from 2030 on, hydroelectric plants would cease to be installed.

An alternative to reduce these emissions is carbon capture and storage (CCS), which employs solvents based on amine compounds. In this scene, ionic liquids (IL) have been investigated to a greater extent for this application. In this work, we make an evaluation of interactions between gases (CO2, SO2, and H2S) and anion/cation from IL, as well as cation-anion interactions. For this, quantum calculations under vacuum were performed at the B3LYP/6-311+G-* level of theory and using the M06-2X functional, where dispersion effects are considered. Among the well-studied systems based on imidazolium cations and fluorinated anions, we also studied the tetraalkylammonium, tetraalkylphosphonium, ether-functionalized imidazolium based systems, and tetrahexylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, [THA][Tf2N], as a potential prototype. The ion pairs evaluated include [Tf2N]--based IL, with alkyl chain varying from [C1mim]+ to [C8mim]+ and [C 1mim]+-based IL. We found that the anion becomes more available to interact with gas with the weakening of the cation-anion interaction.

The vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode of PHEVs have been investigated in numerous recent studies from many aspects, while most of them have predicted a 10- to 15-year horizon for V2G to gain a wider acceptance of governments and stakeholders who are interested in changing existing electricity grid to a smart grid. Thus, electricity grid should be focused on a more practical examination and implementation before reaching that point. Vehicle-to-building (V2B) mode is a concept that could be broadly implemented on a horizon of less than 4 years. Disconnecting home or whole a facility from grid, is the greatest excellence of V2B. In this paper a real distribution network is modeled in order to analyze the constructive potential profits of PHEVs as dispersed energy storage, performing on V2B mode of operating.

In this paper, an optimal energy management strategy is proposed to take full advantage of a hybrid CCHP and PV system. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied on a typical residential building to minimize both Energy cost and emission. Evaluating the proposed strategy, three scenarios are considered: the building without Energy Storage Devices (ESDs) following thermal or electric load, and the building incorporating both Electrical and Thermal Energy Storage.

Radiation as a terminal treatment kills or inactivates all the microbes in the processed human tissues to ensure that the tissues attain a high sterility assurance level (10-6) for safe clinical use. Radiation kills the microorganisms through direct and indirect effects. Radiosensitivity of the microbes is influenced by numerous factors including the microbe types, microbial cell-cycle stages, level of oxygen, water content of tissues, temperature during irradiation, nutrient or organic substances, chemical agents, radiation dose rate, and linear energy transfer of the radiation source. Prerequisite understanding of radiation effects on tissues and tissue components may assist in identifying an appropriate dose to avoid degradation effects especially in soft tissues. Irradiated frozen tissues sustain less degradation than freeze-dried tissues irradiated at room temperature. A combination of freezing and radiation is recommended for weight-bearing large bone and soft tissues. However, the combination of freeze drying and radiation is still the best procedure for small bones and amnion, for easy transportation and storage. Viral disease transmission is prevented through an efficient tissue screening and processing, followed by radiation sterilization. Radiation doses, less than 25kGy, that do not enhance the damage caused by freeze drying, are favorable for sterilizing tissues. The radiation dose as decided by the tissue banker must be able to completely kill microorganisms with no or minimal effect on the intended tissue functions. The selected dose must be validated according to ISO standards.

Planning a grid based on renewable power plants poses serious challenges to the normal operation of a power system, namely on frequency and voltage stability. Regardless of its inherent problems, there is a consensus that in a future not far away, the green energy could supply most of local needs with less production based on fuel burning. In past grid code compliance, wind turbines did not require services for supporting grid operation. To shift to large-scale integration of renewables, the island grid code should incorporate a new set of requirements in order to regulate the inclusion of these services. Hence, this paper focuses on grid code requirements for large renewable energy integration based distributed generation in island power systems. The paper also discusses additional requirements such as ""virtual"" wind inertia for improving regulation capability of wind farms and electric energy storage applications for better renewable generation performance. Moreover, a comparative analysis of insular grid code compliance to these requirements in European context is presented. © 2014 IEEE.","Grid codes; Islanded systems; Renewables penetration; Stability and frequency regulation","Energy policy; LSI circuits; Power plants; System stability; Wind power; Frequency regulations; Grid code requirements; Grid codes; Large-scale deployment; Regulation capability; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable generation; Renewables; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908431838

Herein, a novel supercapacitor electrode comprising 3D hierarchical mixed-oxide nanostructured arrays (NAs) of C/CoNi3O4 is reported. The network-like C/CoNi 3O4 NAs exhibit a relatively high specific surface area; it is fabricated from ultra-robust Co-Ni hydroxide carbonate precursors through glucose-coating and calcination processes. Thanks to their interconnected three-dimensionally arrayed architecture and mesoporous nature, the C/CoNi 3O4 NA electrode exhibits a large specific capacitance of 1299 F/g and a superior rate performance, demonstrating 78% capacity retention even when the discharge current jumps by 100 times. An optimized asymmetric supercapacitor with the C/CoNi3O4 NAs as the positive electrode is fabricated. This asymmetric supercapacitor can reversibly cycle at a high potential of 1.8 V, showing excellent cycling durability and also enabling a remarkable power density of ∼13 kW/kg with a high energy density of ∼19.2 W·h/kg. Two such supercapacitors linked in series can simultaneously power four distinct light-emitting diode indicators; they can also drive the motor of remote-controlled model planes. This work not only presents the potential of C/CoNi3O4 NAs in thin-film supercapacitor applications, but it also demonstrates the superiority of electrodes with such a 3D hierarchical architecture. An optimized asymmetric supercapacitor using novel 3D hierarchical C/CoNi3O4 hybrid nanostructured arrays as the positive electrode is fabricated. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits appealing energy storage performance with a high power density, excellent rate capability, and favorable cycling behavior.

The doped graphenes can be prepared by a broad variety of chemical approaches. The substitution of a carbon atom should induce n-type behavior in the case of nitrogen and p-type behavior in the case of boron-doped graphene; however, the real situation is more complex. The electrochemical experiments show that boron-doped graphene prepared by hydroboration reaction exhibits similar properties as the nitrogen doped graphene; according to theory, the electrochemical behavior of B and N doped graphenes should be opposite. Here we analyze the electronic structure of N/B-doped graphene (at ∼5% coverage) by theoretical calculations. We consider graphene doped by both substitution and addition reactions. The density of states (DOS) plots show that graphene doped by substitution of the carbon atom by N/B behaves as expected, i.e., as an n/p-doped material. N-doped graphene also has a lower value of the workfunction (3.10 eV) with respect to that of the pristine graphene (4.31 eV), whereas the workfunction of B-doped graphene is increased to the value of 5.57 eV. On the other hand, the workfunctions of graphene doped by addition of -NH2 (4.77 eV) and -BH2 (4.54 eV) groups are both slightly increased and therefore the chemical nature of the dopant is less distinguishable. This shows that mode of doping depends significantly on the synthesis method used, as it leads to different types of behaviour, and, in turn, different electronic and electrochemical properties of doped graphene, as observed in electrocatalytic experiments. This study has a tremendous impact on the design of doped graphene systems from the point of view of synthetic chemistry.

Beginning with the trivial case of electrostatic accelerators, the synchronization condition is explained for a number of driven accelerators like Alvarez linacs, cyclotrons and finally synchrotrons and storage rings, where it plays a crucial role. In the case of the latter, the principle of phase focusing is motivated qualitatively as well as on a mathematically more correct level and the problem of operation below and above the transition energy is discussed.

However, petroleum is also a major pollutant of the environment. Contamination by oil and oil products has caused serious harm, and increasing attention has been paid to the development and implementation of innovative technologies for the removal of these contaminants. Biosurfactants have been extensively used in the remediation of water and soil, as well as in the main stages of the oil production chain, such as extraction, transportation, and storage. This diversity of applications is mainly due to advantages such as biodegradability, low toxicity and better functionality under extreme conditions in comparison to synthetic counterparts. Moreover, biosurfactants can be obtained with the use of agro-industrial waste as substrate, which helps reduce overall production costs. The present review describes the potential applications of biosurfactants in the oil industry and the remediation of environmental pollution caused by oil spills. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Industrial wastes; Patents; Surface tension; Sustainable technologies","biosurfactant; emulsifying agent; fatty acid; glycolipid; lipopeptide; phospholipid; rhamnolipid; vegetable oil; surfactant; Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans; Acinetobacter; Acinetobacter calcoaceticus; aerobic bacterium; agricultural waste; agro industrial waste; Bacillus licheniformis; Bacillus subtilis; biodegradability; biodegradation; Candida; Candida glabrata; Candida tropicalis; cleaning; detoxification; ecosystem restoration; food chain; gas exchange; Kluyveromyces lactis; Lactobacillus pentosus; LC 50; marine environment; mutagen testing; nonhuman; oil industry; oil spill; petrochemical industry; phytoplankton; pipeline; pollution; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas fluorescens; review; toxicity; viscosity; Yarrowia lipolytica; Bacteria; bioremediation; fungus; lipid metabolism; metabolism; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Fungi; Lipid Metabolism; Petroleum Pollution; Surface-Active Agents",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904438233

In the present work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) &amp; ZnO nanocomposite with 0-5 atom% Ag doping was prepared by electrodeposition method and characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM, EDX, UV-Vis spectroscopy and final photoelectrochemical activity was assessed under 1.5 AM solar simulator in 1 M NaOH as electrolyte.

We find a red-shift of 0.35 eV in the UV-vis spectrum and therefore an enhanced photoelectrochemical activity in the visible range on Ag doping in rGO/ZnO nanocomposite. Nanocomposite with 1 atom% Ag doping showed the highest photocurrent density of 2.48 mA/cm2 at 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl over other samples, which was almost five times higher than that for undoped rGO/ZnO composite.

The developmental origins of health and disease paradigm suggests that environmental factors during early life could play a role. In this perspective, perinatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been indicated as a programming factor for obesity and related metabolic disorders later in life. Here we study early life programming by BPA using an experimental design that is relevant for human exposure. C57BL/6JxFVB hybrid mice were exposed during gestation and lactation via maternal feed to 8 non-toxic doses (0-3000. μg/kg body weight/day (μg/kg bw/d)) of BPA. After weaning, offspring were followed for 20 weeks without further exposure. Adult male offspring showed dose-dependent increases of body and liver weights, no effects on fat pad weights and a dose-dependent decrease in circulating glucagon. Female offspring showed a dose-dependent decrease in body weight, liver, muscle and fat pad weights, adipocyte size, serum lipids, serum leptin and adiponectin. Physical activity was decreased in exposed males and suggested to be increased in exposed females. Brown adipose tissue showed slightly increased lipid accumulation in males and lipid depletion in females, and ucp1 expression was dose-dependently increased in females. The effects in females were more reliable and robust than in males due to wide confidence intervals and potential confounding by litter size for male data. The lowest derived BMDL (lower bound of the (two-sided) 90%-confidence interval for the benchmark dose) of 233. μg/kg bw/d (for interscapular weight in females) was below the proposed BMDL of 3633. μg/kg bw/d as a basis for tolerable daily intake. Although these results suggest that BPA can program for an altered metabolic phenotype, the sexual dimorphism of effects and diversity of outcomes among studies similar in design as the present study do not mark BPA as a specific obesogen. The consistency within the complex of observed metabolic effects suggests that upstream key element(s) in energy homeostasis are modified.

In this version we have restructured the serial implementation of the code so as to achieve optimal task-based parallelization. The pure shared-memory parallelization of the library has been based on the lightweight OpenMP tasking model allowing for the full extraction of the available parallelism and efficient scheduling of multiple concurrent library calls. On multicore clusters, parallelism is exploited by means of TORC, an MPI-based multi-threaded tasking library. The new MPI implementation of NDL provides optimal performance in terms of function calls and, furthermore, supports asynchronous execution of multiple library calls within legacy MPI programs. In addition, a Python interface has been implemented for all cases, exporting the functionality of our library to sequential Python codes.

Computer: Distributed systems (clusters), shared memory systems. Operating system: Linux, Unix. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes. RAM: The library uses O(N) internal storage, N being the dimension of the problem. It can use up to O(N2) internal storage for Hessian calculations, if a task throttling factor has not been set by the user. Classification: 4.9, 4.14, 6.5. Catalog identifier of previous version: AEDG_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180(2009)1404 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: The numerical estimation of derivatives at several accuracy levels is a common requirement in many computational tasks, such as optimization, solution of nonlinear systems, and sensitivity analysis. For a large number of scientific and engineering applications, the underlying functions correspond to simulation codes for which analytical estimation of derivatives is difficult or almost impossible. A parallel implementation that exploits systems with multiple CPUs is very important for large scale and computationally expensive problems. Solution method: Finite differencing is used with a carefully chosen step that minimizes the sum of the truncation and round-off errors. The parallel versions employ both OpenMP and MPI libraries. Reasons for new version: The updated version was motivated by our endeavors to extend a parallel Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework [1], by incorporating higher order derivative information as in most state-of-the-art stochastic simulation methods such as Stochastic Newton MCMC [2] and Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian MC [3]. The function evaluations are simulations with significant time-to-solution, which also varies with the input parameters such as in [1, 4]. The runtime of the N-body-type of problem changes considerably with the introduction of a longer cut-off between the bodies. In the first version of the library, the OpenMP-parallel subroutines spawn a new team of threads and distribute the function evaluations with a PARALLEL DO directive. This limits the functionality of the library as multiple concurrent calls require nested parallelism support from the OpenMP environment. Therefore, either their function evaluations will be serialized or processor oversubscription is likely to occur due to the increased number of OpenMP threads. In addition, the Hessian calculations include two explicit parallel regions that compute first the diagonal and then the off-diagonal elements of the array. Due to the barrier between the two regions, the parallelism of the calculations is not fully exploited. These issues have been addressed in the new version by first restructuring the serial code and then running the function evaluations in parallel using OpenMP tasks. Although the MPI-parallel implementation of the first version is capable of fully exploiting the task parallelism of the PNDL routines, it does not utilize the caching mechanism of the serial code and, therefore, performs some redundant function evaluations in the Hessian and Jacobian calculations. This can lead to: (a) higher execution times if the number of available processors is lower than the total number of tasks, and (b) significant energy consumption due to wasted processor cycles. Overcoming these drawbacks, which become critical as the time of a single function evaluation increases, was the primary goal of this new version. Due to the code restructure, the MPI-parallel implementation (and the OpenMP-parallel in accordance) avoids redundant calls, providing optimal performance in terms of the number of function evaluations. Another limitation of the library was that the library subroutines were collective and synchronous calls. In the new version, each MPI process can issue any number of subroutines for asynchronous execution. We introduce two library calls that provide global and local task synchronizations, similarly to the BARRIER and TASKWAIT directives of OpenMP. The new MPI-implementation is based on TORC, a new tasking library for multicore clusters [5–7]. TORC improves the portability of the software, as it relies exclusively on the POSIX-Threads and MPI programming interfaces. It allows MPI processes to utilize multiple worker threads, offering a hybrid programming and execution environment similar to MPI+OpenMP, in a completely transparent way. Finally, to further improve the usability of our software, a Python interface has been implemented on top of both the OpenMP and MPI versions of the library. This allows sequential Python codes to exploit shared and distributed memory systems. Summary of revisions: The revised code improves the performance of both parallel (OpenMP and MPI) implementations. The functionality and the user-interface of the MPI-parallel version have been extended to support the asynchronous execution of multiple PNDL calls, issued by one or multiple MPI processes. A new underlying tasking library increases portability and allows MPI processes to have multiple worker threads. For both implementations, an interface to the Python programming language has been added. Restrictions: The library uses only double precision arithmetic. The MPI implementation assumes the homogeneity of the execution environment provided by the operating system. Specifically, the processes of a single MPI application must have identical address space and a user function resides at the same virtual address. In addition, address space layout randomization should not be used for the application. Unusual features: The software takes into account bound constraints, in the sense that only feasible points are used to evaluate the derivatives, and given the level of the desired accuracy, the proper formula is automatically employed.

In order to respond to a transient power demand, usually battery energy storage device is combined with super capacitor. Battery-super capacitor system is used to create an energy storage system with the high energy density attributes of batteries and the high power density of super capacitor. In order to simulate the PEV model, dynamic state space models of bidirectional DC-DC converter and grid connected voltage source converter with energy storage models are considered to connect the PEV to the main grid. In order to stabilize the DC-link power and distribute the power between dual energy storage sources in PEV during normal and disturbance conditions on the grid voltage, a Lyapunov based Neuro-Fuzzy control strategy has been developed. This controller determines the super capacitor power that should be generated according to the amount of available energy in DC-link. Moreover, a robust sliding mode control strategy for voltage source converter based on positive and negative symmetrical components is presented to investigate the voltage disturbance ride-through and voltage control capability. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, its major problems, limited write endurance and high write energy, are still preventing it from being used as a drop-in replacement of SRAM cache. In this paper, we propose a novel coding scheme for STT-RAM last level cache based on the concept of value locality. We reduce switching probability in cache by swapping common patterns with limited weight codes (LWC) to make writes less often as well as more uniform. We also define some policies for swapping these patterns. Our evaluation shows that bit write variance in memory cells can be reduced by about 20% on average resulting in a more uniform wear-out directly enhancing lifetime and improving cell reliability. In addition, writes in cache lines can be reduced by about 12% compared to one of the most effective circuit level techniques known as early write termination (EWT) [12]. Our method increases memory hierarchy access time by about 0.08% on average, which is negligible. We have shown that our method doesn't adversely affect last level cache energy-delay2. The non-uniformity caused by the coding scheme can be used for another coding scheme at main memory or L1 cache depending on their technologies. © 2014 IEEE.","cache; limited weight code; memory endurance; nonvolatile memory; STT-RAM; write energy; write hotspot","Codes (symbols); Random access storage; Static random access storage; cache; Hot spot; limited weight code; Non-volatile memory; Stt rams; write energy; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937635300

These lattices make use of a large number of weak bending magnets which considerably reduces the amount of power radiated in the dipoles in comparison to power radiated from insertion devices. Therefore parameters such as emittance, energy spread, and radiated power are - unlike 3rd generation storage rings - no longer constant during a typical user shift. Instead, they depend on several varying parameters such as insertion device gap settings, bunch charge, bunch length, etc. Since the charge per bunch is usually high, intrabeam scattering becomes very strong creating a dependence of emittance on stored current. Furthermore, since the bunch length can vary as insertion device gaps change, the emittance blow-up from intrabeam scattering is not constant either. Therefore, the emittance, bunch length, and hence the resulting Touschek lifetime have to be calculated in a self-consistent fashion with 6D tracking taking into account not only the bare lattice and RF cavity settings, but also momentary bunch charge and gap settings. This paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (insertion devices, emittance coupling), longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic Landau cavities), and choice of stored current in an ultralow-emittance storage ring as well as some implications for brightness optimization.

The aim of this problem is to determine the optimum size of energy storage like battery storages and use the efficient hydrogen and thermal energy storages and to schedule the committed units' output power while satisfying practical constraints and electrical/thermal load demand over one day with 15 min time step. In order to best use of multiple PEM-FCPPs, hydrogen storage management is carried out. Also, since the electrical and heat load demand are not synchronised, it could be useful to store the extra heat of PEM-FCPPs in the peak electrical load in order to satisfy delayed heat demands. Due to uncertainty nature of electrical/thermal load, photovoltaic and wind turbine output power and market price, a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming model, where the first stage prescribes the here-and-now variables and the second stage determines the optima value of wait-and-see variables under cost minimization is implemented. For solving the problem, a new enhanced cuckoo optimisation algorithm is presented and successfully applied to two typical micro-grids.

Although infaunal organisms can be expected to be particularly impacted by decreases in seawater pH, as a result of naturally acidified conditions in benthic habitats, information regarding physiological and behavioral responses is still scarce. Determination of PO2 and PCO2 gradients within burrows of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis during environmental hypercapnia demonstrated that besides hypoxic conditions, increases of environmental PCO2 are additive to the already high PCO2 (up to 0.08 kPa) within the burrows. In response to up to 4 weeks exposure to pH 7.3 (0.3 kPa PCO2) and pH 7.0 (0.6 kPa PCO2), metabolic rates of A. filiformis were significantly reduced in pH 7.0 treatments, accompanied by increased ammonium excretion rates. Gene expression analyses demonstrated significant reductions of acid-base (NBCe and AQP9) and metabolic (G6PDH, LDH) genes. Determination of extracellular acid-base status indicated an uncompensated acidosis in CO2-treated animals, which could explain the depressed metabolic rates. Metabolic depression is associated with a retraction of filter feeding arms into sediment burrows. Regeneration of lost arm tissues following traumatic amputation is associated with significant increases in metabolic rate, and hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0, 0.6 kPa) dramatically reduce the metabolic scope for regeneration, reflected in an 80% reduction in regeneration rate. Thus, the present work demonstrates that elevated seawater PCO2 significantly affects the environment and the physiology of infaunal organisms like A. filiformis. © 2014.

Changes in the use of energy (between somatic and reproductive processes) were indirectly evaluated by means of temporal variations in fish body condition, feeding activity, visceral fat storage, and reproductive effort. Fish were collected from October 1999 to September 2004, in periods that preceded and followed the construction of the dam. We recorded significant changes in all ecological traits for the three analyzed species (for males and females). In general, there was an intense reduction in reproductive activity after river damming, whereas visceral fat and body condition increased consistently. In contrast, there was no clear trend in feeding activity (i.e., stomach weight), with little changes in species diet during the analyzed period. These results indicate that the impoundment changed the energy allocation process between somatic and reproductive activities, since fish started to allocate energy mainly to somatic processes. These changes may have a negative effect on the persistence of populations in Lajeado Reservoir, because improvements in somatic condition will not necessarily translate into increased fitness. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia.","Body condition; Colonization; Fitness; Reproduction; River regulation","Hemiodontidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907583529

Our results were compared with data on the reproductive biology of Brazilian populations of T. torquatus and congeneric species. In Corrientes, males of T. torquatus exhibited a continuous reproductive cycle, but with annual variation of testicular parameters associated with spermatogenic activity. In contrast, females were reproductive only from winter to summer (July-February), laying at least two clutches each of six eggs, on average, per reproductive season. The relative clutch mass and egg size values in Corrientes were the highest reported for the species. The annual cycle of energy storage (as fat bodies) was inversely correlated with reproductive activity in both sexes. Males differed from females in snout-vent length, head size, interlimb length, and tail length.Weobserved interpopulational differences in relative clutch mass, egg volume and mass, incubation period and hatching time, and the minimum body size for sexual maturity probably as a result of phenotypic plasticity or adaptation to local environmental conditions and likely both. © 2014 Published by NRC Research Press.","Lizard; Reproductive cycle; Squamata; Tropidurid; Tropidurus torquatus","annual variation; body size; egg size; environmental conditions; female; hatching; lizard; male; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive biology; sexual dimorphism; sexual maturity; summer; winter; Argentina; Corrientes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903304950

Both exhibit highly ordered molecular structures and appear as micrometer-sized granules inside chloroplasts. In order to distinguish grana and starch, we used multiphoton microscopy, with simultaneous acquisition of two-photon fluorescence (2PF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) signals. SHG is sensitive to crystallized structures while 2PF selectively reveals the distribution of chlorophyll.Result: Three distinct microstructures with different contrasts were observed, i.e. "" SHG dominates"" , "" 2PF dominates"" , and "" SHG collocated with 2PF"" . It is known that starch and grana both emit SHG due to their highly crystallized structures, and no autofluorescence is emitted from starch, so the "" SHG dominates"" contrast should correspond to starch. The contrast of "" SHG collocated with 2PF"" is assigned to be grana, which exhibit crystallized structure with autofluorescent chlorophyll. The "" 2PF dominates"" contrast should correspond to stroma thylakoid, which is a non-packed membrane structure with chrolophyll. The contrast assignment is further supported by fluorescence lifetime measurement.Conclusion: We have demonstrated a straightforward and noninvasive method to identify the distribution of grana and starch within an intact leaf. By merging the 2PF and SHG images, grana, starch and stroma thylakoid can be visually distinguished. This approach can be extended to the observation of 3D grana distribution and their dynamics in living plants. © 2014 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Grana; Second harmonic generation; Starch; Two-photon fluorescence","chlorophyll; starch; article; fern; histology; multiphoton microscopy; photosynthesis; plant leaf; thylakoid; ultrastructure; Chlorophyll; Ferns; Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Starch; Thylakoids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902946268

The fabrication of different oxide/metal core-branch nanoarrays with adjustable components and morphologies (e.g., nanowire and nanoflake) is reported on different conductive substrates. Hollow metal branches (or shells) wrapped around oxide cores are realized by electrodeposition using ZnO nanorods as a sacrificial template. In battery electrode application, the thin hollow metal branches can provide a mechanical protection of the oxide core and a highly conductive path for charges. As a demonstration, arrays of Co 3O4/Ni core-branch nanowires are evaluated as the anode for lithium ion batteries. The thin metal branches evidently improve the electrochemical performance with higher specific capacity, rate capability, and capacity retention than the unmodified Co3O4 counterparts. A thin shell helps a lot. Metal oxide nanostructures wrapped with thin and hollow metal shells are fabricated to improve their lithium ion storage properties. The thin metal branches can provide a structural protection of the oxide core and a more conductive path for charge carriers.

Here, a self-assembled cobalt oxide (CoO) nanorod cluster on three-dimensional graphene (CoO-3DG) is synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method followed by heat treatment. As an additive-free electrode, CoO-3DG exhibits good electrochemical performance. Compared with CoO nanorod clusters grown on Ni foam (i.e., CoO-Ni, ≈680 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and ≈400 F g-1 at 20 A g-1), CoO-3DG achieves much higher capacitance (i.e., ≈980 F g-1 at 1 A g -1 and ≈600 F g-1 at 20 A g-1) with excellent cycling stability of 103% retention of specific capacitance after 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, it shows an interesting activation process and instability with a redox reaction for CoO. In addition, the phase transformation from CoO nanorods to Co3O4 nanostructures was observed and investigated after charge and discharge process, which suggests the activation kinetics and the phase transformable nature of CoO based nanostructure. These observations demonstrate phase transformation with morphological change induced capacitance increasement in the emergent class of metal oxide materials for electrochemical energy storage device. An ex situ method demonstrates that the capacity increase of cobalt oxide nanorod cluster on 3D graphene (CoO-3DG) pseudocapacitors is due to phase transformation from nanorods to nanoflowers with a valence change of Co. This evidence could help to understand the activation process phenomenon in metal oxide pseudocapacitors. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Development of novel materials with improved radiation resistance, which is of the utmost importance for progress in nuclear energy, requires guidelines to arrive at favorable parameters more efficiently. Here, we present a methodology that can be used for the design of radiation tolerant materials. We used synchrotron X-ray reflectivity to nondestructively study radiation effects at buried interfaces and measure swelling induced by He implantation in Cu/Nb multilayers. The results, supported by transmission electron microscopy, show a direct correlation between reduced swelling in nanoscale multilayers and increased interface area per unit volume, consistent with helium storage in Cu/Nb interfaces in forms that minimize dimensional changes. In addition, for Cu/Nb layers, a linear relationship is demonstrated between the measured depth-dependent swelling and implanted He density from simulations, making the reflectivity technique a powerful tool for heuristic material design. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Helium; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Multilayers; Nuclear energy; Reflection; Swelling; Advanced nuclear system; Dimensional instability; Linear relationships; Metallic multilayers; Nanoscale multilayers; Nuclear energy systems; Reflectivity technique; Structural component; Radiation effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903140239

These additives are expected to form more homogeneous composites with Mg/MgH2 as compared to metallic scandium. However, scandium(III)chloride, reacts with MgH2 during mechano-chemical treatment and form ScH2 and MgCl2 (that later crystallise during heat treatment). The composite MgH2-ScH 2 was investigated using in-situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction during up to five cycles of continuous release and uptake of hydrogen at isothermal conditions at 320, 400 and 450 °C and p(H 2) = 100-150 or 10-2 bar. The data were analysed by Rietveld refinement and no reaction is observed between either MgH 2/ScH2 or Mg/ScH2 during cycling. The extracted sigmoidal shaped curves for formation or decomposition of Mg/MgH2 suggest that a nucleation process is preceding the crystal growth. The reaction rate increases with increasing number of cycles of hydrogen release and uptake at isothermal conditions possibly due to activation effects.

To expose its hydrogen storage capabilities, detailed structural, elastic, electronic, optical and dielectric aspects have been deeply analysed. The electronic band structure calculations demonstrate that Mg2FeH6 is semiconducting material. The obtained results of the optical bandgap (4.19 eV) also indicate that it is a transparent material for ultraviolet light, thus demonstrating its potential for optoelectronics application. The calculated elastic properties reveal that Mg2FeH6 is highly stiff and stable hydride. Finally, the calculated hydrogen (H2) storage capacity (5.47 wt.%) within a reasonable formation energy of -78 kJ mol-1, at room temperature, can be easily achievable, thus making Mg2FeH6 as potential material for practical H2 storage applications.

The use of wood pellets made from sawdust is rapidly increasing. Wood pellets are a refined compacted fuel with high energy density and low emissions during combustion. Sawdust and wood pellets may be stored for several months due to seasonal demand variation and wood-fuel trade. Wood contains unsaturated fatty acids susceptible to oxidation, a process commonly referred to as fats going rancid. The level of oxidation in pellets is an important parameter of pellets quality as oxidation during storage causes problems such as self-ignition of pellets stored in silos and emissions of malodorous compounds. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of the age of the raw material on the oxidation caused aldehyde emissions from wood pellets. Pellets were produced from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) sawdust that was either freshly sawn or had been stored for 4 months. The pellets were then stored in either 18 C or in 40 C. The formation of the aldehyde hexanal was analyzed with static headspace and gas chromatography. Pellets made from fresh sawdust were low-emitting after 80 days, whereas pellets made from aged sawdust did not reach the same low level until 190 days after production. This held true whether the pellets were stored in 18 C or in 40 C. The aged sawdust pellets had maximum emissions at the same time as the emissions ceased from the fresh sawdust pellets. A key conclusion is that when a low level of aldehyde emissions is required during storage, the pellets should be produced of sawdust that is freshly sawn. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The calculations were performed using the long range corrected version of density functional theory, the Coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP) and the second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). The results showed that the average adsorption energy per hydrogen is about -0.7 and -0.3 kcal mol -1 at the MP2/6-311+G(d,p) and CAMB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) levels of theory, respectively. The adsorption energies were corrected for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) by the counterpoise method. It was found that the hydrogen storage capacity of the BMP is about 6.49 wt%, which is close to the values reported for the other selected materials for the hydrogen storage in the literature. The maximum number of hydrogen molecules, which were adsorbed by the BMP building block, is about ten. Molecular dynamic simulation was performed to assess the potential of BMP for hydrogen storage.

Devices for direct conversion of solar photons suffer from poor efficiencies due to spectrum losses, which are caused by energy mismatch between the optical absorption of the devices and the broadband irradiation provided by the sun. In this context, photon-upconversion technologies are becoming increasingly interesting since they might offer an efficient way of converting low energy solar energy photons into higher energy photons, ideal for solar power production and solar energy storage. This perspective discusses recent progress in triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) photon-upconversion systems and devices for solar energy applications.

The X-ray diffraction patterns show that as-synthesized LaNi5 alloy is single phase with CaCu5-type structure while some weak peaks of elemental nickel also appeared after several hydrogenation/dehydrogenation (H/D) cycling. The presence of pure Ni was also followed using the room temperature magnetic measurements. After H/D cycling, the particle size decreases and particle size distribution was found nearly uniform compared to noncycled alloy. The pressure-composition isotherms (PCIs) of the hydrogen absorption reaction were determined in the temperature range 20-80°C using a homemade Sievert's type experimental apparatus, and then the enthalpy and entropy of hydride formation were calculated. The hydriding kinetic mechanism of LaNi5 was evaluated using the different fitting models: Jander diffusion model (JDM), Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) and Chou models. All employed models confirm an increase in the hydriding reaction rate with temperature. However, the calculated results using JMA model show a better agreement with the experimental data and hence we believe that diffusion along with nucleation and growth is the rate-controlling step for the hydriding reaction. The values of activation energy for hydriding reaction were also obtained by JD and JMA models. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","hydriding kinetic; hydrogen storage; magnetic properties; pressure-composition-isotherm; X-ray diffraction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899626409

One of these applications is the frequency control of the electric power systems. Frequency of a power system depends on the balance of produced and demanded energy in any instant of time. Subsequent to a sudden change in the system, which causes produced and demanded energy mismatch, frequency oscillates. According to standards, the permissible variation band of the frequency is very restricted. Larger swings of frequency may result in instability and undesirable trips. As a result, suitable frequency control mechanisms should be implemented in the system. SMES is well-suited for this application because of high energy density and fast response. SMES is attached to system by a power conditioning system (PCS) which include power electronic converters, mainly a dc-dc chopper and an inverter. This paper, studies the application of a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel converter for frequency control. As far as the authors' knowledge, such a study has not been done before.

The optimization model maximizes the net benefit of installations in reservoir systems and is employed to design Khersan 1 and 2 power plants in the Khuzestan province of Iran. An optimization model is developed to determine design decision variables, including volume of reservoir, installed capacity of power plants, diameter of water transmission installations, and also operation decision variables including output volume of the reservoir at each time step and number of hours the power plant works in a day. To estimate the potential of pumped-storage power plants, two models of design are considered in (1) hydropower form and (2) pumped-storage form. The optimal design and operation of each of the aforementioned modes is accomplished by employing the nonlinear programming (NLP) code contained in the (language for interactive general optimization) LINGO 11.0 software package. Results of pumped-storage systems design and operation are compared to individual hydropower systems in the same area to determine the economic advantage of pumped-storage systems. Four criteria are considered to compare those two systems: (1) net benefit; (2) ratio of benefit to cost; (3) system efficiency criteria; and (4) mean, firm, and secondary-generated energy. Results indicate that pumped-storage systems have better outcomes than individual hydropower systems, based on the aforementioned four criteria. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Hydropower; Optimization; Pumped-storage; Simultaneous design-operation","Decision making; Design; Mathematical models; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Power plants; Reservoirs (water); Design and operations; Economic advantages; General optimizations; Hydropower; Khuzestan provinces; Optimization modeling; Pumped-storage; Simultaneous design-operation; Hydroelectric power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901014823

As measured from ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, it was discovered that adding PAG accelerated the conversion of latent pigment to regenerated pigment. In addition, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that, as the amount of PAG increased, the regenerated pigment lost its crystal structure, which particle size is increased from 1 to 4 μm and morphology is changed from a bar like form to a cubic and spherical form. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The performances of AFE materials are strongly dependent on the phase transformation process, which are mainly determined by the constitutions and the external field. For AFE thin/thick films, the electrical properties are also strongly dependent on their thickness, crystal orientation and the characteristics of electrode materials. Accordingly, various strategies have been employed to tailor the phase transformation behavior of AFE materials in order to improve their performances. Due to their relatively poor electrical strength (low breakdown fields), most PZ-based orthorhombic AFE ceramics are broken down before a critical switching field can be applied. As a consequence, the electric-field-induced transition between AFE and FE phase of only those AFE bulk ceramics, with compositions within tetragonal region near the AFE/FE morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), can be realized experimentally at room temperature. AFE materials with such compositions include (Pb,A)ZrO3 (A = Ba, Sr), (Pb1-3/2xLa x)(Zr1-yTiy)O 3 (PLZT x/(1-y)/y), (Pb0.97La0.02)(Zr,Sn,Ti) O3 (PLZST) and Pb0.99(Zr,Sn,Ti)0.98Nb 0.02O3 (PNZST). As compared to bulk ceramics, AFE thin and thick films always display better electric-field endurance ability. Consequently, room temperature electric-field-induced AFE-FE phase transition could be observed in the AFE thin/thick films with orthorhombic structures. Moreover, AFE films are more easily integrated with silicon technologies. Therefore, AFE thin/thick films have been a subject of numerous researches. This review serves to summarize the recent progress of PZ-based AFE materials, focusing on the external field (electric field, hydrostatic pressure and temperature) dependences of the AFE-FE phase transition, with a specific attention to the performances of AFE films for various potential applications, such as high energy storage, electric field induced strains, pyroelectric effect and electrocaloric effect. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The fine structure of starch isolated from the aged rice and the pasting properties of starch and rice flour were studied. After storage, the percentage of short amylopectin (AP) chains increased in TNW1, and no uniform changing pattern was observed in the chain-length (CL) distribution of TCSW1. The viscosity of starch isolated from the aged rice increased as the storage temperature and duration increased. We hypothesised that this increase was due to the hydrolysis of AP by endogenous amylase and the generation of small clusters during storage, which caused the simple dissociation of AP and a high swelling degree of starch granules during gelatinisation.

In this system, photoionized charged defects behave as surface trapped charges to achieve the electrical memory effect. As a result of the high surface electric field, the rate of dissociation of the photoexcited charge is amplified, thereby decreasing the optical writing energy. Moreover, the extremely high dynamic photoconductive gain (ca. 10 10) makes it possible to write multibit optical data bit-by-bit into the NW.

These lattices make use of a large number of weak bending magnets which considerably reduces the amount of power radiated in the dipoles in comparison to power radiated from insertion devices. Therefore, in such storage rings, parameters such as emittance, energy spread, and radiated power are - unlike 3rd generation storage rings - no longer constant during a typical user shift. Instead, they depend on several varying parameters such as insertion device gap settings, bunch charge, bunch length, etc. Since the charge per bunch is usually high, intrabeam scattering in medium-energy storage rings with ultralow emittance becomes very strong. This creates a dependence of emittance on stored current. Furthermore, since the bunch length is adjusted with rf cavities but is also varied as insertion device gaps change, the emittance blowup from intrabeam scattering is not constant either. Therefore, the emittance, bunch length, and hence the resulting Touschek lifetime have to be calculated in a self-consistent fashion with 6D tracking taking into account not only the bare lattice and rf cavity settings, but also momentary bunch charge and gap settings. Using the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring as an example, this paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (insertion devices, emittance coupling), longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic cavities), and choice of stored current in an ultralow-emittance storage ring as well as some implications for brightness optimization. © Published by the American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902089723

Recent research has found that graphene oxide is a composite material consisting of the so-called ""oxidation debris"" and unoxidized graphene fragments. Surprisingly, the oxidation debris, which contains small and highly oxidized aromatic fragments adsorbed on graphene surfaces, is responsible for the excellent solubility and inherent fluorescence of graphene oxide. Here, we examine the origin of the inherent electroactivity of graphene oxide and demonstrate that such phenomenon is attributed to the presence of oxidation debris. We separate oxidation debris from the less oxidized graphene backbone in ""as-prepared"" graphene oxide nanoplatelets using ultrasonication. We found that the extension of ultrasonication time corresponded to a larger amount of oxidation debris released from the graphene oxide nanoplatelets' surfaces and subsequently caused detrimental effects to the inherent electroactivity of the graphene material. Since graphene oxide is often the material of choice for energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, a thorough understanding on the origin of such inherent electrochemical properties of graphene oxide is of very high importance. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","graphene oxide; inherent electroactivity; oxidation debris","Debris; Fluorescence; Oxidation; Aromatic fragments; Electro-activity; Excellent solubility; Graphene fragments; Graphene oxides; Recent researches; Super capacitor; Ultra-sonication; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901684100

It was found that during ball milling, the NaAlH4/MgH2/LiBH4 combination converted readily to the mixture of LiAlH4/MgH2/NaBH 4 and there is a mutual destabilization among the hydrides. Three major dehydrogenation steps were observed in the system, which corresponds to the decomposition of LiAlH4, MgH2, and NaBH4, respectively. The onset dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 in this system is observed at around 275 °C, which is over 55 °C lower from that of as-milled MgH2. Meanwhile, NaBH4-relevant decomposition showed significant improvement, starts to release hydrogen at 370 °C, which is reduced by about 110 °C compared to the as-milled NaBH 4. The second and third steps decomposition enthalpy of the system were determined by differential scanning calorimetry measurements and the enthalpies were changed to be 61 and 100 kJ mol-1 H2 respectively, which are smaller than that of MgH2 and NaBH 4 alone. From the Kissinger plot, the apparent activation energy, EA, for the decomposition of MgH2 and NaBH4 in the composite was reduced to 96.85 and 111.74 kJ mol-1 respectively. It is believed that the enhancement of the dehydrogenation properties was attributed to the formation of intermediate compounds, including Li-Mg, Mg-Al, and Mg-Al-B alloys, upon dehydrogenation, which change the thermodynamics of the reactions through altering the de/rehydrogenation pathway. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Temperature- programmed-desorption results show that the addition of 5 wt.% Fe 2O3 to the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite system improves the onset desorption temperature to 95 °C and 270°C for the first two dehydrogenation stage, which is lower 40°C and 10°C than the undoped composite. The dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation kinetics of 5 wt.% Fe2O3-doped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite were also improved significantly as compared to the undoped composite. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements indicate that the enthalpy change in the 4MgH2-LiAlH4 composite system was unaffected by the addition of Fe2O3 nanopowder. The Kissinger analysis demonstrated that the apparent activation energy of the 4MgH 2 + LiAlH4 composite (125.6 kJ/mol) was reduced to 117.1 kJ/mol after doping with 5 wt.% Fe2O3. Meanwhile, the X-ray diffraction analysis shows the formation of a new phase of Li 2Fe3O4 in the doped composite after the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation process. It is believed that Li 2Fe3O4 acts as an actual catalyst in the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 + 5 wt.% Fe2O3 composite which may promote the interaction of MgH2 and LiAlH 4 and thus accelerate the hydrogen sorption performance of the MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite system. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this study, we report a novel route for synthesis of three-dimensional Ni(OH) 2/graphene/nickel foam electrode by electrochemical depositing Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes on graphene network grown on nickel foam current collector and explore its applications in supercapacitors. The resulting binder-free Ni(OH)2/graphene/nickel foam electrode exhibits excellent supercapacitor performance with a specific capacitance of 2161 F/g at a current density of 3 A/g. Even as the current density reaches up to 60 A/g, it still remains a high capacitance of 1520 F/g, which is much higher than that of Ni(OH)2/nickel foam electrode. The enhanced rate capability performance of Ni(OH)2/graphene/nickel foam electrode is closely related to the presence of highly conductive graphene layer on nickel foam, which can remarkably boost the charge-transfer process at electrolyte-electrode interface. The three-dimensional graphene/nickel foam substrate also significantly improves the electrochemical cycling stability of the electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 film because of the strong adhesion between graphene film and electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes. Results of this study provide an alternative pathway to improve the rate capability and cycling stability of Ni(OH)2 nanostructure electrode and offer a great promise for its applications in supercapacitors. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Conversely, renewable energy (RE), which produces no carbon emissions, has drawbacks such as intermittency, a lower electricity conversion rate and high cost. In this study, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimisation model under carbon constraints is developed to address these issues. The model is able to determine the most economical low carbon power generation mix to satisfy the forecast electricity demand in Iskandar Malaysia (IM) for the year 2025 while being reliable and having less impact on the environment. The model includes fuel-switching, RE power generation and implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS).

The planning horizon is divided into time intervals that are not necessarily of equal duration, but which represent time slices generated by specific events (e.g. start and end of plant operation) occurring in the system as well as the required degree of flexibility in planning. In carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems, CO2 sources have variable flow rates and fixed operating lives, while CO2 sinks have finite injection rate and storage capacity limits, as well as earliest times of availability. The model takes into account such physical and temporal considerations, and also accounts for the need for additional power generation to compensate for energy loss penalties resulting from the capture of CO2. A case is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to examine the tradeoff between carbon emissions reduction and power cost, as well as the effects of uncertainties in sink characteristics and properties of compensatory power on CCS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Mathematical optimization; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Source-sink matching","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy dissipation; Integer programming; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon emissions reductions; Degree of flexibility; Mathematical optimizations; Mixed-integer linear programming; Planning horizons; Source-sink; Variable flow rate; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; energy planning; flow measurement; power plant; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896850331

Nanostructured 84 mol% MgH2-10%mol TiH2-6%mol TiO2 nanocomposite powder was prepared by high-energy ball milling and subjected to thermal analyses. Evaluation of the absorption/desorption properties revealed that the addition of the Ti-based catalysts significantly improved the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. A decrease in the decomposition temperature (as high as 100 °C) was attained after co-milling of MgH2 with the Ti-based catalysts. Meanwhile, solid-state chemical reactions between MgH2 and TiO2 nanoparticles during co-milling slightly decreased the maximum hydrogen capacity. It was also found that formation of micro-cracks at the particle surfaces during thermal cycling enhanced the H-kinetics.

The morphology structure of the composite film was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the electrochemical capacitive properties were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The WO3/PANI nano-composite exhibited multiple colors (electrochromism) during the CV scans, from brownish green to transparent to light green then back to brownish green. Surprisingly, the integration of the PANI with the WO3 led to synergistic performance of nanohybrid wherein a true electrochemical double layer capacitor was obtained. Also, interestingly and unlike literature reports, the CBD method led to excellent capacitance retention (&gt;98%) of the PANI even at 1000 continuous cycles. This work demonstrates that simple CBD can be used to get WO3/PANI films that give good electrochromism and pseudo-capacitance comparable to the ones obtained by other methods. Hence the obtained nanocomposite film of WO 3/PANI can be a promising material for electrochromic and energy storage applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemical bath deposition; Electrochemical capacitors; Electrochromism; PANI film","Atomic force microscopy; Capacitors; Cyclic voltammetry; Deposition; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochromism; Nanocomposite films; Nanocomposites; Scanning electron microscopy; Capacitance retention; Chemical bath deposition methods; Chemical-bath deposition; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical double-layer capacitors; Energy storage applications; Fluorine doped tin oxide; Polyaniline nanocomposites; Polyaniline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899443772

Black soybean koji (BSK) is produced by the fermentation of black soybean with Aspergilllus awamori. Previous study indicated that BSK extract has antioxidative and multifunctional bioactivities, however, the role of BSK in the regulation of energy metabolism is still unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of glucose utilization on insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipogenesis-related protein expression in differentiated adipocytes with BSK treatment. Cytoxicity assay revealed that BSK did not adversely affect cell viability at levels up to 200 μg/mL. The potential for glucose utilization was increased by increased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), GLUT4 and protein kinase B (AKT) protein expression in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 cells in response to BSK treatment. Simultaneously, BSK inhibited lipid droplet accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The inhibitory effect of adipogenesis was associated with downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) level and upregulated Acrp30 protein expression. Our results suggest that BSK extract could improve glucose uptake by modulating GLUT1 and GLUT4 expression in a 3T3-L1 insulin-resistance cell model. In addition, BSK suppressed differentiation and lipid accumulation in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which may suggest its potential for food supplementation to prevent obesity and related metabolic abnormalities. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","3T3-L1 preadipocytes; Adipokines; Black soybean Koji; Insulin","adiponectin; amylase; beta glucosidase; black soybean koji; daidzein; daidzin; fat droplet; genistein; genistin; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 4; isoflavone derivative; malonyldaidzin; malonylgenistin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; protein kinase B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; unclassified drug; glucose; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 4; isoflavone derivative; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; plant extract; 3T3 cell line; adipocyte; adipogenesis; animal cell; article; Aspergilllus awamori; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity assay; glucose transport; glucose utilization; high performance liquid chromatography; insulin resistance; lipid storage; MTT assay; nonhuman; obesity; oil red o staining; proadipocyte; protein expression; soybean; staining; Western blotting; adipocyte; animal; chemistry; cytology; drug effects; insulin resistance; isolation and purification; metabolism; mouse; soybean; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Glucose; Glucose Transporter Type 1; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Insulin Resistance; Isoflavones; Mice; Plant Extracts; PPAR gamma; Soybeans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900032597

These tools have to predict releases from a wide range of storage pressures (up to 80 MPa) and temperatures (down to 20 K), e.g. cryogenic compressed gas storage covers pressures up to 35 MPa and temperatures between 33 K and 338 K. Accurate calculations of high pressure releases require real gas EOS. This paper compares a number of EOS to predict hydrogen properties typical in different storage types. The vessel dynamics are modeled using a simplified engineering and a CFD model to evaluate the performance of various EOS to predict vessel pressures, temperatures mass flow rates and jet flame lengths. It is shown that the chosen EOS and the chosen specific heat capacity correlation are important to model accurately hydrogen releases at low temperatures.

Herein we examine the effects of two amorphization strategies in the nanoscale, i.e., (1) molecular mobility restrictions and (2) high energy surface occupation, both by polymer excipient stabilizers, on the (i) morphology, (ii) colloidal stability, (iii) drug loading, (iv) amorphous state stability after three-month storage, and (v) in vitro supersaturation profiles, using itraconazole (ITZ) as the model drug. Drug-polyelectrolyte complexation is employed in the first strategy to prepare amorphous ITZ nanoparticles using dextran sulfate as the polyelectrolyte (ITZ nanoplex), while the second strategy employs pH-shift precipitation using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as the surface stabilizer (nano-ITZ), with both strategies resulting in >90% ITZ utilization. Both amorphous ITZ nanoparticles share similar morphology (∼300 nm spheres) with the ITZ nanoplex exhibiting better colloidal stability, albeit at lower ITZ loading (65% versus 94%), due to the larger stabilizer amount used. The ITZ nanoplex also exhibits superior amorphous state stability, attributed to the ITZ molecular mobility restriction by electrostatic complexation with dextran sulfate. The higher stability, however, is obtained at the expense of slower supersaturation generation, which is maintained over a prolonged period, compared to the nano-ITZ. The present results signify the importance of selecting the optimal amorphization strategy, in addition to formulating the excipient stabilizers, to produce amorphous drug nanoparticles having the desired characteristics. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","bioavailability enhancement; drug complexation; nanomedicine; nanopharmaceuticals; poorly soluble drug","dextran sulfate; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; itraconazole; nanoparticle; polyelectrolyte; antifungal agent; itraconazole; nanoparticle; polymer; article; complex formation; moisture; nanomedicine; particle size; pH; precipitation; priority journal; proton transport; thermogravimetry; thermostability; zeta potential; chemistry; Antifungal Agents; Hypromellose Derivatives; Itraconazole; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticles; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899892061

Systematic power output variation will then become manifest since solar power has an evident diurnal period, but also surface winds - which are driven by surface temperatures - follow a diurnal periodic behavior lagging about 4 h in time. On an ordinary day a strong diurnal varying renewable electricity generation results when combining wind and solar power on such continent sized grid. Comparison with possible demand patterns indicates that coping with such systematically varying generation will require large scale renewable energy storage and conversion for timescales and storage capacities of at least up to half a day. Seasonal timescales for versatile, high quality, generally applicable, energy conversion and storage are equally essential since the continent wide insolation varies a factor ∼3, e.g., in Europe and Northern Africa together. A first order model for estimating required energy storage and conversion magnitudes is presented, taking into account potential diurnal and seasonal energy demand and generation patterns.

In this study, we used a novel approach to first measure fatigue-induced reductions in force and tetanic Ca2+ in isolated single mouse muscle fibres following repeated contractions and subsequently quantify the subcellular distribution of glycogen in the same fibre. Using this approach, we investigated whether the decreased tetanic Ca2+ induced by repeated contractions was associated with glycogen depletion in certain subcellular regions. The results show a positive correlation between depletion of glycogen located within the myofibrils and low tetanic Ca2+ after repetitive stimulation. We conclude that subcellular glycogen depletion has a central role in the decrease in tetanic Ca2+ that occurs during repetitive contractions. In skeletal muscle fibres, glycogen has been shown to be stored at different subcellular locations: (i) between the myofibrils (intermyofibrillar); (ii) within the myofibrils (intramyofibrillar); and (iii) subsarcolemmal. Of these, intramyofibrillar glycogen has been implied as a critical regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. The aim of the present study was to test directly how the decrease in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) during repeated tetanic contractions relates to the subcellular glycogen distribution. Single fibres of mouse flexor digitorum brevis muscles were fatigued with 70 Hz, 350 ms tetani given at 2 s (high-intensity fatigue, HIF) or 10 s (low-intensity fatigue, LIF) intervals, while force and [Ca2+]i were measured. Stimulation continued until force decreased to 30% of its initial value. Fibres were then prepared for analyses of subcellular glycogen distribution by transmission electron microscopy. At fatigue, tetanic [Ca2+]i was reduced to 70 ± 4% and 54 ± 4% of the initial in HIF (P &lt; 0.01, n = 9) and LIF (P &lt; 0.01, n = 5) fibres, respectively. At fatigue, the mean inter- and intramyofibrillar glycogen content was 60-75% lower than in rested control fibres (P &lt; 0.05), whereas subsarcolemmal glycogen was similar to control. Individual fibres showed a good correlation between the fatigue-induced decrease in tetanic [Ca2+]i and the reduction in intermyofibrillar (P = 0.051) and intramyofibrillar (P = 0.0008) glycogen. In conclusion, the fatigue-induced decrease in tetanic [Ca2+]i, and hence force, is accompanied by major reductions in inter- and intramyofibrillar glycogen. The stronger correlation between decreased tetanic [Ca2+]i and reduced intramyofibrillar glycogen implies that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release critically depends on energy supply from the intramyofibrillar glycogen pool. © 2014 The Physiological Society.",,"calcium; glycogen; calcium; glycogen; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cellular distribution; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; flexor digitorum brevis muscle; glycogen analysis; metabolic stress; mouse; muscle contraction; muscle excitation; muscle fatigue; muscle strength; nonhuman; priority journal; protein depletion; sarcoplasmic reticulum; skeletal muscle; transmission electron microscopy; animal; C57BL mouse; cell fractionation; chemistry; metabolism; muscle fatigue; organ culture technique; physiology; refractory period; skeletal muscle; Animals; Calcium; Female; Glycogen; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Organ Culture Techniques; Refractory Period, Electrophysiological; Subcellular Fractions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899925295

In this article, we report the study of the doping of Li, Na and K atom onto carbon nanotube using density functional theory calculations. Then hydrogen adsorption on these carbon nanotubes has been studied to determine the best compound for hydrogen storage. A detailed comparison of the binding energies, equilibrium positions, Mulliken charges has been performed for the three alkali metal doped carbon nanotubes. Binding energies of metal doped carbon nanotubes indicate that these structures are stable and site dependence. We found that K has the most binding energy with carbon nanotubes.

High-tech plant incidents are caused by hazardous energy, even when that energy is confined to the inside of the process machine. During daily maintenance procedures, overhauling or troubleshooting, engineers entering the interior of the machines are in direct contact with the source of the energy or hazardous substances, which can cause serious injury. The best method for preventing such incidents is to use inherently safer design strategies (ISDs); this approach can fully eliminate the dangers from the sources of hazardous energy at a facility.This study first conducts a lithography process hazard analysis and compiles a statistical analysis of the causes of the fires and losses at high-tech plants in Taiwan since 1996, the aim being to establish the necessary improvement measures by using the Fire Dynamics Simulation (FDS) to solve relevant problems. The researchers also investigate the lithography process machine in order to explore carriage improvement measures, and analyse the fires' causes and reactive materials hazardous properties, from 1996 to 2012. The effective improvement measures are established based on the accident statistics. The study site is a 300mm wafer fabrication plant located in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan.After the completion of the annual maintenance jobs improvement from September 2011 to December 2012, the number of lithography process accidents was reduced from 6 to 1. The accident rate was significantly reduced and there were no staff time losses for a continuous 6882h. It is confirmed that the plant safety level has been effectively enhanced. The researchers offer safety design recommendations regarding transport process appliances, chemical storage tanks, fume cupboard devices, chemical rooms, pumping equipment, transportation pipelines, valve manual box (VMB) process machines and liquid waste discharge lines. These recommendations can be applied in these industries to enhance the safety level of high-tech plants, facilities or process systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemical supply system; Failure mode & effective analysis (FMEA); Fire dynamics simulation (FDS); Inherently safer design (ISD); Photolithography","Chemical storage tanks; Chemical supply systems; Effective analysis; Fire dynamics simulation; Hsin-chu science parks; Inherently safer design; Maintenance procedures; Transportation pipelines; Accident prevention; Accidents; Chemical equipment; Economics; Maintenance; Materials properties; Photolithography; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896749120

Post-treatment including stabilization at 250 C and carbonization at 800 C converted electrospun fibers to bonded carbon nanofibers. The formation of interconnected carbon nanofibers was attributed to the decomposition of PB, which reduced the viscosity of nanofibers and caused the fusion of connecting points. As a result, the conductive pathways developed, leading to an increase in both the electrical conductivity and microcrystallite size. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the specific capacitance of the 90:10 PAN/PAN-co-PB derived carbon nanofibers was 170.2 F/g, which was about 24% higher than that of the neat PAN-derived carbon nanofibers.

In particular, consumption and production of natural gas have intensified, and more infrastructures for its transport and importation have been built. In addition, recent discoveries (such as the huge natural gas volumes located in offshore fields) and new research into unconventional deposits indicate a rise in Brazil's proven natural gas reserves in the near future. However, Brazil lacks the geological or underground storage facilities to support its rapidly expanding gas industry, as well as important tools for meeting fluctuating demand and production and improving supply security. To assess the required storage capacity for Brazil, it is useful to analyze the international experience, clarifying the development of several aspects of the gas industry in gas storing nations. To this end, we investigated the relationships between storage and various characteristics of the gas sector by linear regression analysis. The research, conducted on all 38 countries with operational underground natural gas storage, evaluated the extent to which storage capacity is affected by proven reserves, production, consumption, infrastructure, total gas imports and exports, and the use of natural gas as a percentage of total national energy consumption. A very strong relationship emerged between underground natural gas working storage capacity and gas consumption (R2=0.8825) and gas infrastructure (R2=0.9130). Another important relationship was identified between storage and gas production volume (R2=0.8239). The remaining aspects did not significantly affect the development of gas storage activity. We estimated the deviations between the values calculated by the linear regression equations and those reported in the technical literature. The errors varied from 89.1%, when all 38 countries were involved, to 31.4%, considering the 13 nations with the highest working gas storage capacities. The average deviation was significantly higher for the 12 nations with little storage capacity (as high as 288%); excluding these 12 countries, the average error reduced to 37.4%. Thus, the equations obtained by the correlations more accurately predicted the outcome in countries with higher storage capacity. The large deviations for countries such as Argentina, China, and Sweden are discussed. Finally, the required storage for the Brazilian gas sector was determined at two intervals: (i) 0.34-9.22billionm3, based on the error of 89.1%, and (ii) 1.98-6.70billionm3, based on the deviation of 37.4%. It is important to mention that high errors were expected, since gas storage depends on factors such as geology and demand seasonality, which were not considered in this work, but which could be analyzed in future researches. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Gas industry aspects; Linear regression; Underground natural gas storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894809119

The solution of 1:4.6 ratio HF and ethanol at low current densities (10 and 20 mA/cm2) allows the best control over selective etching of Si forming amorphous and ordered carbon on the SiC surface. The presence of an intense G band of graphitic carbon in Raman spectra and high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis indicate formation of ordered carbon on the surface of SiC.

Moreover, pipelines or metal containers may contain some metal ions because of inner corrosive chemicals or surface deterioration, which may induce a chemical reaction, while TMCH is mixed with them. To avoid these unexpected chemical reactions, we focused on the thermal hazard analysis of TMCH mixed with metal ions, such as nickel(II) bromide or copper(II) bromide.

Non-isothermal experimental results combined with isoconversional kinetic analysis can acquire further safety parameters, such as apparent activation energy (E a) and time to maximum heating rate. The results of this study could be used as a proactive case for the storage of TMCH mixed with metal ions. © 2014 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","1,1-bis(tert-Butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane (TMCH); Apparent activation energy (E a); Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Heat of decomposition (ΔH d); Time to maximum heating rate (TMR)","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Calorimeters; Calorimetry; Chemical activation; Chemical analysis; Chemical hazards; Chemical reactions; Containers; Crosslinking; Decomposition; Differential scanning calorimetry; Heating rate; Indicators (chemical); Isotherms; Metal ions; Pipelines; Polybutadienes; Thermodynamic stability; 1,1-bis(tert-Butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane (TMCH); Apparent activation energy; Heat of decomposition; Isoconversional kinetic analysis; Non-isothermal condition; Polybutadiene rubbers; Thermokinetic parameters; Time to maximum heating rate (TMR); Metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910141091

The memory devices exhibited a high ON/OFF ratio of over 106 and a long retention time of over 105 seconds. The resistive switching mechanism was investigated using the high-angle dark field transmission electron microscopy image of Al/gelatin/ITO devices in the pristine high-resistance state (HRS) and then in returning to HRS after the RESET process. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed the aggregation of N and Al elements and the simultaneous presence of carbon and oxygen elements in the rupture of filament paths. Furthermore, via a current-sensing atomic force microscopy, we found that conduction paths in the ON-state are distributed in a highly localized area, which is associated with a carbon-rich filamentary switching mechanism. These results support that the chelation of N binding with Al ions improves the conductivity of the low-resistance state but not the production of metal filaments. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","chelate effect; filamentary theory; gelatin; memory; resistive switching","Aluminum; Atomic force microscopy; Carbon; Chelation; Data storage equipment; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; Chelate effects; Current-sensing atomic force microscopies; Dark-field transmission electron microscopy; Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy; filamentary theory; gelatin; Non-volatile memory application; Resistive switching; Switching systems; aluminum; gelatin; gelatin film; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; equipment design; transmission electron microscopy; Aluminum; Equipment Design; Gelatin; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899579071

However, they generally exhibit poor energy storage ability at high current densities due to their insulating nature. Nickel-cobalt-aluminum LHs are synthesized and chemically treated to form LHs with enhanced conductivity that results in greatly enhanced rate performances. The key role of chemical treatment is to enable the partial conversion of Co2+ to a more conductive Co3+ state that stimulates charge transfers. Simultaneously, the defects on the LHs caused by the selective etching of Al promoted the electrolyte diffusion within LHs. As a result, the LHs show a high specific capacitance of 738 F g-1 at 30 A g -1, which is 57.2% of 1289 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The strategy provides a facile and effective method to achieve high performance LHs for supercapacitor electrode materials. The electrochemically redox-active, transition-metal-containing hydroxides (Co and Ni) have high specific capacitances, which are favorable for high energy density storage. However, the intrinsic low electric conductivity restricts the performance at high power densities.

Therefore, this work provides a promising approach for the design and synthesis of structure tunable materials with largely enhanced supercapacitor behavior, which can be potentially applied in energy storage devices. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In this paper, lab-scale test facilities have been built to understand the mechanisms of heat charging and discharging processes. The facilities consist of a direct/indirect-contact thermal energy storage container, heat transfer oil (HTO)/water tanks, an electrical boiler, HTO/water pumps and a plate heat exchanger. The organic phase change material (PCM), erythritol, which is sugar alcohol, was chosen as the working material due to its large heat density (330. kJ/kg) and suitable melting point (118. °C) for industrial low-temperature heat recovery, as well as non toxic and corrosive. Although differential scanning calorimetry tests have shown that a large temperature range exists during the phase change of erythritol, it did not affect the heat discharging during the tests of system performance. Heat charging/discharging results show that for the direct-contact storage container, heat discharging process is much faster than charging process. At the initial stage of heat charging, heat transfer oil is blocked to enter the container, resulting in a slow charging rate. Meanwhile, the PCM attached on the container wall on the bottom always melts last. It has been found that increasing the flow rate of HTO can effectively enhance the charging/discharging processes. For the indirect-contact storage container, heat charging and discharging take almost the same time; and the flow rate of HTO does not show an obvious effect on the charging and discharging processes due to the weak thermal conductivity of the solid phase change material. Comparatively, using the direct-contact storage container may achieve shorter charging/discharging processes than using the indirect-contact storage container. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Direct-contact; Indirect-contact; Industrial waste recovery; Mobilized thermal energy storage system; Phase change","Differential scanning calorimetry; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Oil tanks; Phase change materials; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Charging/discharging; Direct contact; Indirect contact; Low temperature heat recovery; Phase Change; Plate heat exchangers; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal energy systems; Storage (materials); alcohol; calorimetry; experimental study; heat flux; industrial waste; phase transition; recycling; storage structure; sugar; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893010381

The 1T1R ReRAM [1-3] fits embedded applications requiring fast read (RD) access time (T AC) and low RD-VDDMIN, particularly for devices powered by batteries or energy harvesters. The cross-point ReRAM [4-6] is meant for high capacities with high RD-VDDMIN and slow TAC. As devices shrink, ReRAMs have higher cell resistance (R) and greater variations in write time and R, which reduces the R-ratio (RH/RL) between the high-R state (HRS, RH) and low-R state (LRS, RL). ReRAM also have a high RL, which enables a larger voltage drop across ReRAM to reduce write voltage and cell-switch (CS) size. Thus, ReRAM macro designs suffer: (1) small sensing margin (SM), limited RD-VDDMIN, and slow TAC due to high-RL and small R-ratio; (2) increase in energy due to large set DC-current (IDC-SET) resulting from wide set-time (TSET) distribution. This study develops a swing-sample-and-couple (SSC) voltage-mode sense amplifier (VSA) to overcome (1), enabling 1.8× greater SM for lower RD-VDDMIN and 1.7× faster TAC across various VDD, compared to conventional differential-input (CD) VSAs. To reduce &gt;99% set energy, we use a 4T self-boost-write-termination (SBWT) scheme to cut off IDC-SET of faster-TSET devices, with an area penalty below 0.5%. A fabricated 28nm 1Mb ReRAM macro achieves TAC = 404ns at VDD = 0.27V and confirms the IDC-SET cut-off by SBWT. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Cell resistance; Embedded application; Energy Harvester; High capacity; Non-volatile memory; Resistive rams (ReRAM); Sense amplifier; Sensing margin; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898075711

It is highly important to be able to produce these materials in large quantities for practical applications. The only method capable of large-scale production is the oxidative treatment of graphite to graphene oxide, followed by its consequent reduction. We describe a scalable method for a one-step doping of graphene with phosphorus, with a simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide. Such a method is able to introduce significant amount of dopant (3.65 at. %). Phosphorus-doped graphene is characterized in detail and shows important electronic and electrochemical properties. The electrical conductivity of phosphorus-doped graphene is much higher than that of undoped graphene, owing to a large concentration of free carriers. Such a graphene material is expected to find useful applications in electronic, energy storage, and sensing devices.

However the use of hydrogen in vehicles at pressures much higher than those applicable in natural gas cars still requires safety and performance studies with respect to the verification and validation of the existing standards and regulations. The JRC-IET has developed a facility, GasTeF, for carrying out tests on full-scale high pressure vehicle's tanks for hydrogen or natural gas. A typical test performed in GasTeF is the hydrogen cycling, in which tanks are filled and slowly emptied using hydrogen pressurised up to 88 MPa, for at least 1000 times in line with the requirements of the EU regulation on type-approval of hydrogen-powered motor vehicles. The temperature evolution of the gas inside and outside the tank is monitored using a thermocouples array system specifically designed for this purpose.

In this context, this study provides a way of determining an adaptive threshold that allows the segmentation of voltage or current signals based on Wavelets decomposition. The disturbances considered in this work were the short-duration voltage variations, impulsive and oscillatory transients, and harmonic distortions. The signals were synthetically generated. Moreover, white noise was added on the signals. Thus, a Symlet Wavelet was applied to the signals in order to denoise them. In the sequence, a Daubechies Wavelet was used to decompose the filtered signals. So, to determine the initial and final points of each segment, an adaptive threshold was established based on the energy and entropy of energy for the second level of decomposition. Thus, the number and position of each segment were determined according to the intersections of the detail curves and the thresholds found. © 2014, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Depletion of fossil fuels and impacts of global warming caused widespread attention using renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar energies. Energy security under varying weather conditions and the corresponding system cost are the two major issues in designing hybrid power generation systems. In this paper, the match evaluation method (MEM) is developed based on renewable energy supply/demand match evaluation criteria to size the proposed system in lowest cost. This work is undertaken with triple objective function: inequality coefficient, correlation coefficient, and annualized cost of system. It provides optimum capacity of as many numbers of supplies as required to match with a load demand in lowest investment, so it can handle large-scale design problems. Meteorological data were collected from the city of Zabol, located in south-east of Iran, as a case study. Six types of wind turbine and also six types of PV modules, with different output powers and costs, are considered for this optimization procedure. A battery storage system is used to even out irregularities in meteorological data. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm has been used for the prediction of an optimized set of design based on the MEM technique. The results of this study are valuable for evaluating the performance of future stand-alone hybrid power system. It is worth mentioning that the proposed methodology can be effectively employed for any composition of hybrid energy systems in any locations taking into account the meteorological data and the consumer’s demand. © 2014, The Author(s).","Electricity match rate (EMR); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Match evaluation method (MEM); Sizing study",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979975701

Despite numerous favorable properties, the development of this biodegradable plastic for commercialization is slowed down by its comparably higher production cost compared to synthetic plastics. Extensive efforts have been directed towards lowering the cost of production in order to make this bioplastic competitive with conventional plastics. The strategies taken include the development of ""super bugs"" capable of maximizing the production of PHA from the carbon feedstock fed, identification of inexpensive, renewable and non-food grade carbon sources and the implementation of various efficient fermentation and extraction procedures. Among the more than 300 PHA producers identified, only a few of them are suitable candidates for large scale PHA production. This review highlights the most extensively-studied PHA producers and summarizes the advantages of using them for PHA production. The use of genetically engineered microbes that confer benefits that are not found in wild type strain has become increasingly important. Examples on the expression of PHA biosynthetic enzymes in recombinant microorganism for the metabolic engineering of PHA are also discussed.

Nevertheless, the amount of power harvested by the implanted receiver is sensitive to the distance and orientation of the external transmitting transducer attached to the skin with respect to the implanted receiving transducer. This paper describes an ultrasonic power transfer link whose harvested power is controlled by an inductive link. A small (5 μF) storage capacitor voltage, which is part of the implanted unit, is allowed to swing between 3.8 and 3.5 V using hysteretic control. The two control states are indicated by excitation (while the implanted storage capacitor voltage decreases) or the absence of excitation of an implanted coil that is magnetically coupled to an external coil attached to the skin surface.

A coupled surface energy balance-snow model simulates surface melt and the evolution of subsurface density, temperature, and water content. The inverse problem consists of iteratively calibrating accumulation, serving as input for the model, by finding a match between modeled and observed radar travel times. The inverse method is applied to a 16 km GPR transect on Nordenskiöldbreen, Svalbard, yielding annual accumulation patterns for 2007-2012. Accumulation patterns with a mean of 0.75 meter water equivalent (mwe) a-1 contain substantial spatial variability, with a mean annual standard deviation of 0.17 mwe a-1, and show only partial consistency from year to year. In contrast to traditional methods, accounting for melt water percolation, refreezing, and runoff facilitates accurate accumulation reconstruction in areas with substantial melt. Additionally, accounting for horizontal density variability along the transect is shown to reduce spatial variability in reconstructed accumulation, whereas incorporating irreducible water storage lowers accumulation estimates. Correlating accumulation to terrain characteristics in the dominant wind direction indicates a strong preference of snow deposition on leeward slopes, whereas weaker correlations are found with terrain curvature. Sensitivity experiments reveal a nonlinear response of the mass balance to accumulation changes. The related negative impact of small-scale accumulation variability on the mean net mass balance is quantified, yielding a negligible impact in the accumulation zone and a negative impact of -0.09 mwe a-1 in the ablation area. © 2014.

IMC thickness measurement has been carried out to estimate the coefficient of diffusion (D o) and E aa various aging conditions of different EMCs and bonding wires. Apparent activation energies (E aa) of both wire types were investigated after high temperature storage life tests (HTSL) for both molding compounds. Au bonds were identified to have faster IMC formation, compared to slower IMC growth of Cu. The E aa obtained for CuAl IMC diffusion kinetics are 1.08 and 1.04 eV with EMC A and EMC B, respectively. For AuAl IMC diffusion kinetics, the E aa obtained are 1.04 and 0.98 eV, respectively, on EMC A and EMC B. These values are close to previous HTSL studies conducted on Au and Cu ball bonds and are in agreement to the theory of HTSL performance of Au and Cu bonding wires.Overall, EMC B shows slightly lower apparent activation energy (E aa) valueas in CuAl and AuAl IMCs.

The performance is comparable to that of batteries using liquid electrolyte of inorganic salt, and the batteries exhibit excellent cycle life and rate performance. This significant widening of battery operation temperatures coupled with the inherent flexibility and robustness of the SIPE membranes makes it possible to develop thin and flexible Li-ion batteries for a broad range of applications.

However, compared to the fuel-powered vehicles, AFVs such as electric vehicles require frequent recharging of their electrical energy storages (batteries), which results in a short vehicle driving range. Thus, AFV users who want to travel from home to a terminal location and back again must consider whether their AFVs can be recharged on the way. One of the approaches to solve this problem is to install alternative fuel charging stations on suitable locations to provide recharging services. However, when the budget is limited, the selection of locations and the types of alternative fuel charging stations becomes a decision problem, since it will directly affect the number of potential AFV users that can be served. This paper develops a mixed-integer programming model to address this problem and to maximize the number of people who can complete round-trip itineraries. A hybrid heuristic approach is proposed to solve this model.

This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage (HES) composed of lithium-ion batteries and ultracapacitors that can be incorporated in the PV-based system to complement the supply-demand mismatches by using a multimode fuzzy-logic power allocator. The battery used in the HES was modeled based on the experimental data and can accurately reflect the battery dynamics under varying conditions. The power allocator optimally adjusts the power contributions of the batteries and ultracapacitors and exchanges energy between them, thus compensating the supply-demand mismatches without accidentally depleting or saturating the two components. The proposed HES was evaluated in both short- and long-term scenarios. A good ac-side performance in the short-term scenario is observed due to the instant response of the ultracapacitors to the high-frequency requests. In the long-term scenario, the power allocator restrains the frequency fluctuations caused by the supply-demand mismatches within \pm 0.2 Hz, while maintaining the batteries and ultracapacitors in a safe working region. Additionally, the participation of ultracapacitors in supplying high-frequency power is beneficial for relaxing the stress on batteries, and the simulation results show that the lifetime of batteries in the HES can be extended. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; hybrid energy storage (HES); lithium-ion battery modeling; photovoltaic (PV) generation; ultracapacitor","Frequency fluctuation; High frequency HF; High-frequency power; Hybrid energy storage; Lithium-ion battery; Photovoltaic arrays; Photovoltaic generation; Ultracapacitors; Energy storage; Fuzzy logic; Land vehicle propulsion; Lithium batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Sun; Capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898018141

Annealing leads to remarkable changes in the structure and properties of the copolymer, within the first four hours of treatment, and with kinetics depending on the temperature. The crystallinity increases by 19% (relative), resulting in a 10 K increase in the Curie transition, a 4 K increase of the melting temperature and a 2 K decrease in the glass transition temperature. A crystalline phase transition from the paraelectric α-phase to the ferroelectric β-phase is also evidenced using in-situ X-ray diffraction. The elastic modulus is found to increase by more than three-fold at room temperature and the loss peak at the glass transition is considerably reduced. The piezoelectric coefficient is found to increase by 40% and the dielectric properties are significantly changed. The most remarkable influence is the ten-fold reduction of the oxygen permeability, with a drastic reduction of the activation energy for oxygen transport. The improvement in oxygen barrier properties of the annealed copolymer is attributed to the restricted mobility of oxygen molecules in the semicrystalline polymer with nanometer sized crystallites. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The noise data was analysed using wavelet transform. The results were represented in energy diagrams and showed that considerable changes occurred in the corrosion mechanism during the initial step of the experiment (until 7200 s). During this initial step, it was observed that the corrosion was predominantly localized by means of pitting formation and intergranular corrosion. After approximately 50,000 s (14 h) of immersion, general corrosion processes become dominant. The conclusions obtained from the analysis of the current noise signal using the wavelet transform were confirmed by optical micrograph which suggests that the coupling of electrochemical noise and optical microscopy techniques can be valuable in studying corrosion processes in this system. Another advantage of this procedure is the elucidation and separation of corrosion processes, such as, for example, pitting and intergranular ones, that are not commonly identified by other techniques. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Corrosion; Electrochemical noise; Seawater; Wavelets","Corrosion; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Pitting; Textures; Corrosion mechanisms; Corrosion process; Electrochemical noise; General corrosion; Intergranular corrosion; Microscopy technique; Optical micrographs; Wavelets; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897506984

Hydrogen is presented as new energy sources during the last years which can be utilized instead of fossil fuel. One of the most promising clean methods of obtaining hydrogen is using renewable sources like wind and solar energy via electrolysis. In present work, a techno-economic evaluation of wind-hydrogen hybrid system (wind turbine, electrolysis, and PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) fuel cell) in household size will be considered. In order to save the extra energy of wind turbine, electrolysis is used to convert this energy into hydrogen chemical energy. Generated hydrogen is stored in hydrogen storage tank. PEM fuel cell is applied to convert chemical energy of hydrogen into electrical power with high efficiency when extra power is required. Results show that wind energy in Manjil and Binaloud (two cities which have wind power plant in Iran) has greater wind speed in comparison with other cities. Also result shows that in standalone application, the size of wind turbine is bigger than the on-grid one to supply the full load consumption and it makes the standalone application too expensive. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Exergy and economic analysis; PEM fuel cell; Wind-hydrogen hybrid system","Electric power transmission networks; Electrolysis; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Polyelectrolytes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar energy; Wind power; Wind turbines; Fuel cell hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage tank; New energy sources; PEM fuel cell; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Standalone applications; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economic evaluation; Economic analysis; consumption behavior; cost-benefit analysis; energy resource; exergy; fossil fuel; fuel cell; polymer; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; wind turbine; Binaloud; Gilan; Iran; Manjil; Razavi Khorasan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895923264

Three common solders (Sn37Pb, Sn36Pb2Ag, and Sn3Ag0.5Cu) were used to conduct several experiments testing the quality of the solder joints in this study. Accelerated tests were performed to determine the long-term reliability of the solder joints. The storage temperatures were 100, 120, 150, and 180±1 C for various aging durations. The results showed that the sintered Ag electrode gradually transformed into an Ag3Sn intermetallic compound (IMC), and the growth kinetics of Ag3Sn remained a diffusion-controlled process during isothermal aging. The formation of Ag 3Sn increased the series resistances (RS) of the cell modules because Ag3Sn had a higher electrical resistivity than sintered Ag did. In addition, the results revealed that Sn3Ag 0.5Cu PV ribbon effectively slowed down the growth kinetics of Ag3Sn.

Using energy storage facilities with a non-firm connection strategy is the key to maximum integration of distant wind farms into a transmission-constrained power system. In this paper, we explore the application of energy storage in optimal allocation of wind capacity to a power system from distant wind sites. Energy storage decreases transmission connection requirements, smoothes the wind farm output and decreases the wind energy curtailments in a non-firm wind capacity allocation strategy. Specifically, we examine the use of compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology to supplement wind farms and downsize the transmission connection requirements. Benders decomposition approach is applied to decompose this computationally challenging and large-scale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) into smaller problems. The simulation results show that using energy storage systems can decrease the variation of wind farms output as well as the total cost, including investment and operation costs, and increase the wind energy penetration into the power system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Benders decomposition; Energy storage systems; Power generation planning; Wind energy","Benders decomposition; Compressed air energy storage; Connection requirements; Energy storage systems; Mixed-integer linear programming; Power generation planning; Storage facilities; Wind energy curtailments; Compressed air; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Industry; Linear programming; Optimization; Stochastic programming; Wind power; Electric power transmission; energy planning; linear programing; power generation; wind farm; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888061697

This particular rectifier arrangement consists of a full rated diode bridge rectifier and a partially rated two-level voltage source auxiliary converter. This combination helps achieve power conversion at medium voltage with low voltage switching devices, improve current quality through pulse width modulation (PWM) operation and smoothen the dc-link voltage by transferring the ripples to the dc-side of the auxiliary converter. Moreover, this topology can be extended by replacing the two-level auxiliary converter with a multilevel converter such as diode-clamped three-level converter to achieve higher voltage levels and better power quality requirements. Apart from that, there is a possibility of interfacing energy storage devices through the dc-side of the auxiliary converter to mitigate power fluctuations. Control strategies and modulation techniques that are specific to the topology for different operating scenarios are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink.

This processing route is presented as a powerful tool to reduce the activation time for Mg hydrogenation samples with no need to introduce any additives. Mg samples were extensively processed by CR and CR + HEBM and their effects on the microstructure and hydrogen storage properties were studied. The Mg samples processed by CR + HEBM presented refined microstructure (grain sizes around 4-7 nm), strong texture and are certainly free of oxide layer formation.

In the present work crystal growth in GexSb100-x thin films with x = 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 is studied in detail, demonstrating that the crystallization temperature increases from ∼80 °C for Ge6Sb94 to ∼200°C for Ge10Sb90 and simultaneously the activation energy for crystal growth also significantly increases from 1.7 eV to 5.5 eV. The most interesting new finding is that in the thin films containing 8, 9, and 10 at% Ge two competing growth modes occur which can have several orders of magnitude difference in growth rate at a single external temperature: an initial mode with isotropic slow growth producing circular crystals with smooth surfaces and growth fronts and a fast growth mode producing crystals with triangular shape having rough surfaces and growth fronts indicative of dendritic-like growth. The slow-growth mode becomes increasingly dominant for crystallization at low temperatures when the Ge concentration is increased from 8 to 10 at% Ge. For a certain Ge concentration, the slow growth mode becomes increasingly dominant at lower temperatures and the fast growth mode at higher temperatures. Latent heat produced during crystallization is considered a principal factor explaining the observations. The fast growth mode is associated with (eutectic) decomposition generating more latent heat and instable growth fronts and the slow growth mode is associated with thermodynamically less stable homogeneously alloyed crystals generating less latent heat, but stable growth fronts. Two competing crystal growth modes occur in thin films composed of Ge8Sb92, Ge9Sb91 and Ge 10Sb90: an initial isotropic slow growth mode is followed by a fast dendritic-like growth mode producing crystals with an overall triangular shape.

In the two-step synthesis, presynthesized Sn nanoparticles act as a low-melting-point catalyst for decomposing the Ge precursor, bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amido]Ge(II), and for crystallization of Ge via solution-liquid-solid growth mechanism. Creation of such Sn-Ge nanoheterodimers can serve as a well-controlled method of mixing these nearly immiscible chemical elements for the purpose of obtaining Sn-Ge nanocomposite electrodes for high-energy density Li-ion batteries. Comparable mass content of Sn and Ge leads to synergistic effects in electrochemical performance: high charge storage capacity above 1000 mAh g-1 at a relatively high current density of 1 A g-1 is due to high theoretical capacity of Ge, while high rate capability is presumably caused by the enhancement of electronic transport by metallic Sn. At a current density of 4 A g-1, Sn-Ge nanocomposite electrodes retain up to 80% of the capacity obtained at a lower current density of 0.2 A g-1.

In the present study, the solid-liquid phase diagrams of three binary systems of 1-tetradecanol. +. dodecanoic acid, 1-hexadecanol. +. tetradecanoic acid and 1-octadecanol. +. hexadecanoic acid were determined by differential scanning calorimetry.

The experimental data showed that the systems present eutectic transitions and some of them exhibit partial solid phase miscibility. The liquid phase activity coefficients were calculated by Margules 2 and 3-suffix and by UNIFAC and UNIFAC-Dortmund methods. The modeling approach resulted in an accurate prediction, with average absolute deviations from experimental data lower than 1.16. K.

According to the operation records of the installed wind farms, Penghu has bettter wind conditions than any other site in Taiwan. The total capacity of wind farms in Penghu reaches up to 10.2MW, which means 35% penetration on wind power is possible during minimum load. The high level of wind power generation in the Penghu power system makes the decision of diesel unit commitment and control of the power system more difficult due to the high variability of wind power output in a time frame ranging from seconds to hours. This work investigates the significant factors that affect the system transient stability as high penetration of wind power is integrated. Additionally, the possible impact and coping strategies for the high wind power penetration are studied, and several specific suggestions are proposed to Taiwan Power Company. These strategies include revising the load shedding methods, unit commitment scheduling, wind turbine operation, the suitable energy storage system planning, and wind turbine protection. © 2014 IEEE.","Diesel-Wind Hybrid System; Penetration; Penghu Island; Transient Stability; Wind Farm","Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Hybrid systems; Stability; System stability; Wind power; Wind turbines; Energy storage systems; Penetration; Penghu Island; Taiwan power companies; Unit commitment scheduling; Variability of wind power; Wind farm; Wind hybrids; Electric load shedding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983209103

An adapted low-carbon generation expansion planning model (GEP) was applied to determine the least-cost decision. Based on the scenario analysis, we conclude with the following findings. First, technically, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is indispensable to help China achieve a high-degree CO2 reduction in the power sector, but it results in a slight increase in fuel consumption. Second, the cost competitiveness of CCS technology increases with the CO2 price and exceeds the cost competitiveness of renewable energy power technologies at certain points. Hence, CCS facilitates a cost-effective decarbonization when CO2 price is introduced. Third, the share of renewable energy generation slightly varies at around 42% across the scenarios, which almost achieves the production limit. A heavy reliance of CO2 reduction on renewable energy generation is not technically and economically effective for China. © 2014 IEEE.","China; CO2 price; generation expansion planning; Low-carbon generation technologies; power decarbonization","Carbon dioxide; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Fuel storage; Renewable energy resources; Carbon capture and storage; China; CO2 price; Cost competitiveness; Generation expansion planning; Generation technologies; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy power; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936980957

Fungal laccase, potassium octocyanomolibdate (4 +) and atmospheric oxygen served as catalyst, redox-mediator and terminal oxidant, respectively. The structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of composites with different PANI content were investigated. The energy storage of enzymatically obtained composite consists of an electrical double layer capacitance as well as pseudocapacitance of conducting polymer. The obtained PANI/MWCNT composite with PANI content ca. 49 wt.% had high specific capacitance and cycle stability during doping/dedoping. The specific capacitance of this composite measured by cyclic voltammetry technique with potential scan rate of 5 mV/s was ca. 440 F/g. The specific capacitance of the composite decreased by less than 7% of its maximum value after 1000 scan cycles between -0.1 and 0.7 V. Supercapacitor (SC) shell was made from flexible adhesive tape (regular Scotch tape) and current collector was formed after its separation from the surface of graphite foil. The ethanol dispersion of PANI/MWCNT composite was deposited on the current collector surface. The gel polymer electrolyte (polyvinyl alcohol in 1 M phosphoric acid) was employed as both electrolyte medium and separator. The energy and power densities under an operating window of 0.7 V were ca. 7.03 Wh/kg and 5.2 kW/kg, respectively. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, to detect M-PAM signals reliably, the requirement of accurate channel state information is more stringent. Previously, for OOK systems, we have developed a receiver that requires few pilot symbols and can jointly detect the data sequence and estimate the unknown channel gain implicitly. In this paper, using the same approach, we extend our previous work and derive a generalized receiver for M-PAM systems. A Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm coupled with a selective-store strategy is adopted, resulting in a low implementation complexity and a low memory requirement. Therefore, the receiver is efficient in terms of energy, spectra, implementation complexity and memory. Using theoretical analysis, we show that its error performance approaches that of maximum likelihood detection with perfect knowledge of the channel gain, as the observation window length increases. Also, simulation results are presented to justify the theoretical analysis. © 2014 IEEE.","Free space optical (FSO); Intensity modulation / direct detection (IM/DD); Maximum likelihood detection; Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM); Sequence detection","Amplitude modulation; Associative storage; Channel state information; Communication channels (information theory); Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Modulation; Optical communication; Viterbi algorithm; Free-space optical; Intensity modulation direct detection; Maximum likelihood detection; Pulse amplitude modulations (PAM); Sequence detection; Pulse amplitude modulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946686556

Samples of pure MgH2 and MgH 2-mixtures containing 2 mol% of FeF3 were processed under air atmosphere and their effects on the microstructure and the hydrogen storage properties were studied in detail. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis on all samples revealed crystallite sizes in the nanometer range for the beta-MgH 2 and FeF3 phases (beta (beta): ∼8-13 nm and FeF 3: ∼16-21 nm). No extra crystallite size reduction was observed for the HEBM + CR samples in comparison with those only cold rolled. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluation together with elemental composition analysis indicated a finer size distribution of additive particles and also a more intimate level of mixing for the HEBM + CR mixture than for the mixture obtained only by CR. These features were associated with the HEBM step applied before the CR. These characteristics led to a lower hydrogen desorption temperatures and enhanced desorption kinetics behavior for the HEBM + CR samples in comparison with the CR samples. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The insulator usage is to reduce the heat transfer between two medium and the capability is measured by its heat flow resistance. The bigger the value, the more blocking capacity or insulating it provides. It is needed to find optimal material to energy conversion at the same time reduce the waste generation. Therefore, a small-scale experimental testing of natural cooling process of an insulated tank within a confined room without any forced cooling system, e.g. fan. The testing is repeated by changing the insulator using the potential waste material from natural and industrial waste. The analysis is performed on the relationship between heat loss and the reserved period by the insulator. The results represent the percentage of period of the insulated tank withstand the heat compared to non-insulated tank, e.g. cotton reserved the period of 19% more than non-insulated tank to withstand the heat transfer of water to the surrounding. The paper finally justifies that cotton is the most potential waste material as an insulator in water. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Insulator; Thermal storage; Waste material","Blocking capacity; Experimental testing; Insulator; Optimal materials; Potential wastes; Technological development; Thermal storage; Waste generation; Cotton; Energy conversion; Heat transfer; Industrial engineering; Insulating materials; Tanks (containers); Wastes; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896832627

Since only a small fraction (&lt;10%) of the incident solar energy is reflected and/or transmitted, a large fraction of the solar radiation is converted into heat. If this heat can be harvested as well, the overall energy efficiency of such an integrated photovoltaic thermal (PVT) hybrid system will be greatly improved. At the same time, pumping water through the PV modules will cool (if Twater &lt; Tmodule) the solar cells and improve their electricity production efficiency. This article describes the design and numerical simulation of a PVT system for producing electricity and hot water in a student hostel in Singapore. The nominal electrical power output is 10 kW p (kilowatt peak). Thermal models were developed based on basic energy balance equations and average climatic conditions for Singapore over a typical year were used. A survey of the hot water usage pattern over a typical week was carried out and used in the simulation. The optimum mass flow rate in the collectors is found to be 0.039 kg/(s m2) and the optimum storage tank capacity for hot water is 2500 kg for a showering load of around 6000 kg/day. The average thermal and electrical efficiency of the system are 43% and 12%, respectively.

In the present study we studied leptin storage and secretion regulation in 3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes. Leptin is stored in membrane-bound vesicles that are localized predominantly in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and close to the plasma membrane of both 3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes. Insulin increases leptin secretion as early as 15 min without affecting the leptin mRNA level. Interestingly, treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and the ER-Golgi trafficking blocker Brefeldin A inhibit both basal and ISLS (insulin-stimulated leptin secretion), suggesting that insulin stimulates leptin secretion by up-regulating leptin synthesis and that leptin-containing vesicles go through the ER-Golgi route. The PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt, but not MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), pathway is involved in ISLS in vitro and in vivo. Although Ca 2+ triggers synaptic vesicle and secretory granule exocytosis, Ca2+ influx alone is not sufficient to induce leptin secretion. Remarkably, Ca2+ is required for ISLS possibly due to its involvement in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation.We conclude that insulin stimulates leptin release through the PI3K/Akt pathway and that Ca2+ is required for robust Akt phosphorylation and leptin secretion. © The Authors Journal compilation © 2014 Biochemical Society.","Akt; Ca2+; Insulin; Leptin; Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); Primary adipocyte; Secretion","brefeldin A; calcium; cycloheximide; insulin; leptin; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; adipocyte; animal cell; article; calcium transport; cell membrane; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum; energy balance; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; exocytosis; Golgi complex; hormonal regulation; hormone release; hormone synthesis; in vitro study; in vivo study; leptin secretion; leptin synthesis; male; membrane vesicle; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; secretory granule; signal transduction; synapse vesicle; upregulation; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes, White; Animals; Calcium; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Enzyme Activation; Golgi Apparatus; Insulin; Leptin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Protein Transport; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Secretory Vesicles; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896894616

Their high power and energy density could improve the performance indices of the vehicle, provided that an optimal energy management strategy is employed that could handle systems with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). The majority of existing energy management strategies is limited to a single DOF and the small body of work on multi-DOF systems is mainly heuristic-based. We propose an optimal solution to the energy management problem in fuel-cell hybrid vehicles with dual storage buffer for fuel economy in a standard driving cycle using multi-dimensional dynamic programming (MDDP). An efficient MDDP code is developed using MATLAB™'s vectorization feature that helps reduce the inherently high computational cost of MDDP. Results of multiple simulated experiments are presented to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed strategy. A comparison is also made between a single and a double buffer fuel-cell hybrid vehicle in various driving cycles to determine the maximum reduction in fuel consumption that can be achieved by the addition of an ultra-capacitor. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This is because while DNA molecules functionalize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via π-π stacking, their hydrophilic sugar-phosphate backbones also promote the dispersion of CNTs. The resultant CNTs@DNA chains can link multiple MnO2 spheres to form a networked architecture that facilitates charge transfer and effective MnO2 utilization.

Due to the characteristics of the PV module and the DC-bus, the single power stage must provide low current ripple in the input and output terminals, must operate with output current and voltage regulation and present a high voltage conversion ratio. To achieve such features, this paper proposes a novel boost-Zeta integrated converter. The analysis of the operation of this converter is carried out in details. The MPPT algorithm and the charging method are discussed in detail. The DC-DC converter is designed to ensure low ripple and limited charging current, as well as voltage regulation when the batteries are fully charged. In this version of the paper, simulation results are presented for the converters confirming the theoretical analysis. In final version of the paper, experimental results will be presented. © 2014 IEEE.","Battery charging method; DC-DC converter; Maximum power point tracking MPPT; PV Module Integrated","Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Energy resources; HVDC power transmission; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Voltage regulators; Distributed renewable energy resources; Future renewable electric energy delivery and managements (FREEDM); Integrated converters; Integrated systems; Low current ripples; Maximum Power Point Tracking; PV modules; Storage capability; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946688415

Thus, the use of energy storage in conjunction with these generation sources can minimize problems caused by the intermittency of the primary source (sun, wind, etc.). Among the various options, the energy storage in form of hydrogen has been very promising. This paper deals with the analysis of fuel cells (FC) to be integrated with energy storage power plants using hydrogen. Initially a simulation is performed using the electrochemical model of the FC. Next, some practical data are obtained using FC with the same parameters used in the simulation. Thus, it is possible to validate the model by comparing practical and theoretical results, by getting the actual FCs performance and operation data. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Alternative source; Electrochemical modeling; Energy storage plant; Fuel cell integration; Intermittency; Primary sources; Fuel cell power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946685203

However, a hurdle in their utilization is that typically, large amounts of such nanostructured materials are required. Gas-phase coating using atomic layer deposition (ALD, a variant of chemical vapour deposition) can be used to provide the surface of a particle with either an ultrathin continuous coating or a decoration of nanoclusters. When carried out in a fluidized bed, ALD is an attractive way of producing nanostructured particles with excellent scale-up potential. We demonstrate the fabrication of catalysts by deposition of the active phase (Pt) on fluidized nanoparticles (TiO2 P25) at atmospheric pressure. We show that ALD is a technique that 1) guarantees efficient use of the precursor; 2) allows precise control of the size and loading; 3) can be used for low and medium loading of catalysts by adjusting the number of repeated cycles; 4) leads to high-quality (low impurities level) end-product. ©2014 Hosokawa Powder Technology Foundation.","Atomic layer deposition; Catalyst; Clusters; Nanostructured particles; Platinum; Titania","Chemical vapour deposition; Clusters; Core-shell nanoparticles; Energy conversion and storages; Nanostructured particles; Precise control; Scalable production; Titania; Atmospheric pressure; Catalysts; Chemical vapor deposition; Coatings; Deposition; Energy conversion; Fluidization; Fluidized beds; Nanoparticles; Platinum; Titanium dioxide; Atomic layer deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897730563

The studied scale of the SNG plant is a thermal input of 100 MWth,LHV to the gasifier at a moisture content of 20 wt-% with a preceding drying step reducing the biomass' natural moisture content of 50 wt-%. Preparation of the CO2-rich stream for carbon capture and storage is investigated for the amine-based absorption and the membrane-based separation technology alternatives. The resulting cold gas efficiency ηcg for the investigated process alternatives ranges between 0.65 and 0.695. The overall system efficiency ηsys ranges from 0.744 to 0.793, depending on both the separation technology and the background energy system. Amine-based absorption gives the highest cold gas efficiency whereas the potential for cogeneration of electricity from the process' excess heat is higher for membrane-based separation and pressure swing adsorption. The estimated specific production costs for SNG cSNG for a process input of 90.3 MWth,LHV at 50 wt-% moisture vary between 103-127 €2010/MWhSNG. The corresponding production subsidy level csubsidy needed to achieve end-user purchase price-parity with fossil natural gas is in the range of 56-78 €2010/MWhSNG depending on both the energy market scenario and the CO2 separation technology. Sensitivity analysis on the influence of changes in the total capital cost for the SNG plant on the production cost indicates a decrease of about 12% assuming a 30% reduction in total capital investment. Capture and storage of biogenic CO2 - if included in the emission trading system - only becomes an option at higher CO2 charges. This is due to increased investment costs but, in particular, due to the rather high costs for CO2 transport and storage that have been assumed in this study. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Biofuels; Biomass gasification; CO2 separation; Energy systems; Modelling; Synthetic natural gas; Thermo-economics","Biomass Gasification; Carbon capture and storage; Emission trading systems; Energy systems; Pressure swing adsorption; Synthetic natural gas; Thermo-economics; Total capital investments; Adsorption; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Efficiency; Gasification; Investments; Models; Moisture determination; Natural gas; Phase separation; Gas permeable membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893520572

The printed all-solid flexible MSCs exhibited remarkably high mechanical flexibility when the devices were bent to a radius of 3.5 mm. In addition, all-solid MSCs were successfully demonstrated by screen printing technique on various substrates, such as silicon, glass and conventional printing paper. Moreover, the screen printing technique can be extended to other active materials, such as OLC and carbon nanotubes.

It is found that Na binding and mobility can be significantly facilitated in layered Si structures. In contrast to the Si bulk, where Na insertion is energetically unfavorable, Na storage can be achieved in polysilane and silicene. The energy barrier for Na diffusion is reduced from 1.06 eV in the Si bulk to 0.41 eV in polysilane. The improvements in binding energetics and in the activation energy for Na diffusion are attributed to the large surface area and available free volume for the large Na cation. Based on these results, we suggest that polysilane may be a promising anode material for Na-ion and Li-ion batteries with high charge-discharge rates.

These processes are supposed to be part of the energy balance in the active layer of rock glaciers leading to lower subsurface temperatures than would be expected at the lower limit of discontinuous high mountain permafrost. In this study, new parametrizations were introduced in a numerical soil model (the Coup Model) to simulate permafrost temperatures observed in a borehole at the Murtèl rock glacier in the Swiss Alps in the period from 1997 to 2008. A soil heat sink and source layer was implemented within the active layer, which was parametrized experimentally to account for and quantify the contribution of air flow driven heat transfer on the measured permafrost temperatures. The experimental model calibration process yielded a value of about 28.9 Wm-2 for the heat sink during the period from mid September to mid January and one of 26 Wm-2 for the heat source in the period from June to mid September. Energy balance measurements, integrated over a 3.5 m-thick blocky surface layer, showed seasonal deviations between a zero energy balance and the calculated sum of the energy balance components of around 5.5 Wm-2 in fall/winter, -0.9 Wm-2 in winter/spring and around -9.4 Wm-2 in summer. The calculations integrate heat exchange processes including thermal radiation between adjacent blocks, turbulent heat flux and energy storage change in the blocky surface layer. Finally, it is hypothesized that these deviations approximately equal unmeasured freezing and thawing processes within the blocky surface layer. © 2014 Author(s).",,"active layer; airflow; borehole; energy balance; energy storage; heat transfer; numerical model; permafrost; rock glacier; Corvatsch; Graubunden; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924751714

The purpose of this study was to compare postural steadiness of below knee amputees with visual alterations while wearing three different prosthetic feet. Methods: Ten male below-knee amputees were instructed to stand quietly on the Biodex® balance platform while wearing solid ankle cushion heel (SACH), single axis (SA) and energy storage and release (ESAR) prosthetic foot under different visual input conditions (eyes-opened and eyes-closed). The overall stability index (OSI), anterior- posterior stability index (APSI), and medial-lateral stability index (MLSI) were computed. Perceived balance assessment of each foot was evaluated using Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) score. Results: The findings highlights that SACH showed lowest overall stability index (indicating less body sway) during eyes-opened (OSI: SACH = 1.09, SA = 1.58, ESAR = 1.59) and SA showed lowest overall stability index during eyes-closed (OSI: SACH = 2.52, SA = 2.30, ESAR = 2.76) condition. However, overall stability indexes between foot types did not differ significantly during eyes-opened or eyes-closed (p = 0.651). There was a trend of instability which occurred more in medial-lateral compared to anterior-posterior direction for all foot types, with significant result in ESAR foot(eyes-opened: MLSI = 1.59, APSI = 0.65, p = 0.034; eyes-closed: MLSI = 2.76, APSI = 1.80, p = 0.017, respectively). When comparing between visual conditions, stability score was significantly higher during eyes-closed compared to eyes-opened situations for SACH and ESAR foot (eyes-closed vs opened; SACH OSI: 3.43 vs 1.71, p = 0.018 and MLSI: 3.43 vs 1.71, p = 0.018; ESAR OSI: 3.58 vs 1.86, p = 0.043 and APSI: 1.80 vs 0.65, p = 0.027).

This paper presents the design of such control-oriented models to describe the power dissipation in a mechanical hybrid powertrain. The two key powertrain components are the continuously variable transmission for mechanical power transmission and a flywheel system for kinetic energy storage. The power dissipation in these components is modelled by parametric functions, which are suitable for describing smooth characteristics in a relatively simple format with only a few coefficients. The functions are selected on the basis of the physical understanding of the systems, whereas the coefficients are identified from dedicated test rig experiments. The results show that the power dissipations are modelled very accurately for both the continuously variable transmission and the flywheel system, with a modelling error of less than 75 W for 80% of the operating conditions in a wide operating range between -25 kW and 38 kW. The continuously variable transmission model is also validated under dynamic driving conditions, showing an overall error for the transmission efficiency of less than 1%. © IMechE 2014.","automotive systems; continuously variable transmission; flywheel system; hybrid vehicles; Modelling","Automotive Systems; Continuously variable transmission; Control oriented models; Flywheel systems; Mechanical power transmission; Parametric functions; Powertrain components; Transmission efficiency; Flywheels; Hybrid powertrains; Hybrid vehicles; Kinetics; Models; Optimization; Wheels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897680918

Although various CO2 capture technologies have been proposed, using the captured CO2 from power plants is increasingly popular because of concerns with regard to the safety of underground and ocean CO2 storage. Various techniques related to utilization of CO2 from the exhausted gas of power plants are discussed in this article. The existing and under-development technologies for CO2 utilization in the world are briefly reviewed. Two categories, direct utilization of CO2 and conversion of CO2 to chemicals and energy products, are used to classify different forms of CO2 utilization. Regarding the direct utilization of CO2, in addition to its use in soft drinks, welding, foaming, and propellants, as well as the use of supercritical CO2 as a solvent, CO2 capture via photosynthesis to directly fix carbon into microalgae has also attracted the attention of researchers. The conversion of CO2 into chemicals and energy products via this approach is a promising way to not only reduce the CO2 emissions, but also generate more economic value. Since CO2 is just a source of carbon without hydrogen, a clean, sustainable and cheap source of hydrogen should be developed. This article reviews the literature on the production of biofuel from microalgae cultivated using captured CO2, the conversion of CO2 with hydrogen to chemicals and energy products, and sustainable and clean sources of hydrogen, in order to demonstrate the potential of CO2 utilization. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Chemical; CO2 utilization; Energy product; Hydrogen; Microalgae","Atmospheric CO; Economic values; Energy products; Exhausted gas; Micro-algae; Soft drinks; Supercritical CO; Algae; Beverages; Carbon; Chemicals; Global warming; Hydrogen; Microorganisms; Power plants; Carbon dioxide; bioaccumulation; biofuel; carbon; carbon dioxide; global warming; hydrogen; microalga; photosynthesis; power plant; solvent",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897649726

Moreover, the prevalence of intelligent mobile phones and wireless networks can allow users to use network services at home and obtain multimedia content easily through mobile devices, thus achieving ubiquitous network cloud multimedia service. However, how to meet the users' demand for high quality and diversified cloud multimedia with handheld devices, which have limited arithmetic capability and power, is an interesting and challenging study. This paper proposed an adaptive energy-efficient stream decoding system for cloud multimedia network on multicore systems. The overall dynamic energy-efficient design was planned in a systematic viewpoint, and the temporary storage block for cloud multimedia was controlled, while considering the instancy of cloud multimedia streaming transmission without destroying the original decoding process.

However, the vehicle to grid (V2G) capacity varies over time based on the availability of the EVs and their individual state of charge (SOC). Hence a real-time V2G capacity estimation is important for utilizing EVs as SES efficiently. In this paper, an algorithm for half-hourly V2G capacity estimation using real-time EV scheduling is proposed. The algorithm is implemented as part of the Building Energy Management System (BEMS). The BEMS uses forecasted building load demand without EVs and predicted charging profiles of the EVs connected to the building for estimating the V2G capacity. The estimated V2G capacity and the availability of RESs are considered by the BEMS to schedule the EV charging/discharging. The proposed algorithm is applied to study three case scenarios using BEMS on residential, office, and commercial buildings in Singapore. The results obtained clearly show that a group of EVs connected to any high-rise building can be effectively used as a distributed storage system. © 2013 IEEE.","charging profile; forecasting; scheduling; smart energy storage; Vehicle to grid","Building energy management systems; Charging profiles; Commercial building; Distributed storage system; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Renewable energy source; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle to grids; Algorithms; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy storage; Forecasting; Multiprocessing systems; Office buildings; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Tall buildings; Estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897597871

In this paper we provide insights into the characteristics of mature Brazilian sugarcane and maturing US dry mill corn ethanol industries. Both systems continue to improve as measured by life cycle data such as total renewable energy produced per unit of fossil energy consumed [renewable energy ratio (RER)]. Sugarcane self-benchmarking systems showed RER values of 7.0 in 2002 to 9.4 in 2009 as the industry started to switch to mechanized harvesting. The average US RER improved from 1.1 to 1.7 from 2000 to 2010. RERs of 4.4 to 5.5 are observed in corn ethanol plants employing natural gas or corn stover combined heat and power. Ethanol systems configured to produce ethanol and electricity had similar net energy balances (a ratio of net energy produced to energy contained in the fuel). One measure of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions (biomass use efficiency) compares the effectiveness of displacing carbon from combustion of fossil fuels with renewable carbon. Advanced corn ethanol systems reach higher GHG emission reduction levels compared to sugarcane ethanol by displacing coal-based electricity. Sugarcane systems achieve double the GHG emissions reductions per unit of harvested land relative to corn ethanol because sugarcane and corn are grown as perennial and annual crops in tropical and temperate climatic zones, respectively. Carbon dioxide capture and storage systems could offer additional GHG emission reductions for both corn and sugarcane ethanol systems. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Corn; Ethanol; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment; Sugarcane; Trade","Biofuels production; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Combined heat and power; Corn; Ethanol production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mechanized harvesting; Renewable energies; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Sugar cane; Ethanol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897593453

Nano-encapsulated organic PCM was fabricated by encapsulation of n-octadecane as a core with St (styrene) - MMA (methylmethacrylate) copolymer shell using miniemulsion in-situ polymerization method. The influence of St/MMA and n-octadecane/copolymer mass ratio on the encapsulation processes, physico-chemical and thermal properties of the resulting nanocapsules has been studied systematically. DSC (differential scanning calorimeter) analysis indicated that the n-octadecane in the nanocapsules form melts at 29.5°C and crystallize at 24.6°C. N-octadecane nanocapsules has an enthalpy of 107.9 and 104.9 Jg-1 for melting and crystallization, respectively. TGA (thermal gravimetric analysis) thermograms showed that the nano-encapsulated organic PCM degraded in two distinguishable steps and has a good chemical stability. The thermal cycling test of the nanocapsules was carried out for 360 heating/cooling cycles and indicates that the developed nanomaterial has good chemical stability and thermal reliability.

Another important aspect is that contextual information is also generated while devices harvest energy from their ambiance.

This phenomenon can be utilized in designing the heat protective materials as well as in the thermal energy storage systems. In this work, effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as PCM and montmorillonite nanoclay, as a thermal property modifier in epoxy resin on the thermal protection performance of nanocomposites were studied. A special performance evaluation test was designed to study the top surface temperature behavior of prepared samples under back surface heating. Results indicated that increasing PCM content improved thermal protection performance, but lower thermal diffusivity was found for the sample containing 60 wt% of PEG, with a 31 % decrease in top surface temperature. These results show that increasing of top surface temperature of samples containing PCM was very slow when compared with the neat epoxy sample.

Among the renewable energy technologies, the solar energy coupling with fuel cell technology will be the promising possibilities for the future green energy solutions. Fuel cell cogeneration is an auspicious technology that can potentially reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact associated with serving building electrical and thermal demands. In this study, performance assessment of a co-generation system is presented to deliver electrical and thermal energy using the solar energy and the reversible solid oxide fuel cell. A mathematical model of the co-generation system is developed. To illustrate the performance, the system is considered in three operation modes: a solar-solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode, which is low solar radiation time when the solar photovoltaic (PV) and SOFC are used for electric and heat load supply; a solar-solid oxide steam electrolyzer (SOSE) mode, which is high solar radiation time when PV is used for power supply to the electrical load and to the steam electrolyzer to generate hydrogen (H2); and a SOFC mode, which is the power and heat generation mode of reversible SOFC using the storage H2 at night time. Also the effects of solar radiation on the system performances and the effects of temperature on RSOFC are analyzed. In this study, 100 kW electric loads are considered and analyzed for the power and heat generation in those three modes to evaluate the performances of the system. This study is also revealed the combined heat and power (CHP) efficiency of the system. The overall system efficiency achieved for the solar-SOFC mode is 23%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 20% and for the SOFC mode is 83.6%. Besides, the only electricity generation efficiency for the solar-SOFC mode is 15%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 14% and for the SOFC mode is 44.28%.

This makes the subsurface, including its groundwater, of crucial importance for primary energy savings. The regulation of ATES systems is similar in many countries around the world. This paper seeks solutions for the institutional hindrances to the diffusion of ATES. The use of aquifers by individual ATES systems can be optimized to maximize their efficiency on the one hand, and to optimize the performance of the regional subsurface for energy storage on the other. The application of ATES in an aquifer has similar properties as other common resource pool problems. Only with detailed information and feedback about the actual subsurface status, a network of ATES systems can work towards an optimum for both the subsurface and buildings, instead of striving for a local optimum for individual buildings. Future governance of the subsurface may include the self-organization or self-governance.

By performing the rapid thermal annealing on Gd2O3 films with different thickness, the Gd2O3-NCs with the diameter of 6-9 nm for charge storage, surrounded by the amorphous Gd2O3 (α-Gd 2O3) layer, were formed. The α-Gd2O 3 layer was considered to be the charge trapping layer, resulting in the large memory window of Gd2O3-NC/CT memories with thick Gd2O3 film. The charge trapping energy level of the Gd2O3-NCs and α-Gd2O3 layer was extracted to be 0.16 and 0.45 eV respectively by using the temperature-dependent retention measurement.

In this work energy management in microgrids is addressed in light of economic and environmental restrictions through (a) development of an operational strategy for energy management in microgrids and (b) determination of type and capacity of distributed generation (DG) sources as well as the capacity of storage devices (SD) based on optimization. Net Present Value (NPV) is used as an economic indicator for justification of investment in microgrids. The proposed NPV-based objective function accounts for the expenses including the initial investment costs, operational strategy costs, purchase of electricity from the utility, maintenance and operational costs, as well as revenues including those associated with reduction in non-delivered energy, the credit for reduction in levels of environmental pollution, and sales of electricity back to the utility.

Here, a facile and powerful method based on anion exchange reactions is reported to achieve metal sulfide nanoarrays through a topotactical transformation from their metal oxide and hydroxide pre-forms. Demonstrations are made to CoS and NiS nanowires, nanowalls, and core-branch nanotrees on carbon cloth and nickel foam substrates. The sulfide nanoarrays exhibit superior redox reactivity for electrochemical energy storage. The self-supported CoS nanowire arrays are tested as the pseudo-capacitor cathode, which demonstrate enhanced high-rate specific capacities and better cycle life as compared to the powder counterparts. The outstanding electrochemical properties of the sulfide nanoarrays are a consequence of the preservation of the nanoarray architecture and rigid connection with the current collector after the anion exchange reactions. Arrays of various metal sulfide nanostructures are obtained via a shape-reserved transformation directly from their oxide or hydroxide pre-forms induced by a versatile anion exchange reaction method. The obtained metal sulfide nanostructures demonstrate much improved pseudocapacitor performance compared to sulfides in other forms. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These converters can be controlled in several ways to execute different functions inside microgrids. Some of the converters cannot operate on isolated grids, that is, without connection to the electrical grid. Therefore, there are converters whose purpose is to provide a voltage reference so that other converters continue to deliver power independent of grid presence. These devices are called grid-forming converters and are usually constituted by a converter associated to an energy storage system. This paper presents the practical implementation of a grid-forming converter using the Modified Synchronous Reference Frame as base structure for the converter control.

These resources include both dispersed energy storage systems (DESSs) and volatile renewable embedded generators. Technical constraints related to both energy resources and electrical network are modeled and taken into account in the proposed optimization problem. The paper first proposes a convex formulation of a specific optimal power flow (OPF) used to compute the resources schedule. Its objective function aims at achieving the minimum of the following quantities: network and DESSs losses, energy cost imported from the external grid, and deviations from the day-ahead scheduled power flow with the same external grid. In addition, the ability of using the substation transformer tap-changer is incorporated into the problem with a suitable cost function. The initial OPF formulation is then enhanced thanks to the use of the Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Programming approach in order to formulate a stochastic AC-OPF. The uncertainties of the problem are due to the forecast errors of the PV generation, load consumption and energy prices. The applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling approach are tested by using a modified version of the IEEE 34 buses test feeder. © 2014 IEEE.","active distribution networks; convex optimization; dispersed energy storage systems; optimal power flow; stochastic programming","Acoustic generators; Convex optimization; Cost functions; Costs; Data storage equipment; Electric lines; Electric load flow; Embedded systems; Energy resources; Energy storage; Integer programming; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Probability distributions; Scheduling; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Active distribution networks; Day-ahead scheduling; Dispersed energy storages; Optimal power flows; Optimization problems; Second-order cone programming; Substation transformers; Technical constraints; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946690347

Previous research has mostly focused on the production process of bacterial starters, but there are few studies about cellular protein deterioration causing cell defectiveness during storage. In the present study, we investigated the influence of storage temperature (-21, 4, 35°C) on the cellular protein modifications which may contribute to the senescence of freeze-dried Acetobacter senegalensis.Results: Heterogeneous populations composed of culturable cells, viable but non-culturable cells (VBNC) and dead cells were generated when freeze-dried cells were kept at -21 and 4°C for 12 months whereas higher storage temperature (35°C) mainly caused death of the cells. The analysis of stored cell proteome by 2D-DiGE demonstrated a modified pattern of protein profile for cell kept at 4 and 35°C due to the formation of protein spot trains and shift of Isoelectric point (pI). Quantification of carbonylated protein by ELISA showed that the cells stored at 4 and 35°C had higher carbonylated protein contents than fresh cells. 2D-DiGE followed by Western blotting also confirmed the carbonylation of cellular proteins involved in translation process and energy generation. The auto-fluorescent feature of cells kept at 35°C increased significantly which may be an indication of protein glycation during storage. In addition, the percentage of cellular unsaturated fatty acid and the solubility of cellular proteins decreased upon storage of cells at higher temperature suggesting that peroxidation of fatty acids and possibly protein lipidation and oxidation occurred.Conclusions: High storage temperature induces some deteriorative reactions such as protein oxidation, lipidation and glycation which may cause further protein modifications like pI-shift, and protein insolubility. These modifications can partly account for the changes in cell viability. It can also be deduced that even moderate carbonylation of some critical cellular proteins (like ribosomal proteins) may lead to VBNC formation or death of freeze-dried bacteria. Moreover, it seems that other mechanisms of biomolecule deterioration preceding protein carbonylation lead to VBNC formation under very low storage temperature. © 2014 Shafiei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2D-DiGE; Acetic acid fermentation; Acetobacter; AGEs; Carbonylation; Oxidative stress; Protein; Starter; VBNC","Acetobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Fluorescent Dyes; Freeze Drying; Microbial Viability; Oxidoreductases; Protein Carbonylation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteome; Temperature; Time Factors; Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894566371

However, partial discharge has always been a predecessor to major faults and problems in this field. In addition, there is a lot more to explore, as neither the partial discharge characteristic in nanocomposites nor their electrical properties are clearly understood. By adding a small amount of weight percentage (wt%) of nanofillers, the physical, mechanical, and electrical properties of polymers can be greatly enhanced. For instance, nanofillers in nanocomposites such as silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O 3) and titania (TiO2) play a big role in providing a good approach to increasing the dielectric breakdown strength and partial discharge resistance of nanocomposites.

However, although delivering better performance, shock resistance, and energy efficiency than mechanical hard disks, NAND flash memory comes with unique characteristics and operational constraints, and cannot be directly used as an ideal block device. In particular, to address the notorious write-once property, garbage collection is necessary to clean the outdated data on flash memory. However, garbage collection is very time-consuming and often becomes the performance bottleneck of flash memory. Moreover, because flash memory cells endure very limited writes (as compared to mechanical hard disks) before they are worn out, the wear-leveling design is also indispensable to equalize the use of flash memory space and to prolong the flash memory lifetime. In response, this paper surveys state-of-the-art garbage collection and wear-leveling designs, so as to assist the design of flash memory management in various application scenarios. The future development trends of flash memory, such as the widespread adoption of higher-level flash memory and the emerging of three-dimensional (3D) flash memory architectures, are also discussed. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Design; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Monolithic microwave integrated circuits; NAND circuits; Refuse collection; Application scenario; Better performance; Development trends; Garbage collection; Non-volatile memory technology; Operational constraints; Performance bottlenecks; Threedimensional (3-d); Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946531525

It is found that the MgH2 + 10 wt.% FeCl3 sample exhibits the best comprehensive hydrogen storage properties, in terms of the onset dehydrogenation temperature, the hydrogen amounts de/reabsorbed as well as the relative de/rehydrogenation rates. The onset dehydrogenation temperature of the 10 wt.% FeCl3-doped MgH2 sample is reduced by about 90 C compared to the as-milled MgH2, and the sorption kinetics measurements indicate that the FeCl3-doped sample displays an average dehydrogenation rate 5-6 times faster than that of the undoped MgH2 sample. Higher levels of doping introduce negative effects, such as lower capacity and slower absorption/desorption rates compared to samples with lower FeCl3 doping levels. The apparent activation energy for hydrogen desorption is decreased from 166 kJ•mol-1 for as-milled MgH 2 to 130 kJ•mol-1 by the addition of 10 wt.% FeCl3. It is believed that the improvement of the MgH2 sorption properties in the MgH2/FeCl3 composite is due to the catalytic effects of the in-situ generated Fe species and MgCl2 that are formed during the heating process. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Neon (Ne), the operating gaseous medium, was doped with krypton (Kr) in different volumetric ratios at various operating pressures ranging from 2 to 14 mbar. The 1% Kr doping increased the average optimum SXR emission efficiency from 0.47% to 0.6% without enhancing the hard X-ray (HXR) (>1600 eV) emission. The Kr doping influenced the major pinching characteristics such as focusing efficiency and time to pinch with consequential effect on X-ray emissions. Synchronous operation of the 4 pseudo-spark gap (PSG) switches was mandatory for efficient discharge current delivery to the electrodes. A drastic improvement in the pinching efficiency was obtained with replacement of old and worn out PSG switches with the new ones. Optical imaging of current sheath dynamics was performed using gated ICCD camera to verify the normal operation of the device after the PSGs replacement. A numerical simulation analysis on the 2 cm long stainless steel tapered anode, used in this study, was done to predict the maximum SXR emission efficiency and the peak operating gas pressure.

An area of growing concern for modern multiprocessor systems is the increase in the failure probability of one or more component processors. This is especially critical for applications where performance degradation (e.g., throughput) directly impacts the quality of service requirement. This article proposes a design-time (offline) multi-criterion optimization technique for application mapping on embedded multiprocessor systems to minimize energy consumption for all processor fault-scenarios. A scheduling technique is then proposed based on self-timed execution to minimize the schedule storage and construction overhead at runtime. Experiments conducted with synthetic and real applications from streaming and nonstreaming domains on heterogeneous MPSoCs demonstrate that the proposed technique minimizes energy consumption by 22% and design space exploration time by 100x, while satisfying the throughput requirement for all processor fault-scenarios. For scalable throughput applications, the proposed technique achieves 30% better throughput per unit energy, compared to the existing techniques. Additionally, the self-timed execution-based scheduling technique minimizes schedule construction time by 95% and storage overhead by 92%. © 2014 ACM.","Energy consumption; Fault tolerance; Multimedia applications; Synchronous dataflow graphs; Task mapping and scheduling","Design space exploration; Embedded computing system; Heterogeneous multiprocessor systems; Multi-criterion optimization; Multimedia applications; Performance requirements; Synchronous dataflow graphs; Task mapping; Energy utilization; Fault tolerance; Quality of service; Throughput; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893611324

A widely considered approach to addressing this issue is to install battery energy storages together with solar PV sources. This paper discusses the capacity planning when battery energy storage is used as a companion for grid-connected solar PV systems. We consider the concrete context of the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS). For electricity markets like NEMS that adopt real-time bidding and clearance, we propose solutions that can enable a battery-companioned solar PV system to behave in the same way as traditional dispatchable generators. We observe that the battery capacity requirement can be reduced by shortening the cycle length for real-time bidding and clearance or by allowing occasional disconnection of solar PV units. To further reduce the battery capacity, we discuss the design of more flexible forms of contracts between the grid and the solar PV systems. © 2014 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Ass.",,"Commerce; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Power markets; Solar concentrators; Battery energy storage; Capacity planning; Electricity market; National electricity market of singapore (NEMS); Power system operators; Solar generation; Solar photovoltaic power; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949924933

With the advent of materials science, this relation has become even more pronounced. The pivotal role of advanced materials in industrial economies has not yet been matched by the influence of advanced materials during the transition from agricultural to modern societies. The role of advanced materials in poverty eradication can be very large, in particular if new trajectories of social and economic development become possible. This is the topic of this essay, different in format from the traditional scientific review, as we try to encompass not only two infant technologies of solar energy conversion and storage by means of organic materials, but also the social conditions for introduction of the technologies. The development of organic-based photovoltaic energy conversion has been rapid, and promises to deliver new alternatives to well-established silicon photovoltaics. Our recent development of organic biopolymer composite electrodes opens avenues towards the use of renewable materials in the construction of wooden batteries or supercapacitors for charge storage. Combining these new elements may give different conditions for introduction of energy technology in areas now lacking electrical grids, but having sufficient solar energy inputs. These areas are found close to the equator, and include some of the poorest regions on earth. Recent developments in printed organic photovoltaic materials and devices are presented. We also discuss the electrochemical storage of electricity by using organic materials, with perspectives on how to integrate these into rural electrical grids in sub-Saharan Africa.

The proposed procedure takes into account the voltage support and network losses minimization along with minimization of the cost of energy from external grid. For the case of large-scale problems, accounting networks with large number of nodes and scenarios, the selection of the solution methodology is a non-trivial problem. In this respect, the paper proposes and discusses the applicability of the Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers in order to provide an efficient algorithm for large-scale networks that also provide a solution to the optimality aspect.

Traditionally, conventional power plants are used for frequency reserves. There are economical and technical benefits of also using energy-constrained units such as storage systems and demand response, but so far they have not been widely adopted as their energy constraints prevent them from following traditional regulation signals, which sometimes are biased over long time-spans. This paper proposes a frequency control framework that splits the control signals according to their frequency content. This guarantees that all control signals are zero-mean over well-defined time-periods, which is a crucial requirement for the usage of energy-constrained units such as batteries. A case-study presents a possible implementation, and shows how different technologies with widely varying characteristics can all participate in frequency control reserve provision, while guaranteeing that their energy constraints are always fulfilled. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",,"Electric power systems; Ancillary service; Conventional power plants; Demand response; Energy constraint; Energy-constrained; Frequency contents; Storage systems; Traditional regulations; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946692045

Moreover, they are often not profitable because of their high investment costs. Their unused capacities could be used to provide power system services, such as frequency control, allowing them to generate additional revenues. However, individual units might not be available to provide system services over the entire contract duration, since they must also provide their local services. This paper shows how an aggregation of distributed ESUs can simultaneously provide local services individually and system services in aggregate. Using a model predictive control approach, a central scheduler dynamically allocates parts of the energy and power capacities of each ESU to either the local or grid service with the objective of maximizing the profit of the aggregation. A key contribution of this paper is the development of an algorithm that handles both resource aggregation and optimal provision of multiple services. We find that multitasking can almost double an ESU's profits as compared with a single-service approach, and that the benefits from aggregation depend on the grid service market structure and how often the local service is required. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.","battery; distributed storage; scheduling","Economics; Electric power system control; Energy storage; Grid computing; Investments; Model predictive control; Profitability; battery; Distributed energy storages; Distributed storage; Distribution grid; Energy storage unit; Integration support; Model-predictive control approach; Resource aggregation; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946691579

Unlike conventional battery control methods that try to extend battery lifetime by applying heuristic rules, this approach allows us to maximize battery lifetime within an optimal control framework. We use an online Least Squares (LS) identification method to develop a two-dimensional degradation map that describes the lost battery charge as a function of the battery state of charge and the applied current. We project the degradation map to an economic cost function that associates each discrete control action with its utilization cost. Additionally, we develop a nonlinear battery model to capture fast battery dynamics including the rate capacity effect and we identify its parameters with a nonlinear LS method. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by presenting a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for a peak shave application in which we use a linearized version of the battery model along with the degradation cost function. We use a high-fidelity lithium ion electrochemical battery model to simulate a real battery system and we show that the MPC scheme increases the battery lifetime by a factor of 2.6 and the internal rate of return by 11 percentage points as compared to conventional control approaches. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.","battery degradation; battery energy storage system; battery management systems; battery modeling; capacity fade; online system identification","Algorithms; Charging (batteries); Cost functions; Costs; Earnings; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Heuristic methods; Identification (control systems); Least squares approximations; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Model predictive control; Online systems; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Secondary batteries; Social networking (online); Battery degradation; Battery energy storage systems; Battery modeling; Capacity fade; Electrochemical batteries; Non-linear battery models; Optimal control frameworks; Power system applications; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946689936

This paper investigates the effects on global welfare of the introduction of (a) inexpensive storage and (b) a rolling horizon market design that supports the use of updated information. Such an environment could adversely affect some generators which could suffer significant losses due to additional commitment costs and may therefore decide to retire some generating units. This paper makes two contributions: First, it assesses the impact on welfare of uncertainty, a rolling horizon unit commitment, and the inclusion of storage. Second, it proposes a pricing mechanism that guarantees the profitability of all scheduled generators while maximizing the consumers' surplus and compares this mechanism with existing cost-recovery methods. Simulation results show that the proposed market design does not affect all the generators in the same manner but outperforms other methods in terms of efficiency. They also show that a shorter commitment horizon reduces the profitability of storage. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.","Interval Optimization; Market Pricing; Rolling Horizon Unit Commitment; Storage","Commerce; Depreciation; Design; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Electricity market design; Interval optimization; Market pricing; Pricing mechanism; Renewable energy source; Revenue adequacy; Unit-commitment; Updated informations; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946685752

The objective is to determine power schedules for controllable devices in a power network, such as generators, storage, and curtailable loads, which minimize expected short-term operating costs under various device and network constraints. These schedules include planned power output adjustments, or reserve policies, which track errors in the forecast of power requirements as they are revealed, and which may be time-coupled. Such an approach has previously been shown to be an attractive means of accommodating uncertainty arising from highly variable renewable energy sources. Given a probabilistic forecast describing the spatio-temporal variations and dependencies of forecast errors, we formulate a family of stochastic network and device constraints based on convex relaxations of chance constraints, and show that these allow economic efficiency and system security to be traded off with varying levels of conservativeness. The results are illustrated using a simple case study, in which conventional generators plan schedules around an uncertain but time-correlated wind power injection. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",,"Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Errors; Forecasting; Operating costs; Relaxation processes; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Computationally efficient; Conventional generators; Convex approximation; Optimal power flow problem; Probabilistic forecasts; Spatio-temporal variation; Stochastic optimal power flows; Variable renewable energies; Stochastic systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946080773

These benefits can possibly be achieved by harvesting urine and feces separately using a conveyor belt placed at a 4° angle beneath the slats. Urine drains from this belt into a gutter leading to a closed storage vessel while feces remain on the belt for up to 24h. Such a belt was evaluated in a partially slatted swine facility housing 80-100 grower pigs in five separate experiments. Fecal DM was determined as a function of both belt residence time and collection time-of-day. The driest feces were obtained with daily collections at 0600h. Collections at this time of day resulted in a 9.8±5.0% increase in DM over collection at 1500h (P=0.07). Under steady state conditions, feces were collected at 49±5% DM and output was 0.26±0.05kgDMpig-1d-1 suggesting an apparent feed DM digestibility of 82.8±2.1%. Urine collected was 1.3±0.2Lpig-1d-1, equivalent to 33±6% of the water intake. Emissions from this facility were for ammonia 1.03±0.20kgpig-1yr-1 or 5.9±1.0% of the intake N and for methane 1.05±0.29kgpig-1yr-1 or 0.64±0.18% of the feed energy. Odor emission at the ventilation fan was 1.9OUanimal-1s-1. All three emission parameters were substantially less than literature values for conventional houses. In conclusion, the belt system was easy to operate and allowed for the separate collection of urine and feces resulting in reduced odor nuisance.

This paper presents empirical estimates of vaccine supply chain costs for Vietnam's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) for routine vaccines at each level of the supply chain, before and after the introduction of the pentavalent vaccine.We used micro-costing methods to collect resource-use data associated with storage and transportation of vaccines and immunization supplies at the national store, the four regional stores, and a sample of provinces, districts, and commune health centers. We collected stock ledger data on the total number of doses of vaccines handled by each facility during the assessment year.Total supply chain costs were estimated at approximately US$65,000 at the national store and an average of US$39,000 per region, US$5800 per province, US$2200 per district, and US$300 per commune health center. Across all levels, cold chain equipment capital costs and labor were the largest drivers of costs. The cost per dose delivered was estimated at US$0.19 before the introduction of pentavalent and US$0.24 cents after introduction. At commune health centers, supply chain costs were 104% of the value of vaccines before introduction of pentavalent vaccine and 24% after introduction, mainly due to the higher price per dose of the pentavalent vaccine.The aggregated costs at the last tier of the health system can be substantial because of the large number of facilities.

Hydrogen can be used to store variable renewable energy such as solar and wind energy. According to this fact, there is an increasing interest in use of solar-hydrogen systems for power supply in remote areas or other standalone applications. One of these applications is Hydrogen production station working by solar energy to use in fuel cell vehicle. Time consuming aspect of solar-hydrogen production is the most prominent reason for presenting a new scheme as a parking-refueling station for fuel cell vehicles in this study. To do this, Simulation, economic and environmental evaluations of the solar parking-refueling station are considered in this article. Because of using an independent hydrogen compression system, the suggested parking-refueling station can be used in a standalone area such as rural and military applications. Results show that the proposed system seems to be economic in present condition. It also illustrates that the Levelized Cost of Product (Km-Passenger) is in a range of 0.15-0.28 US$. Although using the tracker system is not economically efficient, the effect of such a structure is more obvious in the points far from tropical area. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, it is in the nature of these systems that they undergo processes that cannot be investigated by diffraction alone.

Despite these numbers, only a few basic prosthetic and orthotic devices are available, and all lack functionality to restore ankle and foot mobility. Objectives: The aim of this explorative study was to design and test a unique prosthesis for Syme or Pirogoff amputees with the necessary low installation height but restoring ankle and foot mobility. Study design: A case study was performed. Methods: The new prosthesis was designed and numerically analyzed on aspects concerning strength and deformation. A prototype was tested in a case study to assess the biomechanical behavior of the new foot. As a reference, six Syme/ Pirogoff amputees were measured. Additionally, all volunteers filled out a questionnaire to evaluate their prosthetic feet. Results: The self-selected and maximum walking speed of the case subject at 0° and 5° slopes was higher using the new foot (0.36 m/s and 0.53 m/s, respectively) comparing to the Low Rider (Otto Bock HealthCare) (0.31 m/s and 0.31 m/s, respectively). Using the new foot, a more symmetrical walking pattern was achieved.

We hypothesized that (1) beta-alanine supplementation would increase intramuscular carnosine and buffering capacity and dampen acidosis during severe cycling, (2) that high-intensity interval training (HIT) would enhance aerobic energy contribution during severe cycling, and (3) that HIT preceded by beta-alanine supplementation would have greater benefits. Methods: Sixteen active men performed incremental cycling tests and 90-s severe (110 % peak power) cycling tests at three time points: before and after oral supplementation with either beta-alanine or placebo, and after an 11-days HIT block (9 sessions, 4 × 4 min), which followed supplementation. Carnosine was assessed via MR spectroscopy. Energy contribution during 90-s severe cycling was estimated from the O2 deficit. Biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were taken before and after the test. Results: Beta-alanine increased leg muscle carnosine (32 ± 13 %, d = 3.1). Buffering capacity and incremental cycling were unaffected, but during 90-s severe cycling, beta-alanine increased aerobic energy contribution (1.4 ± 1.3 %, d = 0.5), concurrent with reduced O2 deficit (-5.0 ± 5.0 %, d = 0.6) and muscle lactate accumulation (-23 ± 30 %, d = 0.9), while having no effect on pH. Beta-alanine also enhanced motivation and perceived state during the HIT block. There were no between-group differences in adaptations to the training block, namely increased buffering capacity (+7.9 ± 11.9 %, p = 0.04, d = 0.6, n = 14) and glycogen storage (+30 ± 47 %, p = 0.04, d = 0.5, n = 16). Conclusions: Beta-alanine did not affect buffering considerably, but has beneficial effects on severe exercise metabolism as well as psychological parameters during intense training phases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Block training; Carnosine; Glycogen; Muscle buffering capacity","beta alanine; carnosine; adult; article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet supplementation; human; male; metabolism; oxygen consumption; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; skeletal muscle; Adult; beta-Alanine; Carnosine; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption; Resistance Training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895909357

Mate producers perform the sapeco process by rapidly passing the leaves through flames. It has been proven that this procedure leads to high energy consumption and also to excessive exposure of the raw material to heat. In this present work, the effect of sapeco on the inactivation of peroxidase, the color, and degradation of the chlorophyll in mate was evaluated by performing the sapeco procedure in a conveyor oven, without any direct contact with the flames. The mate processed in a conveyor oven was compared with mate processed in mate factories.

Selecting the type and number of prime movers, their nominal power and operational strategy, the heating capacity of backup boiler and storage tank, the cooling capacity of electrical and absorption chillers as well as electric cooling ratio (the ratio of electrical chiller capacity to the demand cooling capacity) were considered as nine design parameters. Three types of prime movers including gas turbine, diesel engine, and gas engine were studied in this article. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm was applied to obtain the maximum actual annual benefit and exergy efficiency simultaneously. Actual annual benefit included the energy, economy, and environmental parameters, therefore with adding exergy parameters, 4 E analysis of combined cooling, heating, and power system was performed. The combined cooling, heating, and power system could run in two operation modes, named economical and electricity tracking modes. In the former case, it was allowed to sell the excess electricity to the network and in the latter, it was not allowed to sell the excess electricity to the grid. It was observed that actual annual benefit for the gas engine was higher than two other cases in economical mode. In electricity tracking mode, the gas engine and gas turbine were more profitable. In addition, the trends of optimum values of design parameters versus actual annual benefit and exergy efficiency in economical mode were investigated and the results were presented.

Objective: We assessed whether the consumption of chlorogenic acid-rich coffee attenuates the effects of short-term fructose overfeeding, dietary conditions known to increase intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCLs), and blood triglyceride concentrations and to decrease hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy humans. Design: Effects of 3 different coffees were assessed in 10 healthy volunteers in a randomized, controlled, crossover trial. IHCLs, hepatic glucose production (HGP) (by 6,6-d2 glucose dilution), and fasting lipid oxidation were measured after 14 d of consumption of caffeinated coffee high in chlorogenic acid (C-HCA), decaffeinated coffee high in chlorogenic acid, or decaffeinated coffee with regular amounts of chlorogenic acid (D-RCA); during the last 6 d of the study, the weight-maintenance diet of subjects was supplemented with 4 g fructose $ kg21 $ d21 (total energy intake 6 SD: 143 6 1% of weightmaintenance requirements). All participants were also studied without coffee supplementation, either with 4 g fructose $ kg21 $ d21 (high fructose only) or without high fructose (control). Results: Compared with the control diet, the high-fructose diet significantly increased IHCLs by 102 6 36% and HGP by 16 6 3% and decreased fasting lipid oxidation by 100 6 29% (all P , 0.05). All 3 coffees significantly decreased HGP. Fasting lipid oxidation increased with C-HCA and D-RCA (P , 0.05). None of the 3 coffees significantly altered IHCLs. Conclusions: Coffee consumption attenuates hepatic insulin resistance but not the increase of IHCLs induced by fructose overfeeding. This effect does not appear to be mediated by differences in the caffeine or chlorogenic acid content.

High meltwater runoff is responsible for half of Greenland's mass loss. Surface melt has been spreading and intensifying in Greenland, with the highest ever surface area melt and runoff recorded in 2012. However, how surface melt water reaches the ocean, and how fast it does so, is poorly understood. Firn-partially compacted snow from previous years-potentially has the capacity to store significant amounts of melt water in liquid or frozen form, and thus delay its contribution to sea level. Here we present direct observations from ground and airborne radar, as well as ice cores, of liquid water within firn in the southern Greenland ice sheet. We find a substantial amount of water in this firn aquifer that persists throughout the winter, when snow accumulation and melt rates are high. This represents a previously unknown storage mode for water within the ice sheet. We estimate, using a regional climate model, aquifer area at about 70,000 km 2 and the depth to the top of the water table as 5-50 m. The perennial firn aquifer could be important for estimates of ice sheet mass and energy budget. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Scheduling of the battery after installation has to be considered for the optimal design; because battery degradationcost is mainly a function of system operation. In this paper, peak shaving and load shifting which are important applications of PV/storage systems are studied. Load shifting is mostly implemented when time-of-use pricing is in effect and peak shaving is beneficial when utility customers are charged for peak of demand. In order to account for seasonality in system net load, data clustering techniques are implemented to produce scenarios for net load of the customer. Then, the proposed Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model of the optimization problem is solved. To illustrate the important cost of battery degradations, a model of non-ideal battery is also studied and the results are compared with the case which ideal model of battery is used. Results show that sizing determination of the battery highly depends on the exact pricing structure. In addition, it is illustrated that, considering real assumptions for battery ageing is necessary to reliably estimate financial benefits of storages in PV/storage systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery energy storage; Demand charge; Energy; Photovoltaic (PV); Sizing optimization; Time-of-use","Clustering algorithms; Costs; Photovoltaic cells; Battery energy storage; Demand charge; Energy; Photovoltaic; Sizing optimization; Time of use; Optimization; installation; optimization; photovoltaic system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893002557

The cooperation concerns the integration of biofuel polygeneration production. A MODEST optimisation model framework is used, assuming various energy market and transport sector scenarios for the year 2030. The scenarios with biofuel production and increased biofuel use in the region are compared with reference scenarios where all new plants introduced into the district heating sector are combined heat and power plants, and the share of biofuel used in the transport sector is the same as today. The results show that the cooperation implies an opportunity to reduce fossil fuel consumption in the sectors by between 20% and 65%, depending on energy market conditions and assumed transport sector scenarios. If we consider biomass an unlimited resource, the potential for greenhouse gas emissions reduction is significant. However, considering that biomass is a limited resource, the increase of biomass use in the district heating system may lead to a decrease of biomass use in other energy systems. The potential for reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions is thus highly dependent on the alternative use of biomass. If this alternative is used for co-firing in coal condensing power plants, biomass use in combined heat and power plants would be more desirable than biofuel production through polygeneration. On the other hand, if this alternative is used for traditional biofuel production (without co-production of heat and electricity), the benefits of biofuel production through polygeneration from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective is superior.

However, such mechanisms suffer from inevitable prediction errors, which in turn degrade the overall performance in real implementations. To circumvent such problems, we propose a fundamental framework to efficiently manage the harvested energy in a prediction free manner. In particular, we theoretically derive a set of Budget Assigning Principles (BAPs) to maximize the amount of harvested energy that can be utilized by a sensor in the presence of battery energy storage inefficiencies, which in turn maximize the sensor's performance level in terms of the sensor's average duty cycle. A Prediction FREE Energy Neutral (P-FREEN) power management mechanism is then proposed to implement the BAPs based solely on current observed energy harvesting rate and battery residual energy level. The performance of P-FREEN is verified via theoretical analysis and extensive computer simulations using real life energy harvesting data sets. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the hemolymph concentrations of some carboxylic acids (oxalic, piruvic, lactic and succinic). After one, two and three weeks of infection, the snails were dissected to collect the hemolymph and separate the tissues. A significant reduction of the levels of glucose in the hemolymph was observed as of the first week of infection in relation to the control group. The lactate dehydrogenase activity of the infected group was significantly higher than the average of the control group. This increase was accompanied by a reduction of the levels of piruvic acid and an increase in the levels of lactic acid in the hemolymph of the parasited snails, confirming the acceleration of the anaerobic metabolism, necessary for the host to obtain energy and maintain its redox balance. In parallel, there was a decrease in the glycogen content of the storage tissues, with that reduction being significantly greater in the cephalopedal mass than the digestive gland, demonstrating that in this interaction system, the mobilization of glycogen was not sufficient to maintain and reestablish the normal glycemia of the infected snails. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Carbohydrates; Host-parasite relationship; Larval nematodes","carboxylic acid; glucose; glycogen; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; oxalic acid; piruvic acid; succinic acid; unclassified drug; glucose; glycogen; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; oxalic acid; pyruvic acid; succinic acid; anaerobic metabolism; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; Biomphalaria glabrata; concentration (parameters); controlled study; energy balance; exocrine gland; glycogen analysis; hemolymph; high performance liquid chromatography; intermediate host; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; anaerobic metabolism; angiostrongyliasis; Article; enzyme activity; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; Biomphalaria glabrata; Gastropoda; Metastrongylidae; Mollusca; Nematoda; Carbohydrates; Host-parasite relationship; Larval nematodes; Anaerobiosis; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; Animals; Biomphalaria; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Host-Parasite Interactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888133823

Storages are important since they provide energy buffering to load changes, energy levelling to source variations and ride-through enhancement to the microgrids. Recognising their importance, this study presents a scheme for sharing power among multiple distributed storages in coordination with the distributed sources and loads. The scheme prompts the storages to autonomously sense for local operating conditions, requesting for maximum charging energy only when excess generation capacity is available. As generation capacity drops or demand increases, energy drawn by the storages decreases spontaneously to avoid over-stressing the sources. When full generation capacity is near, the storages will automatically release their stored energy to help with meeting the extra load demand. The described process takes place autonomously with energy eventually shared among the storages in proportion to their ratings. To test the concepts discussed, experiments have been performed with favourable results obtained for performance verification. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,"Autonomous operations; Distributed energy storages; Distributed generators; Distributed sources; Distributed storage; Generation capacity; Operating condition; Performance verification; Electrical engineering; Power electronics; Distributed power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893025717

A new method is developed for the generation of carbon nanoflakes on various metal oxide nanostructures by combining atomic layer deposition (ALD) and glucose carbonization. Various metal oxide@nanoflake carbon (MO@f-C) core-branch nanostructures are obtained. For the mechanism, it is proposed that the ALD Al2O3 and glucose form a composite layer. Upon thermal annealing, the composite layer becomes fragmented and moves outward, accompanied by carbon deposition on the alumina skeleton. When tested as electrochemical supercapacitor electrode, the hierarchical MO@f-C nanostructures exhibit better properties compared with the pristine metal oxides or the carbon coating without ALD. The enhancement can be ascribed to increased specific surface areas and electric conductivity due to the carbon flake coating. This peculiar carbon coating method with the unique hierarchical nanostructure may provide a new insight into the preparation of 'oxides + carbon' hybrid electrode materials for energy storage applications. A new form of carbon nanoflakes on various oxide nanostructures is fabricated based on a unique thermal-induced interaction between atomic layer deposition (ALD)-Al2O3 and glucose.

The difference in cell number emerges early in childhood, suggesting that this is a critical period for being susceptible to obesity. Breast-feeding has been shown to be protective against obesity, and we have previously shown in mice that the physical structure of lipids in human milk may contribute to this protective effect. In the present study, we investigated how differences in the physical structure of lipids in the early diet may modulate adipose tissue development. Male mice were fed a diet containing control infant milk formula (Control IMF; Danone Research) or Nuturis® (Concept IMF with large phospholipid-coated lipid droplets; Danone Research) from postnatal day (PN)16 to 42. Subsequently, mice were challenged with a moderate Western-style diet (WSD) until PN98, and body composition was monitored by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Epididymal WAT was analysed for adipocyte size, number and gene expression of metabolic transcription factors. Early Concept IMF exposure reduced fat accumulation during the WSD challenge by 30% compared with the Control IMF. It reduced adipocyte size without affecting adipocyte number in adult mice. The Concept IMF decreased the expression of PPARγ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and retinoid X receptor α in WAT in adulthood, key regulators of metabolic activity. In conclusion, Concept IMF exposure in early life reduced susceptibility to obesity in adult life, by preventing adipocyte hypertrophia upon adult dietary challenge without affecting adipogenesis. These data emphasise the importance of the physical properties of dietary lipids in early life in obesity risk later in life.

It has been previously shown that the host cytosol is a nitrogendeficient environment for the intracellular Symbiodinium and may act to limit growth rates of symbionts during the symbiotic association. This study aimed to investigate the cell proliferation, as well as ultrastructural and lipid compositional changes, in free-living Symbiodinium spp. (clade B) upon nitrogen (N)-deprivation. The cell proliferation of the N-deprived cells decreased significantly. Furthermore, staining with a fluorescent probe, boron dipyrromethane 493/503 (BODIPY 493/503), indicated that lipid contents progressively accumulated in the N-deprived cells. Lipid analyses further showed that both triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol ester (CE) were drastically enriched, with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; i.e., docosahexaenoic acid, heneicosapentaenoic acid, and oleic acid) became more abundant. Ultrastructural examinations showed that the increase in concentration of these lipid species was due to the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs), a cellular feature that have previously shown to be pivotal in the maintenance of intact endosymbioses. Integrity of these stable LDs was maintained via electronegative repulsion and steric hindrance possibly provided by their surface proteins. Proteomic analyses of these LDs identified proteins putatively involved in lipid metabolism, signaling, stress response and energy metabolism. These results suggest that LDs production may be an adaptive response that enables Symbiodinium to maintain sufficient cellular energy stores for survival under the N-deprived conditions in the host cytoplasm. © 2014 Jiang et al.",,"cholesterol ester; docosahexaenoic acid; fat droplet; heneicosapentaenoic acid; lipid; nitrogen; oleic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; article; cell proliferation; controlled study; endosymbiosis; lipid composition; lipid storage; nonhuman; proteomics; stereospecificity; Symbiodinium; ultrastructure; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Blotting, Western; Boron Compounds; Cell Proliferation; Chlorophyll; Cholesterol Esters; Cnidaria; Cytosol; Dinoflagellida; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Lipid Metabolism; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Nitrogen; Oligonucleotides; Rosaniline Dyes; Species Specificity; Symbiosis; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900315906

Basic principle of mass conservation can be applied in statistical modeling with a historic time series to obtain the atmospheric CO2 concentration, making it possible to create scenarios that will help in the decision making process. A model that links all carbon cycle factors has been developed this article, focusing on the Boreal, Temperate, Tropical, and Polar thermal climatic zones to calculate atmospheric CO2 level. It was developed with nonparametric models based on carbon dioxide records from measurement stations: EIA (Energy Information Administration), CDIAC (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center), FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), and SIO (Scripp Institution Oceanography). The advantage of the model developed here is that it is able to analyze different scenarios, considering both the behavior of particular countries or groups of countries in each thermal zone and their influence on the predicted concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Results show that in 2100, the atmospheric CO2 concentration will be four times that of the pre-industrial period. The Temperate zone already emits almost half of the carbon dioxide to the atmosphere; by 2100, this emission will increase 15 times more than that of the tropical zone. China will be responsible for nearly two times the emissions of the United States. CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere will stabilize when anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions decrease by at least 36% in the Temperate zone by 2100. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration; Thermal zones; Time series model","Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration; Decision making process; Energy Information Administration; Food and agriculture organizations; Thermal zones; Time series modeling; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Global warming; Time series; Carbon dioxide; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate modeling; concentration (composition); decision making; emission; environmental planning; industrial location; time series; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886245520

However, massive deployment of small cells also incurs severe interference and increased energy consumption, which degrades the energy efficiency of the system. In this paper, we analyze the energy efficiency in cognitive small cell network, and propose a traffic-aware distributed sensing and access scheme for cognitive small cells base stations (SBSs). The proposed scheme adopts the concept of dynamic data driven applications systems (DDDAS). In the DDDAS paradigm, a model of the underlying design space is managed dynamically, updated periodically based on measurements of data, and used to drive measurement functions and adaptation of system configurations. Through careful integration of DDDAS-based design principles, SBSs have the ability to configure their sensing and access parameters according to the traffic patterns that are actually encountered. Simulation results show that our proposed DDDAS-based scheme can achieve significantly higher energy efficiency compared to conventional spectrum sharing schemes in cognitive small cell networks. © 2014 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; DDDAS; dynamic spectrum access; energy efficiency; small cell; utility","Cells; Cognitive radio; Cytology; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Mobile security; Signal processing; DDDAS; Distributed sensing; Dynamic spectrum access; Measurement function; Small cell Networks; Small cells; System configurations; utility; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946686949

Compelling data have implicated the neurotransmitter dopamine as an important part of body weight regulation. However, the precise mechanisms through which dopamine regulates energy homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate mechanisms through which dopamine modulates energy storage. We showed that dopamine signaling regulates fat reservoirs in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that the fat reducing effects of dopamine were dependent on dopaminergic receptors and a set of fat oxidation enzymes. Our findings reveal an ancient role for dopaminergic regulation of fat and suggest that dopamine signaling elicits this outcome through cascades that ultimately mobilize peripheral fat depots. © 2014 Barros et al.",,"dopamine; dopamine receptor; Caenorhabditis elegans protein; dopamine; dopamine receptor; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; fat; serotonin; serotonin agonist; animal experiment; article; Caenorhabditis elegans; controlled study; dopaminergic transmission; energy metabolism; fat content; fatty acid oxidation; lipid analysis; lipid storage; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; signal transduction; animal; drug effects; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression; genetics; homeostasis; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mutation; oxidation reduction reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; time; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Dopamine; Dopamine Agents; Energy Metabolism; Fats; Gene Expression; Homeostasis; Lipid Metabolism; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Mutation; Oxidation-Reduction; Receptors, Dopamine; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Serotonin; Serotonin Receptor Agonists; Signal Transduction; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899805654

Two different groups of nanotubes were studied: the first were (12,12) SiNTs, (19,19) CNTs, and (15,15) SiCNTs and the second were (7,7) SiNTs, (11,11) CNTs, and (9,9) SiCNTs with the diameters of ∼26 and ∼15 Å for the first and second groups, respectively. The simulations were carried out for different thermodynamic states. The potential energy functions (PEFs) were calculated using ab initio quantum mechanics and then fitted with (12,6) Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential model as a bridge between first principles calculations and GCMC simulations. The absolute, excess, and delivery adsorption isotherms of hydrogen were calculated for two groups of nanotubes.

In response to the possibility of its large-scale manufacturing as commercial products in the future, an investigation was conducted to determine the cytotoxicity of one particular family of graphene derivatives, the halogenated graphenes, for the first time. Halogenated graphenes were prepared through thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide in gaseous chlorine, bromine or iodine atmospheres to yield chlorine- (TRGO-Cl), bromine- (TRGO-Br) and iodine-doped graphene (TRGO-I) respectively. 24 h exposure of human lung carcinoma epithelial cells (A549) to the three halogenated graphenes and subsequent cell viability assessments using methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-8) assays revealed that all the halogenated graphenes examined are rather cytotoxic at the concentrations tested (3.125 μg mL-1 to 200 μg mL-1) and the effects are dose-dependent, with TRGO-Cl reducing the cell viability to as low as 25.7% at the maximum concentration of 200 μg mL-1. Their levels of cytotoxicity can be arranged in the order of TRGO-Cl &gt; TRGO-Br &gt; TRGO-I, and it is suggested that the amount of halogen present in the graphene material is the determining factor for the observed trend. Control experiments were carried out to test for possible nanomaterial-induced interference as a consequence of reaction between the halogenated graphenes and the viability markers (MTT/WST-8 reagent) or binding of the formazan products under cell-free conditions. The data obtained eliminate the probability of significant influence by these interferents as the change in the normalized percentage of formazan formed is relatively small and thorough washings were performed prior to the viability assessments to reduce the amount of halogenated graphenes that could eventually interact with the MTT/WST-8 assays. More studies need to be carried out in the future to complement the results obtained in this initial study in an attempt to develop a better understanding of the health hazards that the halogenated graphenes pose. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cell-free conditions; Commercial products; Control experiments; Epithelial cells; Gaseous chlorines; Large-scale manufacturing; Maximum concentrations; Physicochemical property; Bromine; Chlorine; Cytotoxicity; Graphene; Halogenation; Health hazards; Iodine; bromine; chlorine; graphite; iodine; oxide; water; article; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; halogenation; human; tumor cell line; Bromine; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Chlorine; Graphite; Halogenation; Humans; Iodine; Oxides; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890841962

Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully regulate wind or solar power output. In contrast, flow batteries can independently scale the power (electrode area) and energy (arbitrarily large storage volume) components of the system by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form. Wide-scale utilization of flow batteries is, however, limited by the abundance and cost of these materials, particularly those using redox-active metals and precious-metal electrocatalysts. Here we describe a class of energy storage materials that exploits the favourable chemical and electrochemical properties of a family of molecules known as quinones. The example we demonstrate is a metal-free flow battery based on the redox chemistry of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7- disulphonic acid (AQDS). AQDS undergoes extremely rapid and reversible two-electron two-proton reduction on a glassy carbon electrode in sulphuric acid. An aqueous flow battery with inexpensive carbon electrodes, combining the quinone/hydroquinone couple with the Br 2/Br-redox couple, yields a peak galvanic power density exceeding 0.6 W cm-2 at 1.3 A cm-2. Cycling of this quinone-bromide flow battery showed >99 per cent storage capacity retention per cycle. The organic anthraquinone species can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals. This organic approach permits tuning of important properties such as the reduction potential and solubility by adding functional groups: for example, we demonstrate that the addition of two hydroxy groups to AQDS increases the open circuit potential of the cell by 11% and we describe a pathway for further increases in cell voltage. The use of π-aromatic redox-active organic molecules instead of redox-active metals represents a new and promising direction for realizing massive electrical energy storage at greatly reduced cost. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"9,10 anthraquinone 2,7 disulphonic acid; bromide; hydroquinone; quinone derivative; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; aqueous solution; catalysis; electricity generation; electrochemical method; electrode; solar power; solubility; sulfuric acid; wind power; article; electric battery; electrode; metal free organic inorganic aqueous flow battery; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892147016

Operational constraints for time to solution can be met with both processor types, although on different numbers of nodes. Energy to solution is a factor 3 lower with GPUs, but strong scaling can be pushed to larger node counts with CPUs to minimize time to solution. Our data shows that an affine relationship exists between energy and node hours consumed by the simulation.

Thus, this paper focus on the thermal conductivity enhancement of Cu and Fe nanoparticles dispersed in paraffin based suspension was investigated experimentally for utilization in solar collector integrated with TES. The enhanced thermal conductivity measurement was performed by transient hot disk sensor technique. The increment in thermal conductivity showed approximately linear progression with increase in percentage of mass concentration of the dispersed metal-nanoparticles. It was observed that the nanoparticle with lower thermal conductivity value (Fe- 80 W/m·K) at bulk enhanced the polymer matrix higher than the nanoparticle with higher thermal conductivity value (Cu- 401 W/m·K) at the bulk. The Cu and Fe nanoparticles, at mixing ratio of 1.5% by mass, increased the thermal conductivity of the paraffin based nanocomposites by 20.63% and 51.95%, respectively when compared with the pure paraffin.

The simulation model accounts for both the mechanical deformation of the SWCNT and the interactions among the hydrogen and carbon atoms. It is found that the critical torsional moment and stiffness of the SWCNT are both significantly dependent on the hydrogen molecule storage density. Importantly, the change in torsional stiffness differs from that of conventional linear elastic materials as a result of the nonlinear oscillatory response due to nonlinear mechanical effects. It is shown that under large deformations, the SWCNT switches reversibly between different morphological patterns. Each change in pattern corresponds to an abrupt release of the strain energy and a singularity in the stress-strain curve. It is shown that at higher hydrogen storage densities, the hydrogen molecules exert a stabilizing effect on the SWCNT. The degree of torsional stability is determined principally by the distribution of the hydrogen molecules within the SWCNT. Finally, it is shown that the torsional deformation of the SWCNT is characterized by a stick-slip phenomenon. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on a bow-tie model, in which an incident, leakage of gas oil from the storage system (cavern and wells), is evaluated by assessing its possible causes and effects. The causes are all the events that may lead to leakage from the storage system. The effects are the consequences of the leakage. It is considered that the most serious of the subsurface risks is contamination of the groundwater due to upward migration of the gas oil to the surface. A unique aspect of our risk assessment is the combination of causes and effects.The effects of containment/failure are quantified at multiple time scales using a numerical flow model for multiphase flow through porous medium, based on the geohydrological properties of the subsurface of the Twente area. The probability of occurrence of loss of containment/failure (causes) is quantified semi-quantitatively, using the causal relationships between the causes and effects.Modelling of the leakage shows that, as expected, leakage from the well above the hydrogeological base in the phreatic aquifer produces an immediate risk of contamination of the upper groundwater. However, leakage at a deeper level does not pose a risk of contamination of groundwater, because the low porosity and permeability of the geological layers prevent the upward migration of leaking gas oil. The semi-quantitative approach to the probability of failure finds that for multiple scenarios (e.g. well failure, unstable cavern, high pressure) and in the absence of human intervention, the probabilities of failure are medium to high. If human intervention is assumed, these probabilities of failure diminish considerably, especially those associated with the well. These findings are consistent with those from other hazard studies on storage in salt caverns.The causes (probabilities of failure) and effects (modelling of leakage) together indicate that for most scenarios the risk is low when human intervention (e.g. monitoring of the well) is assumed.Notwithstanding our conclusion that the risk of leakage associated with gas oil injection and storage in salt caverns is low, an extensive monitoring plan should be formulated to monitor the containment of the gas oil in the storage system and its long-term stability, to ensure timely human intervention that reduces the risk considerably. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Markov Chain; Multiphase flow modelling; Risk analysis; Salt caverns; Storage","Low porosity and permeability; Multiphase flow modelling; Numerical flow models; Probability of failure; Probability of occurrence; Risk of contamination; Salt caverns; Semi-quantitative risk assessment; Aquifers; Caves; Energy storage; Gas oils; Groundwater resources; Markov processes; Multiphase flow; Porous materials; Probability; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Salt deposits; Groundwater pollution; cavern; flow modeling; gas; hydrogeology; leakage; Markov chain; multiphase flow; oil; permeability; porosity; risk assessment; underground storage; Netherlands; Overijssel; Twente",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890037578

In this situation, it is possible to obtain electrochemical energy after the complete charge/discharge cycle conducted in electrolytic solutions with different proton concentrations. To this end, we prepared modified electrodes from phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS), and polyallylamine (PAH) by the layer-by-layer (LbL) method and investigated their electrochemical behavior, aiming to use them in these neutralization pseudocapacitors. We analyzed the potentiodynamic profile of the current density at several scan rates, to evaluate the reversibility of the proton electroinsertion process, which is crucial to maximum energy storage efficiency. On the basis of the proposed reaction mechanism and by using frequency-domain measurements and models, we determined rate constants at different potentials. Our results demonstrated that the conducting polymer affects the self-assembled matrixes, ensuring that energy storage is high (22.5 kJ mol-1).

However it is not clear how the carbon material can accomplish the dissociation (or recombination) of H2. In this work we investigate the dissociation of H2 on Aln (n = 2, 4, and 6) clusters supported by coronene and graphene substrates using density functional theory (DFT), where coronene and graphene are taken as models for nanographitic surfaces. In our calculations, we account for van der Waals interactions by adapting the correlation part of the PBE exchange-correlation functional with the Grimme and Langreth corrections, and we use NEB to calculate the minimum energy reaction path for the dissociation of H2. Analysis of the minimum barrier reaction paths and the associated dissociation barriers of H2 on Aln clusters interacting with the modeled carbon surfaces shows that the investigated carbon materials have a promoting effect on the dissociation of H2 on the Aln clusters, resulting in barrierless dissociation of H2 on Al 4 and Al6 supported on coronene. The calculations on coronene suggest that the promoting effect comes from a stabilization of the singlet states of Aln. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon nano-materials; Complex metal hydrides; Dissociation barrier; Exchange-correlation functionals; First-principles calculation; Graphene substrates; Hydrogen storage materials; Van Der Waals interactions; Aluminum; Graphene; Hydrogen storage; Surfaces; Van der Waals forces; Dissociation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892568579

The next generation L10 FePt media subjected to low energy embedment of C+ ions have the potential to provide reduced magnetic spacing along with smaller and thermally stable grains, which is pivotal for achieving areal densities beyond 1 Tb/in.2 However, the impact of low energy C+ ions embedding on the magnetics of FePt media is not known. Here, the magnetic properties of L10 FePt, post-shallow C+ ion embedment at 350 eV, were investigated. It was observed that bombardment of C+ ions in the 5 nm thick FePt films produced a monumental reduction of ∼86% in the out-of-plane coercivity value. Increasing the FePt film thickness did not significantly suppress the impact of these C+ ions on the media. Structural and elemental analyses attributed this alteration caused in the magnetic properties of the well-ordered FePt films to the penetration of &gt;2 nm by the C+ ions into the FePt film. The media's crystallography with respect to the size and direction of the incoming ions has emerged to be accountable for the deeper distribution of the C+ ions and the associated widespread cascade damages within the magnetic layer. The consequences of low energy C+ ions embedding to attain high storage densities using high anisotropy L10 FePt media are discussed. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Antiwear property; Filtered Cathodic Vacuum Arc techniques; High storage density; Magnetic spacings; Out-of-plane coercivity; Shallow embedding; Structural disorders; Thermally stable; Amorphous films; Magnetic materials; Magnetic properties; Ions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892184358

Among porous materials, active carbons are the most popular materials in separation processes. They are non-crystalline materials with heterogeneous pore structures. This property does not permit accurate structural determinations by diffraction techniques. Thus only limited structural information can be extracted from experimental techniques. Consequently, a molecular model of nanoporous carbon can't be constructed that is based solely on experimental data. Computer simulation techniques provide an alternative way to tackle this problem. So, in this study, the synthesis process of an amorphous active carbon is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. Simulations are carried out at constant temperature in the box containing specific numbers of pure carbon sheets. Two different types of ensembles have been used for simulation including NPT and NVT. Calculated results show that the final structure of porous carbons is in agreement with SEM images of some commercial active carbons. Also, results indicate that the final structure is consisted of three different pore size (r) zones: r<2 nm which produces micro pores,2<r<50 nm which produces mesopores and r>50 nm which named macro pores. These observations are exactly the same as what is observed in experiments. These various pore sizes especially micro and meso pores are observed in radial distribution function curve, too. At last, the temperature effect on the pore size is investigated. Three different temperatures of 973K, 1073 K and 1173 K are applied for the simulation. Calculated results show that increasing the temperature does not have any significant effects on the pore size and structure. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Molecular dynamics simulation; Nanostructure formation; Porosity; SEM Image","Diffraction techniques; Experimental techniques; Molecular dynamics simulations; Nanostructure formation; Noncrystalline materials; Radial distribution functions; SEM image; Structural determination; Computer simulation; Crystalline materials; Molecular dynamics; Nanostructured materials; Pore size; Porosity; Porous materials; Amorphous materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891530020

It has good transparency, high electron mobility, wide, and strong room-temperature luminescence. These properties have many applications in a wide area of emerging applications. Doping ZnO with the transition metals gives it magnetic property at room temperature hence making it multifunctional material, i.e. coexistence of magnetic, semiconducting and optical properties. The samples can be synthesized in the bulk, thin film, and nano forms which show a wide range of ferromagnetism properties. Ferromagnetic semiconductors are important materials for spintronic and nonvolatile memory storage applications. Doping of transition metal elements into ZnO offers a feasible means of tailoring the band gap to use it as light emitters and UV detector. As there are controversial on the energy gap value due to change of lattice parameters we have synthesized Mn-doped ZnO nanoparticles by co-precipitation method with different concentrations to study the effect of lattice parameters changes on gap energy. The doped samples were studied by XRD, SEM, FT-IR., and UV-Vis. The XRD patterns confirm doping of Mn into ZnO structure.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman scattering, and optical absorbance spectroscopy (OAS) studies reveal that the Mo1-xWxS2 films consist of crystallites of two-to-four monolayers in thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the core levels of Mo3d and W4f shift to lower binding energies while that of S2p shifts to higher ones with the increase in W compositions, which can be related to the larger electron affinity of W (0.8163 eV) than that of Mo (0.7473 eV). OAS has also shown that the direct bandgap of Mo1-xWxS2 is tuned from 1.85 to 1.99 eV by increasing x from 0 to 1. Both E12g and A1g phonon modes of the Mo1-xWxS2 films exhibit a two-mode behavior. The bandgap tuning and the two-mode phonon behaviors are typically the same as those recently observed in monolayer Mo1-xWxS2 obtained by mechanical exfoliation, thus shedding light on the bottom-up growth of large-scale two-dimensional Mo1-xWxS2 ternary alloys. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"C-plane sapphire substrates; Co-sputtering techniques; Mechanical exfoliation; Optical absorbance; Sapphire substrates; Ternary compounds; Two-mode behavior; Vapor phase growth; Atomic force microscopy; Binding energy; Data storage equipment; Energy gap; Monolayers; Phonons; Photoelectrons; Sapphire; Ternary alloys; Vapors; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Tungsten compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890173911

However, this type of ephemeral structure currently requires the implementation of significant resources, for which the characteristics of flexibility and economic efficiency most often prevail over considerations related to sustainability. This lack of sustainability exists due to several attributes of a temporary building. Firstly, the distance between the place of storage and the one of use requires transportation, which can sometimes represent a significant share of consumption and environmental impacts. Furthermore, heat energy required to achieve an acceptable level of indoor comfort in a building with little or no thermal isolation is disproportionate to the short time of use. Finally, the materials used, in most cases, have a significant life cycle in terms of embodied energy required for their manufacture and respectively their disposal. However, many parameters are not as yet subject to specific studies. Contributing to remedy this lack, the present paper aims to evaluate the environmental impacts and lack of performances of current temporary event structures. In order to compare them with the expected performances of an alternative proposition -the On STAGE Project-, which refers to architectural quality and high level of comfort with an optimal use of resources and a minimization of environmental impacts. Firstly, a detailed analysis of a typical ephemeral structure system is presented, through an assessment process, that takes into account not only environmental criteria calculated on the whole life cycle, Non Renewable Energy (NRE) and Global Warming Potential (GWP), but also the thermal and acoustic comfort. Then the set of results will be compared to the simulated values for On STAGE Project, and show that it is possible, through an integrated design process based on the principles of bioclimatic architecture and the use of renewable energy sources, to design a temporary structure capable of high level of comfort, preserving resources and reducing environmental impacts, in order to meet sustainability goals, even in the case of a short lifespan. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.",,"Architecture; Ecosystems; Global warming; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Architectural quality; Bio-climatic architectures; Economic efficiency; Global warming potential; Integrated design process; Non-renewable energy; Temporary structures; Use of renewable energies; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088357999

In this perspective, how can we design attractive urban neighborhoods generating endogenous economic activity and fostering socio-cultural dynamics, while moving towards local energy self-sufficiency? Answering that question requires major changes in the way we consider energy in the construction sector, by thinking beyond the scale of a single building and by including a greater number of design parameters. Filling this gap in current research, the Symbiotic Districts project examines dimensions influencing energy self-sufficiency at neighborhood scale by integrating parameters related to buildings, infrastructure, mobility, food, goods and services. The present paper analyzes the results of a case study on an urban sector in the city of Yverdon-les-Bains (Switzerland). Taking lifestyles as a starting point, the project explores three scenarios (technological, behavioral and symbiotic) for the future development of this neighborhood for 2035. The scenarios test different design strategies related to industrial symbioses, production, storage, transportation or urban agriculture. In order to calculate an estimated global balance, an energy flow analysis allows the assessment and comparison of the energy performance of each scenario. In parallel, an urban form adapted to the proposed vision evaluates how architectural and urban design is likely to foster the necessary behavior changes towards the expected energy turnaround. © 2014 30th International PLEA Conference: Sustainable Habitat for Developing Societies: Choosing the Way Forward - Proceedings.

Recent years, industry and academia pay more attention to this area. Modeling of CO2 transportation in pipelines is crucial in engineering design and operation of these pipelines. However, there are no standalone industrial standards for CO2 transportation modeling due to a lack of valid operational and experimental data. This paper will review up-to-date CO2 pipeline design and modeling especially focusing on the Equation of State (EOS). The most economical means of CO2 transportation is to keep it in dense phase. This is a big challenge for traditional Equations of State such as the Peng-Robinson equation and the SRK equation because they are more suitable for the vapor-liquid equilibrium properties of hydrocarbon mixture systems. Pure CO2 properties can be accurately predicted by the Span-Wagner equation. But impurities in CO2 can change the properties dramatically. It has been reported that both Peng-Robinson and Span-Wagner equations have been used in the energy industry for CO2 pipeline simulation. This paper will present the results using different Equations of State for CO2 simulation. Different commercial software packages have been tested. The results show there is about 5% difference in density and a 3% difference in viscosity. The Peng-Robinson equation with Peneloux volume correction is more conservative in pressure drop calculations.

For the adequate maintenance of the best technical behavior of this system, it is necessary that we provide the hydroelectric basis with a range of projects with hydraulic accumulation capacity, which is commonly defined as reservoir capable of accumulation and/or regularization. However, the environmental licensing process for hydropower has been increasingly complex in Brazil, particularly in the case of dams with reservoirs of accumulation, due to allegations of the existence of a high degree of negative social and environmental impacts in their implementation. The lack of new projects capable of regulation and accumulation, in addition of impacting the foundations of national hydropower matrix, can also create serious consequences for the operation of the National Interconnected System-SIN, therefore the reservoirs are important not only for its ability to stabilize the waterways in which they are located, but also provide the flexibility for the National Operator of the System - ONS, minimizing thermal dispatch, and also facilitate integration with new renewable sources such as wind and biomass, among others. According to the Ten Year Energy Plan 2011 ∼ 2020 - PDE, elaborated by EPE - Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica, the raising of the storage capacity will be only 6% (six percent) in the period, while the installed capacity of hydropower will increase 39% (thirty-nine percent). Currently the projects under construction and development are run of rivers with no capacity of accumulation or regularization. In power plants with this characteristic, all the water coming in has to go out (through the turbines or spillways) with no storage conditions. As a result, these assets have low capacity factor (ratio of the effective production of the plant over a period of time and the maximum total capacity in this same period). This systemic configuration offers adverse consequences such as the inability to control floods and greater requirements on the SIN' power plants that has regulating capacity, requiring higher thermal dispatch due to the need to meet seasonal load supplying. Moreover, the existence of generation assets with accumulation capacity allow you to take full advantage of hydrological diversity among the national hydrographic basins, enabling the integration of alternative sources called ""new renewables"" such as wind power, biomass and SHPs - Small Hydropower, among others. The projects with capacity of accumulation and regularization bring numerous benefits making the operation of the National Interconnected System - SIN more flexible, minimizing the dispatch of thermal power plants, which contributes both to reduce the total cost of operating the system and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In this context, it is imperative a thorough technical evaluation of the optimal configuration of projects, properly expressed in Inventory Studies, seeking the optimal use of the hydrographic basin, as required by law. This paper has the objective to show that there are feasible and pragmatic alternatives for the improvement of this institutional matter, proposing guidelines and procedures that contribute to consolidating security and operational flexibility of the National Integrated System - SIN, showing clearly and objectively that the environmental issue, if properly crafted, may induce a perfect use of the national energy potential. © 2014 CIGRE.

As such, the capability limits and testing methods are internationally standardized in IEC 62271-102. The test circuit dictated in this standard is the Thévenin equivalent of the high current, power frequency approximation of two parallel busbars supplied by an AC current source. This setup inevitably couples different factors influencing the bus-transfer switching process by directly specifying the preswitching current through the disconnector switch and recovery voltage expected across it after successful switching. To facilitate a more detailed and direct investigation of bus-transfer switching processes, a different test method is suggested and consequently implemented as a proof of concept. The suggested method entails the use of an AC current source to drive a current through two parallel impedances representing different sections of a busbar. The disconnector switch under test is placed in series with one of the impedances. In order to analyze the feasibility of such a setup, a proof of concept current source along with two parallel impedances was built. The main design goal for the current source was to provide AC currents over a large range of magnitudes at a constant frequency. In addition, the current provided by the source must not be influenced by the bus-transfer switching process. To fulfill these requirements, an LC-resonance circuit with an adjustable resonance frequency and a substantial initial energy storage capacity was chosen. Its applicability was verified in numerous switching cases of different specifications. The impedances representing substation busbars in the test setup were designed with a main focus on adjustability and precision. The resistance and inductance components were modelled after typical GIS substation values for lengths between 10 m and 600 m. Due to the conductor being comprised of overhead line cable, virtually any length in this range can be represented with minimal effort. Experimental verification has demonstrated that this type of test setup ensures direct comparability between laboratory tests and substation processes due to the ability to directly measure both parallel currents and the recovery voltage occurring at the disconnector after successful switching. This feature can prove beneficial for non-standard testing cases such as failure analysis and substation planning which require precise modelling of substation characteristics as well as sophisticated measurements. © 2014 CIGRE.

In this regard, polyethylene glycol/cellulose acetate (PEG/CA) electrospun nanofibers as a model of PCM/polymer structure were electrospun. The electrospinning process was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) to produce phase change nanofibers (PCNs) with achievable minimum and maximum diameter at nanoscale range. Therefore, PCNs with minimum and maximum diameter (223 nm and 545 nm, respectively) were successfully prepared. According to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, the PCNs sample with maximum diameter exhibited higher efficiency of enthalpy (49.41 %) than the PCNs sample with minimum diameter (46.24 %). On the other hand, a test based on the T-history method revealed that PCNs with maximum diameter enjoy higher thermal insulation effect. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as DSC results showed that the PCNs samples exposed to thermal cycling test not only preserved their structural durability, but also exhibited about twofold increasing in the efficiency of enthalpy than the non-exposed samples. According to thermogravimetric analysis (TG) results, due to successful entrapping, a fraction of PCMs within the structure of polymer matrix, PCNs sample display greater thermal stability comparing to the pure PCM. The present work emphasises that at nanoscale range, higher diameter of PCNs can present more favorable thermal behavior; suggesting a great potential for advanced applications of thermal energy storage and thermal regulating materials fields. © 2014 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Electrospinning; Phase change nanofibers (PCNs); Response surface methodology (RSM); Thermal durability; Thermal stability","Differential scanning calorimetry; Durability; Electrospinning; Enthalpy; Heat storage; Nanofibers; Nanotechnology; Phase change materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface properties; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Advanced applications; Electrospinning process; Electrospun nanofibers; Phase Change; Response surface methodology; Shape stabilized phase change material; Structural durability; Thermal durability; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027917321

Generally, dryers are classified into different categories based on drying strategy, drying medium, mode of handling of drying material, and mode of heat transfer. With reference to the dryer classification, dryers that permit high temperature drying or low temperature have the potential to avoid microbial multiplication and inactivate microbial activity. In addition, hybrid drying which combines different drying techniques can also be considered. Further, pretreatments can be applied in order to reduce or eliminate microbial load of a product before drying.

While the mechanism and regulation of myocardial carbohydrate (glucose, lactate) uptake have been unraveled in detail in the 1990s, insight into fatty acid uptake originates from more recent studies. Fatty acid movement across the sarcolemma is facilitated by membrane-associated proteins, specifi- cally CD36, membrane-associated fatty acid-binding protein (FABP pm) and selected fatty acid transport protein (FATP) isoforms, and is up- or downregulated through changes in sarcolemmal content of (primarily) CD36. The recruitment of CD36 from an endosomal storage pool to the sarcolemma, which is under the control of various physiological stimuli (including insulin and contraction), represents a pivotal step in the overall regulation of myocardial fatty acid uptake and utilization. Dysregulation of the intracellular cycling of CD36 underlies various cardiac metabolic diseases. As a result, the mechanism and regulation of myocardial glucose uptake by GLUT4 cycling and of fatty acid uptake by CD36 cycling are very similar. Likely, manipulation of the presence and/or activity of substrate transporters for glucose and fatty acids in the sarcolemma holds promise as therapeutic approach to alter cardiac substrate preference in disease so as to regain metabolic homeostasis and rectify cardiac functioning. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","CD36; Fatty acid uptake; Fatty acid-binding protein; Fatty acid-transport protein; Metabolic modulation; Substrate preference",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016476628

This trend must be subdued or even reversed by reducing CO2 emissions in the power sector. An enhanced power generation efficiency, a switch to lower-carbon fossil fuels, an increased utilization of renewables and nuclear power, and the introduction of CCS (carbon capture and storage) are possible options to achieve this objective. At present, many countries concentrate their attention to the development of clean coal technologies to enhance the efficiency and the environmental benignity of coal extraction, preparation, and utilisation, among which gasification illustrates a paradigm of BACT (best achievable control technology) concept. Dry sulfidation technology in coal gasification plants can be implemented to prevent the sulfur corrosion of equipment and reduce pollutant emissions to meet environmental regulations and improve energy efficiency. In this study, 20 wt%Fe2O3/Al2O3 was used as a sorbent to perform multiple sulfidation/regeneration cycle tests in a fixed-bed reactor under simulated hot syngas conditions (For the sulfidation step: 973K, inlet gases:CO:30%, H2S:1%, CO2:5%, H2:10%, N2 balance; For the regeneration step: Air, 973K). The physical properties of sorbents were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), BET, and SEM7EDS. ICP-AES results indicated that the composition of metal oxide was close to the theoretical value. Multiple sulfidation/regeneration cycle tests showed that the 20wt%Fe2O3/Al2O3 can be regenerated and thus reused after the oxidation process. Due to the sulfidation reaction, colour change of the 20 wt%Fe2O3/Al2O3 sorbent was observed, from the original red to black. After six sulfidation-regeneration cycles, the sulfur capacity of the sixth cycle remained approximately on a level of 68% of the sulfur capacity in the first cycle. The BET analysis showed that the surface area decreased as the cycle number increased.

The fracture energy of coked specimens was compared to non-coked ones. The analysis was based on the data provided by load-displacement curves obtained from fracture energy tests. A very important parameter that aided this investigation was the absolute value of the tangent at the inflexion point of these curves, in the region correspondent to the crack propagation. Results indicated that coke causes an increase in the fracture energy. On the other hand, the brittleness of the material becomes higher, due to an increase in the storage strain energy before crack propagation. © 2014 The American Ceramic Society.",,"Coke; Crack propagation; Digital storage; Fracture; Fracture energy; Refractory materials; Strain energy; Absolute values; Alumino-silicate refractories; Inflexion point; Load-displacement curve; Petrochemical industry; Refractory castables; Cracks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996469995

This phenomenon is generally known as global warming. Alternation of radiative balance and increased temperature in the atmosphere will change precipitation patterns and other climatic variables [39]. Because of close interactions between water, socioeconomic activities, and cultural practices, climate change impact on regional water availability is considered one of the most important impacts on the society of future climatic changes. Global climate change is considered to impose significant alterations on regional landscape systems, regional water cycles, and particularly catchment hydrology [55]. Changes in hydrological regimes will affect almost every aspect of socioeconomic life, from agricultural production and energy consumption to flood control, municipal and industrial water supply, conservation of natural resources, and ecohydrological management. Anticipated increased flow volumes will require larger reservoir spillways and drainage waterways for flood management, whereas decreased flow volumes will need increased capacity of flood storage for the security of water supply schemes. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how climate change and climate variability could affect regional water availability. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Agriculture; Catchments; Conservation; Energy utilization; Flood control; Floods; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources management; Reservoir management; Water supply; Agricultural productions; Climate change impact; Global climate changes; Hydrological regime; Increased temperature; Industrial water supply; Precipitation patterns; Water supply schemes; Reservoirs (water)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992715239

One particular issue is the vulnerability of cryogenic LNG storage tanks with respect to impact loadings, such as ship collisions and dropped objects. This requires an understanding of the impact resistance of the storage tanks and the actual loads to be expected. No substantial literature exists on the actual energy absorbing capacity (crashworthiness) of cryogenic tanks. Main issues are material properties under cryogenic/moderate strain rate conditions and failure mechanisms associated with large deformation - fluid structure interaction, in particular the liquid-full condition. This paper reports material properties of stainless steel 304 at both ambient and cryogenic conditions. Also the effect of strain rate is addressed. Moreover, it describes and compares two approaches of predicting the effect of the 'liquid-full' condition on the impact resistance of LNG storage tanks. The first approach follows a multi-material Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation, whereas the second approach captures the fluid-structure interaction through an analytical loading subroutine, calculating the internal pressure as a function of tank volume decrease. Results of impact experiments on partially liquid-filled small-scale storage tanks are presented. The calculation methods have been validated against the experimental results. The results of the validation show that the crashworthiness of stainless steel (cryogenic) storage tanks can be well predicted through both the ALE and the analytical formulation.

The value of storage is defined as the consumer's net benefit obtained by optimally operating the storage. We formulate the operation problem as a dynamic program. Under the assumption that consumer utility (received from electricity consumption) is additively separable over time, we establish a threshold structure of the optimal operation policy for a consumer who faces random electricity prices and stochastic demand. For a more general setting that incorporates the inter-temporal substitution effect in consumer demand, if the consumer always faces the same (realized) purchasing and selling price, then it is optimal for her to use the storage only for arbitrage, and therefore the VoS does not depend on the consumer's demand. © 2014 IEEE.","Demand response; Dynamic programming; Energy storage operation; Value of storage",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988306087

SPICE simulations were performed to compare energy requirements per one-bit memory cell between the proposed memory cell and the conventional volatile one-bit SRAM cell. Simulations show that the SRAM memory cell requires between 73.034 pJ and 12.433 nJ to retain logic information for 10 years, while the proposed memory cell requires less than 1 pJ to hold logic information for up to 10 years.

Thus, finding and characterizing enzymes that can deal with the complexity of the walls has been the main focus of research. As a result, data on pretreatments of many kinds and performances of enzyme cocktails containing glycosyl hydrolases from microorganisms are becoming quickly available. Here we propose that the efficiency of the 2G process could be increased even further by acquiring control of mechanisms that plants themselves use to degrade their own walls, so that wall loosening provoked by such processes would decrease the energy demand for pretreatments and facilitate hydrolysis. The examined in this chapter are plant-microorganism interaction, cell wall storage mobilization, fruit ripening, abscission, and aerenchyma formation. These systems are seen as having in common the use of modules that are coupled sequentially in order to lead to cell wall modification, including hydrolysis, for performance of different biological functions. These modules are (1) target cells perception of a message from the hormonal balance, (2) cell separation, (3) cell expansion, (4) programmed cell death, (5) hemicellulose- cellulose relaxation/hydrolysis and (6) cellulose hydrolysis.

Energy storage systems that are connected to the PV generators using bidirectional isolated dc-dc converter can be utilized for compensating the fluctuating PV power. This paper presents a grid connected energy storage system based on a 2 kW full-bridge bidirectional isolated dc-dc converter and a PWM converter for PV output power leveling. This paper proposes two controllers: a current controller using the d-q synchronous reference and a phase-shift controller. The main function of the current controller is to regulate the voltage at the high-side dc, so that the voltage ratio of the high-voltage side (HVS) with low-voltage side (LVS) is equal to the transformer turns ratio. The phase-shift controller is employed to manage the charging and discharging modes of the battery based on PV output power and battery voltage. With the proposed system, unity power factor and efficient active power injection are achieved. The feasibility of the proposed control system is investigated using PSCAD simulation. © 2014 Rajkiran Singh et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965041338

In pumped storage power plant, due to connect between upper and main reservoir, water seepage from upper reservoir have a significant effect on the efficiency of the power plants to produce energy. The objective of this research is to estimate water seepage from the upper reservoir of Rudbar pumped storage power plant, based on combined geological and geotechnical investigations using numerical and analytical methods. Geological investigations show that the upper reservoir consists of limestone and marly limestone. Obtained data of seven exploratory boreholes and seven joint measurement stations have been considered as the main source for seepage calculations in analytical method and distinct element method (DEM), respectively. The input data such as permeability of layers and the hydraulical and mechanical properties of discontinuities has been obtained from measured data. Results from both methods (analytical and numerical) have an appropriate consistency together. The estimated seepage from analytical method and DEM is around 348,000 m3/day and 280,000 m3/day, respectively.

The use of STT-RAM in last level on-chip caches has been proposed as it significantly reduced cache leakage power as technology scales down. Having a cell area only 1/9 to 1/3 that of SRAM, this will allow for a much larger cache with the same die footprint. This will significantly improve overall system performance, especially in this multicore era where locality is crucial. However, deploying STT-RAM technology in L1 caches is challenging because write operations on STT-RAM are slow and power-consuming. In this chapter, we propose a range of cache hierarchy designs implemented entirely using STT-RAM that delivers optimal power saving and performance. In particular, our designs use STT-RAM cells with various data retention times and write performances, made possible by novel magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) designs. For L1 caches where speed is of the utmost importance, we propose a scheme that uses fast STT-RAM cells with reduced data retention time coupled with a dynamic refresh scheme. We will show that such a cache can achieve 9.2 % in performance improvement and saves up to 30 % of the total energy when compared to one that uses traditional SRAM. For lower-level caches with relatively larger cache capacities, we propose a design that has partitions of different retention characteristics and a data migration scheme that moves data between these partitions. The experiments show that on the average, our proposed multiretention-level STT-RAM cache reduces total energy by as much as 30-70 % compared to previous single retention-level STT-RAM cache, while improving IPC performance for both 2-level and 3-level cache hierarchies. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The problem is ensuring energy supply after the Sun has gone down. Balancing this cyclic and intermittent energy production along with uncertain energy demand is a major concern to all large utilities around the world. Conventional options for dealing with such imbalance of energy consist of creating flexible electricity demand and supply, but that is not always feasible. Hence options for storing energy when in excess and supplying it when the demand rises are investigated. Batteries are conventional solutions for energy storage; newer options include storage in the form of hydrogen. We propose a new solution for all energy buffering problems - Ammonia! Ammonia can be a suitable medium to 'buffer' intermittent renewable energy in liquid form. We propose a completely environmentally friendly system, where there are no carbon emissions upstream or downstream. Ammonia can be produced decentrally from renewables (or cheap power) via Proton's NFuel units and this ammonia can be converted into power when needed via ammonia generators. Secondly, excess ammonia can be directly used as a fertilizer or chemical feedstock. Over the longer term such decentralized and independent power production and usage system will herald the dawn of energy independency, guaranteeing security of supply by reducing reliance on imported oil and gas. © 2014 The Authors. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonia; Energy buffering; NFuel; Solar; Sustainable","Carbon; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Engineering research; Hydrogen storage; Solar energy; Chemical feedstocks; Electricity demands; Energy buffering; Environmentally friendly systems; Intermittent energy production; NFuel; Solar; Sustainable; Ammonia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949122809

However, this type of ephemeral structure currently requires the implementation of significant resources, for which the characteristics of flexibility and economic efficiency most often prevail over considerations related to sustainability. This lack of sustainability exists due to several attributes of a temporary building. Firstly, the distance between the place of storage and the one of use requires transportation, which can sometimes represent a significant share of consumption and environmental impacts. Furthermore, heat energy required to achieve an acceptable level of indoor comfort in a building with little or no thermal isolation is disproportionate to the short time of use. Finally, the materials used, in most cases, have a significant life cycle in terms of embodied energy required for their manufacture and respectively their disposal. However, many parameters are not as yet subject to specific studies. Contributing to remedy this lack, the present paper aims to evaluate the environmental impacts and lack of performances of current temporary event structures. In order to compare them with the expected performances of an alternative proposition-the On STAGE Project-, which refers to architectural quality and high level of comfort with an optimal use of resources and a minimization of environmental impacts. Firstly, a detailed analysis of a typical ephemeral structure system is presented, through an assessment process, that takes into account not only environmental criteria calculated on the whole life cycle, Non Renewable Energy (NRE) and Global Warming Potential (GWP), but also the thermal and acoustic comfort. Then the set of results will be compared to the simulated values for On STAGE Project, and show that it is possible, through an integrated design process based on the principles of bioclimatic architecture and the use of renewable energy sources, to design a temporary structure capable of high level of comfort, preserving resources and reducing environmental impacts, in order to meet sustainability goals, even in the case of a short lifespan. © 2014 The Authors.

Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is an innovative technology that provides an energy and cost-effective separation of CO2 for further capture and storage and thereby helps to mitigate the anthropogenic CO2 emissions from thermochemical fuel conversion. The solid oxygen carrier is a core component of every CLC system and the choice of the oxygen carrier depends on the fuel and operation conditions. Low-cost oxygen carriers tend to be more suitable for the process as the lifetime of the oxygen carrier material is often limited by side reactions with fuel ash, or by carryover losses in the ash separation. A series of natural ores and waste products have been investigated as potential oxygen cares, such as Mn-ore, Fe-ore, ilmenite. The materials are chosen based on their content of oxides that have proven to have promising oxygen transporting capabilities. The results lead to summary of criterion for further screening of the existing materials for more reactive and better suited candidates for the process. © SGEM2014.","CLC; CO2 capture and storage; CO2-neutral; Conversion; Energy; Ores; Oxygen carriers; Waste materials","Climate change; Combustion; Cost effectiveness; Fuel storage; Fuels; Manganese; Ores; Oxygen; Ship conversion; Waste incineration; Wastes; Anthropogenic CO; Chemical-looping combustion; CLC; Energy; Innovative technology; Operation conditions; Oxygen Carrier; Solid oxygen carriers; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946728797

In this case, in addition to mapping the structure and the XML data to relations, it is also required to translate XML queries to SQL.

Their energy consumption is growing exponentially, with and without the use of 'green' energy. Increasing environmental awareness within information science has led to discussions on sustainable development. 'Green Computing' has been introduced: the study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing. This can be defined as 'designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated subsystems - such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and communications systems - efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment'. Nevertheless, the data deluge makes it not only necessary to pay attention to the hard- and software dimensions of ICTs but also to the value of the data stored. We explore the possibilities to use information and archival science to reduce the amount of stored data. In reducing this amount of stored data, it's possible to curb unnecessary power consumption. The objectives of this paper are to develop a model (and test its viablility) to [1] increase awareness in organizations for the environmental aspects of data storage, [2] reduce the amount of stored data, and [3] reduce power consumption for data storage. This model integrates the theories of Green Computing, Information Value Chain (IVC) and Archival Retention Levels (ARLs). We call this combination 'Green Archiving'. Our exploratory research was a combination of desk research, qualitative interviews with information technology and information management experts, a focus group, and two exploratory case studies. This paper is the result of the first stage of a research project that is aimed at developing low power ICTs that will automatically appraise, select, preserve or permanently delete data based on their value. Such an ICT will automatically reduce storage capacity and curb power consumption used for data storage. At the same time, data disposal will reduce overload caused by storing the same data in different formats, it will lower costs and it reduces the potential for liability. © The Authors, 2014.

Since the solar irradiation level is variable, the output power of photovoltaic (PV) plant is intermittent. Electrical energy storage systems (ESSs) like battery can be exploited to cope with this difficulty. A smart microgrid (MG) consisting of PV, diesel, and battery energy storage (BES) plants is configured for this reason. MG is subject to meet two targets. Firstly, it is able to degrade power fluctuations due to variability in sunlight and load demand. Secondly, it supplies the local load demand according to operator command. A novel application of moving average filtering (MAF) to smooth out PV plant output power waveform is introduced as well. By the use of MAF, a novel power smoothing index (PSI) is presented which variability of load and generation both are considered in its formulation. PSI is embedded in MG power management system (PMS) for the purpose of BES plant dispatching. MG is simulated in PSCAD software. To validate the operational abilities of proposed PSI and MG, several test cases are conducted using actual load and meteorological data in Peninsular Malaysia. The results indicate that PSI can effectively dispatch BES to remove the power fluctuations generated by solar plant and load.","Energy management; Intermittent renewable; Power smoothing; Smart grid; Solar photovoltaic","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Meteorology; Microgrids; Power management; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Battery energy storage plants; Battery energy storages (BES); Electrical energy storage systems; Intermittent renewable; Power management systems; Power smoothing; Smart grid; Solar photovoltaics; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939558329

Quickly altering output power of this type is random and hence one remedy is to suppress it by short-term to mid-term electrical storage systems. Battery energy storage system (BESS) is one example brought to this end. To compensate for power fluctuations resulted by solar plant together with load, BESS have to be sized accurately. In this paper, a guideline algorithm is proposed which helps to precisely size the BESS. Technical issue related to BESS physical properties are also considered in this method. To protect BESS against over charge/discharge, a current control algorithm is designed as well which adjusts for battery storage plant dispatching reference to ensure that magnitude of battery current is within the operational boundary. A smart microgrid (MG) consisting of diesel, battery storage, and solar plants is implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC to test and validate aforementioned algorithms.

The effect of parameters such aspect ratio, initial temperature of the nanofluid, the cavity tilt angle, and Grashof number at the solidification time is investigated. The moving solidliquid interface is obtained using Enthalpy-porosity technique in the model. We found that the solidification time decreases with the increase of the aspect ratio (i.e., a longer trapezoidal cavity). Aspect ratio is found to give a prominent effect. However, the effect of cavity tilt angle is found negligible on the solidification process. It was found that larger value of Grashof number decreases the solidification time in the square and trapezoidal cavity both, but increases the convective heat transfer in the trapezoidal cavity only.

Ten days after the operation, the lipectomized animals showed significant higher triacylglycerol, glucose and insulin levels, a lower adiponectin concentration than the sham-operated rats, along with significant higher hepatic mRNA levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a) and the enzymes involved in lipogenesis, sterol biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis. The results of immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis also confirmed increased levels of lipogenic enzymes in the liver of lipectomized versus sham-operated animals. The lipectomized group had a significantly lower adiponectin/leptin ratio that was positively correlated to the level of LDL (r = 0.823, P<0.05) and negatively to glucose and insulin (r =20.821 and 20.892 respectively, P<0.05). Eight weeks after the operation, the lipectomized animals revealed significant higher body and liver weights, weight gain, liver to body weight ratio, hepatic triacylglycerol and serum insulin level. Conclusions: In response to lipectomy a short term enhancement of the expression of hepatic anabolic genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was triggered that might eventually lead to the final extra weight gain. These metabolic changes could be the results of reduced circulating adiponectin that further influences the functions of insulin and hepatic HNF4α. © 2014 Ling et al.

The hydro system includes 150 medium and large hydropower plants. Among these 150 plants, 135 are in operation today and 15 are planned to be operational by the end of 2017. The Brazilian hydro system is completely interconnected. About half of the hydropower plants have large storage capacities to regulate flows. The system is linked with the power grids in Paraguay, Argentina, Venezuela, and Uruguay. Brazil also receives natural gas imports from Bolivia. Each month hydropower generation must be determined. This is a complex decision-making process. The objective is to optimize the entire system operation, which depends on the inflows, storages, forecasts of demands, fuel prices for thermal units, and expansion of the system over a given planning horizon, typically looking ahead five years. Environmental, technical, social, and economic constraints have made it increasingly difficult to project and build new reservoirs with large storage capacities. As a result, newly built hydropower plants are mostly the run-of-river type. To better understand the process, this paper presents a historical survey of the installed capacity of hydropower and storage capacity of the system since 1908 and extends to the planned expansion over the next four years, through 2017. The storage capacity is represented by the concept of maximum stored energy in each reservoir and subsystem. The paper also presents the history of operation over the last 12 years. Data from 2000 and projections through 2017 indicate a significant reduction of relative regulating capacity, represented by the ratio of maximum storage and installed capacity. This reduction has a direct impact on decisions regarding operation and expansion of the complementary thermal system. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Behavioral research; Decision making; Digital storage; Expansion; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Surveys; Thermal expansion; Economic constraints; Hydro-power generation; Hydropower plants; Hydropower system; Installed capacity; Planning horizons; Regulating capacities; Storage capacity; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935498539

As a solution, this work proposes smart grid as a service (SGaaS), which not only allows a smart grid to be composed out of basic services, but also allows power users to choose between different services based on their own requirements.

The risk of acquiring STH is significantly influenced by climatic and socio-economic factors including temperature, rainfall, occupation and availability of safe water and sanitation facilities. STH are transmitted through the parasites' eggs excreted in faeces of infected humans that enter the human body by ingestion or skin penetration. More than a billion people living in tropical and subtropical countries are currently infected with STH, with over 300 million of them suffering from morbidity. The epidemiology of STH is characterized by overdispersed distribution in the population; heavy-intensity infections are the major source of morbidity and these infections usually occur in children and women; treatment administered at regular intervals to these groups at risk will periodically decrease the worm burden of infected individuals and control morbidity. Soil-transmitted helminths can affect the nutritional status of their host by feeding on the content of the host's intestine or on host tissues (e.g. blood), impairing digestion or absorption of nutrients, causing an inflammatory response that leads to the production of substances affecting appetite, intake, metabolism and storage of micronutrients and eliciting fever and immune response, thus increasing consumption of energy. The burden of disease associated with STH is mainly attributable to their chronic and insidious impact on nutritional status, physical development and quality of life of those infected rather than to the overt morbidity or mortality they cause. The severity of the clinical manifestations mainly depends on the intensity of infection and on the underlying nutritional condition of the human host. Eggs of intestinal helminths are generally easy to identify because of their large size and distinctive morphology and their identification in stool specimens remains the most commonly used means of diagnosis, especially in developing countries. The Kato-Katz technique direct smears in saline or concentration techniques (such as formol-ether) can be alternatively used. WHO-recommended treatment options include albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel. All the mentioned medicines are to be administered orally. These drugs are effective, safe and extremely low cost. For these reasons, in area of high endemicity WHO recommends preventive chemotherapy; this measure consists on the large-scale distribution of anthelmintic drugs to population groups at risk. It has been demonstrated that treatment at regular intervals, when started early in life, protects children from the worst consequences of STH and prevents the development of complications associated with heavy-intensity infections. One of the risks of this approach is the development of resistance to anthelmintic drugs in targeted parasites; as of today, however, scientific investigations have not demonstrated any presence of resistance among helminths that infect humans. To further increase cost efficacy of the control activities WHO supports and endorses the development of multi-disease national plans of action (e.g. addressing also the control of schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis) implemented in integrated way and complemented by other public health interventions such as the provision of health education and the improvement of the sanitation infrastructure. WHO envisages a world free of childhood morbidity due to STH. The goal is to reduce morbidity from STH among preschool-age children (aged 1-4 years) and school-age children (5-14 years) to a level below which it would not be considered a public health problem, i.e. when the level of prevalence of STH infections of moderate and high intensity among school-age children is <1%. This target is achievable; in 2012 over 260 million of children have been treated with preventive chemotherapy for the control of STH and the large drug donations by pharmaceutical companies and the support provided by international donors are sustaining the efforts of endemic countries. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien.

A lot of basic scientific work such as nature discovery and organic evolution heavily relies on the environment reconstruction. However, gathering large amount of environmental data costs huge energy and storage space. The shortage of energy and storage resources has become a major problem in sensor networks for environment reconstruction applications. Motivated by exploiting the inherent feature of environmental data, in this paper, we design a novel data gathering protocol based on compressive sensing theory and time series analysis to further improve the resource efficiency. This protocol adapts the duty cycle and sensing probability of every sensor node according to the dynamic environment, which cannot only guarantee the reconstruction accuracy, but also save energy and storage resources. We implement the proposed protocol on a 51-node testbed and conduct the simulations based on three real datasets from Intel Indoor, GreenOrbs and Ocean Sense projects. Both the experiment and simulation performances demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the conventional methods in terms of resource efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. © 2014 The British Computer Society.

Chemistry, biotechnology, and process engineering advances will make biorefineries feasible in technical and cost aspects. Efforts have been concentrated in assessing plant biodiversity and crop potentialities for manipulation of physiological responses such as carbon fluxes toward soluble, storage, and structural sugars, waxes, oils, phenolics, and many other products. Thanks to advances in the omics field by the use of model plants, these issues have been addressed, allowing for a better comprehension of the general plant metabolism with concomitant inferences to important crops, like sugarcane. Plant cell walls are one of the most abundant, renewable, and useful biomaterial on the earth. However, wall polymers are entrapped in an imbricated structural organization. Thus, the viability of using such feedstock in a bio-based economy will greatly depend on the integration of green and white technologies in the production processes to efficiently extract and use molecules and energy stored in biomass.

These bacteria play an important role in the oceanic nitrogen cycle and can be applied in wastewater treatment for the removal of ammonium. Like other members of the phylum Planctomycetes, anammox bacteria defy many microbiological concepts. Among other unique characteristics such as the presence of ladderane membrane lipids and hydrazine as an anammox intermediate, anammox bacteria have a compartmentalized cell plan consisting of a paryphoplasm, riboplasm, and anammoxosome compartment. Further, their cell wall has been hypothesized to be devoid of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane typical of Gram-negative bacteria. In this chapter, the current knowledge of anammox cell biology is reviewed. The chapter starts with an introduction touching upon topics such as evolution, classification, detection methods, culturing, ecology, and application. Next, the anammox cell envelope is described, focusing on the hypothesized absence of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane. We move further on to the paryphoplasm compartment where the presence of the anammox cell division ring and what is known (or not known) about the contents and function of this compartment are discussed. After the cell envelope and paryphoplasm, the riboplasm is reviewed, the standard cytoplasmic compartment of anammox bacteria where DNA metabolism and protein synthesis take place. The focus lies on carbon fixation and (glycogen) storage and speculations about how protein sorting to the different compartments is achieved. Next, the anammoxosome is discussed, the compartment which is the locus of anammox energy metabolism and functions in energy conservation over its highly curved membrane. The tubule-like structures and putative iron storage particles inside this compartment are also described. Finally, we dig a little deeper into the energy metabolism of the cell where we discover that anammox bacteria also show generalist as well as specialist behavior in relation to substrates and electron donors and acceptors. The chapter concludes with an outlook and questions for future research concerning this enigmatic group of Planctomycetes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

If a vehicle manufacturer focuses only on a fixed driving cycle there is a risk that controllers of the vehicle are optimized for a certain driving cycle and hence are sub-optimal solutions to real-world driving. To deal with this issue, it is beneficial to have a method for generating more driving cycles that in some sense are equivalent but not identical. The idea here is that these generated driving cycles have the same vehicle excitation in the mean tractive force, MTF. Using the individual force components of the MTF in the generation of driving cycles with Markov chains makes it possible to generate equivalent driving cycles that have the same vehicle excitation from real-world driving data. This is motivated since the fuel consumption estimation is more accurate when the MTF components are considered. The result is a new method that combines the generation of driving cycles using real-world driving cycles with the concept of equivalent driving cycles, and the results are promising. © IFAC.","Automotive emissions; Drive cycle; Driver behavior; Equivalence measures; Markov process; Specific energy; Test procedures; Vehicle excitation; Vehicle propulsion","Automation; Automotive industry; Catalytic converters; Chains; Digital storage; Markov processes; Testing; Vehicles; Automotive emissions; Drive cycles; Driver behavior; Equivalence measures; Specific energy; Test procedures; Vehicle propulsion; Automobile manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929783412

An electrolyzer produces hydrogen from surplus energy generated by the wind turbine and photovoltaic array of RE system for later use by a fuel cell. The SM controller inputs are (a) net power flow and (b) batteries state of charge (SOC) and controller output determines the time for hydrogen production or consumption. Actual data for weekly residential load, wind speed, ambient temperature, and solar irradiation are used for performance simulation and analysis of the RE system examined. The weekly operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) are considered. It is determined that SM controller results in (a) reduced fluctuations in batteries SOC which translates into longer life for batteries and the average SOC is increased by 6.18% and (b) less working hours for fuel cell, when the load is met by wind and PV. It is found that the SM controller results in lower O&M costs and LPSP by 57 and 33%, respectively. In addition, a reduction of 18% in investment cost is achievable by reducing the capacity of RE system equipment.

In this study, a variant of LTC engines, known as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), is utilized for operation in a series HEV configuration. An experimentally validated dynamic HCCI model is used to develop required engine torquefuel consumption data. Given the importance of EnergyManagement Control (EMC) on HEV fuel economy, three different types of EMCs are designed and implemented. The EMC strategies incorporate three different control schemes including thermostatic Rule-Based Control (RBC), Dynamic Programming (DP), and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The simulation results are used to examine the fuel economy advantage of a series HEV with an integrated HCCI engine, compared to a conventional HEV with a modern Spark Ignition (SI) engine. The results show 12.6% improvement in fuel economy by using a HCCI engine in a HEV compared to a conventional HEV using a SI engine. In addition, the selection of EMC strategy is found to have a strong impact on vehicle fuel economy.

First, the expected temperature shock significantly and positively affects both the near-month and far-month natural gas and heating oil futures returns. Next, significant temperature shock has effect on both the conditional mean and volatility of natural gas and heating oil prices. The results indicate that expected inventory surprises significantly and negatively affects the far-month natural gas futures returns. Moreover, volatility of natural gas futures returns is higher on Thursdays and that of near-month heating oil futures returns is higher on Wednesdays than other days. Finally, it is found that storage announcement for natural gas significantly affects near-month and far-month natural gas futures returns.

The results showed that, considering a load profile with 21.675kWh for daily consumption, a 3kW PV array with a 2kW wind turbine and a 5kWh battery could save 96% of the monthly electricity bill; from 2'377 to 66'960 dollars.

A 3GeV linear accelerator serves as a full-energy injector into both rings as well as a driver for a short-pulse facility, in which undulators produce X-ray pulses as short as 100fs. The 3GeV ring employs a multibend achromat (MBA) lattice to achieve, in a relatively short circumference of 528m, a bare lattice emittance of 0.33nmrad, which reduces to 0.2nmrad as insertion devices are added. The engineering implementation of the MBA lattice raises several technological problems. The large number of strong magnets per achromat calls for a compact design featuring small-gap combined-function magnets grouped into cells and sharing a common iron yoke. The small apertures lead to a low-conductance vacuum chamber design that relies on the chamber itself as a distributed copper absorber for the heat deposited by synchrotron radiation, while non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating provides for reduced photodesorption yields and distributed pumping. Finally, a low main frequency (100MHz) is chosen for the RF system yielding long bunches, which are further elongated by passively operated third-harmonic Landau cavities, thus alleviating collective effects, both coherent (e.g. resistive wall instabilities) and incoherent (intrabeam scattering). In this paper, we focus on the MAXIV 3GeV ring and present the lattice design as well as the engineering solutions to the challenges inherent to such a design. As the first realisation of a light source based on the MBA concept, the MAXIV 3GeV ring offers an opportunity for validation of concepts that are likely to be essential ingredients of future diffraction-limited light sources. © 2014 International Union of Crystallography.","multibend achromat; storage ring; synchrotron light source","Coherent scattering; Design; Incoherent scattering; Light sources; Magnets; Synchrotron radiation; Diffraction limited; Electron storage ring; Engineering implementation; Engineering solutions; Intra-beam scattering; multibend achromat; Non-evaporable getters; Synchrotron light source; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927737392

This paper illustrates the advances in the experimental analysis of the water retention behaviour of shales under non-isochoric conditions which have been recently achieved by the authors. The testing methodologies involve the direct control of the water content and the subsequent measurement of the total suction at equilibrium by a psychrometer. Furthermore, the volume change response of the material upon total suction variations can be investigated: A fluid displacement technique with a non-polar liquid is used in order to assess the volume changes of the shale samples and to compute the degree of saturation.

Thirty-day-old male Swiss mice were fed with HFD rich in saturated fat and green tea extract (GTE) for 8 weeks. After that, body weight and mass of fat depots were evaluated. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed 3 days prior to euthanasia; serum glucose, insulin and adiponectin were measured in fasted mice. Hypothalamic TLR4 pathway proteins, serotonin receptors 1B and 2C and serotonin transporter were analyzed by Western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A second set of animals was used to measure food intake in response to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Mice fed with HFD had increased body weight and mass of fat depots, impaired oral glucose tolerance, elevated glucose and insulin and decreased adiponectin serum levels. TLR4, IκB-α, nuclear factor κB p50 and interleukin 6 were increased by HFD. Concomitant GTE treatment ameliorated these parameters. The serotoninergic system remained functional after HFD treatment despite a few alterations in protein content of serotonin receptors 1B and 2C and serotonin transporter. In summary, the GTE attenuated the deleterious effects of the HFD investigated in this study, partially due to reduced hypothalamic inflammation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Green tea extract; High-fat diet; Hypothalamus; Neuroinflammation; Serotonin","adiponectin; fluoxetine; glucose; green tea extract; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insulin; interleukin 6; serotonin 2 receptor; serotonin receptor; serotonin transporter; toll like receptor 4; adiponectin; cholesterol; glucose blood level; I kappa B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insulin; interleukin 6; NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha; plant extract; tea; Tlr4 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 4; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; body mass; body weight; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; food intake; glucose blood level; hypothalamus; insulin blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mouse; nervous system inflammation; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; serotoninergic system; Western blotting; adipose tissue; adverse effects; animal; blood; chemistry; diet restriction; drug effects; genetics; glucose tolerance test; hypothalamus; inflammation; lipid diet; metabolism; pathology; tea; Animalia; Mus; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Cholesterol; Diet, High-Fat; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fasting; Glucose Tolerance Test; Hypothalamus; I-kappa B Proteins; Inflammation; Insulin; Interleukin-6; Male; Mice; NF-kappa B p50 Subunit; Plant Extracts; Tea; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926420091

This configuration is akin to several practical engineering applications, such as in the food (baking) industry, metal parts (heat treating) industry, and containerization (storage and transportation) of discrete solid goods. Because of the relative large size of the solid bodies placed inside the enclosure, a porous medium approach is not appropriate in the present case. Hence, the solid and fluid constituents within the enclosure are viewed individually and modeled using continuum balance equations, with suitable compatibility conditions imposed at their interfaces. The periodic heating is simulated by imposing a sinusoidal time-function on the hot wall temperature, while maintaining the cold wall temperature constant. Results are presented in terms of surface-averaged (hot and cold) Nusselt numbers, time-varying energy capacity (equal to the thermal energy stored inside the enclosure), isotherms and streamlines, for Ra varying from 103 to 107, Pr = 1 and 36 uniformly distributed, conducting and disconnected solid square blocks.

Combining these alternative energy sources with existing power systems requires systematic assessments and planning. The present study investigates the conversion of an existing power system into one with a windintegrated microgrid. The standard approach applies wind resource assessment to determine suitable wind farm locations with high potential energy and then develops specific dispatch strategies to meet the power demand for the wind-integrated system with low cost, high reliability, and low impact on the environment. However, the uncertainty in wind resource results in fluctuating power generation. The installation of additional energy storage devices is thus needed in the dispatch strategy to ensure a stable power supply. The present work proposes a design procedure for obtaining the optimal sizing of wind turbines and storage devices considering wind resource assessment and dispatch strategy under uncertainty. Two wind models are developed from real-world wind data and apply in the proposed optimization framework. Based on comparisons of system reliability between the optimal results and real operating states, an appropriate wind model can be chosen to represent the wind characteristics of a particular region. Results show that the trend model of wind data is insufficient for wind-integrated microgrid planning because it does not consider the large variation of wind data. The wind model should include the uncertainties of wind resource in the design of a wind-integrated microgrid system to ensure high reliability of optimal results.

This study aims to disentangle the contribution of movement strategies in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions in predicting the overall postural stability. The overall (OSI), anterior-posterior (APSI) and medial-lateral (MLSI) stability indexes were measured during standing with various sensory conditions by using computerized posturography. Postural stability of amputees was assessed while wearing three types of prosthetic feet: solid ankle cushion heel (SACH), single axis (SA) and energy storage and return (ESAR). We compared the movement strategies of ten unilateral transtibial amputees with nine able-bodied controls using the correlation analysis. The results indicated that amputees exhibited strong to very strong relationship (r= 0.82-0.99) between the OSI and MLSI score in all sensory conditions, in comparison with able-bodied group (r=0.10-0.90). Meanwhile, amputees showed very weak to very strong relationship (r=0.15-0.97) between the OSI and APSI score in comparison with able-bodied group (r=0.96-0.99). This study showed that a consistent strong relationship between OSI-MLSI was found in amputees group as for OSI-APSI in able-bodied group. Thus, movement strategies in below-knee amputees occurred most in medial-lateral direction compared to anterior-posterior direction in able-bodied group. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Patient rehabilitation; Anterior posteriors; Comparative studies; Correlation analysis; Lateral directions; Lower-limb amputations; Postural stability; Sensory conditions; Transtibial amputees; Artificial limbs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925597094

To enhance paraffin wax thermal conductivity, alumina (Al2O3) as a material which high conductivity was employed. Parafin wax was dispersed with alumina homogenously with volume fraction 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%.Objective: This paper examines the thermal conductivity enhancement using paraffin wax as a heat storage material by mixed with alumina (Al2O3) particles.Results:At starting heat, paraffin wax absorbs sensible heat and then latent heat which takes place at a temperature nearly constant. Similarly, at the beginning of the heating process, temperature increases rapidly until paraffin reach its melting temperature and tend to increased constantly after the temperature reached 60°C. Conclusion: The addition of Al2O3 particles which have a high thermal conductivity could able to increase thermal conductivity of paraffin wax as a heat storage media. Adding amount of Al2O3 particles will reduce latent heat thermal of energy storage material. The conduction heat transfers dominantly during melting and freezing processes. Alumina particles is play significantly in the solidification process comparing to melting process. During freezing process, solid layer was formed on top surface of heat exchanger and remain stable. It can be concluded that by adding alumina particles could increase heat exctraction during solidification process. As a results, it produces low latent heat and high thermal conductivity. © Research India Publications.","Latent heat thermal energy storage; Melting heat transfer; Paraffin wax-Al2O3; Phase change material",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925425720

In this regard, the accurate operation management of Micro-Grid (MG) with various types of renewable power sources (RES) can be an effective approach. This paper presents a novel solution methodology based on Teacher-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm to solve the optimal energy management of MG including several RESs with the back-up of Fuel Cell (FC), Wind Turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV) and Micro Turbine (MT). Moreover, storage devices have been considered to meet the energy mismatch. The solution of this nonlinear constraint optimization problem minimizes the total cost of the grid and RESs, concurrently. Nevertheless, in finding the optimal solution, the interactive effects of MG and utility in a 24 hour time interval are taken into consideration which would increase the complexity of the problem intensely. In order to explore the total search space globally, a modification method is proposed which is compromised of two modification methods based on TLBO. In the end, the suggested algorithm is tested through a typical renewable MG as the test system to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the other well-known algorithms. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

The temperature limit is given by the dielectric polypropylene which has a melting point in the range of 140 to 170°C, while glass is much higher. Thus, the temperature limit could potentially be overcome by use of thin, alkali-free glass as dielectric. Glass capacitors employing ultra-thin and high purity glass layers are promising devices for high temperature applications in oil, gas, aerospace, hybrid electric vehicles, DC transmission, and pulsed power systems. This includes emerging power electronic systems using silicon carbide switches and diodes. This work analyzes and compares various glasses with a thickness of less than 50 μm by dielectric spectroscopy and elemental analysis. It is demonstrated that glass is attractive as dielectric for a wide frequency range up to 200°C. It argues that the dielectric losses are currently too great for thin glass to be used within a commercial power capacitor. While high temperature prototypes already exist, we demonstrate through our analysis that further developments are required to integrate this promising device into commercial systems. It is seen that even trace amounts of alkali materials can have an impact on losses. These losses must be further reduced through fundamental research into polarization/conduction mechanisms of various glass components.

The development of new materials and processes is greatly helped by the understanding of the catalytic process at the molecular level on the macro/micro-kinetic time scale and on that of the actual bond breaking and bond making. The performance of heterogeneous catalysts is inherently the average over the ensemble of active sites. Much development aims at unravelling the structure of the active site; however, in general, these methods yield the ensemble-average structure. A benefit of X-ray-based methods is the large penetration depth of the X-rays, enabling in situ and operando measurements. The potential of X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy methods (XANES, EXAFS, HERFD, RIXS and HEROS) to directly measure the structure of the catalytically active site at the single nanoparticle level using nanometer beams at diffraction-limited storage ring sources is highlighted.

Accordingly, the present study utilizes a quality function deployment method to develop a wheelchair with a user-selectable manual/electric propulsion mode and an auxiliary solar power supply system. The auxiliary solar power supply increased the travel range of the wheelchair by approximately 26% compared with that of a wheelchair powered by battery alone. Moreover, the wheelchair has a modular design and can be disassembled and folded for ease of transportation or storage. Overall, the present results suggest that the proposed wheelchair provides an effective and convenient means of meeting the mobility needs of individuals with mobility difficulties. © 2014 Rehabilitation Research and Development Service.

In this method high purity carbon dioxide is captured at large emission sources, e. g. fossil fuelled power plants. The carbon dioxide can then be transported to a long term storage site, rather than being emitted to the atmosphere. Among the different alternatives for obtaining high purity carbon dioxide during combustion of fossil fuels, Chemical-looping Combustion (CLC) is one of the most promising. Here, the oxygen needed to oxidize a fuel is provided by a solid oxygen carrier. The oxygen carrier is subsequently circulated to another reactor where it is reoxidized with air. By separating these two operations mixing of the combustion products and the nitrogen in the air is avoided. An energy demanding gas separation is thus not necessary. The most crucial part of Chemical-looping Combustion is the solid oxygen carrier. The oxygen carrier should have high reactivity with fuel and oxygen, sufficient oxygen carrying capacity and preferably also low cost. Furthermore it is important that it is able to withstand the tough conditions it is exposed to in a hot fluidizing environment, both with respect to physical attrition and chemical degradation. The most commonly suggested setup of Chemicallooping Combustion is a dual fluidized bed system where gas velocities and mechanical abrasion can be high. When the technology was first demonstrated, nickel oxide based oxygen carriers were typically used. But as nickel is quite costly as well as potentially harmful, alternatives have been sought after. In 2009 Leion et al. [1] investigated an oxygen carrier based on calcium manganite of perovskite structure CaMnO3- δfor chemical looping combustion. The results were very promising and similar materials have since then been successfully tested in pilot ngs up to 120 kWth. including extended operation in continuously operating 10 kWth reactor with very positive results, see Kallen et al. [2], A key feature of these materials is that they are able to release gas phase oxygen at relevant conditions, so called Chemical-looping with Oxygen Uncouplmg, see Ryden et al. [3]. Having gas phase oxygen available for fuel oxidation makes gas-solid mixing less critical and thus makes it easier to reach complete fuel conversion.2 Most studies in which CaMnO3-δ based oxygen earners have been examined have been using particles manufactured from high quality chemicals. While that is reasonable in the early stages of development, cheaper raw materials would be favourable for mdustrial applications. Promismg oxygen carriers based on manganese ores have been manufactured and characterized by Fossdal et al. [4] and Mohammad Pour et al. [5]. This study aims to further examine CaMnO3-δ based oxygen carriers made from low cost, commercial raw materials available in large quantities such as manganese ore. The materials are exammed during continuous Chemical- looping Combustion and Oxygen Uncouplmg in an experimental reactor with the nominal fuel power 300 The reactor has previously been used in numerous studies which make comparisons with materials made from Ingli purity chemicals straightforward. Duiing operation several gas concentrations as well as temperatures and pressure drops are measured which allows monitoring of the chemical reactions and fluidization behaviour in the reactor. Fines (particlcs &lt;45 j.im) arc collcctcd from exiting gas streams which gives an indication of the degree of attrition of the particles. Attrition was also studied in separate jet cup attrition test. The study show that it is possible to manufacture CaMn03 based oxygen carrier with appropriate properties for continuous operation from low-cost materials. The ability to release gas phase oxygen to an inert atmosphere and high conversion of natural gas is demonstrated. The results indicate that tins approach should be feasible also for large-scale applications. © 2014 The Authors.

Captured CO2 is injected into saline aquifers to store pressure, generate artesian flow of brine, and provide an additional working fluid for efficient heat extraction and power conversion. Concentric rings of injection and production wells are used to create a hydraulic divide to store pressure, CO2, and thermal energy. Such storage can take excess power from the grid and excess/waste thermal energy and dispatch that energy when it is demanded, enabling increased penetration of variable renewables. Stored CO2functions as a cushion gas to provide enormous pressure-storage capacity and displaces large quantities of brine, which can be desalinated and/or treated for a variety of beneficial uses.

The injection of gigatons of carbon dioxide poses challenges for pressure management and the mechanical integrity of the storage complex. Optimizing the injection strategy, controlling deformation, preventing leakage and assuring safe long term containment requires reliable and predictive hydromechanical modelling. Based on a newly derived thermodynamically consistent set of equations we have developed fully coupled codes in one, two and three dimensions. In accordance with field observations and laboratory measurements, stress dependent poroviscoelastoplastic deformation is taken into account. Our simulations predict the spontaneous formation of selflocalizing high-porosity channels (or pathway flow) under conditions applicable to CO2 storage in reservoirs. These channels form due to mechanical instabilities that occur as a natural outcome of buoyancy driven flow in viscoplastically deforming rocks. Our results indicate that viscous deformation may explain the formation of chimneys such as those observed at the Sleipner pilot, and that non-linear effects have a major impact on the velocity and distribution of the fluid as well as on stress and deformation of the rock matrix. Thus, complex rheology and non-linear coupling between porosity, permeability, pressures and stresses should be included in state of the art reservoir simulation software in order to determine safe injection and storage conditions and correctly model observations and monitoring results. © 2014 The Authors.

The roadmap has been established in close cooperation with main CCS stakeholders. As guidance for the roadmap, a vision on CCS in the Netherlands for 2050 has been developed. The vision depicts the view of the stakeholders on the role of CCS in the energy system. This roadmap can serve as a solid foundation for CCS stakeholders from both industry and government but also from universities and research institutes to define their next activities.

It was originally intended to reach a final investment decision at the end of 2010, but the project has faced a series delay associated with permitting, complex commercial negotiations and, most seriously, funding. At the moment (September 2014), the European Commission and the Government of the Netherlands are engaged in a renewed push to solve the funding problems and allow construction to finally start. The project has financial support from the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) and the Government of the Netherlands and is now the only one of the six projects originally supported that still has any realistic prospect of being realized in the short term. This paper presents an update of the overall project development as at the time of GHGT-12 and the accomplished milestones and issues met in the permitting process. In addition, it will focus on the technical and economic aspects of integrating the capture plant with the power plant. Furthermore, it will provide an outlook on future CCS/CCU developments in Rotterdam, describing the steps under development to create a full CO2 hub in the port including options for ship transport and bio-CCS.

In most cases a laser beam shaping system consists of conventional lenses with curved surfaces. However these lenses are bulky and their fabrication precisions are limited. In this work, we design and fabricate a lens for laser beam shaping using nanostructures. The lens is designed with traditional geometrical optical methods, using energy conservation and optical coordinate transformation algorithms. But instead of using curved surfaces to implement the lens design, we realize the designs with dielectric nanostructures. The lens is then fabricated using electron beam lithography to achieve a high precision. The fabricated lens has very low profile and is capable of fine tuning laser beams. The lens is then experimentally tested. In the experimental setup a laser beam is directed into a multimode fiber and the irradiance of the output beam irradiance profile is measured. Then the lens is placed in front of the multimode fiber and the outcome beam irradiance profile is measured again to test the effects of our laser beam shaping lens. © 2014 SPIE.","Gaussian beam; Laser beam shaping; Multimode fiber; Nano-structures","Design; Digital storage; Electron beam lithography; Fabrication; Gaussian beams; Laser beams; Laser materials processing; Lenses; Mathematical transformations; Multimode fibers; Nanostructures; Optical data storage; Application area; Co-ordinate transformation; Conventional lens; Irradiance profiles; Laser beam shaping; Material processing; Medical procedures; Nano-structured; Laser beam effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922724784

The energy harvesting interface circuit for micro-power applications uses equivalent voltage of the piezoelectric materials have been developed and simulated. Circuit designs and simulation results are presented for a conventional diode rectifier with voltage doubler in passive technique. Most of the existing techniques are mainly passive-based energy harvesting circuits. Generally, the power harvesting capability of the passive technique is very low. To increase the harvested energy, the active technique and its components such as MOSFET, thyristor and transistor have chosen to design the proposed energy harvesting interface circuit. In this study, it has simulated both the conventional in passive circuit and developed energy harvester in active technique. The developed interface circuits consisting of piezoelectric element with input source of vibration, AC-DC thyristor doubler rectifier circuit and DC-DC boost converter using thyristor with storage device. In the development circuits, it is noted that the components thyristor instead of mainly diode available in conventional circuits have chosen. Because the forward voltage potential (0.7 V) is higher than the incoming input voltage (0.2 V). Finally, the complete energy harvester using PSPICE software have designed and simulated. The proposed circuits in PSPICE generate the boost-up DC voltage up to 2 V. The overall efficiency of the developed circuit is 70%, followed by the software simulation, which is greater than conventional circuit efficiency of 20% in performance evaluator. It is concluded that the developed circuit output voltage can be used to operate for the applications in autonomous devices. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.","AC-DC rectifier; Autonomous devices; DC-DC boost converter; Energy harvesting; Piezoelectric element",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922559472

CO2 can be from different sources in a wide temperature, pressure and concentrations range. Meanwhile, new liquid absorbents are under-development to cost-effectively separate CO2 from gas mixtures. All this makes it crucial to analyze the energy consumption for CO2 separation from different streams and with different absorbents. In this work, the theoretical energy consumption of CO2 separation from flue gas (CO2/N2), lime kiln gas (CO2/N2), biogas (CO2/CH4) and bio-syngas (CO2/H2/CO) was calculated. The results show that the energy consumption of CO2 separation from flue gas is the highest and that from biogas is the lowest. If the CO2 captured from flue gases was substituted by that from biogases, the energy saving would be equivalent to 28.13 million ton standard coal globally. The energy consumption of CO2 separation from biogas using traditional absorbent of 30%MEA and new developed ionic liquids (ILs) was further studied, in which 1-ethyl-3-methy- limidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide ([Emim][NTf2]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] imide ([Hmim][Tf2N]) and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide ([Bmpy][Tf2N]) were screened from 75 ILs. The energy consumptions of CO2 separation using ILs are lower than those of 30%MEA and that of [Bmim][BF4] is the lowest in the four screened ILs. With a very low vapor pressure and high CO2 solubility, it's promising to use ILs as absorbents for CO2 separation. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 capture; CO2 separation; Ionic liquids",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922361376

To establish the relationship between photoinitiator system and nanofiller size on the optical properties and cure efficiency of model composites. Methods. Model composites based on BisGMA/TEGDMA (60:40 mol%) were loaded with 40 wt% of 7 nm or 16 nm-sized filler particles. One of the following photoinitiator systems was added: camphorquinone (CQ) associated with an amine (EDMAB), monoacylphosphine oxide (TPO), or bysacylphosphine oxide (BAPO). The optical properties of disk-shaped specimens were measured 24 h after curing and repeated after storage in water for 90 days and coffee for 15 days. A large spectrum LED unit (Bluephase G2, Ivoclar Vivadent) was used for photoactivation. CIE L∗a∗b∗ parameters, color difference (ΔE), and translucency parameter (TP) were calculated. Knoop hardness readings were taken at top and bottom composite surfaces. Cure efficiency was determined by bottom/top hardness ratio. Data were statistically analyzed at α = 0.05 significance level. Results. Composites formulated with 16 nm particles had higher CIE L∗ than those with 7 nm particles in all storage conditions. BAPO-based composites generally had lower CIE a∗ than the other composites. The group TPO + 16 nm before storage and all groups with 16 nm-sized particles after storage had lower CIE b∗ (i.e. lower degree of yellowing) than the other groups. TPO-based materials had higher color stability. The cure efficiency was not significantly affected by photoinitiator system or particle size. CQ + 7 nm had the lowest and BAPO + 16 nm the highest hardness values. Significance. Combination of photoinitiator system and filler particle size might affect the optical properties of composites, with low influence on cure efficiency. © 2014 Academy of Dental Materials.","Alternative photoinitiators; BAPO; Camphorquinone; CIELAB; Fumed silica; Storage; TPO","Colorimetry; Curing; Digital storage; Efficiency; Energy storage; Fillers; Hardness; Optical disk storage; Particle size; Storage (materials); BAPO; Camphorquinone; CIELab; Fumed silicas; Photoinitiators; TPO; Optical properties; resin; color; dental curing light; nanotechnology; Color; Composite Resins; Curing Lights, Dental; Nanotechnology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922338245

This container has lots of applications and can be designed as stationary solution in remote areas such as rural electrification and a mobile solution for disaster situation, military purposes and exploration teams. In this study the container is a hybrid PV/wind/engine energy system that is designed to provide electricity and drinkable water for 1000 person in disaster situations. A transient model implemented in Transient Simulation System (TRNSYS) program is developed and performance of the system during one-year operation for two locations (Nairobi in Kenya and Nyala in Sudan) with relatively high solar insolation is analyzed. The result of the model is significantly important in order to choose the right size of the different components. Due to the fluctuations of solar and wind energy as well as the importance of the battery life cycle, there is a need to have a smart power management and an appropriate fast response control system. In order to achieve it and to fulfill the energy demand as much as possible through renewable energies, a dispatch strategy is introduced and a control algorithm is applied to the model. This control algorithm has increased system reliability and power availability. The transient simulation shows that the share of power generation by solar energy is 63% and 80% and the share of wind power is 27% and 12% in Nairobi and Nyala respectively. It means that most of the energy demand (around 90%) can be covered by renewable energy.

Several technologies are commercialized for utilizing solar energy in the buildings by absorbing solar radiation and converting it to heat and electricity. These technologies can be categorized into the passive and active systems. A special case is a commercial greenhouse, which can be considered a passive solar building. A greenhouse is a structure which is covered by a transparent device such as glass in order to use solar energy while controlling the temperature, humidity and other parameters according to the requirements for cultivation and protection of the particular plants. The cooling demand in the commercial greenhouses is commonly supplied by e.g. ventilation and thermal screen. In the ventilation method a portion of the absorbed solar energy will be lost through ventilation windows and by applying the solar shielding, solar radiation will be blocked. In this study, by considering the solar blind concept as an active system, PVT panels are integrated to absorb the surplus solar heat (instead of blocking) which is then stored in a thermal energy storage for supplying a portion of the greenhouse heating demand at a later time. The overall objective of this study is to assess the potential of cutting external energy demand as well as maximizing solar energy utilization in a commercial greenhouse for Northern climate condition. Thus, a feasibility assessment has been carried out, examining various system configurations with the TRNSYS tool. The results show that the heating demand for a commercial closed greenhouse with solar blind is reduced by 80%, down to 62 kwh/m2 as compared to a conventional configuration. Also the annual total useful heat gain and electricity generation by solar blind in this concept is around 20 kwh/m2 and 80kwh/m2, respectively. The generated electricity can be used for supplying the greenhouse power demand for e.g. artificial lighting and other devices. Moreover, the cooling demand in a closed greenhouse is reduced by 60% by considering the solar blind system. © 2014 The Authors.

This attribute makes concentrating solar power ideally suited to compensate for fluctuations in other renewable energy sources. In order to analyze this market role, three scenarios were modeled, with low, medium and high penetrations of nondispatchable renewables (i.e. wind and solar photovoltaics). The demand that cannot be met by these variable sources is met by a solar thermal power plant with heat provided either by a solar field and storage system or a back-up gas burner. For each scenario, the size of the solar field and storage were varied in order to show the trade-off between the levelized generation costs of the system, the annual specific CO2 emissions and the share of renewable electricity generation. The results show that, regardless of the scenario, there exist optimum plant configurations with viable costs whilst simultaneously ensuring a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, it is shown that the limited flexibility of the power block prevents the system from reaching higher levels of sustainability. Lastly, the results were compared with an equivalent combined cycle power plant, showing that solutions involving solar thermal power can be justified in environmental terms only if large storage units are integrated into the plants. © 2014 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrating solar power; Electricity demand; Renewable energy; Solar thermal power; Thermal energy storage",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922279172

To compensate for renewable energy fluctuations in the electrical grid, a gas turbine (GT) engine needs to be more flexible, operating in peaking and partial loading modes as well as the base-load operation mode. Understanding how these different modes affect the lifetime of turbine components is critical to ensuring favourable RAM (Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability). Component lifetimes in peaking modes are limited by the number of thermo-mechanical cycles that a component can experience before crack initiation. The useful lifetime of some components can be increased by basing the predicted lifetime on the number of cycles for crack initiation plus the number of cycles for the crack to reach its maximum allowable length based on the fracture toughness K1C criterion for linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). This is usually accomplished by using the Paris law to predict the rate of crack growth. Once cracks are formed, further propagation depends on the states of stress and strain near the cracks. These factors, which drive crack growth, can be quantified by the energy release rate. The Paris law predicts crack growth as a function of the energy release rate under linear elastic conditions, commonly for load controlled tests with load ration R&gt;0. However, large thermal and mechanical loading can result in plastic deformation under cyclic loading conditions. Most GT components operate under strain controlled conditions generated by thermal loading. In this paper, a novel method is used to characterize crack growth under cyclic strain conditions in regions under plastic strain. The experimental data reveal that the rate of crack growth changes under plastic conditions in comparison with the linear elastic case. Especially compared to very high stress intensities δK of load controlled tests, here the allowable displacement limiting strain control matters. Applying experimental data from material tested under cyclic loading and elastic-plastic material response, component lifetime has been reliably predicted. Hereafter the developed method is referred to as elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) lifetime assessment. The EPFM approach more closely predicts the observed rate of crack growth than linear elastic fracture mechanics. LEFM over-predicts component lifetime for cracks growing in plastic regions under cyclic loading and could lead to catastrophic failure of a component. Therefore, the lifetime of a highly loaded component is more reliably assessed using the EPFM approach, as demonstrated for two alloys in this paper.

This feature is introduced as auto-reinforce performance which means giving-back the kinetic energy for flywheel after speed-down occurred (as result of sudden loading). Auto-reinforce performance is an ability to recover the kinetic rotational energy which significantly keeps longer the stored energy of a flywheel device. This novel concept of flywheel is engineered by installing a number of Permanent Magnets (PM) in certain mounting. Hence, the magnetism configuration such magnetic strength, magnetic energy density, pole direction, geometry, and dimension are influential parameters to the mechanical performance. By practicing Finite Element Magnetic Modeling (FEMM), it is possible to predict some designed mechanical parameters such magnetic force and magnetic torque. Finally by evaluating these mechanical parameters, the key performance of this device such as percentage of energy reinforcement and percentage of discharge elongation can be predicted. The main ideas of this paper are: 1) presenting the development stages especially in design prediction using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software; and 2) discovering the correlation of designed magnetic properties and mechanical parameters for prototyping references. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Finite element magnetic modeling; Flywheel energy storage system; Permanent magnet energy","Automotive engineering; Energy storage; Finite element method; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Forecasting; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Loading; Magnetism; Magnets; Permanent magnets; Software prototyping; Wheels; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel energy storage system; Magnetic energy densities; Magnetic modeling; Mechanical parameters; Mechanical performance; Performance prediction; Permanent magnets (pm); Magnetic storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922064070

The current and common technology for monitoring and the determination of the engine oil viscosity using the oil analysis method is found to be uneconomical and ineffective. On the same vein, this paper presents an investigation of the capability of the Metal Magnetic Memory (MMM) technology in the processes of monitoring and detecting the variation of petrol engine lubricant viscosity via in-situ operation. A few investigations were conducted on a Robin Engine 126 cc EX 13D single cylinder of four strokes with water cooling. One multi-grade engine lubricant oil condition has been put to the test; namely, SAE 15W-40. During the investigation of the petrol engine oil viscosity, the magnetic field signal is captured when the engine oil in-service age is 0 km (fresh oil), 250 km, 500 km, 750 km and 1,000 km, with the crankshaft rotational speed of 2500 rpm at three different locations such as at the Bottom Dead Centre (BDC), oil sump A (engine oil inlet), and oil sump B. The lubrication condition in the petrol engine is successfully monitored based on the magnetic field signatures generated by the interaction between the piston surface and the layer of the lubricant during the time when the engine was in operation. The generated MMM signatures were captured using a type 2 scanning device with two ferroprobe sensors and a length measuring sensor and recorded by the TSC-3M-12 type device. The waveform signatures captured were displayed as length domain signal and then were analysed using the MATLAB software to determine the magnetic field energy (EH). In addition, the real viscosity value at room temperature was determined using the Haake Viscotester 6 L, each time after the magnetic field signal was captured. The results of these studies have shown that the magnetic field energy (EH) is inversely proportional to engine oil viscosity. Finally, the MMM technology can be utilised in promoting economic development and effective planning of the maintenance schedule of the petrol engine oil. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Engine oil; Magnetic field energy; Metal magnetic memory; Viscosity","Automotive engineering; Crankshafts; Economic and social effects; Engines; Ferromagnetic materials; Gasoline; Location based services; Lubricating oils; Lubrication; Magnetic devices; Magnetic fields; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; MATLAB; Oil shale; Viscosity; Economic development; Engine oil; Lubrication condition; Magnetic field energy; Magnetic field signature; Maintenance schedules; Metal magnetic memory; Metal magnetic memory technologies; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922008876

Biodiesel fuel from vegetable oil is considered as the best candidates for diesel fuel replacement in diesel engines because of its closer. Fuel prices are going up day by day in the world. Thus, the means and methods have been trying for years to get fuel alternative outcomes. This study investigated the effects of different storage periods used in quality biodiesel blends (B5, B10, B15) of waste cooking oil and diesel fuel under low temperature and the temperature of the environment. Biodiesel samples were stored in glass containers under indoor conditions, and outdoor conditions for 10 weeks in total. These samples were monitored on a weekly basis through the test properties. The experimental density, viscosity, acid value, water content and flash point were discussed in detail.

In this paper, a conceptual design of an MAV with a main drive system using shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator to provide the flapping motion is proposed. SMA is considered superior to other smart materials due to its efficiency and large energy storage capacity. By incorporating SMA in the flapping wing MAV, it will provide users the flexibility to add more payloads by reducing bulky cables or reduce operating cost by using less fuel.

The storage system is part of the Wireless Sensor Energy Harvesting to store and amplify the energy harvested from the surroundings. Finding a new sources of renewable energy has becomes a fashionable among researchers nowadays in particular harvesting the energy from the surrounding. However the challenge raised is to boost up the energy that known are very low. Thus the proposed method must be consumes very little power and suitable for ambient environmental sources such as vibration, wind and RF energy and be able to boost up the energy for storage system. The output of the harvested voltage is insufficient for most applications, therefore the system will boost up the input voltage level using DC to DC converter topology to higher dc voltage.The DC to DC converter shall be designed to suit the types of storage required. The output voltage of this DC converter should be sufficient to charge either capacitor or supercapacitor that will be use in this system as the energy storage system. The supercapacitor will provide power to energize any system such as in this case wireless sensor network[1]. In the case of wireless sensor network for example, the node would require the energy during transmitting and receiving data only whereas during standby mode or sleep mode, the amount of energy required would be very small[2]. Therefore the storage system will make use of this standby time or sleep mode of the sensor node to store as much energy as possible.

The depletion of fossil fuels, the rise in oil prices, and the increase in power demand are the main causes of this problem. Concern over environmental conditions and human health make renewable energy one of the most viable alternative solutions to this crisis. Among various types of renewable energy, fuel cell technology shows a great potential in the electrical energy sector for several reasons, such as high efficiency, clean operation, and immunity to the adverse effects of weather conditions. Recent works prove that fuel cell technology is expected to be a better choice for distributed generation purposes.Distributed generation, which is installed near load centers, can moderate the stress of high electricity demand in the mainstream utility grid. This paper presents an overview of fuel cell technology, with emphasis on fuel cell types, characteristics, and applications. The differences among the various fuel cell types and the dynamic models of each type required for simulation are also discussed. Focus is given to the application of fuel cells in a distributed generation system, the requirements of a fuel cell-based generating system, and issues in distributed generation integration. The present study also discusses the power conditioning unit, which is an important component in the fuel cell-based generating system, as well as its control strategy. Discussion is likewise made on the use of suitable energy storage units for the fuel cell distributed generation system, with regard to battery types and storage control. By adding energy storage units to the fuel cell system, the capabilities of the existing generation system can improve system stability performance.","Distributed generation; Energy storage system; Fuel cell; Power conditioning unit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920549258

The resulting porous, robust and electrically conductive hybrid layer was used to fabricate electroactive polymer actuators both as perpendicularly expanding actuators and as bending trilayer actuators. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy confirm successful incorporation of CDC in the PPy matrix. Cyclic voltammograms confirm slightly higher charging/discharging currents of the PPyCDC hybrid. This indicates the successful coupling of CDC in order to increase electric double-layer capacitance in the hybrid films. The maximum steady state electromechanical diametrical strain is 13% for hybrid material which is in the same order of magnitude as for PPy and 10 more than previously reported CDC films made with nonconducting polymer binders. Furthermore, the expanding actuators made from hybrid material are more efficient than non-modified PPy actuators, having doubled the amount of swelling per injected charge. This improvement is very important since the low energy efficiency is a major shortcoming for ionic electroactive polymers.

As the country develops, with more buildings being built, and as the population grows, with more people demanding thermal comfort in the buildings they work and live in, the rate of electricity consumption for cooling purposes will continue to increase dramatically from year to year. This phenomenon requires the application of alternative energy options and thermal storage. Ground thermal storage is an example of thermal storage which can supply cooling and heating effects resulting in a significant reduction of electricity consumption. This paper discusses the potential of the implementation of ground thermal storage by using a ground heat exchanger (GHE) to supply passive cooling for any application. An analysis has been conducted based on an empirical equation from conduction heat transfer for depths of up to 30 m and thermal diffusivities from 0.04 to 0.1 m2/day. The main input parameters were obtained from a local weather station for three consecutive years. The result showed that a significant reduction occurs at a depth of 2.0 m and below, meaning that cooling can be supplied constantly throughout the year. The temperature amplitude is also attenuated relatively with depth, whereby amplitudes of less than 1 °C occur at a depth of more than 4 m with a thermal diffusivity of 0.04 m2/day. In addition, thermal diffusivity gives a significant increment in temperature amplitude and it is suggested to be maintained at a value of less than 0.06 m2/day. This result provides useful information to researchers and engineers in the field of underground installation of materials or systems such as gas pipelines, water supply and for underground cable transmittance.","Ground heat exchanger; Mathematical model; Underground temperature variation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920166226

This offers the opportunity to cover parts of the process energy demand with concentrated solar power (CSP) and thereby increase the fuel production and carbon conversion efficiency. A plant is examined that produces 1st and 2nd generation ethanol by fermentation of sugars (from sugarcane) and enzymatic hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic residues (bagasse), respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis is a promising alternative for 2nd generation biofuels due to its high conversion efficiency and low environmental impact. In conventional ethanol production processes, electrical and thermal power is delivered to the system by burning parts of the feedstock to drive a steam based cogeneration cycle (between 400 and 800K). Introducing high temperature thermal power (at 800K) from a solar trough field coupled with sensible heat storage, for continuous operation, offers the opportunity to replace the heat generated from biomass burning, and thus increase the product yield.

Based on the exergy analysis of the plant, the incorporation of an ORC to the existing heat recovery system was modelled. Cyclopentane was chosen as the working fluid and the best configuration of the cycle was determined according its vapor saturation curve. The efficiency improvement was quantified using two exergy indexes and a proposed indicator based on the energy consumption in the plant, assuming a distributed part-load operation of two gas turbines SGT-400. The exergy analysis was carried out along an arbitrary production profile formed by 16 scenarios, where the following production parameters were analyzed separately: (i) oil flow, (ii) gas flow, (iii) production water flow, (iv) injected water flow and (v) well pressure. The evaporation temperature of the ORC working fluid was updated in order to reduce its mass flow rate. According to the results, the overall energy efficiency and the ORC power output are strongly influenced by the amounts of gas and water injected back to the reservoir. On the other hand, the exergy breakdown indicates the exhaust gas stream as the greatest exergy loss within the plant. Concerning the proposed ORC, it appears with a great potential for generating useful work from waste heat associated with the exhaust gases, representing savings along the production profile of about 15% based on the energy consumption.","Brazilian FPSO; Exergy analysis; Organic rankine cycle; Waste heat recovery","Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Exergy; Exhaust gases; Floating production storage and offloading; Flow of gases; Flow of water; Gas turbines; Hydraulics; Oil wells; Rankine cycle; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Water injection; Brazilian FPSO; Efficiency improvement; Evaporation temperature; Exergy Analysis; Floating production , storage and offloading units; Organic Rankine cycles; Overall energy efficiency; Production parameters; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915746124

In this paper, a control strategy is proposed for a DC-MG to achieve perfect power sharing considering the effects of line resistances. The DC-MG under study consists of a photovoltaic system, two energy storage systems, a grid-connected converter system, and dc loads.

A hybrid on-chip memory architecture that combines SPM with a mini-cache has been proposed. One key issue for hybrid on-chip memory architectures is to reduce the number of off-chip memory accesses and energy consumption. Existing methods achieve this by moving the most frequently accessed data into SPM. However, these methods may be ineffective because the main source of off-chip memory accesses may not be the most frequently accessed data. Instead, most off-chip memory accesses are caused by cache misses, so reducing the latter will reduce the former. Cache misses are mainly caused by data contending for cache lines. Therefore, this paper proposes a contention-aware SPM allocation method for hybrid on-chip management. The number of cache misses for a page is used as a metric to determine whether a page should be moved to SPM. When the number of misses for a page exceeds a threshold, the page is moved to SPM, reducing cache contention. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy delay product by 35% to 53% compared to a cache-only on-chip memory architecture and 19% to 31% compared to an existing hybrid on-chip memory architecture. © 2014 IEEE.","cache; energy-delay product (EDP); hybrid on-chip memory; scratchpad memory (SPM)","Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; Storage allocation (computer); Allocation methods; cache; Contention-aware; Energy delay product; Higher efficiency; On chip memory; Scratch pad memory; Scratchpad memory allocations; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913589180

Currently, WSN NODEs are extensively powered up using batteries, but the battery has limitation of lifetime, power density, and environmental concerns. To overcome this issue, energy harvester (EH) is developed and presented in this paper. Solar-based EH has been identified as the most viable source of energy to be harvested for autonomous WSN NODEs. Besides, a novel chemical-based EH is reported as the potential secondary source for harvesting energy because of its uninterrupted availability. By integrating both solar-based EH and chemical-based EH, a hybrid energy harvester (HEH) is developed to power up WSN NODEs. Experimental results from the real-time deployment shows that, besides supporting the daily operation of WSN NODE and Router, the developed HEH is capable of producing a surplus of 971 mA·hr equivalent energy to be stored inside the storage for NODE and 528.24 mA·hr equivalent energy for Router, which is significantly enough for perpetual operation of autonomous WSN NODEs used in environmental parameter profiling. © 2014 Mukter Zaman et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912118974

However, these systems have low efficiency due to high power dissipation. A recent concept called ""digital hydraulics"" comprises particularities that create opportunities for a reduction in load loss. This paper proposes a configuration and control method for actuator speed control based on the principles of digital hydraulics. In this context, several fixed displacement units and on/off valves are connected directly to the actuators without throttling valves. The system studied here presents three operation methods (pump mode, motor mode and idle mode), which allows discrete valves to replace continuous or flow control valves in order to control the actuator. Furthermore, a fixed or variable displacement pump with large displacement is replaced by several small, fixed displacement units. Simulations are performed with a co-simulation technique using AMESim and MATLAB. The actuator speed, inlet and outlet pressures on the fixed displacement units and flow rate in the circuit lines are analysed. Preliminary simulation results exhibit smooth transitions between speed levels, adequate dynamic performance, low power dissipation and high energy-storage capacity. A specific limitation of this technology is the obtained actuator discrete speed. The main contributions of this research are the development of a digital hydraulic system configuration and its control strategy, which allows speed control of hydraulic actuators and provides the capacity to store energy.

This paper explains how public domain Earth Observation data based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Second Generation Meteosat (MSG), Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and various altimeter measurements can be used to estimate net water production (rainfall (P) &gt; evapotranspiration (ET)) and net water consumption (ET &gt; P) of Nile Basin agro-ecosystems. Rainfall data from TRMM and the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS-NET) RainFall Estimates (RFE) products were used in conjunction with actual evapotranspiration from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) and ETLook models. Water flows laterally between net water production and net water consumption areas as a result of runoff and withdrawals. This lateral flow between the 15 sub-basins of the Nile was estimated, and partitioned into stream flow and non-stream flow using the discharge data. A series of essential water metrics necessary for successful integrated water management are explained and computed. Net water withdrawal estimates (natural and humanly instigated) were assumed to be the difference between net rainfall (Pnet) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) and some first estimates of withdrawals-without flow meters-are provided. Groundwater-dependent ecosystems withdraw large volumes of groundwater, which exceed water withdrawals for the irrigation sector. There is a strong need for the development of more open-access Earth Observation databases, especially for information related to actual ET. The fluxes, flows and storage changes presented form the basis for a global framework to describe monthly and annual water accounts in ungauged river basins. © 2014 by the authors.","Evapotranspiration; Nile basin; Rainfall; Remote sensing; Water accounting; Water consumption; Water production","Digital storage; Ecology; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Food supply; Groundwater; Image reconstruction; Observatories; Radiometers; Rain; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Rivers; Runoff; Satellite imagery; Stream flow; Water management; Water supply; Groundwater dependent ecosystems; Integrated water management; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Nile basins; Tropical rainfall measurement missions; Water accountings; Water consumption; Water production; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912059183

This ATES is one of the largest European aquifer thermal energy storage systems, and has a seasonal imbalance problem. Reasons for this issue may be the high cooling demand from laboratories, office buildings and the direct ATES cooling system. Annually, cooling towers use on average 250 MWh electricity for the removal of about 5 GWh of excess heat from the ATES to the surroundings. In addition, the TU/e uses a large amount of natural gas for heating purposes and especially for peak supplies. Recovering the surplus heat of the ATES, a CO2 Trans-critical Heat Pump (HP) system to cover particularly peak demands and total heating demand is proposed, modeled and optimized. The model is validated using data from International Energy Agency. Based on simulation results, 708294 nm3 of natural gas are saved where two different scenarios were considered for the ATES efficiency, cost saving and green house gas reduction. In scenario I, the COP of the ATES increased up to 50% by which K€ 303.3 energy cost and 1288.5 ton CO2 are saved annually. On the other hand, it will be shown that the ATES COP in Scenario II will improve up to 20%.

The impact of future electricity price tariffs on dairy farm energy costs was quantified and the efficacy of adjusting milking time to mitigate peak electricity prices was explored. A dairy farm electricity and economic model was applied to assess the potency of technology investment strategies to improve farm profitability and deliver a return on capital invested. The results of this study showed that the most efficacious technology investment strategy to increase farm profitability consisted of a direct expansion milk cooling system with pre-cooling of milk to 15°C with well-water prior to entry to the milk storage tank and heating water with an electrical water heating system. An individual farmer can also choose to minimise electricity use, related costs and GHG emissions, with the trade-off of reduced profitability by adding a solar thermal water heating system. Or indeed minimise electricity costs, with the trade-off of reduced performance in the areas of farm profitability, electricity use and associated GHG emissions by choosing an ice bank cooling system. Analysis of various electricity tariffs showed that the Day&Night electricity tariff minimised annual electricity costs. Likewise, we have provided information showing that electricity cost savings of over 30% can be realized by milking earlier in the morning and later in the evening.

To better comprehension of the process, definition of this production system can be divided into phases. Phase I corresponds to the selection of number of wells and type of the well. Then, following the previous work (Franco, 2003), in the Phase II, the layout arrangement of wells and the set of the stationary Floating Production Unit (FPU) are selected. And, in the Phase III, storage and offloading alternatives for the produced oil and gas are selected. The present paper aims to identify environmental impacts associated with the each component of an offshore system for oil and gas production, and quantify each of them through indexes. It is expected to support the decision makers to select the best fitted system for a given offshore petroleum field. The increasing needs of petroleum to fulfill the energy matrix demanded in Brazil, the growing concern of the society for keeping the environment clean and the inclusion of an index related to the environment besides the technical and technological indexes usually taken makes it an important contribution to improve the process for selection and decision about the offshore production system. Particularly, it will be fundamental in the adverse condition of the Pre-salt scenario of petroleum production, in ultra-deep water depth and oil and gas with more aggressive contaminants to the system. The proposed methodology follows a similar procedure for the assessment of environmental impacts through the use of environmental sensitivity index (ESI) and the use of impact matrix (NOOA, 1997; Patin, 1999; Mariano and La Rovere, 2006). For the estimation of environmental impacts, it was defined the ESI of the area to be developed, and it was constructed an impact matrix based on the activities involved in the installation of platform, operational phase and decommissioning of a FPU and the elements from environment. Therefore, this systematic and structured approach allowed incorporating to the process of selection of the offshore production system for an oil and gas field the selection of alternative which combines the best technical and technological characteristics with better aspects from the environment.

The use of this concept with an opening for boat docking seems to provide a feasible solution for the people transfer in harsh environments, especially in areas like pre-salt Brazilian offshore fields, which are also very far from the coast. Although the helicopter technology has been improved in recent years to attend transport requirements from shore to the platforms, the use of a hub platform at sea still shows some economical and operational advantages, related to the conventional operations. Although the sheltered area provided by the interior of the monocolumn platform seems to solve the transfer problem in harsh environments, the hydrodynamic behavior of the moonpool became a problem to be solved during the feasibility studies of the concept, since the moonpool water column elevations tends to be resonant in special cases. To deal with this problem, some attempts were done to absorb the wave energy inside the moonpool and eliminate its resonance, achieving the desired level of absorption. This work shows the attempts and the results obtained, which has proven the feasibility of the concept.

Among other benefits, it should increase profitability by enlarging the number of customers and accelerating processes and communication. Indeed by 2012, 92% of the Swedish micro, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) had a website presenting their companies; the construction sector for once is no exception. Looking at SME building contractors we inquire into whether the announced potential of being online has been realized and, in particular if their relations to customers have improved. Referring to customer relationship management and e-business studies, we focus on 4 aspects of websites to assess their qualities: content, convenience, control and interaction. The material consists of a sample of 90 building contractors of the region of Gothenburg in Sweden. We have examined the companies' websites, checked their profile, contacted them by phone and carried out in-depth interviews with 21 of them. The results show quite diversified strategies and benefits of their use of websites. Updating the sites regularly or gaining customers seem to be the exception, and the uses of the web sites are so far rather rudimentary. If there is no surprise in the SMEs building their customers relationship on direct contact and local network, the passivity and lack of visibility towards new customers and business opportunity are nevertheless intriguing. Even more as the sector is facing a rather bad reputation in the public. Finally a close contact with clients is said to be one of the most important factors contributing to innovation which these SMEs acutely need to face the new energy regulations.","Customers' relations; Renovation; SME; Websites","Construction industry; Contractors; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Management science; Project management; Public relations; Sales; Social networking (online); Building contractors; Business opportunities; Construction sectors; Customer relationship management; Customers' relations; Renovation; Small and medium-sized enterprise; SME; Websites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911419671

One specific solution is virtual power plants (VPP) of electric vehicles (EV). The operation of the VPP is agent controlled, so that cars are charged when market prices on the wholesale market signal excess capacity and turn into a power plant when market prices signal a need for additional energy supply. We show that due to a low utilization of EVs, its storage in idle status can be used by owners of large EV fleets to trade energy on the electricity wholesale market. We scrutinize and evaluate a trading strategy under different scenarios of battery cost developments for large EV fleets owners in the simulation platform Power TAC against the triple bottom line (people, planet, profit). Findings indicate that people pay lower electricity prices under widespread adoption of VPPs of EVs. In addition to that results show a decrease in CO2 emissions for the planet. Finally profits for fleet owners of EV parks are boosted, which decreases with growing market adoption.

The aim of the present paper is to analyze enablers and barriers for this institutional change. The vocational education system in Denmark is strongly institutionalised with unions, employer's associations and the schools in central roles. Drawing on institutional theory contributions on labour market -, educational - and professional institutions, the paper presents a study of institutional work inside and across schools and craft disciplines working in SMEs involved in new building and renovation with an energy aspect. Collaboration between four education committees for carpenters, masons, electricians and plumbers and interviews with seven companies come to focus on competences of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustainable innovation in SME. The anticipation of future building regulation of 2015 and 2020 creates an institutional pressure in education for change including handling differentiated demands of customers and contractors, not always just following regulation but occasionally ahead of it. At a time this needs to be balanced with customer needs with a comfort orientation and issues of cost and financing. The committees act in a contradictory, sometimes conservative manner in this change of institutions of knowing. In the future specialization will be supplemented by horizontal and vertical interdisciplinary and innovative competences integrating the complex process industrialized construction sector. Schools, teachers and digital teaching materials need be developed to support this change supported by front running companies and results from innovative building projects. The education committees in Denmark can have a leading role in this development and set high and motivational standards for the improvements. The analysis sees however a lot more barriers than enablers.","Climate; Competences; Craft; Energy; Industrialization; Vocational training","Building codes; Construction industry; Education; Electric energy storage; Employment; Project management; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Climate; Competences; Craft; Energy; Industrialization; Vocational training; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911382611

By using VSC-17 data, the VSC-17 dry-storage system was established by TRACE. Then, the analysis results of TRACE were compared with the VSC-17 data. The results of TRACE were similar to the VSC-17 data. It indicates that TRACE has the respectable accuracy in the simulation and analysis of the dry-storage systems. The next step is the application of TRACE in the dry-storage system of Kuosheng nuclear power plant (BWR/6). Kuosheng NPP is the second BWR NPP of Taiwan Power Company. In order to solve the storage of the spent fuels, Taiwan Power Company developed the new dry-storage system for Kuosheng NPP. In this step, the dry-storage system model of Kuosheng NPP was established by TRACE. Then, the steady state simulation of this model was performed and the results of TRACE were compared with the Kuosheng NPP data.

Reconversion of hydrogen back to electricity with the maximum possible efficiency is one pre-requisite to render hydrogen storage technically and economically viable. Pure oxygen is a byproduct in the electrolysis of water. The use of pure oxygen as the oxidant in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) is a possible way of increasing the conversion efficiency of hydrogen to power, by reducing the fuel cell's cathodic kinetic overvoltage, which is the most important energy loss process in low temperature PEFCs. As we demonstrate in this work, when using pure oxygen, either high efficiencies at current densities around 1 A cm-2 are obtained or a very high power density operation (up to 1.6 W cm-2 at cell voltages above 0.62 V) can be reached, giving the technology a broad window of operation and application. The fuel cell stack durability is assessed in accelerated longterm tests of up to 2700 h.

Building such deep walls by conventional submarine technology is difficult. The present study describes the principle and the erection of such submarine defensive walls by a relatively simple efficient and economic technology. This technology is based on lowering highstrength steel fences with horizontal anchors, or two parallel steel fences with distance holders, into the sea and fixing them with rocks deposited from top. Dredged material like gravel or sand can be used for additional filling. This Tsunami-Flooding Barrier (TFB) extends a few meters above sea level and carries on top a concrete supply and service road protected on both sides against storm waves by concrete walls. Replaceable surge stoppers (parapets, wave return walls) prevent overtopping and erosion of the seaward barrier face. The TFBs protect the coastline against tsunami and the highest storm waves from hurricanes, but also can provide protection from oil spills or other contaminations from the ocean and thus protect flora, fauna, coral reefs and beaches. Channels and gates allow navigation and can be closed quickly upon a tsunami or storm warning.The construction costs can be eventually compensated by using the reservoirs between coast and barriers for hydroelectric energy storage (using pump-turbines in the barriers) or for fish-farming, or alternatively the reservoir can be filled with rocks, rubble, gravel, sand and covered with soil in order to reclaim new land. Tidal energy can be generated by installing turbines within these barriers.Also, this submarine architecture may be applied to protect pillars of bridges and offshore platforms, and for erecting “roads” into the sea to connect near-shore platforms and wind-parks with the coast and additionally include oil, gas, gasoline pipelines and electricity lines. © 2014, Tsunami Society.

A theoretical model of laminar forced convection with varying wall temperature due to phase change material (PCM) outside a double wall circular tube and air as heat transfer fluid (HTF) inside a tube was employed to analyze active cooling of air. The analytical prediction in terms of outlet temperature was validated with experimental data. Furthermore, influences of some important design parameters (e.g. inner radius and thickness of the tube) on cooling effect were investigated. It was found that an optimum inner radius and thickness of the tube should be considered to design an LHS system. Better co-efficient of performance (COP) was observed for higher inlet air temperature while the outlet air temperature was almost identical. In this study, the COP of cooling was found 4.16 for 34.5 °C inlet air temperature using tube with 5.35 mm inner radius and 1 mm thickness.

The most important of them is the uncoordinated EV charging that substantially increases the energy demand peaks, putting the smart grid under constant strain. In order to cope with these peaks the grid needs extra infrastructure, a costly solution. We propose an Adaptive Management of EV Storage (AMEVS) algorithm, implemented through a learning agent that acts on behalf of individual EV owners and schedules EV charging over a weekly horizon. It accounts for individual preferences so that mobility service is not violated but also individual benefit is maximized. We observe that it reshapes the energy demand making it less volatile so that fewer resources are needed to cover peaks. It assumes Vehiclc-to-Grid discharging when the customer has excess capacity. Our agent uses Reinforcement Learning trained on real world data to leam individual household consumption behavior and to schedule EV charging. Unlike previous work, AMEVS is a fully distributed approach. We show that AMEVS achieves significant reshaping of the energy demand curve and peak reduction, which is correlated with customer preferences regarding perceived utility of energy availability. Additionally, we show that the average and peak energy prices are reduced as a result of smarter energy use.

Against that background, the aim of this work was to apply the Cleaner Production (CP) methodology in a small swine farm with the purpose of identifying the bottlenecks of processes (considering environmental impacts) and propose sustainable and safe solutions. Based on the first results this research analyzed the economical and environmental feasibility of biogas production, due to the implementation of anaerobic digestions system. To achieve the first goal of this work, the authors developed a schematic flowchart of the process, then identified and evaluated the environmental impacts, to finally select the specific stages necessaries to implement CP actions. The main short and long term actions proposed were: the installations of a septic tank; the improvement of the drainage system; the installation of a hydrometer and a powered watch; the implementation of safety standards to storage chemical and medical products, the improvement of the residues management and the implementation of a biological treatment for the sewage which can be combined to a cogeneration system to produce electricity from the biogas. The technical feasibility study for the implementation of an efficient cogeneration system from the biogas has been developed considering three specific mathematics models (MM): 1st MM: Ratio between animal waste (manure generation) and amount of the biogas produced; 2nd MM: Ratio between the concentration of volatile solids (VS) from animal waste and amount of the biogas produced and 3rd MM: Empirical correlation between the amount of methane produced and the waste digested in the anaerobic reactor, considering influent Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) value. The VS and BOD methods seem to be the most proper models and had close values for the predictions of biogas produced. According to these results the use of biogas for the energy cogeneration seems to be economically and environmentally practicable.

The increasing awareness of the depletion of natural resources has also been a driver in the direction of modern grids which are more efficient and less susceptible to failures. One solution which is being considered as an alternative for the existing centralised electrical grid and thermal needs is the concept of microgrid. Microgrids are decentralised subunits which consist of different cogeneration units and combined heat and power units along with renewable sources and heat and electricity consumers. Multiple microgrids combine together to aid and complement the existing producers thus, reducing the stress on these producers while increasing the efficiency of the entire electricity grid. The presence of different storage devices and electricity production units mean that the microgrids can also maintain very high quality of electricity, thus reducing losses during transmission and distribution. Another advantage of a microgrid is it's ability of being self-sufficient for a short period time which means that microgrids have the ability to island themselves voluntarily or accidentally from the rest of the electricity grid which could be used to prevent entire grid failures during meteorological problems or when the economic factors are not conducive. The presence of decentralised sources, storage devices and consumers mean that there is a strong need for control of all the different components that constitute a microgrid. There are many different approaches to control a microgrid. This paper attempts to demonstrate a model predictive control (MPC) strategy developed to provide strategies for a low-voltage microgrid with both thermal and electrical devices and requirements. The aim of the strategy is to satisfy the demands and comforts of the consumers while minimising the costs associated by performing a multi-layered mixed-integer optimisation which provides strategy that needs to be employed by each unit of the system. The optimisation consists of two layers, the first of which provides the setpoints for both the thermal and electrical components and the second layer solves a problem which is only takes the electrical units into account and is performed over a shorter timestep. This is owing to the different dynamics of the thermal and electrical units. The fast dynamics of the electrical systems requires us to perform the second layer to maintain the efficiency of the microgrid. The paper then shows the importance of optimal sizing for the model predictive control strategy employed for varying periods of the year and the advantages of this strategy for microgrids over the existing strategies. The paper also attempts to show the impact of certain variables employed in the MPC strategy in particular, for LV (Low-Voltage) microgrid..

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a vital technology to mitigate industrial CO2 emissions, which is mainly generated in power plants. Currently, post-combustion capture based on aqueous amine scrubbing is considered as the most suitable technology for CO2 capture. However, the use of amine for CO2 capture has some disadvantages, such as high energy required for solvent regeneration, high solvent loss, and degradation of solvent. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) are considered as potential alternative, because they have negligible vapour pressure, and high thermal stability. In addition, through matching of cations and anions, ILs provide a flexibility to tune their properties. However, due to vast number of potential ILs, time and expense required to obtain the optimal ILs for CO2 absorption through experimentation is unaffordable. This work presents a Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) approach for the design and selection of optimal ILs specifically for the purpose of CO2 capture. The approach utilises group contribution method to estimate the thermophyscial properties of ILs, by considering the structural constraints and allowed combination of cations and anions. Predicted properties of the potential candidates are in good agreement of experimentally measured properties.

The GHG reduction potentials for a case with a condensing HRSC and for a case with the HRSC in backpressure mode producing heat for CO2 separation of the flue gases are evaluated. Pinch technology was used to identify the potential for heat recovery and process integration. Small changes in the operational parameters of the HRSC can result in significant changes of the conversion efficiencies of heat and power. With an HRSC in back-pressure mode, reducing the power production by 4 MW compared to the condensing case, it is possible to produce ~60 MW of heat for district heating. This study shows that approximately one third of the carbon input to the gasifier ends up in the SNG, whereas one third is separated prior to methanation and one third is emitted as CO2 in the flue gases from the combustor of the indirect gasifier. If infrastructure for CO2 storage is available, and CO2 separated from the process and from the flue gases is stored, the GHG emission reductions from the bio-SNG system can be doubled compared to a case without CO2 storage possibility..

Part of this package is the EU-wide emissions trading scheme. The emissions trading instrument covers only 50 per cent of the greenhouse gases in the EU and is only one of many legislative measures that have been adopted by the EU. The current legislative approach of the EU in the field of climate change contains measures for (1) emission reductions, (2) renewable energies and (3) energy efficiency. Based on these three pillars, the EU pursues a ‘triple 20' approach. This political choice entails the following goals for 2020: 20 per cent greenhouse gas emission reduction, 20 per cent renewable energy, and 20 per cent energy saving. In order to reach these policy targets, a range of regulatory instruments has been established, such as, inter alia, emissions trading, taxation, permitting, voluntary agreements, liability arrangements (for carbon capture and storage), energy labelling, eco design requirements and fuel quality standards. Next to that, support mechanisms for, inter alia, promoting renewable energy have been established at EU and Member State level.

In this regard, a new schematic of an isolated hybrid energy system combining Wind Turbine (WT), Fuel Cell (FC) and Ultra Capacitor (UC) using nonlinear detailed models has been presented. In this system, the WT is used as the main power generation source. Fuel cell and Ultra Capacitor are introduced as a backup energy source and buffer storage to supply the load demand for all various operating conditions. In the proposed system, in order to use the grid's capability to its best, the second order sliding (SOSMC) mode strategy is employed to extract the maximum power from wind in the below the rated wind speed. In this part, to validate the performance and capabilities of the proposed MPPT strategy, a comparison with the classical ATF controller was performed using Matlab/Simulink. Moreover, to demonstrate the effectiveness of IFPSO algorithm, optimal droop frequency controller using IFPSO algorithm is compared with conventional and improved droop controllers. According to the simulation results, applying proposed method, the frequency deviation of the isolated power grid in dynamical state declines significantly. © 2014-IOS Press and the authors.

A number of benefits can be obtained in limiting the idling time. These benefits include savings in fuel use and maintenance costs, vehicle life extension, and reduction in exhaust emissions. The main objective of idling reduction (IR) devices is to reduce the amount of energy wasted by idling trucks, rail locomotives, and automobiles. During idling, gasoline vehicles emit a minimum amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and negligible particulate matter (PM). However, generally a large amount of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) are produced from these vehicles. Gasoline vehicles consume far more fuel at an hourly rate than their diesel counterparts during idling. Higher NOx and comparatively larger PM are produced by diesel vehicles than gasoline vehicles on the average during idling. Auxiliary power unit (APU), direct-fired heaters, fuel cells, thermal storage system, truck stop electrification, battery-based systems, engine idle management (shutdown) systems, electrical (shore power) solutions, cab comfort system, and hybridization are some of the available IR technologies whose performances for reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions have been compared. This paper analyzes the availability and capability of most efficient technologies to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions from diesel and gasoline vehicles by comparing the findings of previous studies. The analysis reveals that among all the options direct fired heaters, APUs and electrified parking spaces exhibit better reduction of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions than others. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In comparative terms, the entransy dissipation rate is related with the loss of heat transfer ability just like the exergy destruction rate is proportional to the loss of work ability, being these losses caused by the irreversibilities related to the thermodynamic processes. Some authors have questioned the need for the concept of entransy, claiming that this concept is only an extension of a well established theory of heat transfer. The objective of this work is show the equivalence between the application of the concepts of entransy and entropy generation rate, which can be verified using various application examples. The application examples used here are the thermodynamic modeling of three physical models of solar energy collectors and a physical model of a sensible heat storage system.

To reach this ambitious target, a revision of the current energy system is required together with retrofitting of the building stock. The method applied is based on the energy hub concept, which can be used to optimize the energy consumption during planning and operation. To apply the energy hub concept at neighbourhood level, a three step approach is required, including modelling the energy demand of the buildings, the evaluation of the local renewable potential, and the management and optimization of demand and supply. Centralized and decentralized local renewable sources are investigated, namely photovoltaics, biomass, or small hydro power. Scenarios are evaluated based on their environmental performance and savings of CO2 emissions. Results show that an energy sustainability (ratio of energy demand covered by renewables) of 83% and a CO2 emissions reduction of 86% can be achieved. The results further suggest that up to 50% of the available energy potential from renewables cannot be utilized in this community when insufficient storage is provided in the energy system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In order to stabilize the shape and enhance the thermal conductivity of SA, the effects of adding carbon nanospheres (CNSs) as a carbon nanofiller were examined experimentally. The maximum mass fraction of SA retained in CNSs was found as 80 wt% without the leakage of SA in a melted state, even when it was heated over the melting point of SA. The dropping point test shows that there was clearly no liquid leakage through the phase change process at the operating temperature range of the composite PCMs. The thermal stability and thermal properties of composite PCMs were investigated with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), respectively. The thermal conductivity of the SA/CNS composite was determined by the laser flash method. The thermal conductivity at 35 °C increased about 105% for the highest loading of CNS (50 wt%). The thermal cycling test proved that form-stable composite PCMs had good thermal reliability and chemical durability after 1000 cycles of melting and freezing, which is advantageous for latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the big problem to this type of system is that once the hot water leaves the storage tank and travels through the system piping, the water temperature drops due to the travel distance and ambient air temperature. Because of this drop in temperature, users need to wait for the undesirable cool water to flow out of the system before the desired hot water starts flowing out of the system. The ideal solution to this problem is to reheat the undesirable (cooled) water in the system by the use of an individual hot water circulating system. This study focuses on water saving and energy consumption in the individual hot water circulating system. The results show energy consumption is 50% less than the non-circulating central hot water system. Three parameters in wasted water demand, electric consumption, and heating source consumption were considered to transfer them with CO2 transfer coefficient to estimate the reducing CO2 emission. The hot water circulation system presents the benefits of water and energy saving, and reduction of CO2 emission, but the piping connection should be improved for easy installation in the existed buildings in the future. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In order to investigate the effect of operating conditions on mass transport overpotential, this study established a relationship between the limiting current density and operating conditions. First, electrolyte solutions with different states of charge were prepared and used for a single cell to obtain discharging polarization curves under various operating conditions.

By effectively identifying reusable cache lines and storing them in the assist, PSC reduces average memory access time by upto 59% as compared to competing schemes and conventional data caches.

Energy and exergy including their cost analyses for the TES system were performed. Accordingly, total life cycle cost was calculated for different flow rates of the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF). With 0.033. kg/min and 0.167. kg/min flow rates of water as HTF, energy efficiencies experienced were 63.88% and 77.41%, respectively, but in exergy analysis, efficiencies were observed to be about 9.58% and 6.02%, respectively.

The creation and the distribution of video content is a multi-stage process that refers to the aquisition of video source, content production and packaging, and distribution to customers. The major components are the access networks, metro/edge networks, core networks, data centers and storage networks. Today, the access networks, of type wireless and wired, dominate the power consumption of the chain. However, it is expected that, with increasing access speeds, the core network routing will dominate the power consumption of the chain as well. Furthermore, it is also expected that the power consumption of Data Centers (DCs) and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) will be dominated by the power consumption of data storage for content that is infrequently downloaded as well as by the transport of data for content that is frequently downloaded.

The problem is to maximize the long-term utility of the energy by controlling how it is used. The methodology for designing the control policy depends on the size of the battery. If the battery is small, the control policy is determined by solving a Markov decision problem. If the battery is large, this problem is complex, but one can replace it by a simpler problem where the constraint is on the average power usage. When the battery is large, the average power usage should not exceed the average power harvested by the source. When the battery size is moderate, the control is based on the large deviations of the battery charge.

However, most of the reported PCM-based FPGAs have significant active leakage power and reliability issues. This paper presents a low active leakage power and high reliability PCM based non-volatile SRAM (nvSRAM). The low active leakage power and high reliability are achieved by biasing PCM cells at 0 V during FPGA operation.

Nevertheless, hydrogen storage remains a daunting challenge but a potential reaction for the generation of hydrogen on demand is the hydrolytic oxidation of organosilanes. Here, we demonstrate that silver nitrate, a readily available ionic salt, can catalyze the hydrolysis of organosilanes to produce hydrogen and organosilanols. In particular, turnover numbers and turnover frequencies in excess of 5 × 103 and 102 min-1 respectively are obtainable for the hydrolysis of triethylsilane at room temperature. This proposed silver nitrate mediated system is, by far, the simplest and cheapest catalytic hydrolysis of organosilanes. Results from the kinetic studies suggested a mechanistic scenario in which the hydrolysis of organosilanes is third order overall and first order in organosilane, water, and catalyst. The high hydrogen yield observed makes the silver nitrate catalyst an attractive material for hydrogen evolution. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,"Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Hydrolysis; Proven reserves; Silver alloys; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrolysis; Nitrates; Proven reserves; Silanes; Silver; Silver alloys; Catalytic hydrogen evolution; Catalytic hydrolysis; Hydrogen evolution; Hydrolytic oxidations; Potential reactions; Room temperature; Turnover frequency; Turnover number; Silanes; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906876063

Highly dense AuNPs on ZNA surfaces act as sinks for the storage of UV-generated electrons, which promote the separation of charge carriers and create numerous photocatalytic reaction centers.

Indeed, they have the capability to support ADNs by providing ancillary services in addition to energy balance capabilities. Within this context, this paper focuses on the optimal allocation of DSSs in ADNs by defining a multi-objective optimization problem aiming at finding the optimal trade-off between technical and economical goals. In particular, the proposed procedure accounts for: 1) network voltage deviations; 2) feeders/lines congestions; 3) network losses; 4) cost of supplying loads (from external grid or local producers) together with the cost of DSS investment/maintenance; 5) load curtailment; and 6) stochasticity of loads and renewables productions.

The 3D hybrid memory cell relies on: (i) a Short Circuit Current Free Nano-Electro-Mechanical Field Effect Transistor (SCCF NEMFET) based inverter for data storage; and (ii) adjacent CMOS-based logic for read/write operations and data preservation. We compare 3D Stacked Hybrid NEMFET-CMOS Caches (3DS-HNCC) of various capacities against state of the art 45 nm low power CMOS SRAM counterparts (2D-CC). All the proposed implementations provide two orders of magnitude static energy reduction (due to NEMFET's extremely low OFF current), a slightly increased dynamic energy consumption, while requiring an approximately 55% larger footprint. The read access time is equivalent, while for write operations it is with about 3 ns higher, as it is dominated by the mechanical movement of the NEMFET's suspended gate. In order to determine if the write latency overhead inflicts any performance penalty, we consider as evaluation vehicle a state of the art mobile out-of-order processor core equipped with 32-kB instruction and data L1 caches, and a unified 2-MB L2 cache. We evaluate different scenarios, utilizing both 3DS-HNCC and 2D-CC at different hierarchy levels, on a set of SPEC 2000 benchmarks. Our simulations indicate that for the considered applications, despite of their increased write access time, 3DS-HNCC L2 caches inflict insignificant IPC penalty while providing, on average, 38% energy savings, when compared with 2D-CC. For L1 instruction caches the IPC penalty is also almost insignificant, while for L1 data caches IPC decreases between 1% to 12% were measured. © 2014 IEEE.","3DS-IC; Caches; Computer Architecture; Emerging Memories; Low Power; Memory Hierarchy; NEMS","Computer architecture; Energy utilization; Field effect transistors; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; Nanotechnology; NEMS; Static random access storage; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Caches; Dynamic energy consumption; Emerging memory; Low Power; Memory hierarchy; Out-of-order processors; Performance penalties; Processor performance; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906773420

On the other side, due to the rise of environmental consciousness, electric companies are eager to replace traditional generators with renewable energy. One of the most efficient ways is to provide an electricity buyback scheme for electric companies to encourage users to generate more renewable energy at their homes. Different from the previous works, we consider dynamic pricing with renewable energy buyback as our target scenario. We formulate the dynamic pricing problem as a convex optimization problem and propose a day-ahead time-dependent pricing scheme.

The suspended nanoparticles have proven to increase the heat transfer rate substantially. The horizontal walls of the cavities are insulated while side walls are kept at constant but different temperatures. The total solidification time of pure fluid and nanofluid filled in the cavity is investigated for three different inclinations of side walls and the results are compared with square cavity. Results revealed that the total solidification time for pure fluid as well for nanofluid for all nano particle concentrations decreases. The effects of Grashof number (105-107) on the heat transfer phenomenon and solid-liquid interface are also numerically investigated and presented graphically. The enthalpy-porosity technique is used to trace the solid-liquid interface. Inclination angle can be used efficiently to control the solidification time.

Our developments allow one to achieve the necessary accuracy for the evaluation of the HFX in a highly controllable manner. We show here that our solutions can take great advantage of the latest trends in HPC platforms, such as extreme threading, short vector instructions and highly dimensional interconnection networks. Indeed, all these trends are evident in the IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. We demonstrate an unprecedented scalability up to 6,291,456 threads (96 BG/Q racks) with a near perfect parallel efficiency, which represents a more than 20-fold improvement as compared to the current state of the art. In terms of reduction of time to solution, we achieved an improvement that can surpass a 10-fold decrease in runtime with respect to directly comparable approaches. We exploit this development to enhance the accuracy of DFT based molecular dynamics by using the PBE0 hybrid functional. This approach allowed us to investigate the chemical behavior of organic solvents in one of the most challenging research topics in energy storage, lithium/air batteries, and to propose alternative solvents with enhanced stability to ensure an appropriate reversible electrochemical reaction. This step is key for the development of a viable lithium/air storage technology, which would have been a daunting computational task using standard methods. Recent research has shown that the electrolyte plays a key role in non-aqueous lithium/air batteries in producing the appropriate reversible electrochemical reduction. In particular, the chemical degradation of propylene carbonate, the typical electrolyte used, by lithium peroxide has been demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations of highly realistic models. Reaching the necessary high accuracy in these simulations is a daunting computational task using standard methods. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Chemical stability; Computational methods; Distributed parameter networks; Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Quantum chemistry; Supercomputers; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; Alternative solvents; Chemical degradation; Condensed-phase simulations; Electrochemical reactions; Electrochemical reductions; Lithium/air batteries; Molecular dynamics simulations; Molecular dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906713613

Although microgrids can effectively monitor REGSs, it cannot directly manage and control the intermittent output characteristic of REGSs. Recently, many experts recommend that Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) should be integrated into REGSs to mitigate the instability and further reduce the peak load and contract capacity of microgrids. Although the benefits of ESSs for REGS integrations are significant, their benefits greatly depend on the locations and capacities of ESSs installed.

We examined the effect of hydrogen adsorption on the structural properties, the density of states of this nano structure. Calculations were performed in the GGA and LDA approximations. We find that in the case of chemical adsorption of hydrogen, functional exchange-correlation PBE (GGA) in explaining chemical bonds have more accuracy and leads to more stable structures. Adsorption is chemical and the binding energy of single and double hydrogen adsorption is -2.28 eV and -3.48 eV, respectively. Our calculations show that the adsorption of one hydrogen atom induces a magnetic moment as 1 μB, because of breaking of π-bonds and generate unpaired electron and system find ferromagnetic configuration. Further analysis indicates that adsorption of second hydrogen eliminates magnetization and the semi metalic α-graphyne structure attains a band gap of 2 eV upon hydrogenation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The main aim of this research is to identify the common barriers and ultimate success factors to implementing a microgrid in the real world. We found that microgrids vary significantly depending on location, components, and optimization goals, which cause them to experience different types of challenges and barriers. However, the most common barriers were identified and grouped into four categories: technical, regulatory, financial, and stakeholder, based on the literature and overlying patterns recognized amongst the thirteen case studies. The most common technical barriers include problems with technology components, dual-mode switching from grid-connected to island mode, power quality and control, and protection issues. There is extensive research on how to overcome these issues, so technical solutions are becoming available yet case specific. Regulatory barriers exist due to interconnection rules with the main grid and the prohibition of bi-directional power flow and local power trading between microgrid and the main network. The latter issue is the barrier experienced most often and has only recently been addressed, so solutions need further research. The main financial barrier is still the burden of high investment and replacement costs of the microgrid. This can be resolved with proper market support in the short term and might naturally resolve itself through learning over the long run. Lastly, stakeholder barriers include issues with conflicting self-interest and trust, and having the expertise to manage operations. These stakeholder barriers are not yet addressed in the literature and need to be further researched. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Barriers; Distributed generation; Energy storage; Islanding; Microgrids; Renewable energy","Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy storage; Investments; Barriers; Bi-directional power flows; Islanding; Micro grid; Optimization goals; Regulatory barriers; Renewable energies; Technical solutions; Success factors; Electric power system control; Distributed power generation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906669626

Towards this direction, emerging power electronic topologies will be the key components of the developed charging infrastructures. Lately, a novel converter architecture has been proposed for such a purpose. The latter is based on a Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) converter with integrated battery energy storage systems, which play the role of a buffer in such a power demanding application. This paper is focusing on the isolated DC/DC conversion stage, which is needed for the achievement of the high charging currents. The dual half-bridge (DHB) converter is chosen, which fulfills several requirements for the studied application. The soft switching operation of the converter under wide input-output voltage variations is discussed.

In this paper, two different techniques to mitigate the time-varying and intermittent nature of renewable energy generation are considered. The first one is the use of storage, which smooths out the fluctuations in the renewable energy generation across time. The second technique is the concept of distributed generation combined with cooperation by exchanging energy among the distributed sources. This technique averages out the variation in energy production across space. This paper analyzes the tradeoff between these two techniques. The problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the time average cost of energy exchange within the grid. First, an analytical model of the optimal cost is provided by investigating the steady state of the system for some specific scenarios. Then, an algorithm to solve the cost minimization problem using the technique of Lyapunov optimization is developed, and results for the performance of the algorithm are provided. These results show that in the presence of limited storage devices, the grid can benefit greatly from cooperation, whereas in the presence of large storage capacity, cooperation does not yield much benefit. Further, it is observed that most of the gains from cooperation can be obtained by exchanging energy only among a few energy-harvesting sources. © 2014 IEEE.","cooperation; Lyapunov optimization; micro-grids; Renewable energy; storage","Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Optimization; Virtual storage; cooperation; Distributed sources; Integration of renewable energies; Micro grid; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Smart grid systems; Stochastic optimization problems; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906653089

It works by accelerating a rotor flywheel disc at a very high speed and maintaining the energy in the system as rotational energy. Active magnetic bearings (AMB) are ideally suited for use at high-speed and are so used in FESSs. This work develops a mathematical model of the levitation force and rotational torque of a flywheel. The systems for controlling the position and velocity of the flywheel are designed based on the emergent approaches of fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and an online trained adaptive neural network controller (NNC). In the proposed controller system, an FLC was first designed to identify the parameters of the FESS. This allowed the initial training data with two inputs, the error and derivate of the error, and one output signal from the FLC to be obtained. Finally, an NNC with online training features was designed using an S-function in Matlab software to achieve improved performance.

Both advanced-melt spinning (MS), high-pressure torsion (HPT)-and more conventional-cold rolling (CR), cold forging (CF)- techniques are evaluated as means of production of bulk samples with very refined microstructures and controlled textures. In the best SPD processing conditions, attractive H-absorption/desorption kinetic properties are obtained, which are comparable to the ones of MgH2 milled powders, even if the needed temperatures are higher-350°C compared to 300°C.CR and CF stand out as the processes with higher potential for industrial application, considering the level of the attained hydrogen storage properties, its simplicity and low cost. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ball milling; Cold rolling; Hydrogen storage; Melt spinning; Plastic deformation; High pressure torsions; High-energy ball milling; Hydrogen storage properties; Means of productions; Mechanical processing; Processing condition; Refined microstructure; Severe plastic deformations; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906351207

MnO2 nanoflowers are recovered from spent zinc-carbon battery by combination of solution leaching and electrowinning techniques. In an effort to utilize recovered MnO2 nanoflowers as energy storage supercapacitor, it is crucial to understand their structure and electrochemical performance. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the recovery of MnO2 in birnessite phase, while electron microscopy analysis shows the MnO 2 is recovered as 3D nanostructure with nanoflower morphology. The recovered MnO2 nanoflowers exhibit high specific capacitance (294 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1; 208.5 F g-1 at 0.1 A g -1) in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, with stable electrochemical cycling.

PCM with appropriate scalability, power consumption and multiple bits per cell storage capability is a probable candidate for substituting DRAM. Although storing multiple bits per cell seems to be a rational response to large memory demands, there is a significant problem to achieve this goal. Resistance drift problem is an important reliability concern that is coupled to a multi-level cell PCM (MLC PCM) memory system. In this paper, we propose a memory system architecture that, by exploiting the benefits of compression, converts resistance drift prone blocks to drift resilient blocks in order to protect the memory system from resistance drift. Evaluations on a full-system simulator, consisting of a quad-core ALPHA CMP and a banked PCM memory, show that our proposed approach provides up to 9.8× reduction in bit error rate, an average of 8% reduction in energy consumption, and 21% IPC improvement. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Computer architecture; Emerging technologies; Full system simulators; Memory system architectures; Memory systems; Multilevel cell; Phase change memory (pcm); Resistance drifts; Storage capability; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906337178

The main focus of this study is to analyze the effects of coherence protocols and replacement policies on the vulnerability of caches. The outcomes of this analysis indicate two facts: (i) Differences in handling write operations play an important role to make distinction in favor of or against a cache coherence protocol; (ii) Near-optimal solutions for replacement problem, aimed at enhancing the performance, can also make positive influence on reduction of cache vulnerability factor. Based on the results of first step, two schemes are introduced to enhance the reliability of caches by applying some modification on the structures of cache coherence protocols and cache replacement policies. The first scheme tries to manage sharing of the dirty data items among different same-level caches. The second helps to give priority and more opportunity to old dirty blocks than clean blocks for replacement. The proposed schemes reveal about 18% improvement in MTTF, with negligible performance, bandwidth and energy consumption overhead compared to previous cache structures. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With significant penetration of PEVs in the near future, the concept introduced in literatures as Vehicle to Grid (V2G) will be practically possible. The V2G concept eases the integration of renewable energy resources into power system and gives a new force to the inevitable move towards power generation by clean energy resources.

Since the circuit can be readily retrofitted to an existing PV system, no modification on the central inverter is required. The main idea of the scheme is that, during partial shading, parts of the current from the nonshaded modules are harvested by an energy recovery circuit using power electronic switches and storage components. In doing so, the current of the PV string is maintained at the level generated by the shaded module. There is no need for the shaded module to be short-circuited; as a result, it can still actively produce output power (despite being partially shaded). To investigate the idea, the proposed circuit is retrofitted to a prototype PV system using eight modules. The partial shading conditions are emulated using a solar simulator with a controllable irradiance capability. The results are validated by a good agreement between the experimental and simulation works. © 2014 IEEE.","Energy recovery; inverter; maximum power point (MPP); maximum power point tracking (MPPT); partial shading; photovoltaic (PV)","Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Energy recovery; inverter; Maximum power point; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Partial shading; Photovoltaic; Recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906259115

The In and Sn-3Ag layers have much lower melting temperatures than the base material (Cu) and can be melted through the heat generated during ultrasonic bonding, forming intermetallic compounds (IMCs). Samples were bonded using different ultrasonic powers, bonding times, and forces and subsequently aged at 300°C for 500 h. After aging, die shear testing was performed and the fracture surfaces were inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that the shear strength of Cu/In joints reached an upper plateau after 100 h of thermal aging and remained stable with aging time, whereas that of the Cu/Sn-3Ag joints decreased with increasing aging time. η-Cu7In4 and (Cu,Au)11In9 IMCs were observed at the Cu/In joint, while Cu3Sn and (Ag,Cu) 3Sn IMCs were found at the Cu/Sn-3Ag joint after reliability testing.

The over-RESET energy is considered to be the key electrical parameter to induce endurance failure in the memory device. When the device suffers the over-RESET energy, a gradually reduced memory window is observed associated with endurance cycles, and the overall degradation will include two stages. The first stage can be explained by the worn filament model and is mainly due to imbalance energy between SET and RESET process. The occurrence of unusual resistance-voltage (R-V) patterns at positive and negative voltage seep in the memory device under the second stage degradation demonstrates the existence of complementary resistive switching (CRS) in the single Ti/HfO xbipolar RRAM. After analyzing the operation conditions to activate the self-CRS in memory device with one transistor-one resistor (1T-1R) configuration, the mechanism about the second stage degradation in the RRAM originated from over-RESET energy is also discussed.

Based on the results from Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), rigid PU showed a higher Storage Modulus (E′) which may be related to the macromolecules crosslinking process. In contrast, the greater Loss Modulus (E″) in semi rigid PU was related to the greater ability to dissipate energy, suggesting that the change in polyol/pre-polymer ratio promotes structural changes in PU resins. Le Bail method was performed with a triclinic crystal structure (for rigid PU, a = 4.9117 (2) A˚, b = 8.1103 (2) A˚, c = 19.7224 (2) A˚, α = 116.2831 (2)°, β = 125.4058 (2)° and γ = 83.6960 (2)°). Average crystallite size was found in the range of 26 (1) A˚ for rigid PU and somewhat smaller around 20 (1) A˚ for semi rigid PU. The Guinier radii of gyration (Rg) and the maximum particle sizes (Dmax) were calculated based on Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) curves. Two different values for Radii of gyration (Rg) were calculated, one obtained from Guinier's plot using the program Microcal Origin 7.5 (RgORIGIN) and other from the pair-distance distribution function (p(r)) calculation, using the GNOM (RgGNOM) program package The possible highest values of (RgORIGIN) were obtained from Guinier's curves. For rigid and semi rigid PU resins, the (RgORIGIN) values were, respectively, (320 ± 1) and (260 ± 1) A˚. The average radii of gyration (RgGNOM) were obtained from the calculated pair-distance distribution function (p(r)). For rigid and semi rigid PU resins, the RgGNOMvalues were, respectively, (95 ± 1) A˚ and (86 ± 1) A˚. Dmaxvalues were obtained from the p(r) and ranged from (330 ± 3) A˚ to (260 ± 3) A˚ for rigid and semi rigid PU, respectively.

Impact Izod and three-point bending tests were conducted to determine the networks' impact energy (Ei), elasticity modulus (Ey), yield stress (σy) and fracture toughness (KIC) values. The same three-point bending mode was also employed to characterize the systems' thermo-mechanical properties (DMA) and storage modulus (E') and damping modulus (tan δ=E/E') values. The DGEBA/D230 network showed greater flexibility, maximum impact energy, higher fracture toughness, and a lower yield stress than the DGEBA/TETA and DGEBA/TEPA networks. The fracture behavior of these epoxy systems was correlated to the molecular weight between the crosslink points, Mc, and the plastic zone size (rp) at the crack tip carved in the samples. The DGEBA/D230 network had the highest storage modulus and tan δ intensity, together with higher toughness and deformation during the network's fracture.

Idle EV's objectives are charging for the next ride and providing VPP capacity, which we show is sufficiently available. These VPPs participate in an energy exchange.

We study trading behavior of EV fleet owners agents, and its effects in Power TAC, a large scale, multi-agent smart grid simulation. We show that these VPPs offer crucial resource flexibility to the grid. They reduce the average electricity price by 3.2% and emissions by 2.4%.

However, currently it remains unclear when and under which conditions battery storage can be profitably operated in residential PV systems without policy support. Based on a review of previous studies that have examined the economics of integrated PV-battery systems, in this paper we devise a simulation model that investigates the economic viability of battery storage for residential PV in Germany under eight different electricity price scenarios from 2013 to 2022. In contrast to previous forward-looking studies, we assume that no premium is paid for solar photovoltaic power and/or self-consumed electricity. Additionally, we run the model with a large number of different PV and storage capacities to determine the economically optimal configuration in terms of system size. We find that already in 2013 investments in storage solutions were economically viable for small PV systems. Given the assumptions of our model, the optimal size of both residential PV systems and battery storage rises significantly in the future. Higher electricity retail prices, lower electricity wholesale prices or limited access to the electricity wholesale market add to the profitability of storage. We conclude that additional policy incentives to foster investments in battery storage for residential PV in Germany will only be necessary in the short run. At the same time, the impending profitability of integrated PV-storage systems is likely to further spur the ongoing trend toward distributed electricity generation with major implications for the electricity sector. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery storage; Distributed electricity generation; Electricity price; Simulation; Solar energy; Solar photovoltaic power; Techno-economic model","Computer simulation; Costs; Economics; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Battery storage; Distributed electricity generation; Electricity prices; Simulation; Solar photovoltaic power; Techno-economic model; Electric batteries",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905826327

The energy hub consists of several inputs (energy resources) and outputs (energy consumptions) and also some energy conversion/storage devices. The energy hub can be a home, large consumer, power plant, etc. The objective is to minimize the energy procurement costs (fuel/electricity/environmental aspects) subject to a set of technical constraints. One of the popular options to be served as the input resource is renewable energy like wind or solar power. Using the renewable energy has various benefits such as low marginal costs and zero environmental pollution. On the other hand, the uncertainties associated with them make the operation of the energy hub a difficult and risky task. Besides, there are other resources of uncertainties such as the hourly electricity prices and demand values. Hence, it is important to determine an economic schedule for energy hubs, with an acceptable level of energy procurement risk. Thus, in this chapter a comprehensive multiobjective model is proposed to minimize both the energy procurement cost and risk level in energy hub. For controlling the pernicious effects of the uncertainties, conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used as risk management tool. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved using GAMS. Simulation results on an illustrative test system are carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2014.","Energy hub; Price uncertainty modeling; Scenario-based modeling; Stochastic optimization; Wind energy","Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Risk management; Solar power plants; Uncertainty analysis; Value engineering; Wind power; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Energy hubs; Environmental pollutions; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Multi-objective modeling; Price uncertainty; Scenario-based modeling; Stochastic optimizations; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905757866

Due to the increasing demand for sustainable energy, the number of ATES systems has increased rapidly, which has raised questions on the effect of ATES systems on their surroundings as well as their thermal performance. Furthermore, the increasing density of systems generates concern regarding thermal interference between the wells of one system and between neighboring systems. An assessment is made of (1) the thermal storage performance, and (2) the heat transport around the wells of an existing ATES system in the Netherlands. Reconstruction of flow rates and injection and extraction temperatures from hourly logs of operational data from 2005 to 2012 show that the average thermal recovery is 82% for cold storage and 68% for heat storage. Subsurface heat transport is monitored using distributed temperature sensing. Although the measurements reveal unequal distribution of flow rate over different parts of the well screen and preferential flow due to aquifer heterogeneity, sufficient well spacing has avoided thermal interference. However, oversizing of well spacing may limit the number of systems that can be realized in an area and lower the potential of ATES. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); Distributed temperature sensing (DTS); Heterogeneity; The Netherlands; Thermal conditions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905754472

These concepts include restructuring, smart grids, and the importance of environmental concerns. The art of decision making is defined as choosing the best action among available choices considering the constraints and input data of the problem. Decision making is usually a complex task which becomes more sophisticated when the input data of the problem are subject to uncertainty. This chapter presents a critical review of the state-of-the-art uncertainty in handling tools for renewable energy studies.

The development project which have a potential of storing 23MTPA of CO2 in a nearby offshore saline aquifer is energy intensive. The operational cost of operating the high duty CO2 capture, transport and reinjection (or CCS) facilities has a negative impact on the overall project economics. As such, optimizing the energy footprint of the CCS facilities is imminent. As a means to achieve the desired duty reduction, the project have identified potential energy recovery from the high pressure well stream via the adiabatic turboexpander gas expansion, deployment and integration of the liquid CO2 pumps as opposed to the conventional higher duty compressor systems and utilizing low BTU gas turbine drivers to avoid the high duty fuel gas separation penalty. The aggregate duty reductions achieved has met the initial project expectation. However, the deployment of these technology is rather new for offshore service and a proper technology qualification exercise is a necessity.

Monitoring solutions based on this technology have proven particularly cost effective and can be applied to large scale structures where hundreds of sensors must be deployed for long term measurement of different mechanical and physical parameters. Sensors based on Fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) are the most common solution used in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and the measurements are performed by special instruments known as optical interrogators. Acquisition rates increasingly higher have been possible using the latest optical interrogators, which gives rise to a large volume of data whose manipulation, storage, management and visualization can demand special software applications.

A controlling factor for the economic feasibility of HT-ATES is the recovery efficiency. Due to the effects of density-driven flow (free convection), HTATES systems applied in permeable aquifers typically have lower recovery efficiencies than conventional (lowtemperature) ATES systems. For a reliable estimation of the recovery efficiency it is, therefore, important to take the effect of density-driven flow into account. A numerical evaluation of the prime factors influencing the recovery efficiency of HT-ATES systems is presented. Sensitivity runs evaluating the effects of aquifer properties, as well as operational variables, were performed to deduce the most important factors that control the recovery efficiency. A correlation was found between the dimensionless Rayleigh number (a measure of the relative strength of free convection) and the calculated recovery efficiencies. Basedona modified Rayleigh number, two simple analytical solutions are proposed to calculate the recovery efficiency, each one covering a different range of aquifer thicknesses. The analytical solutions accurately reproduce all numerically modeled scenarios with an average error of less than 3%. The proposed method can be of practical use when considering or designing an HT-ATES system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Density-drivenflow; Numerical modeling; The Netherlands; Thermal systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905709038

These entities are called balance groups (BGs), or are given similar names, because they are responsible for maintaining an energy balance for the group, and experience costs in case of imbalances. With large shares of uncertain renewable energy sources (RES), BGs are exposed to the risk of high balancing costs. In this paper, we propose a day-ahead (DA) scheduling and a real-time (RT) control scheme to minimize the spot market and balancing costs of a BG using flexible loads and storage resources. In the DA scheduling problem, we account for RES and price uncertainties by formulating a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with recourse. The RT control problem is formulated as a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) problem that uses short-term RES forecasts. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme considering a BG with a wind farm, an industrial load, and a pumped-storage plant. The results show that the proposed scheme reduces the BG costs, but the cost savings vary and are case dependent. © 2014 IEEE.","balance group; demand response; model predictive control; pumped-storage plant; stochastic optimization","Commerce; Costs; Electric utilities; Model predictive control; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Real time control; Stochastic control systems; Wind power; Balance groups; Demand response; Electricity market; Pumped storage plants; Renewable energy source; Scheduling problem; Stochastic optimization problems; Stochastic optimizations; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905695158

We refer to the time-coupled redispatch rules as affine reserve policies, and they apply not only to generators but to other continuously-controllable devices such as energy storage units or demand response installations, which are modelled as generic mixed logical-dynamical systems. We use a lumped-parameter example to demonstrate that unit commitment decisions coupled with affine reserve policies can reduce the number of time periods in which expensive peaking plants need to be employed, and that the effect is present for a wide range of parameter values.

This work elaborates on the opportunities and constraints of current balancing markets in the Netherlands and Germany to harness the profitability and feasibility of energy storage systems to participate in load-frequency control and in FRR in particular. One of the main concerns of storage is the state of charge, i.e. availability of discharging or charging energy respectively. Even though firm capacity needs to be provided, the Dutch market allows bids to be withdrawn up to one hour ahead of operation. Therefore Energy Storage System participation in the frequency restoration process encounters limited risk compared to the case of the German system. Furthermore, the Dutch system allows passive balancing, where Energy Storage Systems can contribute in an opportunistic fashion without the need for firm contracts. © 2014 IEEE.","balancing markets; energy storage system; frequency restoration reserves; load-frequency control","Commerce; Electric frequency control; Restoration; Balancing market; Charging energies; Current balancing; Energy storage systems; Frequency restorations; Generation portfolios; Load-frequency control; State of charge; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905674331

Fitting the endurance model to real test data helps in estimating the value of the activation energy for oxygen ion transport.

On the other hand, upcoming storage technologies, such as electric vehicles, hold the potential to store and utilize this intermittent supply at a later time but bring challenges of their own, for example efficient storage utilization and intermittent energy demand. In this paper we propose a novel modelling of the problem of unforecasted energy dispatch with storage as an online scheduling problem of tasks on machines, by transforming time constraints of energy requests into equivalent machine constraints as well as by modelling energy storage through the extension of existing online scheduling techniques with the concept of load credit. Based on this transformation, we also present an algorithm that dispatches load and utilizes efficiently any storage capabilities in order to mitigate the effect of unreliable or non-existent demand forecasts, and we prove that the resulting solution's competitive ratio is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal offline solution. Finally, we provide an extensive simulation study for a variety of scenarios based on data from a large network of consumers, showing that the presented algorithm is highly competitive even to methods that assume exact knowledge about the demand requests.

Various network structures were obtained from pea proteins by varying the pH and salt conditions during gel formation. The coarseness of the network structure was visualized by the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ranked from least coarse to most coarse networks. Least coarse networks were formed at a pH away from the isoelectric point (IEP) of pea proteins, and at a low ionic strength, whereas more coarse networks were formed at pH values close to the IEP and at a high ionic strength during gel formation. Mechanical deformation properties of the gels such as elastically stored (recoverable) energy, Young's moduli (stiffness of gels), fracture stress (gel strength), and fracture strain (brittleness of the gels) were measured by the use of a texture analyzer and correlated to the coarseness of the networks structure. The influence of coarseness on the ability of the networks to elastically store energy was observed for length scales below 50. nm. The findings show that elastically stored energy of pea protein gels can be modulated via the creation of different network structures below 50. nm length scales. The results from this study contribute to a better understanding of the dimensions that set the ability to elastically storage in pea protein gels. If the ability of pea proteins to store energy can be understood, products can be better tailored for consumers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Coarseness; Gel formation; Network structure; Pea proteins; Recoverable energy","Elastic moduli; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Gels; Ionic strength; Proteins; Scanning electron microscopy; Stresses; Coarseness; Gel formation; Network structures; Pea proteins; Recoverable energy; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905647434

Currently, thermal reduction/exfoliation of graphite oxide (GO) is a typical method of choice. However, it has the drawback of requiring specialized equipment for rapid thermal shock. A recent alternative method, microwave-assisted exfoliation, usually suffers from poor reduction of graphite oxide and thus low C/O ratios. Herein we show that vacuum-assisted microwave reduction/exfoliation of graphite oxide in a closed system leads to high C/O ratios and partial hydrogenation of graphene (2.6 at.% of H). Microwave irradiation of graphite oxide in vacuum leads to outgassing from GO and the creation of plasma which aids temperature distribution and hydrogenation. This plasma is quickly extinguished by further dramatic evolution of gases from GO and consequent pressure increase. We assess the influence of precursor graphite oxide, prepared by Hummers, Staudenmaier, and Hofmann methods, upon the materials properties of microwave exfoliated graphene. We show that microwave-exfoliated graphenes prepared from different graphite oxides show very fast heterogeneous electron transfer rates, with similar electrochemical behaviour to thermally reduced graphene oxide. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that unlike the pristine graphene, sodium decorated sheet can effectively interact with the CH4 molecule, so that each metal atom bound on sheet may adsorb up to four CH4. Furthermore, no bond dissociation was observed for the adsorption of CH4 on Na-decorated h-BC 3, which means that decorated sheet can act as a storage device for methane safety storage.

Regarding read operation, access latency increases almost linearly with respect to cell density (the number of bits stored in a cell). Since reads are latency critical, they can seriously impact system performance. This paper alleviates the problem of slow reads in the MLC PCM by exploiting a fundamental property of MLC devices: the Most-Significant Bit (MSB) of MLC cells can be read as fast as SLC cells, while reading the Least-Significant Bits (LSBs) is slower. We propose Striped PCM (SPCM), a memory architecture that leverages this property to keep MLC read latency in the order of SLC's. In order to avoid extra writes onto memory cells as a result of striping memory lines, the proposed design uses a pairing write queue to synchronize write-back requests associated with blocks that are paired in striping mode. Our evaluation shows that our design significantly improves the average memory access latency by more than 30% and IPC by up to 25% (10%, on average), with a slight overhead in memory energy (0.7%) in a 4-core CMP model running memory-intensive benchmarks. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Cytology; Memory architecture; Access latency; Fundamental properties; Least significant bits; Memory access latency; Memory energies; Read latencies; Read operation; Storage capability; Cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905457957

First, we consider the 'off-line' optimization under an idealized assumption that the net energy profile is known ahead of time, and derive its optimal closed-form solution.

The major carotenoids important to humans are α-carotene, β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin. Some of the biological functions and actions of these individual carotenoids are quite similar to each other, whereas others are specific. Besides genotype and location, other environmental effects such as temperature, light, mineral uptake, and pH have been found affect carotenoid development in plant tissues and organs. Therefore, this research investigated the effects of the season and storage periods during postharvest handling on the accumulation of carotenoid in pumpkin. This study shows that long-term storage of pumpkins resulted in the accumulation of lutein and β-carotene with a slight decrease in zeaxanthin. The amounts of β-carotene ranged from 174.583±2.105 mg/100g to 692.871±22.019 mg/100g, lutein from 19.841±9.693 mg/100g to 59.481±1.645 mg/100g, and zeaxanthin from not detected to 2.709±0.118 mg/100g. The pumpkins were collected three times in a year; they differed in that zeaxanthin was present only in the first season, while the amounts of β-carotene and lutein were the highest in the second and third seasons, respectively. By identifying the key factors among the postharvest handling conditions that control specific carotenoid accumulations, a greater understanding of how to enhance the nutritional values of pumpkin and other crops will be gained. Postharvest storage conditions can markedly enhance and influence the levels of zeaxanthin, lutein, and β-carotene in pumpkin. This study describes how the magnitudes of these effects depend on the storage period and season. © 2014 by Japan Oil Chemists' Society.","Carotenoid; Postharvest; Pumpkin; Season; Storage","Chemical engineering; Energy storage; Biological functions; Carotenoid; Carotenoid accumulation; Cucurbita moschata; Post-harvest storage; Postharvest; Pumpkin; Season; Pigments; beta carotene; carotenoid; mineral; xanthophyll; zeaxanthin; chemistry; food storage; light; metabolism; nutritional value; pH; season; squash; temperature; time; beta Carotene; Carotenoids; Cucurbita; Food Storage; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Light; Lutein; Minerals; Nutritive Value; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Zeaxanthins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905198486

Flexible graphene oxide/cotton (GO/Cotton) composite has been prepared by dipping pristine cotton in GO ink. The composite's surface was further modified with polypyrrole (Ppy) via chemical polymerization to obtain Ppy/GO/Cotton composite. The composite was characterized using SEM, FTIR and XRD measurements, while the influence of GO in modifying the physicochemical properties of the composite was also examined using TG and cyclic voltammetry. The achieved mean particle size for Ppy/Cotton, Ppy/GO/Cotton and GO estimated using Scherrer formula are 58, 67 and 554 nm, respectively. FTIR spectra revealed prominent fundamental absorption bands in the range of 1400-1800 cm-1. The increased electrical conductivity as much as 2.2 × 10-1S cm-1for Ppy/GO/Cotton composite measured by complex impedance, is attributed to the formation of continuous conducting network. The partial reduction of GO on the surface of cotton (GO/Cotton) during chemical polymerization can also affect the conductivity. This simple, economic and environmental-friendly preparation method may contribute towards the controlled growth of quality and stable Ppy/GO/Cotton composites for potential applications in microwave attenuation, energy storage system, static electric charge dissipation and electrotherapy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the land-atmospheric water and energy cycle of winter wheat was investigated on Loess Plateau in the northwest of China, using the eddy covariance technique, soil heat flux, and four component radiation measurements during the period from 8 April 2006 to 15 July 2006. Results show that the four components underwent daily changes throughout the period, and varied diurnally according to the synoptic conditions. Latent heat flux was the main consumer of available energy during the studied period. The daily energy partitionings LE/Rn, Hs/Rn and G0/Rn were on average 45%, 34% and 10%, respectively, and the Bowen ratio is estimated at 0.90. Surface albedo of winter wheat field was on average 0.19, over the total period from 8 April to 15 July, but decreased at the time of the heading of the wheat as compared to other seasons because of increased vegetation cover. The energy closure results show that the energy balance closure reached 89% through a thermal storage term of soil correction, which indicates that an energy imbalance of 11% was encountered in our observations. The daily variations in the water and energy fluxes were also analysed, including the diurnal variations on cloudy and clear sky days. Results show that the available sensible as well as latent heat flux both changed daily. The latent heat flux was primarily controlled by antecedent precipitation, with several high latent heat flux days being produced after intensive rain events. The sensible heat flux was mainly controlled by net radiation. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.","Eddy correlation data correction; Land surface process; Water and energy cycle; Winter wheat","Crops; Heat storage; Landforms; Rain; Surface measurement; Weather forecasting; Eddy correlation data; Eddy covariance technique; Energy partitioning; Land-surface process; Radiation measurements; Water and energies; Water and energy fluxes; Winter wheat; Heat flux; albedo; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; correction; correlation; diurnal variation; eddy; energy flux; latent heat flux; sensible heat flux; surface energy; vegetation cover; wheat; China; Loess Plateau; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905057649

Owing to this fact and regarding the random nature of the windspeed, the output power of the windfarm fluctuates. Fluctuating power is a serious problem for high capacity power plants and should be smoothed. As an effective factor on the required battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity value, tracking is the most important part performed by a coordinated control system in the power smoothing process. An ADAptive LInear NEuron (ADALINE)-based power tracking method with a flexible learning rate is proposed in this study. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimisation-based calculation of the learning rate is presented for optimising the proposed tracking method which reduces the required BESS capacity and the investment cost. Moreover, a charging/discharging algorithm for the BESS units is proposed which decreases the number of required BESS units and increases their useful life by reducing the switching activity as well. To evaluate the performance of the proposed coordinated control approach, the real output data of a 99 MW windfarm are tested. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.",,"Maximum power point trackers; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Adaptive linear neurons; Battery energy storage systems; Charging/discharging; Co-ordinated control; Coordinated control system; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Power fluctuations; Switching activities; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905056402

This article presents the theoretical development of an oil-free co-rotating scroll air compressor and turbine working with water injection to make the operations of expansion and compression as isothermal as possible. First experimental results in expander mode are shown. The theoretical performance is predicted with the help of a mathematical model using the equations of energy and mass conservation and the equation of state. This model takes into account the effects of water injection and volumetric losses. The experimental prototype is an oil-free scroll air compressor with the distinctive feature of having two mobile involutes working in synchronized co-rotation one relative to another. The prime-mover is an electric motor driving the two scrolls with two synchronizing belts. Water injection in the housing intends to provide a quasi-isothermal compression. The same deVICe is used as an isothermal expander by supplying high-pressure air with water when it rotates backwards in expander mode, the electric motor acting then as a generator. Expected improvements to a standard scroll compressor and expander are a better volumetric efficiency and a greater power density due to a higher rotational speed of the scrolls, thanks to their symmetrical masses. The isothermal processes increase also the overall performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The hormones coordinate appraisal processes and decision making during the initial phase of a stressful experience and promote subsequently cognitive performance underlying the management of stress adaptation. This action exerted by the steroids on the initiation and termination of the stress response is mediated by 2 related receptor systems: miner-alocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). The receptor types are unevenly distributed but colocalized in abundance in neurons of the limbic brain to enable these complementary hormone actions. This contribution starts from a historical perspective with the observation that phasic occupancy of GR during ultradian rhythmicity is needed to maintain responsiveness to corticosteroids. Then, during stress, initially MR activation enhances excitability of limbic networks that are engaged in appraisal and emotion regulation. Next, the rising hormone concentration occupies GR, resulting in reallocation of energy to limbic-cortical circuits with a role in behavioral adaptation and memory storage. Upon MR: GR imbalance, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occurs, which can enhance an individual's vulnerability. Imbalance is characteristic for chronic stress experience and depression but also occurs during exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids. Hence, glucocorticoid psychopathology may develop in susceptible individuals because of suppression of ultradian/circadian rhythmicity and depletion of endogenous corticosterone from brain MR. This knowledge generated from testing the balance hypothesis can be translated to arational glucocorticoid therapy.

An increasing number of thermoelectric elements, such as heat pumps and thermal storage, will enable conversion from heat to electricity and vice versa. Control in this environment therefore requires an integral management of both the heat network and the electricity network. In this paper we present a simulation framework which is able to simulate and coordinate multi-commodity flows on a district level using a wide variety of appliance models, taking into account different types of business objectives (e.g. time of use tariffs, peak shaving, etc.). To manage these flows a market-based multi-commodity algorithm, for integrated coordination of electricity and heat flows, was developed and integrated in the simulation framework. The algorithm is an enhancement of the PowerMatcher concept and thus inherits its advantages such as scalability and user autonomy.

For the controllable loads by presenting a new controlling algorithms, the consumption of these loads is changed or postponed to another time, with regard to the uncertainties of wind generation and the energy price of upstream distribution network, and of course by considering the welfare level of consumers. On the other hand, Monte Carlo simulation method has been used, in order to model the uncertainties of wind generation, energy price of the upstream distribution network, power consumption of uncontrollable loads, and also the failure probability of units and disconnection probability from the network. In this method, various scenarios have been generated and involved in the operation optimization program with other required inputs for the next 24h.

This paper describes an on-going effort in hybrid modeling and co-simulation of the physical and control domains of district heating networks. The focus is on modeling each domain using semantics and tools natural to each; we also describe the challenges of, and a method for, integration and synchronization of the simulation models in each domain. Here, the dataflow model of computation used by Simulink provides a flexible industry-grade environment for modeling the dynamics of heat energy flows, and the IEC 61499 automation architecture facilitates distributed systems modeling and enables rapid deployment to field hardware. At the application level, we show how this framework enables the study of energy flows within a producer/consumer (prosumer) and the analysis of the economic value of integrating distributed solar thermal generation and storage into a prosumer participating in a district heating network. © 2014 IEEE.","co-simulation; distributed generation; district heating; hybrid modeling; IEC 61499; producer/consumer; prosumer; synchronization; thermal energy networks","Computer simulation; Data flow analysis; Distributed power generation; District heating; Semantics; Standards; Synchronization; Thermal energy; Cosimulation; Energy networks; Hybrid model; IEC 61499; producer/consumer; Prosumer; Models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904657896

Here we review the major tenets of this research to arrive at three major conclusions: First, individual differences in physical activity traits are significantly influenced by genetic factors, but genetic contribution varies strongly over age, with heritability of leisure time exercise behavior ranging from 27% to 84% and heritability of sedentary behaviors ranging from 9% to 48%. Second, candidate gene approaches based on animal or human QTLs or on biological relevance (e.g., dopaminergic or cannabinoid activity in the brain, or exercise performance influencing muscle physiology) have not yet yielded the necessary evidence to specify the genetic mechanisms underlying the heritability of physical activity traits. Third, there is significant genetic modulation of the beneficial effects of daily physical activity patterns on strength and endurance improvements and on health-related parameters like body mass index. Further increases in our understanding of the genetic determinants of sedentary and exercise behaviors as well as the genetic modulation of their effects on fitness and health will be key to meaningful future intervention on these behaviors.

The aim of this work was to assess the influence of the bis-EMA content on the degree of conversion (DC) and its effect on the water sorption and solubility. Materials and methods. In a polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) mould, 30 samples (O = 5 mm, height = 2 mm) of four experimental dental composite resins were cured for 10 s, 20 s and 40 s. The DC was analysed by Fourier Transform (FT)-Raman spectroscopy. To analyse sorption and solubility, six samples (O = 15 mm and thickness = 1 mm) of each composite (n = 72) were stored in water at 37°C for different storage periods: 24 h, 7 days and 30 days. Results. When cured for 20 or 40 s the DC increased with the increasing content of bis-EMA. However, the presence of 15 wt% of bis-GMA did not affect the DC, except when cured with 10 s irradiation time. This study also found a correlation between the content of bis-EMA and the reduced values for sorption and solubility, for all storage times used, when the materials were cured with 20 s. Conclusions. The DC of mixtures with higher content of bis-EMA is affected by the presence of bis-GMA at lower energy density delivered from the curing device, suggesting that the restrictions caused by the presence of hydrogen bonds is dependent of the irradiation time used. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.","Bis-EMA; Dental composites; Energy density; FT-Raman spectroscopy; Hydrogen bonds","2,2-di(4-methacryloxyphenyl)propane; benzhydryl derivative; bisphenol A bis(2 hydroxypropyl) ether dimethacrylate; dental material; methacrylic acid derivative; water; chemistry; Fourier analysis; Raman spectrometry; solubility; Benzhydryl Compounds; Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate; Dental Materials; Fourier Analysis; Methacrylates; Solubility; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904633632

Among them, adding Fe2O3 leads to the most pronounced improvement on the onset dehydrogenation temperature and desorption kinetic rate. The dehydrogenation temperature of the 5 wt.% Fe2O3-doped LiAlH4 sample was reduced to 80 °C and 145 °C in the first and second stages, respectively, compared with 150 °C and 180 °C for the as-received LiAlH4. In terms of the desorption kinetics, the 5 wt.% Fe2O3-doped LiAlH4 sample released about 3.8 wt.% hydrogen at 90 °C after 60 minutes of dehydrogenation, but all the other doped samples released less than 0.7 wt.% hydrogen under the same conditions. From the Kissinger plot based on differential scanning calorimetry at different heating rates, the apparent activation energy of the as-received LiAlH4 was calculated to be 102 and 110 kJ/mol for the first two dehydrogenation steps, and these values were reduced by 84 and 96 kJ/mol, respectively, after being doped with Fe2O3. Based on the X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy examinations, it is believed that the significant improvement of LiAlH4 dehydrogenation properties in the Fe2O3-doped samples was due to the synergetically catalytic effects of the in-situ generated Li5FeO4 and Fe0.974O that were formed during the milling process. © 2014 The Authors.","Complex hydride; Dehydrogenation properties; Hydrogen storage; Lithium alanate; Metal oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904615745

Intermittent renewables could reduce its load factor and revenues, so flexible capture unit operation strategies (flexible CCS) have been suggested to increase profits: CO2 venting and lean- and rich-solvent storage. In this study we quantify the benefits of flexible CCS for both the power plant operator and the total Dutch power system. We use a unit commitment and dispatch model of the northwest European electricity system to simulate the hourly operation of two coal-fired power plants with flexible CCS in 2020 and 2030. We find that flexible capture unit operation hardly affects electricity generation (revenues) because the flexible operation capabilities are not often utilized. CO2 venting is hardly used due to high CO2 prices (43 €/tCO2 in 2020 and 112 €/tCO2 in 2030). The impact of rich-solvent storage is limited because of regeneration constraints of the base-load power plant. The main benefit of flexible CCS is an increase in reserve capacity provision by the power plant of 20-300% compared to non-flexible operation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ancillary services; Electricity market simulation; Power generation; Solvent storage","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Fossil fuel power plants; Power generation; Solvents; Wind power; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal storage; Cost effectiveness; Fossil fuel power plants; Power generation; Solvents; Wind power; Ancillary service; Carbon capture and storage; Coal-fired power generation; Cost-effective technology; Electricity market simulation; Intermittent renewables; Large-scale wind power; Post-combustion CO; Coal-fired power plant; Carbon capture; Carbon capture; alternative energy; carbon sequestration; coal-fired power plant; electricity supply; power generation; renewable resource; wind power; carbon dioxide; combustion; electricity generation; environmental economics; venting; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904548167

Herein, we put forward a smart strategy to convert used disposable bamboo chopsticks into uniform carbon fibers for anodes of LIBs. Bamboo chopsticks waste is recycled and simply treated by a controllable hydrothermal process performed in alkaline solutions, wherein abundant natural cellulose fibers in bamboo in situ get separated and dispersed spontaneously. After carbonization, the evolved carbon fibers exhibit superior anodic performance to the bulky bamboo carbons counterpart, and competitive electrochemical behavior and cost with commercial graphite. The performance of carbon fibers can be further upgraded by growing nanostructured metal oxides (like MnO2) firmly on each fiber scaffold to form a synergetic core-shell electrode architecture. A high reversible capacity of ∼710 mA h g-1 is maintained without decay up to 300 cycles. Our strategy presents a scalable route to transform chopsticks waste into carbon fibers, offering a very promising way to make sustainable anodes for LIBs and economical multi-functional carbon-based hybrids available for other practical applications.

However, in the last couple of years larger PV power plants in the range of 100MW have been installed and set in operation. An important question that arises for very large scale PV power systems is the optimization of the overall system configuration, especially due to the very high initial costs and the financing of such projects. Several concepts in the literature have been investigated regarding efficiency and technical feasibility; however it is also important to evaluate their economic feasibility, using commonly accepted metrics. In this paper four different system configurations are presented, with the typical system configuration of central inverters and medium voltage transformers used as a reference. The other three alternatives include high power DC-DC converters connected in series or in parallel, as well as cascaded DC-AC inverters. In addition, taking into account current developments in energy storage, new possibilities for combining PV with energy storage for large scale plants are rising, in order to deal with the grid integration of ever increasing PV installations. Therefore, a comparison is performed among a PV power plant with and without energy storage for different operation scenarios. The results show clearly the increase of cost and indicate the need for new evaluation metrics to include the expected benefits from the integration of energy storage to PV power systems. © 2014 IEEE.","Cascaded DC-AC; DC-DC Converter; Energy Storage; LCOE; Techno-economic evaluation; Very Large Scale PV systems","DC-DC converters; Ecology; Energy storage; Lead acid batteries; Power plants; Alternative configurations; Cascaded DC-AC; Economic feasibilities; Evaluation metrics; LCOE; PV system; System configurations; Techno-economic evaluation; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904497776

Theoretically the performance being analysed is based on a quasistatic model developed for the car. The quasistatic model is a way to represent the powertrain components in equation forms and is more accurate than earlier developed static models. The theoretical data is obtained by simulating the quasistatic model with a specific drive cycle and analysis is on the energy consumption patterns, the range possible with a full charge on battery and look into how much it differs from the average operating point model. The performance of the car will also be simulated under different operating conditions to give a better idea on the car's theoretical operations. These simulations are primarily based in excel and will be valuable when the car is tested with a dynamometer. Apart from the simulation, the preparatory and miscellaneous works are also discussed in view of upcoming dynamometer tests. These works are mainly into the implementation of a comprehensive data acquisition system and power distribution unit. These systems together with the quasistatic model will provide a reference with which the actual driving and testing data from a dynamometer test can be compared with, enabling for better calibration of the model. © 2014 IEEE.","data acquisition; Efficiency; energy consumption; quasistatic modeling; range estimation; regenerative braking; vehicle performance","Data acquisition; Digital storage; Dynamometers; Ecology; Efficiency; Energy utilization; Lead acid batteries; Powertrains; Regenerative braking; Data acquisition system; Different operating conditions; Electronic differential; Performance simulation; Power distribution units; Powertrain components; Quasi-static model; Range estimation; Vehicle performance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904490780

The first is storage, which smooths the fluctuations of the renewable energy generation across time. The second is the concept of distributed generation combined with cooperation by exchanging energy among the distributed sources. This technique leads to energy aggregation from diverse sources, which averages out the variation in the energy production across space. The trade-off present between the two techniques is analyzed, and the optimal combination of storage and cooperation to achieve a certain grid performance is investigated. The problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the time average cost of energy exchange within the grid. First, an analytical model of the optimal cost is provided by investigating the steady state of the system for some specific scenarios. Then, an algorithm to solve the cost minimization problem using the technique of Lyapunov optimization is developed. The algorithm is implemented on the renewable energy data provided by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) of the United States. The results show that in the presence of limited storage devices, the grid can benefit greatly from cooperation, whereas in the presence of large storage, cooperation does not yield much benefit. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Distributed power generation; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Virtual storage; Distributed sources; Integration of renewable energies; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Optimal combination; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Smart grid systems; Stochastic optimization problems; Communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904479750

We propose and implement a broker/proxy based architecture that stages data at a broker/proxy, and selectively downloads to the mobile device only those contents that have a high likelihood of being viewed. The system determines the relevance of social media updates that continuously arrive (e.g., Facebook friend updates) for each user. Using knowledge of this relevance and current network/system conditions, we develop scheduling algorithms that determine which social contents are sent to the devices. We develop an Android app providing offline access to Facebook. Our experimental results indicate that our system is energy efficient, which saves energy by 6.9 times for WiFi and 9.1 times for cellular connections. We also use data traces gathered from our app to further drive extensive simulation based evaluations which show that our proposed algorithms provide efficient facilities for tuning the system's performance.1 © 2014 IEEE.","energy consumption; mobile devices; offline access; optimization; Social networks","Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Social networking (online); Energy efficient; Extensive simulations; Mobile users; Offline; Social contents; Social media; Social Network Sites; System's performance; Mobile devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904440647

The bidding strategy of a VPP, as a participant in energy and reserve markets, has significant role in maximizing its profit. This paper proposes a new mathematical approach based on a comprehensive model for bidding of a VPP in energy and reserve markets. In our proposed model network topology, VPP security constraints, constraints of distributed energy resources (DER) composing the VPP, power loss in the VPP and the balance between supply and demand are considered. The method determines the amount of energy and reserve that should be bought or sold in day-ahead markets, commitment of DER units, charge or discharge status of storage units and the amount of load curtailments. We have used Benders decomposition (BD) method for solving the problem. The results obtained using BD technique is compared with those obtained using genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation results confirm that using BD is more advantageous for solving the problem. It is also shown that BD can be applied to bidding problem of large-scale VPPs considering all the constraints. It is also observed that computational time for solving the problem using GA and the optimality of the solution are major obstacles for applying GA to solve large-scale VPPs.

The most ambitious goal is to become net-zero relative to fossil fuels or to employ the concept of the energy neutral community/campus. Essentially, both terms denote an energy configuration in which the amount of fossil fuel-based energy used over the course of a year is equal to the amount of energy derived from renewable energy sources that is exported from the community/campus to a power or thermal grid for external users' consumption. Under ideal circumstances, the community consumes no fossil fuel-based energy, only energy generated from renewable sources; this would require the availability of long-term thermal and power storage systems. The achievement of such energy goals in economical and physically realistic ways would require new, unconventional approaches with respect to organization, implementation, funding, and technical decisions. The technical approach involves the emphasis on energy conservation, implementation of energy efficiency measures, use of waste energy streams, reduction of fossil fuel-based energy (if needed), and/or complementation or replacement of fossil fuel-based energy with energy derived from renewable sources. This paper explores approaches used by some of the most innovative International Energy Agency (IEA) countries to develop an ideal road map and transition process to reach net-zero or near net-zero energy targets; analyzes best practices in different countries to provide the best examples of net-zero applications across the globe; and, based on an analysis of solutions using front-running methods and technologies, makes recommendations for energy master planning towards net-zero communities and campuses. © 2014 ASHRAE.",,"Climate change; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Efficiency measure; Energy configurations; International energy agency; Power storage system; Renewable energy source; Technical decision; Transition process; Unconventional approaches; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904298010

In the medium energy machines like the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland and ELETTRA at Sincrotrone Trieste, Italy the beam life time is dominated by the large angle intra-beam scattering. A third harmonic superconducting rf system allows to cope efficiently with this effect. By increasing the beam induced harmonic voltage, the slope of the global accelerating voltage seen by the electrons during one revolution in the storage ring is flattened and the electron bunches are lengthened therefore reducing the intra-beam scattering. In summer 2002 an idle superconducting third harmonic cavity was installed at SLS followed shortly by another one at ELETTRA. At SLS the beam lifetime was increased by a factor of three and the beam current could be increased from 150 to 400mA [1]. This represented the first superconducting application of a high harmonic rf system in a storage ring. The superconducting cavity is cooled with liquid helium at 4.5K by a dedicated cryogenic system. During the past ten years of operation we had eliminated step-by-step all the cryogenic problems encountered with the operation of this facility such that now it operates unattended on a 12 month basis. Stable operation at 400mA is now well established as a standard for the SLS storage ring.

They are especially suitable for reducing the complexity of managing tasks, by providing a mechanism for automatically tuning the system without human intervention. Policy-based systems have been applied for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for controlling several functionalities. However, none of them has been proposed as a storage model, by making a clear distinction between storage functions and their behaviour. In this paper we propose SeSP, a Sensor Storage model based on Policies. SeSP explores concepts that are common in storage models proposed for WSNs in order to reduce the number of message transmissions and thus minimize the sensors' energy consumption. We have conducted a case study applying our policy-based system on two existing storage models: Scoop and DYSTO. Our experimental study, based on simulations, shows that SeSP can effectively reduce the number of transmissions, compared to the fixed values considered by both systems. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Complex networks; Energy utilization; Flexible system; Human intervention; Message transmissions; Number of transmissions; Policy-based systems; Storage function; Storage model; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904197569

CO2 from energy represents about 75% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Annex B (Developed) countries, and over 60% of global emissions. Because of impermeable cap rocks hydrocarbon reservoirs are able to sequester CO2. In addition, due to high-demand for oil worldwide, injection of CO2 is a useful way to enhance oil production. Hence, applying an efficient method to co-optimize CO2 storage and oil production is vital. Lack of suitable optimization techniques in the past led most multi-objective optimization problems to be tackled in the same way as a single objective optimization issue. However, there are some basic differences between the multi and single objective optimization methods. In this study, by using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for an oil reservoir, some appropriate scenarios are proposed based on simultaneous gas storage and enhanced oil recovery optimization. The advantages of this method allow us to amend production scenarios after implementing the optimization process, by regarding the variation of economic parameters such as oil price and CO2 tax. This leads to reduced risks and time duration of making new decisions based on upcoming situations. © 2014 The Authors.","carbon dioxide; decision making; enhanced oil recovery; Greenhouse gas emission; multi-objective optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904189846

This collection method affects the freshness of the data and creates latency in predicting movement patterns. In addition, due to the great amount of packets being sent and received, the sensor nodes' energy is quickly exhausted. Although this data collection method might result in a higher accuracy rate for prediction, it does not extend the lifetime of the sensor network. In this paper, a distributed method is proposed in using the network structure of convex polygons. These polygons are cooperated to find the trajectories of an object and then these trajectories are used to predict objects' movement. The proposed method, based on Trajectory-tree Construction, should reduce both the storage space of collected trajectories and the time spent on trajectory prediction analysis.

In this paper, we demonstrate that a market for balancing has not emerged in the Dutch electricity industry, and that, instead, the balancing transactions are governed by regulated, long-term contracts and a bidding mechanism. We explain the absence of a balancing market by using the framework of transaction cost economics, in which the efficiency of a market decreases with increasing investments in specific assets. The results of a questionnaire among the energy firms that supply balancing power in the Dutch setting show that these firms have invested in specific physical, temporal and dedicated balancing assets. The need for these specific investments to balance supply and demand does not only explain the absence of a market, but also the lack of participation by small firms in the balancing mechanism. We recommend several policies, such as stimulating technological developments for the storage of electricity and demand side management, which reduce these specific investments in balancing assets, and thereby stimulate the creation of a market and the participation of small firms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Balancing mechanism; Electricity market; European rules; Specific investments; Transaction cost economics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904158597

This work discusses the perspectives of treating effluents through anaerobic digestion as well as reporting the experience of using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor as biorefinery annex in a pulp and paper industrial plant to be burned in the boilers. The performance of the reactors has shown to be stable under considerable variations in load and showed a significant potential in terms of biogas production. The reactors UASB treated 3600.00 m3 of effluent daily from a production of 150.00 tons. The biogas generation was 234.000 kg/year/mill, equivalent in combustible oil. The results of methane gas generated by the anaerobic system UASB (8846.00 kcal/m3) dislocate the equivalent of 650.0 kg of combustible oil (10000.00 kcal/kg) per day (or 234.000 kg/year). The production of 8846.00 Kcal/m3 of energy from biogas can make a run at industrial plant for 2 hours. This substitution can save US$ 128.700 annually (or US$ 550.0 of fuel oil/tons).

The distributed EES (DEES) is locally managed by aggregators to maximize the local impact of EES, before the aggregators' adjusted load profiles are submitted to grid operators for the day-ahead scheduling.

After evaluating the performance of the enhanced opposition-based firefly algorithm (EOFA) with fifteen benchmark functions, it is then adopted to determine the optimal size for BESS. Two optimization processes are conducted where the first optimization aims to obtain the optimal battery output power on hourly basis and the second optimization aims to obtain the optimal BESS capacity by considering the state of charge constraint of BESS. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by applying the algorithm to the 69-bus distribution system and by comparing the performance of EOFA with conventional firefly algorithm and gravitational search algorithm.

Their main limitation, however, is the low volumetric energy density when compared with batteries. Here, we describe a hierarchically structured carbon microfibre made of an interconnected network of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes with interposed nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets. The nanomaterials form mesoporous structures of large specific surface area (396 m 2 g-1) and high electrical conductivity (102 S cm-1). We develop a scalable method to continuously produce the fibres using a silica capillary column functioning as a hydrothermal microreactor. The resultant fibres show a specific volumetric capacity as high as 305 F cm-3 in sulphuric acid (measured at 73.5 mA cm-3 in a three-electrode cell) or 300 F cm-3 in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H 3 PO 4 electrolyte (measured at 26.7 mA cm-3 in a two-electrode cell).

However, due to the instability of the wind turbine output, the high penetration of wind power in the system may affect relatively the system's power quality (voltage and frequency) and reliability. The past studies suggested that the optimal penetration level for wind generation be 26.3% under the present dispatching criteria in Penghu. This study suggests that the criteria of current unit scheduling have to be adjusted by increasing the spinning reserve capacity of the diesel engines without affecting the reliability and power quality of Penghu power system, consequently avoiding the construction of high-cost energy storage systems. The proposed method can determine the number of online diesel units and the needed reserve capacity under different load levels by considering the reliability of power supply, the criteria for the limit of wind power penetration, the distribution in different sites for the wind turbines, and the required spinning reserve to compensate the energy loss when a single diesel unit trips offline or any N-1 accident occurs. © 2014 IEEE.","Dispatching Criteria; Penghu Island; Reliability and Power Quality; Spinning Reserve; Wind Power Penetration","Diesel engines; Energy dissipation; Power quality; Reliability; Scheduling; Standby power systems; Wind turbines; Dispatching Criteria; Penghu Island; Reliability and power qualities; Spinning reserves; Wind power penetration; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904013070

The increased complexity results in a very challenging design process, as the satellites have to meet very strict requirements in terms of orbital dynamics, power budgets and data distribution. The limited available volume in cubesat platforms furthermore drives the need for combining multiple solutions for different types of problems into the same component or subsystem.

The concept of this paper differs from conventional methods of energy saving in HVAC systems by integrating the control of both these HVAC systems and the available natural ventilation that is based on the temperature difference between the indoor and the outdoor air. This difference affects the rate of change of indoor air enthalpy or indoor air potential energy storage. However, this is not efficient enough as there are other factors affecting the rate of change of indoor air enthalpy that should be considered to achieve maximum energy saving. One way of improvement can be through the use of model guide for comparison (MGFC) that uses physical-empirical hybrid modelling to predict the rate of change of indoor air potential energy storage considering building fabric and its fixture. Three methods (normal, conventional and proposed) are tested on an identical residential building model using predicted mean vote (PMV) sensor as a criterion test for thermal comfort standard.

The structure is composed of a wind turbine based on a doubly fed induction generator, which is assumed without the presence of energy storage systems (ESS) and other distributed generators (DGs). In this paper, the stand-alone structure is considered to operate in real conditions, and the real wind profile has been applied. The challenge ahead in this situation, is inequality between the mechanical power received from the wind, and the demanded power of local load. Regulation of the voltage and frequency is also the responsibility of DFIG. The proposed power management method operates considering the amount of kinetic energy stored in the turbine inertia, so that more exploitation of wind turbine is possible under these conditions. This power management method has not been studied in the references yet. In this method, when the received power from the wind is more than the load power, the controlling method based on the pitch angle control, operates in a way that the most possible kinetic energy may be stored in the inertia of the turbine, thus the local load is fed for longer time. If the load power is greater than the received power from the wind, the unnecessary loads elimination method is suggested. The proposed method by matlab/simulink is simulated and its results are analyzed at the end. According to the results, it can be concluded that the stability of the turbine in stand-alone mode is increased and the local load is fed at a fixed voltage and fixed frequency, based on the proposed power management method. © 2014 IEEE.","DFIG; inertia of the turbine; mechanical torque; power management; stand-alone wind turbine; wind profile","Distributed power generation; Electric fault currents; Electrical engineering; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Wind turbines; DFIG; DFIG-based wind turbines; Distributed generator (DGs); Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Energy storage systems; Mechanical torque; Power management method; Wind profiles; Power management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903844406

To protect these memories, most of the modern processors employ Error Detection Codes (EDCs) or Error Correction Codes (ECCs). EDCs/ECCs impose significant overheads in terms of area and energy; these overheads increase as a function of interleaving EDCs/ECCs to detect/correct multiple errors. This paper proposes a new cache architecture to minimize the area and energy overheads of EDCs/ECCs in set-associative L1-caches. Simulation results for a 4-way set-associative cache show that the proposed architecture reduces both the area and static power overheads of parity code by about 75% and the dynamic energy overhead by about 73% in comparison to conventional cache architecture. These reduction figures are about 68% and about 66%, respectively, for SEC-DED code.

This is required in order to resolve data dependencies as early as possible in the pipeline, which otherwise would suffer from stall cycles. A significant amount of energy is wasted due to this fast access, since the data can only reside in one of the ways. While it is possible to reduce L1 DC energy usage by accessing the tag and data memories sequentially, hence activating only one data way on a tag match, this approach significantly increases execution time due to an increased number of stall cycles. We propose an early load data dependency detection (ELD 3) technique for in-order pipelines. This technique makes it possible to detect if a load instruction has a data dependency with a subsequent instruction. If there is no such dependency, then the tag and data accesses for the load are sequentially performed so that only the data way in which the data resides is accessed. If there is a dependency, then the tag and data arrays are accessed in parallel to avoid introducing additional stall cycles. For the MiBench benchmark suite, the ELD3 technique enables about 49% of all load operations to access the L1 DC sequentially. Based on 65-nm data using commercial SRAM blocks, the proposed technique reduces L1 DC energy by 13%. © 2014 EDAA.",,"Pipelines; Static random access storage; Access latency; Benchmark suites; Data caches; Data dependencies; Data memory; Energy usage; Load operations; Set-associative; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903827626

Moreover, the FFP was modeled based on mass conservation and first law of thermodynamics for a non-adiabatic cylinder. Due to high operating pressure, AGA-8 equation of state (EOS) was utilized for accurate computation of necessary thermodynamic properties. Both applied models for compression and FFP were compared with the real data. In particular, the FFP model was evaluated using experimental data obtained from an operating compressed natural gas (CNG) station in Sanandaj, Iran.

Not all data need to be refreshed with the same frequency, though, and thus some refresh operations can safely be delayed. Tracking such information allows the memory controller to reduce refresh costs by judiciously choosing when to refresh different rows Solutions that store imprecise information miss opportunities to avoid unnecessary refresh operations, but the storage for tracking complete information scales with memory capacity. We therefore propose a flexible approach to refresh management that tracks complete refresh information within the DRAM itself, where it incurs negligible storage costs (0.006% of total capacity) and can be managed easily in hardware or software. Completely tracking multiple types of refresh information (e.g., row retention time and data validity) maximizes refresh reduction and lets us choose the most effective refresh schemes. Our evaluations show that our approach saves 25-82% of the total DRAM energy over prior refresh-reduction mechanisms. © 2014 ACM.","dram refresh; energy saving; refresh management","Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy conservation; Complete information; Data integrity; DRAM refresh; Imprecise information; Memory capacity; Memory controller; Refresh reductions; Retention time; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903772378

The mTHPC (Foscan®) is a commercial chlorin, used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and is classified as a second-generation drug in PDT. The present work is to obtain quantum chemistry properties which can explain the high efficiency of the mTHPC compared with its isomers (ortho and para) and other chlorins. Based in the chemical hardness and ionization potential obtained from HOMO and LUMO orbitals energy, our results show that all chlorins have similar reactivity. Moreover, all chlorins have approximately the same capacity to storage energy in the triplet excited state, with energy differences between the ground state and the triplet excited state of 1.38, 1.39 and 1.36 eV for oTHPC, mTHPC and pTHPC, respectively. The calculated UV spectra (a very important quantity which can be correlated with the photosensitizer (PS) efficiency property), shows that the present chlorins all have a peak at 622 nm. Finally, after analysis of the dipole moment differences, between the three isomers, an explanation about the greater mTHPC efficiency in PDT, was possible. Due to its greater lipophilic character, mTHPC is absorbed by tumor cells to a greater degree than oTHPC and pTHPC. Our findings are consistent with literature and can be used to help new drug design for use in PDT. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","chlorins; drug design; PDT; quantum chemistry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903769524

Due to process variations of advanced CMOS technologies, it becomes both challenging and costly to maintain perfectly functioning memories under all anticipated operating conditions. Thus, Voltage over Scaling (VoS) has emerged as a means to achieve energy efficient systems resulting in a tradeoff between energy efficiency and reliability. In this paper we present the algorithm and VLSI architecture of a novel error-resilient K-Best MIMO detector based on the combined distribution of channel noise and induced errors due to VoS. The simulation results show that, compared with a conventional MIMO detector design, the proposed algorithm provides up-to 4.5 dB gain to achieve the near-optimal Packet Error Rate (PER) performance in the 4 × 4 64-QAM system. Furthermore, based on experimental results, when jointly considering the detector and memory power consumption, the proposed resilient scheme with VoS memory can achieve up to 32.64% savings compared to the conventional K-Best detector with perfect memory. © 2014 IEEE.","MIMO detector; MIMO OFDM; SRAM; VLSI; voltage over scaling; wireless communication","Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Errors; Gain control; Memory architecture; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Static random access storage; VLSI circuits; Efficiency and reliability; Energy efficient systems; MIMO detectors; MIMO-OFDM; Operating condition; VLSI; Wireless communication system; Wireless communications; MIMO systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903741422

Beams of atomic carbon anions (C-) and smaller carbon anion molecules (C-2, C-3, C-4 etc.) have been produced in a sputter ion source, accelerated to 10 keV or 20 keV, and stored successfully in the two electrostatic rings. The rings are enclosed in a common vacuum chamber cooled to below 13 Kelvin. The DESIREE facility allows for studies of internally relaxed single isolated atomic, molecular and cluster ions and for collision experiments between cat- and anions down to very low center-of-mass collision energies (meV scale). The total thermal load of the vacuum chamber at this temperature is measured to be 32 W. The decay rates of stored ion beams have two components: a non-exponential component caused by the space charge of the beam itself which dominates at early times and an exponential term from the neutralization of the beam in collisions with residual gas at later times. The residual gas limited storage lifetime of carbon anions in the symmetric ring is over seven minutes while the 1/e lifetime in the asymmetric ring is measured to be about 30 seconds. Although we aim to improve the storage in the second ring, the number of stored ions are now sufficient for many merged beams experiments with positive and negative ions requiring milliseconds to seconds ion storage.",,"Atoms; Decay (organic); Electrostatics; Ion beams; Ion sources; Ionization of gases; Scheduling; Asymmetric rings; Collision energies; Collision experiments; Exponential components; Ion-ion collision; Ongoing commissioning; Stockholm University; Vacuum chambers; Limited storage; Negative ions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903699790

This evolution was marked by the introduction of policies to optimize the tape sub-system throughput, going towards a cold storage system where data placement is managed by the experiments' production managers. More efficient tape migrations and recalls have been implemented and deployed where bulk meta-data operations greatly reduce the overhead due to small files. A repack facility is now integrated in the system and it has been enhanced in order to automate the repacking of several tens of petabytes, required in 2014 in order to prepare for the next LHC run. Finally the scheduling system has been evolved to integrate the internal monitoring. To efficiently manage the service a solid monitoring infrastructure is required, able to analyze the logs produced by the different components (about 1 kHz of log messages). A new system has been developed and deployed, which uses a transport messaging layer provided by the CERN-IT Agile Infrastructure and exploits technologies including Hadoop and HBase. This enables efficient data mining by making use of MapReduce techniques, and real-time data aggregation and visualization. The outlook for the future is also presented. Directions and possible evolution will be discussed in view of the restart of data taking activities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cold storage; Data mining; Data visualization; High energy physics; Throughput; Data placement; Data stream; Production manager; Real-time data; Scheduling systems; Small files; Storage systems; Sub-systems; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903649630

In this paper we present how different technologies can be leveraged to build a storage service with differing cost, power, performance, scalability and reliability profiles, using the popular storage solution Disk Pool Manager (DPM/dmlite) as the enabling technology. The storage manager DPM is designed for these new environments, allowing users to scale up and down as they need it, and optimizing their computing centers energy efficiency and costs. DPM runs on high-performance machines, profiting from multi-core and multi-CPU setups. It supports separating the database from the metadata server, the head node, largely reducing its hard disk requirements. Since version 1.8.6, DPM is released in EPEL and Fedora, simplifying distribution and maintenance, but also supporting the ARM architecture beside i386 and x86-64, allowing it to run the smallest low-power machines such as the Raspberry Pi or the CuBox. This usage is facilitated by the possibility to scale horizontally using a main database and a distributed memcached-powered namespace cache. Additionally, DPM supports a variety of storage pools in the backend, most importantly HDFS, S3-enabled storage, and cluster file systems, allowing users to fit their DPM installation exactly to their needs. In this paper, we investigate the power-efficiency and total cost of ownership of various DPM configurations. We develop metrics to evaluate the expected performance of a setup both in terms of namespace and disk access considering the overall cost including equipment, power consumptions, or data/storage fees. The setups tested range from the lowest scale using Raspberry Pis with only 700MHz single cores and a 100Mbps network connections, over conventional multi-core servers to typical virtual machine instances in cloud settings. We evaluate the combinations of different name server setups, for example load-balanced clusters, with different storage setups, from using a classic local configuration to private and public clouds. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Costs; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; File organization; Green computing; High energy physics; Managers; ARM processors; Cluster File Systems; Enabling technologies; High-performance machines; Local configurations; Multi-core servers; Network connection; Reliability profiles; Total cost of ownership; Storage management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903649625

The goals for such a service include (a) vendor neutrality, (b) horizontal scalability with commodity hardware, (c) fault tolerance at the disk, host, and network levels, and (d) support for geo-replication. Ceph is an attractive option due to its native block device layer RBD which is built upon its scalable, reliable, and performant object storage system, RADOS. It can be considered an ""organic"" storage solution because of its ability to balance and heal itself while living on an ever-changing set of heterogeneous disk servers.

We will first present the architecture and configuration of our cluster, including a summary of best practices learned from the community and discovered internally.

We implement specialised storage services to provide tools for optimal data management, based on the evolution of data volumes, the available technologies and the observed experiment and users' usage patterns. Our current solutions are CASTOR, for highly-reliable tape-backed storage for heavy-duty Tier-0 workflows, and EOS, for disk-only storage for full-scale analysis activities. CASTOR is evolving towards a simplified disk layer in front of the tape robotics, focusing on recording the primary data from the detectors. EOS is now a well-established storage service used intensively by the four big LHC experiments. Its conceptual design based on multi-replica and in-memory namespace, makes it the perfect system for data intensive workflows. The LHC-Long Shutdown 1 (LSI) presents a window of opportunity to shape up both of our storage services and validate against the ongoing analysis activity in order to successfully face the new LHC data taking period in 2015.

Tape is an ever-changing technology that is still following Moore's law in terms of capacity. This means we can store every year more and more data in the same amount of tapes. However this doesn't come for free: the first obvious cost is the new higher capacity media. The second less known cost is related to moving the data from the old tapes to the new ones. This activity is what we call repack. Repack is vital for any large tape user: without it, one would have to buy more tape libraries and more floor space and, eventually, data on old non supported tapes would become unreadable and be lost forever. In this paper we describe the challenge of repacking 115 PB before LHC data taking starts in the beginning of 2015. This process will have to run concurrently with the existing experiment tape activities, and therefore needs to be as transparent as possible for users. Making sure that this works out seamlessly implies careful planning of the resources and the various policies for sharing them fairly and conveniently. To tackle this problem we need to fully exploit the speed and throughput of our modern tape drives. This involves proper dimensioning and configuration of the disk arrays and all the links between them and the tape servers, i.e the machines responsible for managing the tape drives. It is also equally important to provide tools to improve the efficiency with which we use our tape libraries. The new repack setup we deployed has on average increased tape drive throughput by 80%, allowing them to perform closer to their design specifications. This improvement in turn means a 48% decrease in the number of drives needed to achieve the required throughput to complete the full repack on time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Drives; High energy physics; Libraries; Tape drives; Throughput; Design specification; Disk array; Floor space; Moore's Law; Non-supported; Physics data; Tape library; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903639282

This paper presents a parametric stochastic optimization model, that combined with a heuristic decision-making method, allows to determine the most suitable electrical battery capacity to be installed in a Low Exergy (LowEx) multi-family house located in the temperate climate zone of Middle Europe. In contrast to most common battery models, this optimization is not formulated in terms of the battery payback period. This model does not explicitly consider the battery cost, but aims instead at a twofold objective, namely to minimize the normalized annual electricity cost and simultaneously peak-shave the 15-minute average electrical power. The sensitivity of the model to uncertainties is accounted for by introducing stochastic elements in several model components. The natural variability in the solar electricity production is modeled by using a historical 12-year-data period, and the estimated electricity consumption by occupants is formulated as a probability distribution. Multiple scenarios are hypothesized in order to evaluate the model performance under different conditions. This model assumes a market-based dynamic electricity-pricing scheme. The effect of the dynamic electricity prices is examined by evaluating the model's behavior when subjected to spot market prices from three different geographically close locations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Battery; Energy storage; Low exergy buildings; Optimization","Battery management systems; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Energy storage; Exergy; Heuristic methods; Investments; Optimization; Probability distributions; Optimization; Battery; Decision-making method; Electricity prices; Electricity-consumption; Low exergies; Natural variability; Stochastic elements; Stochastic optimization model; Stochastic models; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903600929

Currently LHC physics analysis is done using data stored in centrally produced ""ROOT-ntuple"" files that are distributed through the LHC computing grid. The SQL-based approach to LHC physics analysis presented in this paper allows calculations in the analysis to be done at the database and can make use of the database's in-built parallelism features. Using this approach it was possible to reproduce results for several physics analysis benchmarks. The study shows the capability of the database to handle complex analysis tasks but also illustrates the limits of using row-based storage for storing physics analysis data, as performance was limited by the I/O read speed of the system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Digital storage; Query languages; Complex analysis; Large Hadron collider LHC; LHC computing grids; Physics analysis; Read speed; Relational Database; SQL query; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903554759

One of the more popular renewable energy sources is wind power (WP). Beside of all the advantages and the fact that the wind farms (WFs) can connect to the grid, they have unstable production and the energy cannot be stored when the grid does not need power. The main concern of the increase number of WFs in Iran is the uncertainty of WP. Pumped storage hydropower (PSH) is a solution which helps WF operation to become more stable and reliable. Consequently, the ways of connections between grid, WP and PSH are important for this system. In this paper, an attempt is made to solve this problem by manipulating all available hybrid and individual connections between current grid, WF and PSH. This hybrid connection can help the grid to generate more reliable power. In addition, the amount of WP is shown to increase realistically. All possible connection types and their impacts were investigated. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Energy saving; Grid; Hybrid system; Peak demand; Pumped storage hydropower; Renewable energy; Wind power","Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Hydroelectric power; Wind power; Grid; Hybrid connection; Peak demand; Pumped Storage; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Unstable production; Wind farm; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903528492

The addition of 9% nickel to the steel followed by appropriate heat treatment yields a combination of high strength and excellent fracture toughness at cryogenic temperatures. Consequently, these steels have become the main materials of construction of welded tanks and vessels for the storage and transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Welding, the main fabrication process for the construction of tanks and vessels, assumes an especially important role in the use of 9%Ni steels. Recent increase in the demand of LNG as a clean source of energy makes the 9% nickel steels even more important in the construction of welded cryogenic tanks and vessels. Demands for improved mechanical properties, better reliability, optimum usage of steel and lower cost are the main driving forces for new developments in this area.

Limited data exist on cardiac adiposity in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The aim of the study was to examine the components of cardiac steatosis and their relationship to LV structure and function in non-diabetic DCM patients. Methods: Myocardial and hepatic triglyceride (TG) contents were measured with 1.5 T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and LV function, visceral adipose (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous tissue (SAT), epicardial and pericardial fat by MRI in 10 non-diabetic men with DCM and in 20 controls. Results: In face of comparable intra-abdominal fat depots, myocardial TG [0.41% (0.21-2.19) vs 0.86% (0.31-2.24), p=0.038] was markedly lower and epicardial (895 mm 2±110 vs 664 mm2±180, p=0.002) and pericardial fat [2173 mm2 (616-3673) vs 1168 mm2 (266-2319), p=0.039] depots were larger in patients with DCM compared with controls. In subjects with DCM, the LV global function index was decreased to a greater extent than the LV EF [21%±6 vs 34% (16-40)]. Conclusions Myocardial TG content decreased and epicardial and pericardial fat depots increased in non-diabetic subjects with DCM. Although recognised as a site of ectopic fat accumulation, the derangement of myocardial TG seems to play a specific role in the myocardial energy metabolism in congestive heart failure.",,"cholesterol; fatty acid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; abdominal subcutaneous fat; adipose tissue; adult; article; cardiac steatosis; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; congestive cardiomyopathy; controlled study; energy metabolism; female; heart disease; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle function; heart muscle metabolism; human; intraabdominal fat; lipid storage; male; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; obesity; pericardial fat; priority journal; steatosis; tissue level; CARDIAC FUNCTION; LIPIDS; Adipose Tissue; Biological Markers; Body Mass Index; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Obesity; Pericardium; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Triglycerides; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903487269

Furthermore, the generated monitoring flow is constantly increasing, which represents another challenge for the monitoring systems. While existing solutions are traditionally based on Oracle for data storage and processing, recent developments evaluate NoSQL for processing large-scale monitoring datasets.

Construction of the data federations and understanding the impact of the new approach to data management on user analysis requires complete and detailed monitoring. Monitoring functionality should cover the status of all components of the federated storage, measuring data traffic and data access performance, as well as being able to detect any kind of inefficiencies and to provide hints for resource optimization and effective data distribution policy. Data mining of the collected monitoring data provides a deep insight into new usage patterns. In the WLCG context, there are several federations currently based on the XRootD technology. This paper will focus on monitoring for the ATLAS and CMS XRootD federations implemented in the Experiment Dashboard monitoring framework. Both federations consist of many dozens of sites accessed by many hundreds of clients and they continue to grow in size. Handling of the monitoring flow generated by these systems has to be well optimized in order to achieve the required performance. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the XRootD monitoring architecture is sufficiently generic to be easily adapted for other technologies, such as HTTP/WebDAV dynamic federations.",,"Data mining; High energy physics; Information management; Monitoring; Computing model; Data distribution policies; Data federation; Hierarchical data; LHC experiments; Monitoring architecture; Monitoring frameworks; Resource optimization; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903450046

ADC development has always been driven by operations and this contributed to its success. The system has fulfilled the demanding requirements of ATLAS, daily consolidating worldwide up to 1 PB of data and running more than 1.5 million payloads distributed globally, supporting almost one thousand concurrent distributed analysis users. Comprehensive automation and monitoring minimized the operational manpower required. The flexibility of the system to adjust to operational needs has been important to the success of the ATLAS physics program. The LHC shutdown in 2013-2015 affords an opportunity to improve the system in light of operational experience and scale it to cope with the demanding requirements of 2015 and beyond, most notably a much higher trigger rate and event pileup. We will describe the evolution of the ADC software foreseen during this period. This includes consolidating the existing Production and Distributed Analysis framework (PanDA) and ATLAS Grid Information System (AGIS), together with the development and commissioning of next generation systems for distributed data management (DDM/Rucio) and production (Prodsys-2). We will explain how new technologies such as Cloud Computing and NoSQL databases, which ATLAS investigated as R&D projects in past years, will be integrated in production.

User communities therefore generally develop their own application-layer software catering to their specific communities' needs on top of the Grid middleware. It is thus important for the Grid middleware to provide a friendly, well documented and simple to use interface for the applications to build upon. The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC), developed by NorduGrid, provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) which enables applications to use the middleware for job and data management. This paper presents the architecture and functionality of the ARC SDK along with an example graphical application developed with the SDK. The SDK consists of a set of libraries accessible through Application Programming Interfaces (API) in several languages. It contains extensive documentation and example code and is available on multiple platforms. The libraries provide generic interfaces and rely on plugins to support a given technology or protocol and this modular design makes it easy to add a new plugin if the application requires supporting additional technologies.The ARC Graphical Clients package is a graphical user interface built on top of the ARC SDK and the Qt toolkit and it is presented here as a fully functional example of an application.

The evolution of the DPM/LFC software stacks towards a modern framework that can be plugged into Apache servers triggered various initiatives that successfully demonstrated the use of HTTP-based protocols for data access, federation and transfer. This includes the evolution of the FTS3 system towards being able to manage third-party transfers using HTTP. Given the flexibility of the methods, the feature set may also include a subset of the SRM functionality that is relevant to disk systems. The application domain for such an ecosystem of services goes from large scale, Gridlike computing to the data access from laptops, profiting from tools that are shared with the Web community, like browsers, clients libraries and others. Particular focus was put into emphasizing the flexibility of the frameworks, which can interface with a very broad range of components, data stores, catalogues and metadata stores, including the possibility of building high performance dynamic federations of endpoints that build on the fly the feeling of a unique, seamless very efficient system. The overall goal is to leverage standards and standard practices, and use them to provide the higher level functionalities that are needed to fulfil the complex problem of Data Access in HEP. Other points of interest are about harmonizing the possibilities given by the HTTP/WebDAV protocols with existing frameworks like ROOT and already existing Storage Federations based on the XROOTD framework. We also provide quantitative evaluations of the performance that is achievable using HTTP for remote transfer and remote I/O in the context of HEP data. The idea is to contribute the parts that can make possible an ecosystem of services and applications, where the HEP-related features are covered, and the door is open to standard solutions and tools provided by third parties, in the context of the Web and Cloud technologies.",,"Digital storage; Ecology; Ecosystems; High energy physics; Hypertext systems; Information management; Web crawler; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Cloud technologies; Grid-like computing; Performance dynamics; Points of interest; Quantitative evaluation; Services and applications; Standard practices; Standard solutions; HTTP",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903434133

The packages comprising the VM operating system are carefully selected, hard disk images are built for a variety of different hypervisors, and images have to be distributed and decompressed in order to instantiate a virtual machine. Within the HEP community, the CernVM File System (CernVM-FS) has been established in order to decouple the distribution from the experiment software from the building and distribution of the VM hard disk images. We show how to get rid of such pre-built hard disk images altogether. Due to the high requirements on POSIX compliance imposed by HEP application software, CernVM-FS can also be used to host and boot a Linux operating system. This allows the use of a tiny bootable CD image that comprises only a Linux kernel while the rest of the operating system is provided on demand by CernVM-FS. This approach speeds up the initial instantiation time and reduces virtual machine image sizes by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, security updates can be distributed instantaneously through CernVM-FS. By leveraging the fact that CernVM-FS is a versioning file system, a historic analysis environment can be easily re-spawned by selecting the corresponding CernVM-FS file system snapshot.",,"Application programs; Computer operating systems; File organization; Hard disk storage; High energy physics; Linux; Network security; Java programming language; Bootable CD; Deployment process; Disk images; File system snapshots; File systems; Hypervisors; Linux kernel; LINUX- operating system; Application softwares; Virtual machines; Virtual machine; File organization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903433598

The types of polymers produced depend on the available carbon sources, the flexibility of the organism's intermediary metabolism, and the substrate specificity of the PHA biosynthetic enzymes. The recombinant Escherichia coli harboring phaC gene obtained from Cupriavidus necator H16 was constructed and conducted in this work. The overexpressed proteins in the cell broth were directly recovered in the aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). The optimized concentration of ATPS for separation of PHA synthase from unclarified feedstock was found to compose polyethylene glycol 6000 (30%, w/w) and potassium phosphate (8%, w/w) in the absence of NaCl at pH 8.7 and 4°C. The results indicated that the partition coefficient of activity and protein content are 8.30 and 0.23, respectively. The specific activity, selectivity, purification factor and recovery of phaCRe can achieve 1.82Umg-1, 35.30, 16.62 and 96.42%, respectively. The increment of concentration of loading biomass and temperature demonstrated a decreasing trend in terms of selectivity and purification factor.

Energy storage system (ESS) is a vital part of an MG. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for the optimal allocation and economic analysis of ESS in MGs on the basis of net present value (NPV). As the optimal operation of an MG strongly depends on the arrangement and allocation of its ESS, economic operation strategies and optimal allocation methods of the ESS devices are required for the MG. Self-adaptive Bee Swarm Optimization (SBSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the operation strategies and capacities of ESS in MGs in order to find maximal NPV, the generation schedule of ESS and distributed generation sources.

The importance of dietary fat composition for ectopic fat storage in humans is unknown. We investigated liver fat accumulation and body composition during overfeeding saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). LIPOGAIN was a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial. Thirty-nine young and normal-weight individuals were overfed muffins high in SFAs (palm oil) or n-6 PUFAs (sunflower oil) for 7 weeks. Liver fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), total adipose tissue, pancreatic fat, and lean tissue were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Transcriptomics were performed in SAT. Both groups gained similar weight. SFAs, however, markedly increased liver fat compared with PUFAs and caused a twofold larger increase in VAT than PUFAs. Conversely, PUFAs caused a nearly threefold larger increase in lean tissue than SFAs. Increase in liver fat directly correlated with changes in plasma SFAs and inversely with PUFAs. Genes involved in regulating energy dissipation, insulin resistance, body composition, and fat-cell differentiation in SAT were differentially regulated between diets, and associated with increased PUFAs in SAT. In conclusion, overeating SFAs promotes hepatic and visceral fat storage, whereas excess energy from PUFAs may instead promote lean tissue in healthy humans. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"adiponectin; glucose; insulin; palm oil; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; sunflower oil; abdominal subcutaneous fat; adipose tissue; adult; article; body composition; cell differentiation; clinical article; controlled study; dietary intake; double blind procedure; energy; female; human; insulin resistance; intraabdominal fat; lean body weight; lipid storage; liver; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nutritional assessment; overnutrition; parallel design; physical activity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; total adipose tissue; transcriptomics; Adult; Body Composition; Fatty Acids; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Female; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Overnutrition; Transcriptome; Viscera; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903207987

But the interface between a bulk metal and metal nanoparticles has been rarely explored. This paper reports significant temperature effect on the asymmetrical resistive switches of polymer:nanoparticle memory devices. The devices have architecture of a polystyrene layer admixed with gold nanoparticles capped with conjugated 2-naphthalenethiol sandwiched between Au and Al electrodes. The devices exhibit significant resistive switches at room temperature. However, the resistive switches become less significant at temperature below 200 K, and they are not noticeable at 103 K. The temperature effect suggests that the resistive switches are assisted by the thermal energy. The charge transport through the devices has different mechanisms at high and low temperatures. At temperature above 220 K, the Poole-Frenkel emission is an important mechanism for the charge transport. At temperature below 220 K, the temperature-independent Fowler-Nordheim tunneling becomes an important process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, hydrogen is attractive as a fuel because it prevents air pollution and greenhouse emissions. One of the main problems with the utilization of hydrogen as a fuel is its on-board storage. The purpouse of this work was to develop a new hybrid material consisting of a polyaniline matrix with sodium alanate (NaAlH4) using a spray-drying process. The polyaniline used for this experiment was synthesized by following a well-established method for the synthesis of the emeraldine base form of polyaniline using dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid as dopant. Micro particles of polyaniline/sodium alanate hybrids with 30 and 50 wt% of sodium alanate were prepared by using a spray-drying technique. Dilute solutions of polyaniline/sodium alanate were first prepared, 10g of the solid materials were mixed with 350 ml of toluene under stirring at room temperature for 24h and the solutions were dried using spray-dryer (Büchi, Switzerland) with 115°C of an inlet temperature. The hybrids were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, FT-IR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The addition of sodium alanate decreased the glass transition temperature of the hybrids when compared to neat polyaniline. FT-IR spectrum analysis was performed to identify the bonding environment of the synthesized material and was observed that simply physically mixture occurred between polyaniline and sodium alanate. The SEM images of the hybrids showed the formation of microspheres with sodium alanate dispersed in the polymer matrix. © 2014 American Institute of Physics.","microsphere; polyaniline; Spray-drying","Differential scanning calorimetry; Fuel storage; Hybrid materials; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Microspheres; Polyaniline; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium compounds; Spectrum analysis; Bonding environment; Dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid; Greenhouse emissions; Inlet temperature; Micro particles; Room temperature; Spray drying process; Synthesized materials; Drying",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903192903

The goal is to balance the local heat demand and supply in combination with balancing the power supply and demand in the network. The on-off decisions of the local generators are done completely distributed based on local information and information exchange with a few neighbors in the network. This is achieved by using an information sharing model with a distributed model predictive control method based on dual-decomposition and sub-gradient iterations. Because of the binary nature of the decisions, a mixed integer quadratic problem is solved at each agent. The approach is tested with simulation, using realistic heat and power demand patterns. We conclude that the distributed control approach is suitable for embedding the distributed generation at a household level. © 2014 IEEE.","Distributed generation; distributed model predictive control; smart energy management","Distributed power generation; Economics; Heat storage; Power generation; Predictive control systems; Distributed control; Distributed Model predictive Control; Distributed MPC; Information exchanges; Information-sharing model; Local information; Micro-combined heat and power; Mixed integer quadratic problems; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903191418

However, frequent data-writing operations result in increased energy consumption. In this context, a promising memory technology, Non-volatile SRAM (nvSRAM), enables normal and standby operation modes which can be used to store various types of data. However, nvSRAM suffers from high dynamic energy usage due to frequent switching between operation modes. In this paper, we propose a redundant store elimination (RSE) scheme which, on average, discards 94% of needless bitwrite operations. Moreover, we present a retention-Aware cache management policy to reduce data updates of cache blocks, based on the correlation between data lifetime and cache types.

With the increase of processing cores count, larger on-chip memories are required. Due to its high density and low power characteristics, STT-RAM technology can be utilized in GPUs where numerous cores leave a limited area for on-chip memory banks. They have however two important issues, high energy and latency of write operations, that have to be addressed. Low data retention time STT-RAMs can reduce the energy and delay of write operations. However, employing STT-RAMs with low retention time in GPUs requires a thorough investigation on the behavior of GPGPU applications based on which the STT-RAM based L2 cache is architectured. The STT-RAM L2 cache architecture proposed in this paper, can improve IPC by more than 100% (16% on average) while reducing the average consumed power by 20% compared to a conventional L2 cache architecture with equal on-chip area.

The proposed methodology investigates the potential role of EVs and DR in providing reserve capacity for a MG with a high contribution from variable generation such as wind and solar power. The novelty of this paper is the demand side participation in energy and reserve scheduling, simultaneously.

To support the functionality to access the historical data, a multiversion index is adopted to maintain multiple versions of data items and their index information. However, CPSes are usually batterypowered embedded systems that have limited energy, computing power, and storage space. In this work, we consider the systems with phase-change memory (PCM) as their storage due to its nonvolatility and low energy consumption. In order to resolve the problem of the limited storage space and the fact that existing multiversion index designs are lack of space efficiency, we propose a spaceefficient multiversion index scheme to enhance the space utilization and access performance of embedded multiversion database systems on PCM by utilizing the byte-addressability and write asymmetry of PCM.

Two-dimensional imaging and analytical techniques often cannot characterize nanostructures completely. A new three-dimensional (3D) tomography technique for STEM XEDS, namely ChemiSTEMTM Technology [1], reveals the true microstructure of materials offering high X-ray collection efficiency via its windowless detector design, and fast XEDS mapping with tilt response at all angles. ChemiSTEM features the X-FEG and Super X, containing four symmetric detectors for 3D chemical imaging at 0 degree tilt, with significant EDX signal collected under all tilt conditions. The EDS signal of STEM XEDS image tilt series can be processed like normal z-contrast images, because of the monotonic relationship between the EDS signal and the thickness of the TEM foil. Four symmetrically arranged silicon drift detectors (SDD) provide extreme high output count rates (300 kcps) required for acquisition of EDX maps of thick samples, especially on 3 mm disk samples for 3D tomography studies.

Cumulative emission reductions by CCS until 2100 vary in the majority of projections of the IPCC-TAR scenarios from 220 to 2200GtCO2. This variation is a result of uncertainty in key determinants of the baselines of different models, such as, technological development (IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage. Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York). Technological key parameters of CCS deployment are power plant efficiency and investment cost, capture cost, transport cost and storage capacity. This study provides insights in how uncertain the key parameters are and how this influences CCS deployment projections. For each parameter, ranges are determined on the basis of the existing literature. CCS deployment is systematically assessed for all of these parameter ranges in a global energy system model (TIMER). The results show that investment cost uncertainty causes the largest range in cumulative CO2 captured from global electricity production (13-176GtCO2 in 2050) in a scenario with a medium fossil fuel price level. The smallest, but still significant range of 65-91GtCO2 cumulatively captured until 2050, is caused by the uncertainty in the efficiency of the power plant and capture unit. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","CCS deployment uncertainty; Power plant performance; Sensitivity analysis","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Costs; Emission control; Power plants; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; CCS deployment uncertainty; Global energy system models; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Power plant performance; Storage capacity; Transport costs; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission control; fossil fuel; performance assessment; power plant; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902981719

Switching to renewable resources and CO2 capture and storage in power plants, are regarded as promising alternatives. Post-, oxy- and pre-combustion CO2 capture concepts are applicable for power plants using natural gas, coal or biomass as a feedstock. A systematic thermo-environomic optimisation strategy including thermodynamic, economic and environmental considerations is applied for the consistent modelling and optimisation of CO2 capture options. The environmental benefit and the energetic and economic costs of CO2 capture are assessed and optimised. The economic competitiveness appears to be strongly determined by the economic conditions such as the resource price and the carbon tax which are highly uncertain. A method that takes into account the economic parameter sensitivity to support decision-making based on the Pareto-optimal solutions is proposed here.

The catalytic reaction of particular interest generates hydrogen gas as secondary energy storage. For demonstration, indirect water electrolysis was performed generating hydrogen and oxygen in separate catalytic reactions. The electrolyte containing V(II) was chemically discharged through proton reduction to hydrogen on a molybdenum carbide catalyst, whereas the electrolyte comprising Ce(IV) was similarly discharged in the oxidation of water to oxygen on a ruthenium dioxide catalyst.

To evaluate the environmental benefit of capturing CO2 it is important to make a systematic comparison including the whole life cycle from the resource extraction to the final product (i.e. electricity). Especially when comparing natural gas, coal and biomass fed processes the supply chain differences have to be accounted for. Besides the benefit in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction, CCS induces an energy and cost penalty due to the CO2 separation and compression.

Bio-oil comprises a mixture of highly oxygenated compounds, carboxylic acids and trace water. Bio-oil can be used as a substitute for conventional fuels after it is upgraded. However, the oil can react through many chemical reactions such as polymerization and lead to an increase in viscosity of bio-oil during storage. Thus, this paper explores the stabilization of empty fruit bunch derived bio-oil. The objective of this project is to select the optimum condition, to study the accelerated aging of bio-oil and the effect of addictive in stabilizing the bio-oil. The bio-oil is produced from the catalytic pyrolysis of EFB. The optimum reaction condition applied is 5 wt% of H-Y catalyst at reaction temperature of 500 °C and nitrogen flow rate of 100 ml/min. At this optimum condition, it is able to obtain the maximum bio-oil yield. The method used in this research to improve the stability of the bio-oil is through addition of antioxidants. Four different types of antioxidants which are propyl gallate (PG), tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and calcium chloride salts (CaCl2) are added to the bio-oil separately in the amount of 1,000 ppm. All the test samples are subjected to accelerated aging involving exposure to high temperature of 80 oC for 7 d. The properties of samples which are chosen as the indicator of aging are viscosity, water content and acidity. The effectiveness of antioxidants increase in the following order: CaCl2, BHA, TBHQ and PG. The antioxidants used are able to improve the stability of bio-oil in terms of viscosity and water content during aging. All the antioxidants helped to reduce the acidity of bio-oil except for CaCl2. The results from Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that the chain reaction of polymerization stopped by phenolics and decrease in carbonyls and ethers can lead to decreased in water content during aging. In addition, molecule decomposing reactions also reduced and resulted in lower acidity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidants; Catalytic Pyrolysis; Empty Fruit Bunch; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS); Stabilization",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902964408

We have explored the most energetically favorable sites for single Pt atom adsorption on the graphene surface. The interaction of H 2 with the energetically favorable Pt-graphene system was then investigated. We found that H2 physisorbs on pristine graphene with a binding energy of -0.05 eV, while the binding energy is enhanced to -1.98 eV when H2 binds Pt-adsorbed graphene. We also found that up to four H2 molecules can be adsorbed on the Pt-graphene system with a -0.74 eV/H2 binding energy. The effect of graphene layer stretching on the Pt-graphene capacity/ability for hydrogen adsorption was evaluated. Our results show that the number of H2 molecules adsorbed on the Pt-graphene surface rises to six molecules with a binding energy of approximately -0.29 eV/H2. Our first-principles results reveal that the Young's modulus was slightly decreased for Pt adsorption on the graphene layer. The first-principles calculated Young's modulus for the H2-adsorbed Pt-graphene system demonstrates that hydrogen adsorption can dramatically increase the Young's modulus of such systems. As a result, hydrogen adsorption on the Pt-graphene system might enhance the substrate strength. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Ab initio calculations; Adsorption; Graphene; Hydrogen; Mechanical properties; Platinum","graphene; hydrogen; platinum; ab initio calculation; adsorption; article; density functional theory; energy; kinetics; molecule; priority journal; renewable energy; temperature; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902833870

During the conversion process pathogen levels are reduced and plant nutrients made more readily available, so better crops can be grown while existing resources are conserved. Since small scale units can be relatively simple to build and operate biogas should be used directly if possible for cooking, heating, lighting and absorption refrigeration, since both electricity generation and compression of gas for storage or use in vehicles use large amounts of energy for a small output of useful energy. This concept is suited to distributed systems where waste is treated near the source, and sludge is also reused locally, to minimise transport and initial capital cost compared to a centralised system. As the distributed system will need a support network biogas contributes to the triple bottom line, benefiting the environment, reducing costs and contributing to the social structure.

USM with the collaboration Enerbon Sdn Bhd setup up this mini biogas power plant as an education and research and development to professionals and researchers and at the same time give opportunity to the people who are interest with this system to see and experience their self by looking how this mini biogas power plant works. The objectives of this paper are two-fold; firstly to determine whether food wastes (canteen and cafeterias wastes) can produce methane gas (biogas) that can generate heat and electricity and secondly to establish how much methane gas (biogas) can be produced with the certain amount of the feedstock. It should be pointed out that this MBPP can generate 600kW electricity per day as this system can generate electricity about 25kW/h. The methane produced per day is approximately 180 cubic metres. The higher the wastes, the higher the amount of methane gas produced. The cow dung is used to increase the bacteria in the tank; the methane gas production will be higher if the bacteria breed.","Biogas plant; Cow dung; Electricity; Energy; Feedstock; Food waste; Methane gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902578285

It is influenced by heredity, physical activity, food intake (especially related to calcium, vitamin D and energy), and serum vitamin D sufficiency. Adequate amounts of growth hormone and sex steroids are also necessary to guarantee skeletal health. Adolescence is the period of fastest bone accretion, which persists until peak bone mass is achieved. Any disturbance in these physiological events, such as pubertal age and menstrual cycle in females, may limit bone gain or even cause bone loss. Because of this complexity, bone diseases are growing worldwide, including among athletes. It seems that extreme exercises may be detrimental to bone health and performance, especially in the young.

To quantitatively investigate the energy consumption of CO2 separation from different CO2 streams and analyze the effect of temperature, pressure and composition on energy consumption, in this work, the theoretical energy consumption of CO2 separation from flue gas, lime kiln gas, biogas and bio-syngas was calculated. The results show that the energy consumption of CO2 separation from flue gas is the highest and that from biogas is the lowest, and the concentration of CO2 is the most important factor affecting the energy consumption when the CO2 concentration is lower than 0.15 in mole fraction. Furthermore, if the CO2 captured from flue gases in CCS was replaced with that from biogases, i.e. bio-CO2, the energy saving would be equivalent to 7.31 million ton standard coal for China and 28.13 million ton standard coal globally, which corresponds to 0.30 billion US$ that can be saved for China and 1.36 billion US$ saved globally.

Experiments were conducted at five levels of hot air velocity (0.8, 1.35, 2.08, 3.35 and 4.43m/s) and five temperature levels (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80C). The obtained effective moisture diffusivity of terebinth ranged between 1.1×10-10 and 1.26×10-9m2/s and the calculated activation energy of the samples was 49.99-51.22kJ/mol. Results showed that the Logestic model with R2=0.9994, χ2=0.00177 and RMSE=0.0318 had the best performance in moisture prediction. Maximum shrinkage during drying was calculated to be 72.2% at air temperature of 80C and air velocity of 4.43m/s. Maximum rupture force and energy for dried terebinth were calculated to be 135.6N and 2,509.6N·mm, respectively. Most color (ΔRGB) changes were obtained at air temperature of 80C and air velocity of 4.43m/s. Practical Applications: Advantages of fluid bed drying include short processing time, high mass transfer coefficients, low energy consumption and high quality. As heat and mass transfer and quality changes during drying of terebinth with fluid bed method are not described in the literature, it is of importance to gather such data and compare them to find the optimum point of the process. The data clearly proved that in addition to short processing time, the terebinth temperature and moisture content can easily be controlled, and thus, monitoring of terebinth characteristics such as shrinkage, color and mechanical properties, and energy utilization during drying process can be achieved. The models developed for thermal, physical and mechanical characteristics of terebinth fruit can be used to predict more accurately the drying process using a computer and to simulate the storage of terebinth fruit. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Activation energy; Atmospheric temperature; Color; Data processing; Digital storage; Drying; Energy utilization; Fruits; Mass transfer; Mechanical properties; Models; Shrinkage; Drying condition; Effective moisture diffusivity; Heat and mass transfer; Low energy consumption; Mechanical characteristics; Physical parameters; Short processing time; Temperature level; Air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902386072

To balance power for district renewable energy supply, substantial energy can be stored into the floor without violating comfort limits. Heat loss to the outside due to floor heating storage is small in case of low energy houses and can be financially compensated.

Estimation of the intensities of each wavelength for the solar irradiance on the earth surface provides a better way to understand and predict the radiance energy. It requires that the atmospheric and geometric input and the availability of atmospheric parameter is always the main concern in estimating solar irradiance. In this study, a local static atmospheric model for Peninsular Malaysia was built to provide the atmospheric parameters in the estimation of solar irradiance. Ten years of monthly Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) average data (water vapor, temperature, humidity and pressure profile) of the Peninsular Malaysia was used for the building of the atmospheric model and the atmospheric model were assessed based on the measured meteorological data with RMSE of 4.7% and 0.7k for both humidity and temperature respectively. The atmospheric model were applied on a well-established radiative transfer model namely SMARTS2. Some modifications are required in order to include the atmospheric model into the radiative transfer model. The solar irradiance results were then assessed with measured irradiance data and the results show that both the radiative transfer model and atmospheric model were reliable with RMSE value of 0.5 Wm-2. The atmospheric model was further validated based on the measured meteorological data (temperature and humidity) provided by the Department of Meteorology, Malaysia and high coefficient of determination with R2 value of 0.99 (RMSE value 4.7%) and 0.90 (RMSE value 0.7k) were found for both temperature and humidity respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Digital storage; Infrared devices; Infrared instruments; Meteorology; Radiative transfer; Solar radiation; Atmospheric infrared sounders; Atmospheric model; Atmospheric parameters; Coefficient of determination; Humidity and temperatures; Meteorological data; Radiative transfer model; Temperature and humidities; Atmospheric humidity; atmospheric modeling; data set; humidity; meteorology; radiative transfer; solar radiation; temperature effect; wavelength; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902350016

In order to enhance power system flexibility and to reduce the amounts required of reserve capacity two key issues have to be tackled: First, financial incentives for DSP to participate in Ancillary Service markets. Second, incentives for intermittent sources and demand to adhere to their forecasted in-feed schedule. Therefore, we consider the public good aspect of reliable electricity supply and treat deviations from the schedule in in-feed or consumption as negative externalities in electricity market operation. Our contributions are twofold: First, we present a novel methodology which incorporates the individual evaluation of reserves via a suitable cost allocation framework and therefore enhances DSP to ensure operational security. Second, we provide a framework to establish market-based adaptive in-feed premiums for renewable energy sources and to assess investments in DSP and distributed storage in order to reduce the amount of reserve capacity procured by the System Operator.

Although increasing the total investment, thermal energy storage can therefore enhance profitability of the solar power plant. The present study presents optimum power plant configurations for a given location considering different price-based grid integration strategies. Such optimum plant configurations were determined using a thermo-economic optimization approach to compare the profitability of generating electricity assuming an instant-dispatch strategy with respect to a selective operating strategy where electricity is produced only during peak price hours of the day. For each of these price-operating strategies, optimum plant configurations were found by varying two solar-related design parameters, namely the solar multiple and the storage size, whilst simultaneously evaluating the economic performance of each design. Results show that for the case of smaller storage units and solar field size a peaking approach will yield more revenues at the end of the project, thus highlighting the importance of the availability of reliable predictable demand and meteorological data for the plant operators. Moreover, results confirm that for the location considered, the best plant configurations encompass large storage units and solar field sizes, for which the gain of a peaking operation strategy becomes negligible since the plants start behaving similar to a baseload power generation station. Finally, it is performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to the available price data and the influence of renewable electricity incentives, particularly the investment tax credit treasury cash grant, showing the positive impact that such measurements could have in augmenting the economic viability of concentrating solar power and thus serve as a driving force for technology deployment. © 2013 The Authors.","Concentrating solar power; CSP; Operating strategy; Peak power production; TES; Thermal energy storage","Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Heat storage; Investments; Meteorology; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Taxation; Tellurium; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric power plants; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Concentrating solar thermal power; Operating strategy; Peak power; Renewable electricity incentives; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermoeconomic optimization; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902253168

However, most OR-PAM systems are realized by using a bulky laser for photoacoustic excitation. The large volume and high price of the laser may restrain the popularity of OR-PAM. In this study, we attempt to develop a compact, portable, and low cost OR-PAM based on a consumer Blu-ray (405 nm) DVD pickup head for label-free micro-vascular imaging and red-blood-cell related blood examination. According to the high optical absorption of the hemoglobin at 405 nm, the proposed OR-PAM has potential to be an alternative for the conventional optical microscopy in the examinations of hematological morphology for blood routine. We showed that the Blu-ray DVD pickup head owns the required laser energy and focusing optics for OR-PAM. The firmware of a Blu-ray DVD drive was modified to allow its pickup head to generate nano-second laser pulses with a tunable pulse repetition rate of >30 kHz and a tunable pulse width ranging from 10 to 30 ns. The laser beam was focused onto the target after passing through a transparent cover slide, and then aligned to be confocal with a 50-MHz focused ultrasonic transducer in forward mode. To keep the target on focus, a scan involving auto-tracking procedure was performed. The measured maximum achievable lateral resolution was 1 μm which was mainly limited by the minimum step size of the used motorized stage. A blood smear was imaged without any staining. The red blood cells were well resolved and the biconcave structure could be clearly visualized. In addition, to verify the in vivo imaging capability of the proposed OR-PAM, the micro-vasculature of a mouse ear was imaged without any contrast agent. The results showed that it performed better than a 200x digital optical microscope in terms of image contrast and vascular morphology. In summaries, the proposed OR-PAM has been demonstrated as a promising tool for label-free blood imaging in both small animal studies and blood examinations, and potentially can be a compact and low-cost OR-PAM platform. © 2014 SPIE.","Blood smear; Blu-ray DVD pickup head; Label-free microvascular imaging; Optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy","Blood vessels; Data storage equipment; Firmware; Light; Morphology; Optical microscopy; Photoacoustic microscopy; Photons; Pickups; Target tracking; Ultrasonic transducers; Videodisks; Blood smears; DVD pick-up head; Lateral resolution; Microvascular; Optical resolution; Photoacoustic excitation; Small animal study; Tunable pulse widths; Blood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902089903

This paper adds four original contributions to the related literature. First, the three ESSs are compared in a framework of simultaneous optimal ESS sizing and energy management, where the ESSs can serve the powertrain in the most cost-effective manner. Second, convex optimization is used to implement the framework, which allows the hybrid powertrain designers/integrators to rapidly and optimally perform integrated ESS selection, sizing, and power management. Third, both hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and plug-in HEV (PHEV) scenarios for the powertrain are considered, in order to systematically examine how different the ESS requirements are for HEV and PHEV applications.

One of the DER is wind power generation which is a valuable supplement for the conventional energy sources. The integration of intermittent wind generation in power system requires the inclusion of more inventive and sophisticated methods for the planning of power system operation. At a high penetration level, additional reserve capacity intervention is necessary to cover the shortage in generation when a sudden variation of wind occurs. One of the strategies that can be offered to solve this problem is the use of electrical energy storage. A new technology of electric energy storage is Natrium sulfur (NaS) battery system. Lately, this technology is intensely considered because of its sufficient technological maturity and less environmental impact. This work focuses on the economic operation of generation company (Genco) consisting of wind power plant (WPP) and NaS battery plant (NaSP) in a competitive electricity market and the WPP intermittent coverage.

However, the resource hungry pairing-based cryptographic operations, such as encryption and decryption, are executed using the limited computational power of mobile device. Similarly, if the data owner wants to modify the encrypted file uploaded on the cloud storage, after modification the data owner must encrypt and upload the entire file on the cloud storage without considering the altered portion(s) of the file. In this paper, we have proposed an incremental version of proxy re-encryption scheme for improving the file modification operation and compared with the original version of the proxy re-encryption scheme on the basis of turnaround time, energy consumption, CPU utilization, and memory consumption while executing the security operations on mobile device. The incremental version of proxy re-encryption scheme shows significant improvement in results while performing file modification operations using limited processing capability of mobile devices. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Mobile cloud computing; Privacy; Security","Cloud computing; Computer systems; Data privacy; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile devices; Turnaround time; Computational capability; Cryptographic operations; Encryption and decryption; Processing capability; Proxy re encryptions; Proxy re-encryption schemes; Research organization; Security; Cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901987724

Methods to produce a greener, cost effective and reliable source of alternative energy needs to be explored and exploited. One of those methods is done by integrating (or hybridizing) multiple different alternative energy sources (e.g. wind turbine generators, photovoltaic cell panels and fuel-fired generators, equipped with storage batteries) to form a distributed generation (DG) power system. However, even with DG power systems, cost effectiveness, reliability and pollutant emissions are still major issues that need to be resolved. The model development and optimization of the DG power system was carried out successfully in the previous work using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The goal was to minimize cost, maximize reliability and minimize emissions (multi-objective) subject to the requirements of the power balance and design constraints. In this work, due to the uncertain nature on the weather conditions, the power output from the PV cells, WTG and the storage batteries which are subject to insolation and wind conditions were fuzzified in an effort to create a more realistic model. The optimization (in a fuzzy environment) was then performed by using Hopfield neural network (HNN). The optimized results were then discussed and analyzed. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.","Alternative energy; distributed generation (DG); fuzzy environment; Hopfield neural networks (HNN); optimization strategy","Cost effectiveness; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Alternative energy; Alternative energy source; Design optimization; Fuzzy environments; Hopfield neural networks (HNN); Hybrid power systems; Optimization strategy; Renewable energy source; Hopfield neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901813145

We propose a DBMS ApproxiDB with its design, implementation and optimization aware of the underlying approximate hardware. ApproxiDB will run on a hybrid machine consisting of both approximate hardware and precise hardware (i.e., the conventional hardware without sacrificing the accuracy). With approximate hardware, ApproxiDB can efficiently support the concept of approximate query processing, without the overhead of pre-computed synopses or sampling techniques. More importantly, ApproxiDB is also beneficial to precise query processing, by developing non-trivial hybrid execution mechanisms on both precise and approximate hardware. In this vision paper, we sketch the initial design of ApproxiDB, discuss the technical challenges in building this system and outline an agenda for future research. © 2014 VLDB Endowment.",,"Computer architecture; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Query processing; Approximate query processing; Architecture community; Data management system; Hardware components; Implementation and optimization; Research interests; Sampling technique; Technical challenges; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901793632

For comparative purposes, a group was included, which received a normal fat diet (NFD). Male Swiss mice (6-week old) were used. After 14days under the dietary conditions, the mice were fasted for 18h, and experiments were then performed. The HFD-SO, HFD-LO and HFD-MO groups showed higher glycaemia (p<0.05 versus NFD).

However, a reliability concern is raised due to void formation at the bonding interface of Copper wire- Aluminum bond pad (Cu-Al) after High Temperature Storage (HTS) annealing condition. It is believed that the Intermetallic Compound (IMC) layer growth and evolution lead to a volumetric shrinkage which in turn results in the void formation. Annealing conditions influence the development of the IMC at the bonding interface which is related to the bonding reliability. In this work, the effects of annealing toward the micro-structure and IMC growth at the bonding interface were evaluated using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis. In the as-synthesized sample bonded at 100°C, an inhomogeneous IMC formation dominated by grain boundary diffusion was observed. After High Temperature Storage of 1000 hours, the consumption of the Al bond pad resulted in the formation of irregular IMC layers. The variation of phases existed in a localized region was believed due to simultaneous growth of IMC by both grain boundary and volume diffusions. Moreover, the diffusion of Cu into Si was observed.

Eluvaitivu Island is an example in the remote area that is not connected to the mainland. Thus, there is a need for the independent power generation system to supply the load demand in the island. This paper assesses the potential of implementing the Hybrid Diesel/PV/Wind/Battery in Eluvaitivu Island using HOMER simulation software. In this regard, five different system configurations of Hybrid Diesel/PV/Wind with and without energy storage devices have been tested. HOMER simulation software is used to perform the feasibility study and to determine the optimized configuration of the Hybrid system. This leads to optimal configuration which has the lowest Cost of Energy (COE), producing the lowest excess of electricity and releases the smallest amount of carbon dioxides (CO2). The criteria of analysis include the total Net Present Cost (NPC), the COE, the excess of electricity and the CO2 emissions. The sensitivity analyses for the change of PV and diesel prices were also included in this paper. In the presence of global energy scenario, the price of the diesel fuels is expected to increase every year while the cost of the Solar PV is expected to decrease driven by the incentives provided by the government. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cost of energy; Hybrid system; Optimization; Solar PV",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901672113

The mechanisms that direct water vapor adsorption by the theoretical study of enthalpy-entropy compensation were also evaluated. The product reached the equilibrium phases from 144 h of storage and the temperature increase from 15 °C to 45 °C reduced the adsorptive capacity. The Gibbs free energy was negative under all conditions, indicating that the adsorption phenomenon is a spontaneous process. The minimum values for the net integral entropy were indicative of maximum product stability conditions, corresponding to water activities of 0.358-0.119 for the temperature range of 15-45 °C. Isokinetic compensation was confirmed for the adsorption phenomenon and the approach resulted in two zones.

By adding a small-powered solar panel to charge two batteries when idle or low power periods, an extended-range hybrid powered bicycle allows its driving distance to be increased further.

Given the fact that the power and speed associated with the cell access time are directly related to the sense amplifier offset a new optimization platform based on the hybrid offset-cancelled current sense amplifier (OCCSA) [1] is presented. It is shown that the speed and power overhead of the offset cancellation can be optimized in a multi-variable auto-calibration loop to achieve the lowest power or the highest performance mode. The flexibility of having two degrees of freedom in OCCSA offers a significant bitline delay reduction with minimum power sacrifice in the high performance mode. The proposed scheme is verified using a macro cell implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology. In the Power Optimized mode, a wide range of offset is applied to a single column test structure and 25% energy consumption reduction is measured compared to the conventional case. For a 32 kb SRAM array, compared to a conventional sense amplification, a 2X reduction in energy consumption is achieved in the Energy Optimized mode. Thanks to the offset cancelling nature of the proposed scheme, a 2X improvement in cell access time is achieved in the Speed Optimized mode. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Current sense amplifier; Dual mode; Low power; Offset cancellation; SRAM","Calibration; CMOS integrated circuits; Energy utilization; Static random access storage; Consumption reductions; Conventional sense; Current sense amplifiers; Dual modes; Low Power; Offset cancellation; Reduction in energy consumption; Two degrees of freedom; Amplifiers (electronic)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901597078

Having a cell area only 1/9 to 1/3 that of SRAM, allows for a much larger cache with the same die footprint. Such reduction of cell size can significantly shrink the cache array size, leading to significant improvement of overall system performance and power consumption, especially in this multicore era where locality is crucial. However, deploying STT-RAM technology in L1 caches is challenging because write operations on STT-RAM are slow and power-consuming. In this paper, we propose a range of cache hierarchy designs implemented entirely using STT-RAM that deliver optimal power saving and performance. In particular, our designs use STT-RAM cells with various data retention times and write performances, made possible by novel magnetic tunneling junction designs. For L1 caches where speed is of utmost importance, we propose a scheme that uses fast STT-RAM cells with reduced data retention time coupled with a dynamic refresh scheme. In the dynamic refresh scheme, another emerging technology, memristor, is used as the counter to monitor the data retention of the low-retention STT-RAM, achieving a higher array area efficiency than an SRAM-based counter. For lower level caches with relatively larger cache capacities, we propose a design that has partitions of different retention characteristics, and a data migration scheme that moves data between these partitions. The experiments show that on the average, our proposed multiretention level STT-RAM cache reduces total energy by as much as 30%-74.2% compared to previous single retention level STT-RAM caches, while improving instruction per cycle performance for both two-level and three-level cache hierarchies. © 2013 IEEE.","Cache hierarchy; magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ); retention time; spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM); spintronic memristor; switching current.","Cells; Cytology; Design; Dynamic random access storage; Magnetic devices; Memristors; Passive filters; Static random access storage; Cache hierarchies; Magnetic tunnel junction; Memristor; Retention time; Spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM); Switching currents; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901588914

If adopted for heart transplantation, donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) would be expected to improve the availability of organs substantially for both adults and children. With DCDD, however, hearts to be transplanted undergo a period of warm ischaemia before procurement, which is of particular concern because tissue damage occurs rapidly and might be sufficient to preclude transplantation. Nonetheless, the heart is able to withstand limited periods of warm ischaemia, which could provide a window of opportunity for DCDD. Development of clinical approaches specifically for DCDD is critical for the exploitation of these organs, because current practices for donor heart procurement, evaluation, and storage have been optimized for conventional donation after brain death, without consideration of warm ischaemia before organ procurement. Establishment of clinical protocols and ethical and legal frameworks for DCDD of other organs is underway.

It is possible to mitigate the effect of the write uncertainty through the use of a feedback loop that rewrites the memory whenever judged necessary, in effect reshaping the write noise. This scheme highlights a tradeoff between the storage capacity of the memory and the cost of writing to it, measured for example in the number of rewrites. We have developed the model of a rewritable channel to provide an explicit form for this tradeoff and study other performance characteristics of such memories. In this paper, we describe some initial results on the information-theoretic analysis of the rewritable channel. We first consider the problem of determining the capacity of this channel with input cost constraints, and obtain a variety of results from which we extract insights that we believe are of value to memory designers. Our results include an upper bound on capacity of the form log (Γκ), where Γ is a constant that can be easily calculated from the channel's statistics and κ is an average cost parameter. We also provide a lower bound on capacity with a similar form. We analyze the particular case of uniform write noise in detail, obtaining a closed form expression for the capacity-cost tradeoff for all possible cost parameters. We explore this formula from the capacity per unit cost perspective and establish that in order to achieve optimal energy and memory-wear per bit, it is sometimes strictly better to take advantage of the rewriting capability as opposed to writing only once; this observation has significant practical implications. We also include a discussion of the relevance of our work to real emerging memory technologies. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","channel capacity; data storage systems; Memory; nonvolatile memory; phase change memory","Channel capacity; Communication channels (information theory); Data storage equipment; Phase change memory; Capacity per unit cost; Closed-form expression; Data storage systems; Emerging memory technologies; Information-theoretic analysis; Non-volatile memory; Performance characteristics; Storage technology; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901312896

Most of the islands throughout the world depend on fossil fuel importation with respect to energy production. Recent development and research on green energy sources can assure sustainable power supply for the islands. But unpredictable nature and high dependency on weather conditions are the main limitations of renewable energy sources. To overcome this drawback, different renewable sources and converters need to be integrated with each other. This paper proposes a standalone hybrid photovoltaic- (PV-) wave energy conversion system with energy storage. In the proposed hybrid system, control of the bidirectional buck-boost DC-DC converter (BBDC) is used to maintain the constant dc-link voltage. It also accumulates the excess hybrid power in the battery bank and supplies this power to the system load during the shortage of hybrid power. A three-phase complex vector control scheme voltage source inverter (VSI) is used to control the load side voltage in terms of the frequency and voltage amplitude. Based on the simulation results obtained from Matlab/Simulink, it has been found that the overall hybrid framework is capable of working under the variable weather and load conditions. © 2014 Nahidul Hoque Samrat et al.",,"algorithm; article; electric potential; energy conversion; energy resource; feasibility study; Malaysia; photovoltaic wave energy hybrid renewable power generation system; renewable energy; simulation; vector control; weather; electricity; power supply; theoretical model; Electric Power Supplies; Electricity; Malaysia; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901275536

The BES is connected to the PV system DC bus using a DC/DC buck-boost converter. The converter facilitates the BES power charge/discharge to compensate for the DC bus voltage deviation during severe disturbance conditions. In this way, the regulation of DC bus voltage of the PV/BES system can be enhanced as compared to the conventional regulation that is solely based on the voltage-sourced converter (VSC). For the grid side VSC (G-VSC), two control methods, namely, the voltage-mode and current-mode controls, are applied. For control parameter optimization, the simplex optimization technique is applied for the G-VSC voltage- and current-mode controls, including the BES DC/DC buck-boost converter controllers. A new set of optimized parameters are obtained for each of the power converters for comparison purposes.

The receiver, in this scenario, would need a certain amount of energy (derived from the received signal) within a sliding time window for its continuous operation. In order to meet this energy requirement at the receiver, the transmitter should use only those codewords which carry sufficient energy. In this paper, we assume that the transmitter uses on-off keying where bit one corresponds to transmission of a high energy signal. The transmitter uses only those codewords which have at least dones in a sliding window of W = d + 1 bits. We show that with this constraint, the noiseless code capacity is achieved by sequences generated from a finite state Markov machine. We also investigate achievable rates when such constrained codes are used on noisy communication channels.

One promising solution to avoid the use of salt is the seasonal storage of solar heat energy captured directly through the asphalt layer; however, this solution can only be achieved cost effectively if a necessary geostructure is used as a heat exchanger. In this study, such an approach is studied for a bridge crossing a canal, and the geotechnical and energy-related challenges of such a solution are discussed. Bridge piers and abutments are located on piles, which are used as heat exchangers. Depending on local conditions, seasonal storage and natural thermal reload are two possible solutions for the operation of such a system. In particular, the presence of underground water flow is thought to be a significant factor in such a design and is considered here. This study aims to determine the geotechnical and energy design parameters through thermo-hydro-mechanical simulations. A three-dimensional finite-element model analysis is necessary given the distance between bridge piles. Various underground water flow scenarios are studied. The capture of energy and de-icing requirements is based on the few existing structures that use other means of energy exchange with the ground. The results indicate that the use of heat-exchanger piles for de-icing bridges can only be considered at specific sites; however, the efficiency of the solution at those sites is high. Possible foundation and structure stability problems are also considered, such as vertical displacements due to the dual use of the foundation piles. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Energy piles; Natural groundwater flow; THM couplings","bridge; design; finite element method; groundwater flow; heat transfer; ice; pile; thermohydromechanics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901200607

Further, the shear viscosity and storage modulus of the system displayed power-law relations with respect to the dry content of the NFC suspension. The exponential values, 2 and 2.4 respectively, were found to be in good agreement with both theoretical predictions and published experimental work. Furthermore, it was found that the pulp consistency at which NFC is produced affects the properties of the system.

Rapidly changing output power of this kind is unpredictable and thus one solution is to mitigate it by short-term to mid-term electrical storage systems like battery. The main objective of this paper is to propose a power management system (PMS) which is capable of suppressing these adverse impacts on the main supply. A smart microgrid (MG) including diesel, battery storage, and solar plants has been suggested for this purpose. MG is able to supply its local load based on operator decision and decline the power oscillations caused by solar system together with variable loads. A guideline algorithm is also proposed which helps to precisely design the battery plant. A novel application of time domain signal processing approach to filter oscillating output power of the solar plant is presented as well. In this case, a power smoothing index (PSI) is formulated, which considers both load and generation, and used to dispatch the battery plant. A droop reference estimator to schedule generation is also introduced where diesel plant can share the local load with grid. A current control algorithm is designed as well which adjusts for PSI to ensure battery current magnitude is allowable. MG along with its communication platform and PMS are simulated using PSCAD software. PMS is tested under different scenarios using real load profiles and environmental data in Malaysia to verify the operational abilities of proposed MG. The results indicate that PMS can effectively control the MG satisfying both operator and demand sides. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The current studies focus on the effect of addition of 1 wt% hydrophilic nanoclay on mechanical (flexural and impact properties) and dynamic mechanical properties of composites. The composites were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). FTIR spectra show that peak shifting occurs when 1 wt% hydrophilic nanoclay was added to composites. The addition of 1 wt% hydrophilic nanoclay successfully improves the flexural properties and impact resistance of the biocomposites. The storage modulus of biocomposites was decreased when nanoclay was added which indicates that the stiffness of biocomposites was reduced. The loss modulus curve shows that the addition of nanoclay shift two tg in composites become closer to each other which indicates that the incorporation of nanoclay slightly compatibilizes the biocomposites. Tan δ indicated that hybrid composites dissipate less energy compared to biocomposites indicate that addition of clay to biocomposites improves fiber/matrix adhesion.

This behavior contrasts with that of monolithic La-based BMGs, which reach a steady stress level after an initial overshoot. XRD analysis of BMG composites shows the formation of intermetallic compounds during compressive deformation. These intermetallic compound formation/interactions are associated with storage of energy in the material and affect the stress-strain response. In this study, an elastic-viscoplastic, three-dimensional, finite deformation constitutive model is also established to describe the behavior of a recently developed La-based in situ BMG (La-Al-Cu-Ni) composite, within the supercooled liquid region, at ambient pressure and a range of strain rates. The constitutive model is incorporated into a finite element program (ABAQUS/Explicit) via a user-defined material subroutine.

Box 14115-143, Tehran, Iran","With increasing levels of distributed generation (DG) penetration, especially variable output ones, new challenges have appeared in electric power systems. The outputs of these generators are variable and determined largely by nature of the power sources such as wind, wave, and sunlight. One solution to decrease problems caused by the variable output of these resources is to aggregate them into a virtual power plant (VPP). The VPP is an energy management system tasked to aggregate the capacity of some DGs, storage facilities, and dispatchable loads (DL) for the purpose of energy trading and/or providing system support services. The economically optimal control of distributed energy resources (DERs) included in the VPP is complicated by uncertainties, nonlinearities, and inter-temporal constraints. Therefore, a novel two-stage dispatch framework is presented here for the integration of the stochastic and the controllable DERs in the distribution network through the VPP concept. The first stage deals with the VPP optimal bidding model (VOBM). A probabilistic price-based unit commitment using point estimate method (PEM) is used in the VOBM to allow the VPP to decide on the unit commitment of its DERs and the optimal bids to the day-ahead market. The second stage deals with active distribution network management. The distribution system operator uses input from the VOBM to manage any local network constraints and to determine the characteristics of the entire local network at the grid supply points, while seeking to minimize the hourly operation cost. The proposed optimization algorithm is applied to an 18-bus system. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","active distribution network management; distributed energy resources; point estimate method; price-based unit commitment; virtual power plant","Aggregates; Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric power systems; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Optimization; Power plants; Active distribution network management; Distributed Energy Resources; Point estimate method; Price-based unit commitments; Virtual power plants; Network management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900796558

These algorithms use a combination of a coarse and a fine model in the optimization procedure. Despite the good results, the global convergence properties represent an important drawback of these approaches. A global two-level algorithm had been proposed to deal with the convergence problems, but the requirement to refine the global surrogate model in each step can demand high computational time. This paper introduces a global two-level genetic algorithm that uses single predefined coarse and fine surrogate models, which are defined as an artificial neural network nonlinear regression of a preliminary set of finite element simulations.

After decay of shorter-lived isotopes, off-site contamination is now dominated by 134/137Cs, with ~1800km2 having external gamma doses above 5mSvy-1. Although the significance for health of such radiation levels is low, there has been a Government decision that these areas will be cleaned up to reduce exposure and allow displaced residents to return home. After initial tests at 2 sites, a further 11 demonstration remediation projects have been carried out. This work is coordinated by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), with MCM providing support in quality assessment of radioactivity measurements, evaluating the success of different clean-up methods and developing guidelines for the next multi-year phase of large-scale remediation. This work provides a unique perspective on the progress of remediation, experience gained and issues that still need to be resolved - particularly associated with management of the huge quantities of waste generated.

We aimed to compare effects of a meal-replacement based diet with isocaloric reduced-fat plan on LUTS and nutrient intake in obese Asian men. Methods: Obese Asian [mean (range) body mass index of 32.9 (30.5-42.3) kg m-2] men [mean (range) age 40.2 (30-61) years] were randomised to a reduced-fat (&lt; 30% of energy) diet [conventional reduced-fat diet (CD) group; n = 23] or meal-replacement-based plan [meal replacement (MR) group; n = 23], to reduce daily intake by 2000 kJ for 12 weeks. Results: CD and MR groups had statistically significant and similar reductions in weight (-2.6 ± 1.9 kg versus -4.2 ± 3.8 kg), overall LUTS severity measured with International Prostate Symptom Scale (IPSS) scores (-1.71 ± 1.93 points versus -2.42 ± 2.12 points) and insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) calculated from plasma glucose and insulin]. The MR group had significantly greater decreases in WC (-4.8 ± 3.3 cm versus -2.5 ± 2.3 cm), fat mass (-2.47 ± 3.63 kg versus -1.59 ± 2.32 kg), fat intake, plasma C-reactive protein, and in storage LUTS score (-1.59 ± 1.33 points versus -1.00 ± 0.87 points), which was associated with a decreased fat intake (r = 0.48, P = 0.03). A decrease in overall IPSS score was associated with reductions in weight, WC and HOMA. Conclusions: Weight loss as a result of CD or MR had similar efficacy in relieving LUTS.

In this study, lipase immobilisation in gelatin of different Bloom values with the addition of hydrophilic plasticisers, glycerol and mannitol was investigated. Mannitol showed higher efficiency for lipase immobilisation in more uniform pore structures.

The proposed topology consists in an integrated DC/DC and DC/AC converters that can inject electrical power from a low voltage fuel cell into a low voltage monophasic line (100-220Vac). As this topology is suitable to step-up low voltages presents in fuel cell stacks output, it can be also applied in photovoltaic solar panels. The proposed topology is derived from the common topology composed by two intermediary converters: a DC/DC step-up converter and a DC/AC converter, or a monophasic inverter bridge. However, both stages of the converter must operate symbiotically so there is no need of DC bus capacitor, which would be a relatively high voltage capacitor, nor even an inductor for the fuel cell output, which is a relatively high current inductor. Thus, high voltage capacitors and high current inductors are avoided. Compared to others existing fuel cell power converter systems, the proposed circuit has a lower cost, since it has less component count, smaller size, due to the reducing of passive energy storage components and, although it uses the same amount of power transistors, eight in total, only four of them needs to be high frequency transistors, so the other four works in the frequency of the grid. Eventually, simulation and experimental results are presented. © 2014 IEEE.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900427219

However, it is still a big challenge to produce hydrogen and store it. Many studies have been conducted into produce hydrogen from water using photocatalysts. Z-scheme photocatalysis is a two-photocatalyst system that comprises a hydrogen catalyst and an oxygen catalyst to produce hydrogen and oxygen respectively. Compared to the one-step system, the two-step system can promote the efficiency of water splitting. In addition, formic acid (FA) is a convenient hydrogen-storage material and can be safely handled in aqueous solutions. Therefore, this study investigated the photocatalytic conversion of FA solution to hydrogen using visible light with several types of hydrogen catalysts (CdS/titanate nanotubes (TNTs), CdS/TiO2, Pt/CdS/TNTs) and WO3 as the oxygen catalyst. The results showed that the yield of hydrogen with CdS/TNTs + WO 3 was much higher than with CdS/TiO2 + WO3. Moreover, coating the photocatalysts with metal could further promote the reaction.

Here we tested the hypothesis that the immunomodulatory protein pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is associated with adiposity in the general population. Methods Serum PTX3 concentrations, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and fat depots, as quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging, were assessed in three community-based cohorts: ULSAM, n = 790, mean age 78 years; PIVUS, n = 1003, mean age 70 years, women 50%; and the NORDIET-trial, n = 86, mean age 53 years, women 63%. Participants were re-examined after 5 years (PIVUS, n = 804) or following a 6-week randomized controlled dietary intervention (NORDIET). Results PTX3 levels were inversely associated with BMI and WC as well as with total and visceral fat (P < 0.05 for all; adjusted for age, inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors). The association between PTX3 and BMI appeared even stronger in nonobese individuals. A decrease in BMI over 5 years as well as weight loss following the NORDIET intervention were associated with increased serum PTX3 concentrations (P < 0.001). Conclusions These consistent data support an inverse association between circulating PTX3 and anthropometrical measures, calling for further mechanistic studies of the link between PTX3 and fat.

The objective of this review was to describe how mitochondrial metabolism adapts to limited nutrient situations or caloric excess by changes in mitochondrial function or biogenesis, as well as to define the mechanisms propelling these changes.

Prices of electronic products with comparable performance decreased over time. For products where the data allowed fitting the relationship, we found an exponential decrease in price with an average time constant of -0.30 [1/year], meaning that every year the product became 26% cheaper on average.The results imply that the classical approach of setting minimum efficiency performance standards (MEPS) by means of life cycle cost calculations cannot be applied to electronic products. Therefore, an alternative approach based on the improvement of efficiency over time and the variation in efficiency of products on the market, is presented. The concept of a policy action window can provide guidance for the decision on whether setting MEPS for a certain product is appropriate. If the (formal) procedure for setting MEPS takes longer than the policy action window, this means that the efficiency improvement will also be achieved without setting MEPS.

These undesirable features can lead to energy loss and/or can necessitate a large reserve in the form of fast-ramping fuel-based generators. Energy storage can be used to mitigate these effects. In this paper, we are interested in the tradeoff between the use of the reserves and the energy loss. Energy loss includes energy that is either wasted, due to the inefficiency of the storage cycle and the inevitable forecasting errors, or lost when the storage capacity is insufficient. We base our analysis on an initial model proposed by Bejan, Gibbens, and Kelly. We first provide theoretical bounds on the trade-off between energy loss and the use of reserves. For a large storage capacity, we show that this bound is tight, and we develop an algorithm that computes the optimal schedule. Second, we develop a scheduling strategy that is efficient for small or moderate storage. We evaluate these policies on real data from the U.K. grid and show that they outperform existing heuristics. In addition, we provide guidelines for computing the optimal storage characteristics and the reserve size for a given penetration of wind in the energy mix. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Energy storage; forecasting; scheduling; stochastic optimization","Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Forecasting; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Forecast uncertainty; Non-dispatchability; Optimal generation; Renewable energy source; Scheduling strategies; Stochastic optimizations; Storage characteristic; Storage scheduling; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899899742

Due to this mutation, HGPS patients express an incompletely processed form of lamin A called progerin. In this issue of EMBO Reports, the Tazi group demonstrates how mice expressing different LMNA isoforms present opposite phenotypes in longevity, fat storage and mitochondrial function. A study in this issue shows that the LMNA gene encodes functionally distinct isoforms that have opposite effects on energy metabolism and lifespan. Mice expressing lamin C only are obese and have an extended lifespan, whereas mice expressing progerin are lean and die early. © 2014 The Authors.",,"lamin A; lamin C; lamin A; lamin C; Lmna protein, mouse; article; calorimetry; energy expenditure; gene; gene expression; lipid storage; LMNA gene; longevity; mitochondrial gene; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; obesity; phenotype; premature aging; priority journal; progeria; RNA splicing; white adipose tissue; adipose tissue; animal; energy metabolism; genetics; metabolism; physiology; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Lamin Type A",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899812188

Depleted batteries have to be replaced, exposing the patients to the risk of adverse events. Thus, a method for harvesting energy inside the body is desirable since it would allow building devices without batteries. Methods: A miniaturized intravascular Tesla turbine was implanted as an arteriovenous shunt between the common carotid artery and external jugular vein of a pig. The harvested energy was used to power a custom-built temporary cardiac pacemaker. Results: At a flow rate of ∼150 ml/min, an output power of 0.4 mW was measured. Successful ventricular pacing was performed. Conclusion: Harvesting energy from the circulation using an intravascular turbine is technically feasible and provides enough energy to power a cardiac pacemaker. © 2013 et al.; licensee Cardiology Academic Press.","Cardiac pacing; Energy harvesting; Intravascular turbine","animal experiment; arteriovenous shunt; article; cardiovascular equipment; case study; circulation; common carotid artery; energy; external jugular vein; flow rate; harvesting; heart stimulation; in vivo study; nonhuman; sinus node",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899768129

We expect that a natural evolution of such systems is to the cloud where a virtual machine would run the graph processing algorithm and access the graph from secondary storage remotely connected through the network. We evaluate a state of the art graph processing system called X-Stream in EC2 to identify challenges in this space. Our primary finding is that the network bandwidth between a virtual machine and remote storage becomes the limiter for performance. We show that this bottleneck can be somewhat alleviated through the use of VM local instance storage, network provisioning and compression.

This pursuit has vehemently increased the intention for integrating renewable energy (RE) into the electricity sector as a strategy to curb the problem of energy deficiency especially in isolated off-grid settlements. However, the variability in the sources of RE supply coupled with conditional changes in the level of energy consumption with respect to time has brought to focus the necessity for energy storage systems (ESSs). Despite the stochastic nature of RE produced from solar and wind energy and to some extent hydro, interest in their exploitation is still growing high due to their sustainability regarding environmental receptiveness. Thus, this paper extensively reviews the state of the art of three different kinds of energy storage technologies (pumped hydroelectricity storage, batteries and fuel cells) suitable for the integration and management of intermittency in RE. Within the context of the review, advantages and disadvantages of the various technologies are also presented. Additionally, it also pin-points on the different areas of applications of ESSs for RE integration and offers review summary on factors to be considered for selecting appropriate energy storage technology for either commercial or domestic applications. Finally, the paper concluded that ESSs selection is based on performance characteristics and fuel source used whereas no single ESS can meet all the possible requirements to be called a supreme ESS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage systems; Intermittency; Renewable energy","Electric energy storage; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Integration; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Wind power; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Energy storage technologies; Intermittency; Performance characteristics; Renewable energies; Renewable energy power; Solar and wind energies; Fuel storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899700765

All kinds of changes of geotechnical conditions in these areas pose potentially slope instability and jeopardized values of property and life. Soil slopes are affected by water-level fluctuations originating from as well tides and other waves, as non-natural sources such as watercourse regulation for irrigation, freshwater provision, and/or hydropower production. Due to a growing use of non-regulated energy sources (e.g. wind and solar), the need of energy balancing and storage is increasing. Also techniques such as pumped hydropower storage (PHS), which may be associated with significant water-volume changes in the reservoirs, are growing globally. This is expected to involve variations of hydropower reservoir water levels; hour to hour, day to day and/or seasonally. In this paper geotechnical effects of water-level fluctuations on slope stability are reviewed; relevant inter-disciplinary findings are presented, adventurous simplifications and/or inadvertencies are underlined, and potential improvement areas are identified. A lot of research has been carried out focused on coastal erosion; mainly aimed to investigate tide-water influence on slope-profile development, and quantification of sediment production. On the other hand, studies on effects of water-level changes on geotechnical conditions in adjacent soil structures have been predominantly concerning embankment dams. In addition, studies addressing processes in natural slopes and banks are often environmentally oriented, rather than focused on slope stability. Since also water-level rise (not only drawdown) has been shown to significantly influence slope stability, further investigation of processes of suction loss, effects of rapidly increased water pressures, and retrogressive failure development is needed. Long-term views are often missing; analyses tend to involve few rise-drawdown cycles, soil materials are deficiently described, and limited attention is put on constitutive models used. Reliable integration of seepage effects on soil-property changing requires consideration of as well acute effects as long-term changes. Therefore, proper consideration of internal erosion is central. Given the critical relationship between pore pressure, soil strength, and soil-deformation, analyses have to be performed using robust simulation approaches. The terms ""simplicity"" and ""applicability""-promoting use of limit-equilibrium methods-should more often be set in relation to accuracy and robustness provided by use of methods considering also deformations. © 2014 ejge.","Reservoir; Slope stability; Water-level fluctuations","Deformation; Erosion; Hydroelectric power; Reservoirs (water); Slope stability; Soils; Deformation; Erosion; Hydroelectric power; Land use; Reservoirs (water); Soils; Stability; Water levels; Geotechnical conditions; Geotechnical effects; Hydro power production; Hydropower reservoirs; Limited attentions; Sediment production; Water level changes; Water-level fluctuation; Limit equilibrium methods; Water levels; Slope stability; coastal erosion; embankment; land use planning; reservoir; slope dynamics; slope failure; slope stability; soil mechanics; water level; deformation; embankment dam; geotechnical survey; hydroelectric power; soil-structure interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899660658

Therein the wave equation of thermoacoustic dynamics in resonators with non-uniform media and boundary actuations is derived and then turned into a least-action principle. With this least-action principle, we obtain the governing equation of longitudinal resonators with spatially variant cross-section areas to investigate how to shape the resonator for boosting piston stroke and power-transmission efficiency. It is followed by spatiotemporal transfer-function modelling that functionally represents the dynamics and interprets the boundary actuations into internal inputs. This helps formulate the overall dynamics into feedback-interconnection between the thermoacoustic dynamics in the resonator and the mechatronic dynamics of the alternative current generator, so that synthesis of feedback systems can be applied to design the entire engine. Transfer-function modelling following least-action principle leads to the conservation law of thermoacoustic storage, which figures out engine cycles, the most fundamental principle in designing active thermoacoustic engines. Based on such feedback realization, digital signal processing is programmed to numerically assess power ratings of active designs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

They can help match energy supply and demand, exploit the variable production of renewable energy sources (e.g. solar and wind), increase the overall efficiency of the energy system and reduce CO2 emissions. This paper presents a unit commitment formulation for micro-grid that includes a significant number of grid parallel PEM-Fuel Cell Power Plants (PEM-FCPPs) with ramping rate and minimum up and down time constraints. The aim of this problem is to determine the optimum size of energy storage devices like hydrogen, thermal energy and battery energy storages in order to schedule the committed units' output power while satisfying practical constraints and electrical/thermal load demand over one day with 15 min time step. In order to best use of multiple PEM-FCPPs, hydrogen storage management is carried out. Also, since the electrical and heat load demand are not synchronized, it could be useful to store the extra heat of PEM-FCPPs in the peak electrical load in order to satisfy delayed heat demands. Due to uncertainty nature of electrical/thermal load, photovoltaic and wind turbine output power and market price, a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming model, where the first stage prescribes the here-and-now variables and the second stage determines the optima value of wait-and-see variables under cost minimization. Quantitative results show the usefulness and viability of the suggested approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the power management, the proposed BSIMO converter can operate at a step-up state (energy release) and a step-down state (energy storage). At the step-up state, it can boost the voltage of a low-voltage input power source to a controllable high-voltage dc bus and middle-voltage output terminals. If there is redundant energy in the high-voltage dc bus, one can reversely transmit the energy. The high-voltage dc bus can take as the main power, and middle-voltage output terminals can supply powers for individual middle-voltage dc loads or to charge auxiliary power sources (e.g. battery modules). In this study, a coupled-inductor-based BSIMO converter utilises only three power switches to accomplish the bidirectional power control with the properties of voltage clamping and soft switching, and the corresponding device specifications are adequately designed. As a result, the objectives of high-efficiency power conversion, bidirectional energy transmission, high step-up/step-down ratios and various output voltages with different levels can be obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed BSIMO power converter is verified by experimental results of a kW-level prototype in practical applications. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.",,"Electrical engineering; Power electronics; Battery modules; Bi-directional power control; Device specification; Energy transmission; High-efficiency power conversions; Power managements; Single input multiple outputs; Voltage clamping; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899642384

Measuring the respiratory quotient (RQ) during the course of pregnancy (by quantifying O 2 consumption and CO 2 production with indirect calorimetry) could be potentially useful since it gives an insight into the evolution of the proportion of carbohydrate vs. fat oxidized during pregnancy and thus allows recommendations on macronutrients for achieving a balanced (or slightly positive) substrate intake. A systematic search of the literature for papers reporting RQ changes during normal pregnancy identified 10 papers reporting original research. The existing evidence supports an increased RQ of varying magnitude in the third trimester of pregnancy, while the discrepant results reported for the first and second trimesters (i.e. no increase in RQ), explained by limited statistical power (small sample size) or fragmentary data, preclude safe conclusions about the evolution of RQ during early pregnancy. From a clinical point of view, measuring RQ during pregnancy requires not only sophisticated and costly indirect calorimeters but appears of limited value outside pure research projects, because of several confounding variables: (1) spontaneous changes in food intake and food composition during the course of pregnancy (which influence RQ); (2) inter-individual differences in weight gain and composition of tissue growth; (3) technical factors, notwithstanding the relatively small contribution of fetal metabolism per se (RQ close to 1.0) to overall metabolism of the pregnant mother. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Energy balance; Energy substrate; Indirect calorimetry; Pregnancy","carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; estrogen; gestagen; human placenta lactogen; hydrocortisone; progesterone; aerobic metabolism; article; behavior change; body composition; body fat; body weight; caloric intake; calorimetry; carbohydrate intake; confounding variable; energy balance; energy expenditure; fetoplacental unit; first trimester pregnancy; food composition; gluconeogenesis; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance; glucose utilization; heredity; insulin release; insulin response; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; lung gas exchange; macronutrient; oxygen consumption; physical activity; pregnancy; priority journal; respiratory quotient; resting metabolic rate; second trimester pregnancy; third trimester pregnancy; tissue growth; weight gain; caloric intake; energy metabolism; female; fetus; human; metabolism; physiology; pregnancy; Calorimetry, Indirect; Carbon Dioxide; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fetus; Humans; Oxygen Consumption; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899418253

In this paper, a direct-contact erythritol/heat transfer oil (HTO) energy storage system has been studied experimentally, consisting of a thermal energy storage unit, electrical heaters, heat exchanger and water cycle. In the system, erythritol has been used as an energy storage media (melting point = 118 °C, heat enthalpy = 330 kJ/kg), and HTO is used as a heat transfer material. Moreover, simulation has been conducted to understand heat transfer enhancement mechanisms of direct-contact heat storage. It is noticed that, at the beginning of heat storage, heat transfer oil has a small flow rate due to the block of solid part. PCM in the middle area of the storage unit melts faster than other parts due to the greater heat transfer on the liquid-solid interface of the both sides, and erythritol attached on the storage unit wall melts slowly since small heat conductivity plays a key role for heat transfer. It is also found that increasing the flow rate of HTO can significantly decrease the melting time by increasing fluid turbulent degree. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) arrays have emerged as possible scaffolds to support large surface area ceramic layers. However, obtaining conformal and uniform coatings of ceramics on structures with high aspect ratio morphologies is non-trivial, even with atomic layer deposition (ALD). Here we implement a diffusion model to investigate the effect of the ALD parameters on coating kinetics and use it to develop a guideline for achieving conformal and uniform thickness coatings throughout the depth of ultra-high aspect ratio structures. We validate the model predictions with experimental data from ALD coatings of VACNT arrays. However, the approach can be applied to predict film conformality as a function of depth for any porous topology, including nanopores and nanowire arrays. © 2014 Yazdani et al.","Atomic layer deposition; Conformal coating guidelines; Continuum diffusion model; Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes","Aspect ratio; Carbon nanotubes; Ceramic materials; Deposition; Diffusion coatings; Energy conversion; Nanowires; Scaffolds; Titanium dioxide; Virtual storage; Aspect ratio structures; Conformal coatings; Diffusion model; Energy conversion and storages; Interfacial surface; Modeling and optimization; TiO; Vertically aligned carbon nanotube; Atomic layer deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899063255

Three combined systems have been studied in detail: solar and air source heat pump, solar and ground source heat pump, and exclusively solar source heat pump in combination with an ice storage. Numerical calculations have been performed using two simulation platforms: TRNSYS-17 and Polysun-6®. Comparisons between the two simulation environments have been also provided. Moreover, a reference case without solar has been used to determine the potential efficiency benefits of using solar collectors compared to a system with a heat pump alone in the specified climate and for covering the specified heat load. Simulations presented in this work show that differences in system performance up to 4% can be expected between TRNSYS-17 and Polysun-6® for air source based systems, and higher discrepancies, up to 14% are obtained for ground source based systems. Comparisons between combined solar thermal and heat pump systems with their respective ""heat pump only"" reference solutions show that the absolute electricity savings of air source are usually higher compared to ground source based systems.

Iran with annual CO2 production of 532.4 million tons in 2010 has been reported to be the 9th country in the world. Shortage, low efficiency, losses, subsidies and unsuitable consumption pattern in sub-sectors challenge Irans energy sector. Countrys energy supply is intensively dependent on oil and gas, which lead to produce more greenhouse-gas emission. Therefore, Iran should establish some policies to control its environmental pollutions and place carbon-mitigation strategy within the government agenda as soon as possible. Efficient use of energy, progress of renewable energy and enhancing CO2 sequestration to mitigate more CO2 can be alternatives for reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions. Regarding major geological formations such as the second largest natural-gas reservoir and the third-greatest oil reservoir in the world and the second largest basin in the Middle East, storage of carbon and enhanced oil recovery seem to be a suitable choice for carbon capture and storage. Moreover, in Iran due to a vast land area, presence of various saline lakes which containing different species of microalgae and opportunity of establishing microalgae culture ponds, the capture unit and microalgal culture can be located close to carbon sources, which are scattered and far from geological formations. Besides CO2 mitigation, microalgae cultures can also produce valuable products and cause carbon capture more efficient. This article with the aim of anthropogenic CO2 reduction, reviews programs in the field of energy management and sustainable energy development to control emission. Then carbon sources and the potentials to capture and sequester CO2 are explored. In the end, potentials of microalgae in Iran to mitigate CO2 are described. This review is designed to investigate abilities in Iran to utilize or minimize CO2 and deploy biological carbon sequestration in the context of Iran's policy environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The hybrid system consists of a photovoltaic (PV) module, an electrolyser (EL), hydrogen storage tank (HS) and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell (FC). The generated energy is sold to the distribution grid. During the grid interruptions, the hybrid system output is used as an emergency supply to serve the local load, hence increasing the supply reliability. The proposed approach splits the whole problem in two sub problems: revenue maximizing problem (RMP) and expected generation maximizing problem (EGM). RMP finds optimal hourly electricity selling considering hourly variations in electricity price and solar irradiance subjected to HS minimum pressure. EGM uses RMP results and HS minimum pressure to determine expected generated energy (EGE) based on the proposed 4-state generation reliability model for the system. A bi-section search is finally used to find the optimum level for HS minimum pressure to maximize EGE while keeping selling revenue at highest possible level. The impact of optimal system operation on EGE is then evaluated. A series of analyses have been conducted to assess the capability and applicability of the proposed method. Suitable economic indices have also been proposed to evaluate reliability cost/worth of hybrid system application to improve load reliability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Regulators should properly identify long-term impacts of their support policies in the energy resource expansion in order to choose a proper support scheme. These support schemes should ensure the long-term market stability. It is important for a DER investor to properly identify his/her long-term investment behavior to select an appropriate strategy. In this paper, the system dynamics method is used to investigate these issues. The impacts of various multi-resource regulatory policies on market dynamics are modeled and compared with the single-resource support schemes ones. In this study, support schemes are considered for supporting DR, wind resources, CHPs and photovoltaic resources. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With our fixed bed, vacuum reactors using zeolite as TCM, we recently demonstrated long-term heat storage with satisfactory output power. For domestic application, however, it will be necessary to considerably increase storage density and to reduce system costs. In this paper, we discuss issues on system, component and material levels for realizing a commercially attractive system. We first discuss a modular, fixed bed concept with a hot water storage. We show that with proper dimensioning of TCM modules and hot water storage, one can obtain a system where daily storage and on-demand heat delivery can be arranged by the hot water storage, while demands on output power, power control and material stability during operation are relaxed as much as possible. We also discuss atmospheric and central reactor concepts, which may provide lower-cost TCS systems. An important issue on component level is the implementation of a low temperature source providing evaporation heat in winter. We discuss several options, including the application of solar collectors in winter. Heat storage density can be increased by an order of magnitude by applying hydration reactions of hygroscopic salts, but this introduces physical and chemical stability issues during repeated cycles of hydration and dehydration. We discuss several of these stability issues as well as possible stabilization in a composite TCM, which should also provide sufficient vapor and heat transport.","Energy storage; Hygroscopic salts; Sodium sulfide; Thermochemical heat storage; Thermochemical materials; Zeolite",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898951735

The memory devices exhibit bipolar resistance switching characteristics. Using a current-bias method, a negative resistance or snapback characteristic is observed when the memory device switches from a high-resistance state to a low-resistance state owing to the formation of filamentary conducting path. With DC cycling endurance tests, the more set/reset switching cycles are performed, the more times of snapbacks are found. The multiple snapbacks are associated with the additional conducting filaments formed nearby the original filament. By the explorations of temperature- dependent current-voltage characteristics and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra, the filaments may be related to the defect state of interstitial zinc with the trap spacing of 2 nm and the trap energy level of 0.46 eV in ZnO films.

Within this work, different options for hydraulic integration and control of a heat pump connected to a solar combi-storage are investigated by means of annual system simulations. The results show that unfavorable hydraulic integration can lead to additional electric energy demand of the system of up to 45% (>1000 kWh electric energy per year) compared to a - well designed - reference solution with the same components.

In the game-theoretic synthesis, both objectives share the same control and estimation storages, thus reducing the conservatism conventionally happened in robust/optimal control with multiple objectives. Moreover, the feedback controller has a definite structure, thus facilitating the iteration of control modeling and control synthesis to reach a sound design.

The properties evaluated were: moisture content in wet basis, gross and net calorific value and ash content. The shape and size had greater influence on the moisture content and on net calorific value. The pine edge suffered greater loss of moisture content, higher gain and lower gross calorific value and lower ash content during storage. This material was also the most heterogeneous, with respect to changes occurred during storage. The logs of Pinus had the lowest moisture loss and lower energy gain.

Studies emphasize the role of insulin resistance, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipokines in the development and progression of NAFLD. It seems to be independently associated with type II diabetes mellitus, increased triglycerides, decreased HDL-cholesterol, abdominal obesity and insulin resistance.

One-dimensional (1D) hematite nanostructures have attracted, due to their fundamental characteristics such as excellent chemical stability in aqueous environments and low cost, considerable interest for a series of technical applications (as sensors, catalysis, lithium ion batteries and solar energy production and storage). Our study describes the phase evolution of iron oxide nanorods, from β-FeOOH to α-Fe2O3, with increasing temperatures of thermal treatment monitored by ex situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. These data used in conjunction with the Rietveld method allowed us to infer the phase concentration, elucidate the influence of temperature on the unit cell parameters and preferred growth orientation of the nanorods. Only the use of synchrotron radiation allowed us to precisely identify and quantify the presence of a minor Fe2O3 phase, which has never before been reported for those systems. Moreover, the formation of one-dimensional nanorods was accompanied by using scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM). At the highest temperatures of thermal treatments the hematite nanorods exhibited changes that varied from a quasi-perfect crystal up to polycrystalline rods (&gt;500 °C). These findings were used for discussing and explaining recent results using this kind of nanostructure synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. Changes in the preferred orientation of the crystal faces of the rods could be responsible for a low photocatalytic performance reported by this strategy.

Providing content services presents new challenges for coordination between storage systems and network infrastructures, specifically for latency-sensitive applications such as voice, video, and terminal services. However, prior research has not applied collaboration techniques of storage and network inline to the request path for latency sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose a latency-sensitive content distribution mechanism, Space4time, for a real world system. We observe that operation is largely affected by the collaboration among end users, storage and networks in cloud. Meanwhile, dynamic request routing within the cloud is strongly coupled with content placement decisions when designing the mechanism. Based on blocking probability, we propose content distribution and request routing strategies that take as input storage and network traffic information. Our strategies enable us to balance storage capacity savings and network traffic for performance, as demonstrated in our YouTube trace-based simulation. Our evaluation shows that Space4time outperforms StaticScheme on average 22.3% for access latency improvement. With more sites, Space4time has a better performance due to reduced traffic. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Blocking probability; Cloud; Content distribution; Keywords; Latency sensitive; Storage","Blocking probability; Clouds; Distributed database systems; Energy storage; Human computer interaction; Cloud service providers; Content distribution; Keywords; Latency sensitive; Network infrastructure; Routing strategies; Sensitive application; Trace-based simulation; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898771407

We investigated the prediction of the storage lifetime and the thermal impact of thermally reactive material by different thermal analysis models: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for non-isothermal tests versus DSC isothermal tests. Two kinds of kinetic models were compared for evaluating appropriate kinetic parameters of thermal decomposition, and then the thermal hazard parameters were estimated by cartridge package simulation, which could result in reliable thermal hazard properties of a thermal reactive material's thermal decomposition. We also determined the unsafe characteristics of a thermally reactive material stored in a depot under lifetime, so as to prevent runaway reactions that induce incidents by heat attack during storage.

Although the causative gene, COL3A1, was identified >20 years ago, there has been limited progress in understanding the disease mechanisms or identifying treatments. Methods and Results: We studied inflammatory and transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) signaling biomarkers in plasma and from dermal fibroblasts from patients with VEDS. Analyses were done in terms of clinical disease severity, genotype-phenotype correlations, and body composition and fat deposition alterations. VEDS subjects had increased circulating TGF-ß1, TGF-ß2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and leptin and decreased interleukin-8 versus controls. VEDS dermal fibroblasts secreted more TGF-ß2, whereas downstream canonical/noncanonical TGF-ß signaling was not different. Patients with COL3A1 exon skipping mutations had higher plasma intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and VEDS probands had abnormally high plasma C-reactive protein versus affected patients identified through family members before any disease manifestations. Patients with VEDS had higher mean platelet volumes, suggesting increased platelet turnover because of ongoing vascular damage, as well as increased regional truncal adiposity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VEDS is a systemic disease with a major inflammatory component. C-reactive protein is linked to disease state and may be a disease activity marker. No changes in downstream TGF-ß signaling and increased platelet turnover suggest that chronic vascular damage may partially explain increased plasma TGF-ß1. Finally, we found a novel role for dysregulated TGF-ß2, as well as adipocyte dysfunction, as demonstrated through reduced interleukin-8 and elevated leptin in VEDS. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","Aneurysm; Biomarkers; Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; Extracellular matrix; Inflammation","acetylsalicylic acid; adipocytokine; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biological marker; bone morphogenetic protein; C reactive protein; calcium channel blocking agent; collagen fibril; collagen type 3; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 8; leptin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; small interfering RNA; transforming growth factor beta1; transforming growth factor beta2; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; adult; article; blood vessel injury; body composition; child; clinical article; Col3A1 gene; controlled study; cytokine release; disease severity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; Ehlers Danlos syndrome; exon skipping; female; fibroblast; gene; genotype phenotype correlation; haploinsufficiency; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoassay; lipid storage; male; missense mutation; obesity; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein blood level; punch biopsy; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; skin biopsy; thrombocyte volume; turnover time; vascular disease; vascular ehlers danlos syndrome; Western blotting; aneurysm; biomarkers; Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; extracellular matrix; inflammation; Adipokines; Adolescent; Adult; Biological Markers; Body Composition; C-Reactive Protein; Child; Collagen Type III; Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome; Female; Fibroblasts; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Transforming Growth Factor beta2; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898729841

Due to the fluctuation of wind power, it is difficult to schedule wind turbines (WTs) with other distributed energy resources (DERs). In this paper, we propose an expert energy management system (EEMS) for optimal operation of WTs and other DERs in an interconnected micro-grid. The main purpose of the proposed EEMS is to find the optimal set points of DERs and storage devices, in such a way that the total operation cost and the net emission are simultaneously minimized. The EEMS consists of wind power forecasting module, smart energy storage system (ESS) module and optimization module. For optimal scheduling of WTs, the power forecasting module determines the possible available capacity of wind generation in the micro-grid. To do this, first, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to forecast wind speed. Then, the obtaining results are used considering forecasting uncertainty by the probabilistic concept of confidence interval. To reduce the fluctuations of wind power generation and improve the micro-grid performances, a smart energy storage system (ESS) module is used. For optimal management of the ESS, the comprehensive mathematical model with practical constraints is extracted. Finally, an efficient modified Bacterial Foraging Optimization (MBFO) module is proposed to solve the multi-objective problem. An interactive fuzzy satisfying method is also used to simulate the trade-off between the conflicting objectives (cost and emission). To evaluate the proposed algorithm, the EEMS is applied to a typical micro-grid which consists of various DERs, smart ESS and electrical loads. The results show that the EEMS can effectively coordinate the power generation of DERs and ESS with respect to economic and environmental considerations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Expert energy management system (EEMS); Micro-grid; Multi-objective optimization; Wind forecast uncertainty","Electric power generation; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Virtual storage; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Bacterial foraging optimization; Distributed Energy Resources; Environmental considerations; Expert energy management system (EEMS); Interactive fuzzy satisfying method; Micro grid; Multi-objective problem; Wind forecasts; Electric power distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898652780

They maintain only a few pathways for obtaining energy and reducing power for the key functions they need to fulfill. This makes RBCs highly sensitive to any aberration. If so, these RBCs are quickly removed from circulation, but if the RBC levels reduce extremely fast, this results in hemolytic anemia. Several causes of HA exist, and proteome analysis is the most straightforward way to obtain deeper insight into RBC functioning under the stress of disease. This should result in discovery of biomarkers, typical for each source of anemia. In this review, several challenges to generate in-depth RBC proteomes are described, like to obtain pure RBCs, to overcome the wide dynamic range in protein expression, and to establish which of the identified/quantified proteins are active in RBCs. The final challenge is to acquire and validate suited biomarkers unique for the changes that occur for each of the clinical questions; in red blood cell aging (also important for transfusion medicine), for thalassemias or sickle cell disease. Biomarkers for other hemolytic anemias that are caused by dysfunction of RBC membrane proteins (the RBC membrane defects) or RBC cytosolic proteins (the enzymopathies) are sometimes even harder to discover, in particular for the patients with RBC rare diseases with unknown cause.

In this paper we analyze the results of different integrated assessment models (IAMs) taking part in the 27th round of the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) with respect to the role of CCS in long term mitigation scenarios. Specifically we look into the use of CCS as a function of time, mitigation targets, availability of renewables and its use with different fuels. Furthermore, we explore the possibility to relate model results to general and CCS specific model assumptions. The results show a wide range of cumulative capture in the 2010-2100 period (600-3050 GtCO2), but the fact that no model projects less than 600 GtCO2 indicates that CCS is considered to be important by all these models. Interestingly, CCS storage rates are often projected to be still increasing in the second half of this century. Depending on the scenario, at least six out of eight, up to all models show higher storage rates in 2100 than in 2050. CCS shares in cumulative primary energy use are in most models increasing with the stringency of the target or under conservative availability of renewables. The strong variations of CCS deployment projection rates could not be related to the reported differences in the assumptions of the models by means of a cross-model comparison in this sample. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon capture and storage; Function of time; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation options; Model assumptions; Model results; Modeling project; Primary energy use; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898540128

This study explores the impacts of technology limitations on greenhouse gas emission reductions using the integrated model IMAGE. It shows that the required short-term emission reductions to achieve long-term radiative forcing targets strongly depend on assumptions on the availability and potential of mitigation technologies. Limited availability of mitigation technologies which are relatively important in the long run implies that lower short-term emission levels are required. For instance, limited bio-energy availability reduces the optimal 2020 emission level by more than 4 GtCO2eq in order to compensate the reduced availability of negative emissions from bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in the long run. On the other hand, reduced mitigation potential of options that are used in 2020 can also lead to a higher optimal level for 2020 emissions. The results also show the critical role of BECCS for achieving low radiative forcing targets in IMAGE. Without these technologies achieving these targets become much more expensive or even infeasible. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Carbon capture; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Carbon capture and storage; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Integrated modeling; Radiative forcings; Reduction potential; Scenario studies; Technology limitations; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898485061

Furthermore, the control system presents effective charging of the battery in the micro-grid. When the system is grid connected and during normal operation, AC grid converter balances active power to ensure a constant DC voltage while the battery has the option to store energy for necessary usage.

This stresses the need for new therapeutic strategies to combat this growing epidemic of metabolic diseases. A reduced mitochondrial function is one of the characteristics of metabolic diseases and therefore a target for intervention. Here we review the evidence that mitochondrial function may act as a target to treat and prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus, and, if so, whether these effects are due to reduction in skeletal muscle fat accumulation. We describe how exercise may affect these parameters and can be beneficial for type 2 diabetes. We next focus on alternative ways to improve mitochondrial function in a non-exercise manner. Thus, in 2003, resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) was discovered to be a small molecule activator of sirtuin 1, an important molecular target regulating cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial homoeostasis. Rodent studies have clearly demonstrated the potential of resveratrol to improve various metabolic health parameters. Here we review data in human subjects that is available on the effects of resveratrol on metabolism and mitochondrial function and discuss how resveratrol may serve as a new therapeutic strategy to preserve metabolic health.

An NFC device is quite complex: it has to support both ASK/BPSK modulation, variable data rates from 106kb/s to 848kb/s, different ASK modulation indices (8% to 100%), different card types (NFC-A/B/F), and various coding. It also has different operating modes such as Proximity-Inductively-Coupled Card (PICC) or card-emulation mode, Proximity-Coupled-Device (PCD) or reader mode and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mode. Furthermore, some PCDs transmit NFC-A/B/F ASK data in a polling loop manner. Therefore, PICC receivers must support joint data-type detection for successful communication with such PCDs. The device shown in Fig. 9.1.1 supports all these operating modes and complies with ISO-14443, ISO-18092 and NFC Forum standards. The SoC has an ultra-low current receiver, a digital transmitter with a 250mA-maximum-current-drive Class-D PA, a Single-Wire Protocol (SWP) supporting two external UICC SIM cards and one micro-SD chip, an energy-harvesting rectifier unit, an agile synthesizer, and a digital modem. Traditionally, two separate receivers with respective synthesizers and clock recovery/generation circuits are adopted for PICC, PCD and P2P modes [1,2]. In addition, three parallel analog demodulators are needed (one each for NFC-A, B and F) to support joint data-type detection, thus increasing die area significantly. The focus of this paper is the adoption of a single receiver with one reconfigurable PLL to support all NFC modes for compact die area. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Communication; Electric rectifiers; Electromagnetic induction; Modulation; Programmable logic controllers; Digital modems; Digital transmitters; Near-field communication; NFC forum standards; Operating modes; Self-calibrating; Support joints; Variable data rates; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898066983

Two of the biggest enablers for Cloud 1.0 have been clients such as Smartphones and tablets, connected through wired and wireless networks. Embedded within each of these clients are the CPU and GPU processors needed to enable consumer applications and mobile human-interface devices (HIDs). To satisfy the ever-growing computational requirements, mobile CPU clock frequencies have extended into the GHz region. To avoid this barrier, mobile clients are driving the downscaling of process technology while motivating the rapid rise of multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In this process, new architectures involving asymmetric-CPU and octa-cores are emerging.

It has been shown that both boron and nitrogen doping of graphene can improve the intrinsic capacitance of the material relative to the undoped precursor. We address the question of whether p-doping (using boron as dopant) or n-doping (using nitrogen as dopant) leads to increased capacitance relative to undoped graphene materials. Using thermal exfoliation we synthesized both boron- and nitrogen-doped graphene materials and measured capacitance relative to the undoped material. After a full characterization by SEM analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, gamma-ray activation analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, and electrochemical techniques we demonstrate that the doping process does not lead to enhancement of capacitive behavior and that the main characteristic influencing capacitance is the presence of structural defects within the graphitic structure, independent of doping level. Show the doping, get the capacitance: The distinctive structural differences between doped graphene materials in terms of density of defects revealed by Raman spectroscopy is the determining factor as far as their capacitive properties are concerned, whereas type and amount of the doping heteroatoms seem to be largely irrelevant. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Air temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70C at fixed and semi-fluidized bed conditions were applied. Statistical indices showed that the Aghbashlo etal. model was the best for prediction of faba bean-drying kinetics. Moisture diffusivity values for the first and second falling rate drying were between 3.04×10-9-9.62×10-9m2/s and 6.32×10-9-2.64×10-8m2/s, respectively. Maximum values of moisture diffusivity belonged to semi-fluidized bed condition. Activation energy values were calculated between 21.68 and 27.42kJ/mol for temperature boundary of 40-70C, and drying conditions of fixed to semi-fluidized bed, respectively. Specific energy consumption values were computed in the range of 13.36×106-64.30×106kJ/kg from 40 to 70C with drying condition of fixed and semi-fluidized bed, respectively. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The empirical equations of moisture diffusivity, activation energy and specific energy consumption are suggested to use in the computation of these property values of faba beans while the obtained equations are essential to compute the mass transfer and energy required during simulation of high-moisture faba bean drying. High-moisture drying curves were obtained in two falling periods. If empirical models of drying parameters in two falling periods are developed using experimental data of faba bean, the models developed can be used to more accurately predict the drying time and energy consumption using computer and can also be used to select the best operational point in the drying process and to more accurately to model and simulate the drying and storage of faba bean. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Activation energy; Diffusion; Digital storage; Electric load forecasting; Energy utilization; Moisture; Empirical equations; Falling rate drying; Initial Moisture Content; Moisture diffusivity; Semi-fluidized bed; Specific energy consumption; Statistical indices; Temperature boundary; Drying; Vicia faba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897959150

Fuel cells are an interesting alternative for generating electricity since they use hydrogen as their main fuel and release only water and heat to the environment. Although fuel cells show great flexibility in size and operating temperature (some models even operate at low temperatures), the technology has the drawback for hydrogen transportation and storage. However, hydrogen may be produced from methanol steam reforming obtained from renewable sources such as biomass. The use of methanol as raw material in hydrogen production process by steam reforming is highly interesting owing to the fact that alcohol has the best hydrogen carbon-1 ratio (4:1) and may be processed at low temperatures and atmospheric pressures. They are features which are desirable for its use in autonomous fuel cells. Current research develops a mathematical model of an isothermal methanol steam reforming reactor and validates it against experimental data from the literature. The mathematical model was solved numerically by MATLAB® and the comparison of its predictions for different experimental conditions indicated that the developed model and the methodology for its numerical solution were adequate. Further, a preliminary analysis was undertaken on methanol steam reforming reactor project for autonomous fuel cell.","Hydrogen; Mathematical modelling; Methanol; Steam reforming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897949216

Feasibility of using fuel cell (FC) for this airplane is evaluated by means of simulations. Temperature change and dual layer capacity effect are considered in all simulations. Using a three-level 3-phase inverter, FC's output voltage is connected to the essential bus of the airplane. Moreover, it is possible to connect FC's output voltage to airplane DC bus alternatively. PID controller is presented to control flow of hydrogen and oxygen to FC and improve transient and steady state responses of the output voltage to load disturbances. FC's output voltage is regulated via an ultracapacitor. Simulations are carried out via MATLAB/SIMULINK and results show that the load tracking and output voltage regulation are acceptable. The proposed system utilizes an electrolyser to generate hydrogen and a tank for storage. Therefore, there is no need for batteries.

In this work, we target the root cause of network energy consumption through techniques that reduce link and router-level switching activity. We specifically focus on memory subsystem traffic, as it comprises the bulk of NoC load in a CMP. By transmitting only the flits that contain words predicted useful using a novel spatial locality predictor, our scheme seeks to reduce network activity. We aim to further lower NoC energy through microarchitectural mechanisms that inhibit datapath switching activity for unused words in individual flits. Using simulation-based performance studies and detailed energy models based on synthesized router designs and different link wire types, we show that 1) the prediction mechanism achieves very high accuracy, with an average rate of false-unused prediction of just 2.5 percent; 2) the combined NoC energy savings enabled by the predictor and microarchitectural support is 36 percent, on average, and up to 57 percent in the best case; and 3) there is no system performance penalty as a result of this technique. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","cache memory; interconnections; Power management; spatial locality","Buffer storage; Cache memory; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Efficient communications; interconnections; Microarchitectural mechanism; Microarchitectural support; Network energy consumption; Performance penalties; Power managements; Spatial locality; Routers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897522887

The resulting unsteady water release to rivers, called hydropeaking, alters the natural flow regime. Mitigating the adverse impacts of hydropeaking on aquatic ecosystems has become a crucial step in recent water policies. We developed a novel economic-ecological diagnostic and intervention method to assess hydropeaking mitigation measures for fish habitat improvement. This method was applied to an Alpine river downstream of a complex storage hydropower scheme. The approach comprises (1) a hydropower operation model of flow regime generation and cost estimates for different mitigation measures, (2) a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the flow conditions in representative river reaches and (3) a dynamic fish habitat simulation tool to assess the sub-daily changes in habitat conditions of three brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) life stages (adult, spawning and young-of-the-year). Simulations showed that operational measures such as limiting maximum turbine discharge, increasing residual flow and limiting drawdown range incur high costs in relation to their ecological effectiveness. Compensation basins and powerhouse outflow deviation achieved the best cost-benefit ratio. Hydropeaking impact was strongly dependent on river morphology. Monotonous river reaches exhibited low habitat suitability for peak discharge, whereas a braided morphology provided high in-stream structure and thus suitable habitat for unsteady flow conditions. The interdisciplinary approach to economic and habitat rating informs decision makers regarding the effectiveness of measures implemented to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with fluctuating hydropower operations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Brown trout; Economic and habitat rating; Habitat suitability; Hydropeaking; Hydropower; Mitigation measures","Environmental impact; Fish; Hydroelectric power; Morphology; Rivers; Water levels; Water management; Brown trouts; Habitat suitability; Hydropeaking; Hydropower; Mitigation measures; Ecosystems; environmental impact; fish; flow modeling; habitat quality; habitat selection; hydrodynamics; hydroelectric power plant; hydrological regime; two-dimensional modeling; unsteady flow; Salmo trutta; Salmo trutta fario",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897478802

We find that among the considered TM atoms, the Ni, Pd and Co atoms are suitable for decorating B-doped graphene surface, which can be adsorbed stably on the surface. Our results show that the activation energies for H atom diffusion are much smaller than the previously reported values, indicating that a fast H diffusion on this proposed surface can be achieved.

In this study, we verified the metabolic effects of chronic exposure to a highly palatable diet, and determine the response to its withdrawal in adult neonatally handled and non-handled rats. Consumption of foods (standard lab chow and chocolate), body weight gain, abdominal fat deposition, plasma triglycerides, and leptin, as well as serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and cerebral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were measured during chronic chocolate exposure and after deprivation of this palatable food in female rats exposed or not to neonatal handling (10 minutes/day, 10 first days of life). Handled rats increased rebound chocolate consumption in comparison to non-handled animals after 1 week of chocolate withdrawal; these animals also decreased body weight in the first 24 hours but this effect disappeared after 7 days of withdrawal. Chocolate increased abdominal fat in nonhandled females, and this effect remained after 30 days of withdrawal; no differences in plasma leptin were seen after 7 days of withdrawal. Chocolate also increased serum BuChE activity in non-handled females, this effect was still evident after 7 days of withdrawal, but it disappeared after 30 days of withdrawal. Chocolate deprivation decreased cerebral AChE activity in both handled and non-handled animals. These findings suggest that neonatal handling modulates the preference for palatable food and induces a specific metabolic response that may be more adaptive in comparison to non-handled rats. © W.

Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4, also referred to as fasting induced adipose factor) is a secreted factor involved in regulation of lipid homeostasis and has been proposed as circulating mediator between the gut microbiota and fat storage in adipose tissue, although discordant data exist. Currently, little is known about the site and regulation of ANGPTL4 production in the intestine. Here, we show using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence that cells positive for ANGPTL4 are scattered along the epithelial layer in the human small and large intestine. ANGPTL4-positive cells exhibit typical features of EEC characterized by large ANGPTL4-positive secretory granules directed towards the basolateral side. In support, extensive overlap was observed between ANGPTL4-positive cells and cells positive for the entero-endocrine marker chromogranin A. Higher resolution images revealed that ANGPTL4 and chromogranin A are partially present in distinct intracellular vesicles. Using entero-endocrine HuTu-80 cells, ANGPTL4 secretion was shown to be induced by short chain fatty acids and reduced by bile acids. Finally, levels of ANGPTL4 in human plasma were significantly decreased following meal consumption. In conclusion, ANGPTL4 is produced by EEC in human intestine and expression may be regulated by short chain fatty acids and bile acids. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","ANGPTL4; Entero-endocrine cells; Human intestine; Short chain fatty acids","angiopoietin; angiopoietin like 4; bile acid; chromogranin A; short chain fatty acid; unclassified drug; angiopoietin; ANGPTL4 protein, human; adult; article; cell vacuole; controlled study; enteroendocrine cell; epithelium; food intake; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; large intestine; male; meal; normal human; plasma; priority journal; protein localization; protein secretion; secretory granule; small intestine; biosynthesis; cell culture; cytology; enteroendocrine cell; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; metabolism; real time polymerase chain reaction; Adult; Angiopoietins; Cells, Cultured; Enteroendocrine Cells; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897087500

The scenario with no carbon price emphasizes the relevance of coal and the sugarcane to the country's energy system. When a moderate carbon tax is applied, the least-cost option is mostly natural-gas-combined-cycle plants (CCGT) up to 2035. Then, coal-fired plants equipped with post-combustion CCS acquire importance. When higher carbon taxes are applied, all fossil-fuel thermal capacity installed after 2025 is equipped with CCS. Then, after 2040, the main choice is IGCC plants equipped with selexol CCS. Other policies, besides carbon prices, such as fiscal incentives, net metering and smart grids could also favor other options for the country, e.g. solar energy technologies.

The microstructures of MnO2/HPC nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and electron dispersive X-ray elemental mapping analysis. The 3-5nm MnO2 nanocrystals at mass loadings of 7.3-10.8wt % are homogeneously distributed onto the HPCs, and the utilization efficiency of MnO2 on specific capacitance can be enhanced to 94-96 %. By combining the ultrahigh utilization efficiency of MnO2 and the conductive and ion-transport advantages of HPCs, MnO2/HPC electrodes can achieve higher specific capacitance values (196F g-1) than those of pure carbon electrodes (60.8F g-1), and maintain their superior rate capability in neutral electrolyte solutions. The asymmetric supercapacitor consisting of a MnO2/HPC cathode and a HPC anode shows an excellent performance with energy and power densities of 15.3Wh kg-1 and 19.8kW kg-1, respectively, at a cell voltage of 2V.

Power systems after 2030 may consist largely of two low-carbon generator types: Intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (IRES) such as wind and solar PV and thermal generators such as power plants with carbon capture. Combining these two types could lead to conflicts, because IRES require more flexibility from the power system, whereas thermal generators may be relatively inflexible. In this study, we quantify the impacts of large-scale IRES on the power system and its thermal generators, and we discuss how to accurately model IRES impacts on a low-carbon power system. Wind integration studies show that the impacts of wind power on present-day power systems are sizable at penetration rates of around 20% of annual power generation: the combined reserve size increases by 8.6% (6.3-10.8%) of installed wind capacity, and wind power provides 16% (5-27%) of its capacity as firm capacity. Thermal generators are affected by a reduction in their efficiency of 4% (0-9%), and displacement of (mainly natural gas-fired) generators with the highest marginal costs. Of these impacts, only the increase in reserves incurs direct costs of 1-6€/MWhwind. These results are also indicative of the impacts of solar PV and wave power. A comprehensive power system model will be required to model the impacts of IRES in a low-carbon power system, which accounts for: a time step of &lt;1 h, detailed IRES production patterns, flexibility constraints of thermal generators and interconnection capacity. Ideally, an efficient reserve sizing methodology and novel flexibility technologies (i.e., high capacity interconnectors and electricity storage and DSM) will also be included. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Power system modeling; Renewable energy; Thermal power plants; Wind power","Carbon capture; Electric energy storage; Natural resources; Thermoelectric power plants; Wave power; Wind power; Electricity storages; Interconnection capacity; Low-carbon electricities; Power system model; Production patterns; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Thermal power plants; Hydroelectric generators",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896800989

So far, the physical mechanism of extremely high complex dielectric permittivity (with the real part up to 106) is not established convincingly. Moreover, the application area of GDR materials is currently restricted due to unacceptable losses. In this paper, the polaronic approach for elucidation the GDR in solid polar insulators is developed based on a classical Fröhlich polaron model and polaronic phase transition criteria, pioneered by Fratini and Quémerais [Eur. Phys. J. B 14, 99 (2000)]. The dielectric functions of isolated Fröhlich polarons, a polaronic Wigner crystal, a ""polaronic liquid"" and an ""electron liquid"" exhibit surprising diversity. In particular, sufficient for GDR ""dipolar"" permittivity and a moderate level of dielectric loss are expected for a ""polaronic liquid,"" while extremely high metal-like negative real part of the complex permittivity and its excessive imaginary part are customary for the ""electron liquid."" Natural explanations for so-called ""low-temperature anomalies"" in the GDR response observed in codoped nickel oxide, CaCu3Ti4O12 and other quaternary compounds as well as a realistic model for the spectra of optical conductivity and dielectric permittivity obtained from those materials in the far- and midinfrared regions at different temperatures are provided based on the proposed polaronic approach and the Fano resonance model. Furthermore, this polaronic approach provides physically transparent guidelines for the design of new GDR materials, i.e., selection of appropriate host insulators and dopants (codopants) to them, estimations of their critical concentrations and temperature ranges corresponding to a GDR with an acceptable loss level.

The majority of this paper investigates the sphere blockage ratio (β) on the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of a pebble with 14 spheres using a three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the v2̄-f turbulence model. In a previous work, this model has been validated against measured distributions of the heat transfer coefficient on the selected spheres. The measured data are obtained using the transient liquid-crystal technique. According to the simulation results, the thermal-hydraulic characteristics in the sphere array can be captured reasonably with the present CFD model, including flow stagnation, flow separation, vortex formation and anisotropic characteristics of the heat transfer on the sphere surface. Comparisons of the simulation results for the sphere arrays with different blockage ratios show that the flow and turbulent intensity distributions are similar in most regions of a sphere array, except the portions between the pebbles. The heat transfer coefficient for the upstream spheres increases slightly as the blockage ratio decreases. However, a lower heat transfer coefficient is predicted for the downstream sphere if β is less than 0.75. In addition, the heat transfer coefficient around the front of a downstream sphere would not be influenced by the upstream spheres until β≤0.75.

The surface treatment was carried out by bombarding the surface of the magnetic media with C+ ions at 350 eV followed by 90 eV using filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA). The energy and embedment depth of the impinging C+ ions were adjusted by applying an optimized bias to the substrate and simulated by a Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) code which predicted the formation of a graded atomically mixed layer at the carbon-media interface. Cross-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the formation of a 1.8 nm dense nano-layered carbon overcoat structure on the surface of the media. Despite an ~ 33% reduction in the thickness, the bi-level surface modified disk showed corrosion performance similar to that of a commercially manufactured disk with a thicker carbon overcoat of 2.7 nm. This improvement in the corrosion/oxidation resistance per unit thickness can be attributed to the formation of a dense and highly sp3 bonded carbon layer, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy.

It is found that in comparison with the pristine graphene, presence of defects significantly enhances the metal binding. Among three defects, 585 divacancy leads to the strongest binding between graphene and metal. Hydrogen adsorption is then evaluated by sequential addition of hydrogen molecules to the system. The results reveal that in comparison with other structures, 555-777 defective structure doped by Sc has the maximum capacity for hydrogen molecules. Also it is indicated that none of hydrogen molecules were dissociated during relaxation, indicating that all hydrogen molecules are accessible for reversible storage.

The mobilization of accumulated P(3HB) is associated with increased stress and starvation tolerance. However, the potential function of accumulated copolymer such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3- hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] remained unknown. In this study, Delftia acidovorans DS 17 was used to evaluate the contributions of P(3HB) and P(3HB-co-3HV) granules during simulated exogenous carbon deprivation on cell survival by transferring cells with PHAs to carbon-free mineral salt medium supplemented with 1 % (w/v) nitrogen source. By mobilizing the intracellular P(3HB) and P(3HB-co-3HV) at 11 and 40 mol% 3HV compositions, the cells survived starvation. Surprisingly, D. acidovorans containing P(3HB-co-94 mol% 3HV) also survived although the mobilization was not as effective. Similarly, recombinant Escherichia coli pGEM-T::phbCABCn (harboring the PHA biosynthesis genes of Cupriavidus necator) containing P(3HB) granules had a higher viable cell counts compared to those without P(3HB) granules but without any P(3HB) mobilization when exposed to oxidative stress by photoactivated titanium dioxide. This study provided strong evidence that enhancement of stress tolerance in PHA producers can be achieved without mobilization of the previously accumulated granules. Instead, PHA biosynthesis may improve bacterial survival via multiple mechanisms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","Delftia acidovorans; Mobilization; Oxidative stress; PHA; Titanium dioxide","Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Carbon; Cells; Cytology; Escherichia coli; Oxidative stress; Oxides; Titanium dioxide; Delftia acidovorans; Energy storage materials; Mobilization; PHA; Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate; Poly-hydroxyalkanoate; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Recombinant Escherichia coli; Granulation; copolymer; nitrogen; poly(3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate); poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); sodium chloride; titanium dioxide; unclassified drug; hydroxybutyric acid; poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; titanium; article; bacterial cell; bacterial gene; bacterial survival; carbon source; cell count; cell granule; cell motility; cell survival; cell transfer; cell viability; controlled study; Cupriavidus necator; Delftia acidovorans; environmental stress; Escherichia coli; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; oxidative stress; starvation; biosynthesis; chemistry; Delftia; drug effects; metabolism; physiological stress; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cupriavidus necator; Delftia acidovorans; Escherichia coli; Delftia; Hydroxybutyrates; Oxidative Stress; Polyesters; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Starvation; Stress, Physiological; Titanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896319714

The thermal energy storage involves a shell and tube arrangement where paraffin wax as phase change material (PCM) is filled in the shell. Water as heat transfer fluid (HTF) is passed inside the tube for both charging and discharging cycles. According to the conservation of energy, a simple numerical method called alternative iteration between thermal resistance and temperature has been developed for the analysis of heat transfer between the PCM and HTF during charging and discharging cycles. Experimental arrangement has been designed and built to examine the physical validity of the numerical results. Comparison between the numerical predictions and the experimental data shows a good agreement. A detailed parametric study is also carried out for various flow parameters and system dimensions such as different mass flow rates, inlet temperatures of HTF, tube thicknesses and radii. Numerical study reveals that the contribution of the inlet temperature of HTF has much influence than mass flow rate in terms of storage operating time and HTF outlet temperature.

Independent closed-loop torque and stator flux regulation are performed in the stator flux ( x-y) reference frame via two PI controllers. This facilitates fast torque dynamics, which is critical as far as energy charging/discharging in the FESS is concerned. As FESS applications demand high-speed operation, a new field-weakening algorithm is proposed in this paper. Flux weakening is achieved autonomously once the y-axis voltage exceeds the available inverter voltage. An inherently speed sensorless stator flux observer immune to stator resistance variations and dc-offset effects is also proposed for accurate flux and speed estimation. The proposed observer eliminates the rotary encoder, which in turn reduces the overall weight and cost of the system while improving its reliability. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme has been verified by simulations and experiments on a machine prototype. © 2013 IEEE.","Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machine; field-weakening operation; flywheel energy storage system (FESS); sensorless direct torque and flux control (DTFC)","Flywheel propulsion; Permanent magnets; Stators; Charging/discharging; Direct torque and flux control; Field-weakening; Flywheel energy storage system; High-speed operation; Permanent-magnet machine; Speed-sensor less; Stator resistance; Torque",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895930358

Following uptake by enterocytes and secretion as chylomicrons, dietary lipids are cleared from the bloodstream via lipoprotein lipase. Whereas lipoprotein lipase is inhibited by several proteins including Angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4), no endogenous regulator of pancreatic lipase has yet been identified. Here we present evidence that Angptl4 is an endogenous inhibitor of dietary lipid digestion. Angptl4-/- mice were heavier compared to their wild-type counterparts without any difference in food intake, energy expenditure or locomotor activity. However, Angptl4-/- mice showed decreased lipid content in the stools and increased accumulation of dietary triglycerides in the small intestine, which coincided with elevated luminal lipase activity in Angptl4-/. - mice.

Our previous studies reveal significant associations between promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of interleukin (IL)-4 and T2DM, as well as between SNPs in genes encoding IL-4/IL-4 receptor and high density lipoproteins. Our animal study reveals that IL-4 regulates glucose/lipid metabolism by promoting glucose tolerance and inhibiting lipid deposits. The above results strongly suggest the involvement of IL-4 in energy homeostasis. In the present study, we focus on examining the regulatory mechanism of IL-4 to lipid metabolism. Our results show that IL-4 inhibits adipogenesis by downregulating the expression of peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α. Additionally, IL-4 promotes lipolysis by enhancing the activity and translocation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) in mature adipocytes, which suggests that IL-4 plays a pro-lipolytic role in lipid metabolism by boosting HSL activity. Our results demonstrate that IL-4 harbors pro-lipolysis capacity by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation as well as by promoting lipolysis in mature adipocytes to decrease lipid deposits. The above findings uncover the novel roles of IL-4 in lipid metabolism and provide new insights into the interactions among cytokine/immune responses, insulin sensitivity, and metabolism.

Instead, we verify in experiments the electro-thermal analogy, wherein the thermal inertial is parameterized by thermal inductance that formulates hyperbolic heat-conduction. The thermal hyperbolicity exhibits a special frequency response in Bode plot, wherein the amplitude ratios is kept flat after crossing some certain frequency, as opposed to Fourier heat-conduction. We apply this specialty to design an instrument that reliably identifies thermal inductances of some materials in frequency domain. The instrument is embedded with a DSP-based frequency synthesizer capable of modulating frequencies in utmost high-resolution.

The TES system behavior was analyzed through 15 consecutive charge/discharge cycles to evaluate the thickness evolution of the thermocline zone, and hence the overall thermal efficiency of the system, under cyclic conditions. The numerical model was satisfactorily validated with experimental data, gathered from a 6.5 MWhth TES system prototype, located in Biasca, designed and built by the Swiss company Airlight Energy SA. The good agreement between CFD simulations results and experimental data allowed the authors to assess the relevance of radiative heat transfer, even at relatively low temperature (300 ÷ 350°C), on the thermodynamics behavior of the TES system.

The Minewater project is now being upgraded from a straight forward pilot system to a full-scale hybrid sustainable energy structure called Minewater 2.0. A totally new concept which becomes an essential part of the Sustainable Energy Structure Plan of Heerlen and has the following landmarks: • Energy exchange instead of energy supply: cluster grids for energy exchange between buildings and the existing mine water grid for energy exchange between cluster grids. • Energy storage and regeneration in mine water reservoirs instead of depletion. • Addition of poly-generation: bio-CHP, solar energy, feed in of waste heat (data centres and industry), cooling towers for peak cold demands. • Enlargement hydraulic and thermal capacity mine water grid through improving well pumps, pressure boosting systems and reuse of the existing mine water return pipe for additional supply and disposal of hot mine water. • Fully automatic and demand-driven supply of hot and cold mine water through usage of pressurized buffer systems at the extraction wells and sophisticated injections valves at the injection wells. • All geographically dispersed mine water installations at buildings, clusters and wells are equipped with sophisticated process control units that communicate with a Central Monitoring System (CMS) through the internet.

One important consequence of this research was the identification of the wind energy potential for wind-CAES sites. The theoretical wind energy potential of Iran of greater than 50 W/m2 was identified from a wind atlas of Iran. The model produced factor maps by considering the boundary conditions of the input data and created geo-databases from the outputs maps. The main factor maps were electrical grids and substations, gas transmission lines, a wind energy atlas, thermal power plants (location and capacity), salt dome locations and extends (for compressed air reservation), slope data, a digital elevation model, cities and residential areas, water bodies and access roads. For every data layer, criteria where developed from existing laws, regulations and scientific studies and normalized for Iran. In the final step of analysis and modeling, the factor maps were integrated by coding using ArcGIS software and the wind-CAES power plants sites were selected.

Although SWEET17 (for SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTERS17) has been characterized as a vacuolar Fru exporter in leaves, its expression in leaves is low. Here, RNA analysis and SWEET17-β-glucuronidase/-GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN fusions expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reveal that SWEET17 is highly expressed in the cortex of roots and localizes to the tonoplast of root cells. Expression of SWEET17 in roots was inducible by Fru and darkness, treatments that activate accumulation and release of vacuolar Fru, respectively. Mutation and ectopic expression of SWEET17 led to increased and decreased root growth in the presence of Fru, respectively. Overexpression of SWEET17 specifically reduced the Fru content in leaves by 80% during cold stress. These results intimate that SWEET17 functions as a Fru-specific uniporter on the root tonoplast. Vacuoles overexpressing SWEET17 showed increased [14C]Fru uptake compared with the wild type. SWEET17-mediated Fru uptake was insensitive to ATP or treatment with NH4Cl or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, indicating that SWEET17 functions as an energy-independent facilitative carrier. The Arabidopsis genome contains a close paralog of SWEET17 in clade IV, SWEET16. The predominant expression of SWEET16 in root vacuoles and reduced root growth of mutants under Fru excess indicate that SWEET16 also functions as a vacuolar transporter in roots.

The biosensor is composed of an end-to-end fusion of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), chicken metallothionein II (MT-II), and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). In vitro measurements of YFP/CFP fluorescence emission ratios indicated that the addition of metals to the purified biosensor enhanced FRET between CFP and YFP, consistent with heavy metal-induced folding of MT-II. A maximum YFP/CFP FRET ratio of 2.8 was observed in the presence of saturating concentrations of heavy metals. The sensitivity of the biosensor was greatest for Hg2+ followed by Cd2+ ≈ Pb2+ &gt; Zn2+ &gt; Cu2+. The heavy metal biosensor was unresponsive to metals that do not bind to MT-II (Na+ and Mg2+). When expressed in C. reinhardtii, we observed a differential metal-dependent response to saturating external concentrations (1.6 mM) of heavy metals (Pb2+ &gt; Cd2+) that was unlike that observed for the isolated biosensor (in vitro). Significantly, analysis of metal uptake kinetics indicated that equilibration of the cytoplasm with externally applied heavy metals occurred within seconds. Our results also indicated that algae have substantial buffering capacity for free heavy metals in their cytosol, even at high external metal concentrations. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Torrefaction can be employed to improve the properties of biomass in an oxygen-free or nitrogen atmosphere. This study investigates the product yields and the solid product characteristics from corncob waste torrefaction at the temperatures of 250 °C and 300 °C for 1 h. Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and a gas mixture of air and carbon dioxide are employed as the carrier gases. The solid product characteristics approach those of coal at the higher temperature, regardless of what the carrier gases are. The fixed carbon, higher heating value, and solid and energy yields using carbon dioxide as a carrier gas at 300 °C are close to those using nitrogen. The product safety and storage properties before and after torrefaction are revealed by the measurements of ignition temperature and hygroscopicity. A higher torrefaction temperature leads to a higher ignition temperature of treated biomass, except using the mixture of air and carbon dioxide as the carrier gas. Carbon dioxide is a better carrier gas than nitrogen for biomass torrefaction, from the storage and transportation points of view. © 2013 by the authors.","Atmosphere; Biomass and corncob waste; Hygroscopicity; Ignition temperature; Product yield; Torrefaction","Biomass; Calorific value; Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Gases; Nitrogen; Higher heating value; Hygroscopicity; Ignition temperatures; Nitrogen atmospheres; Product yields; Storage and transportations; Storage properties; Torrefaction; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893352843

The converter is designed to drive a three-phase induction motor directly from PV energy. The use of a three-phase induction motor presents a better solution to the commercial dc motor water pumping system. The development is oriented to achieve a more efficient, reliable, maintenance-free, and cheaper solution than the standard ones that use dc motors or low-voltage synchronous motors. The developed system is based on a current-fed multiresonant converter also known as resonant two-inductor boost converter (TIBC) and a full-bridge three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI). The classic topology of the TIBC has features like high voltage gain and low input current ripple. In this paper, it is further improved with the use of a nonisolated recovery snubber along with a hysteresis controller and the use of a constant duty cycle control to improve its efficiency. Experimental results show a peak efficiency of 91% at a rated power of 210 W for the dc/dc converter plus the three-phase VSI and a peak efficiency of 93.64% just for the dc/dc converter. The system is expected to have a high lifetime due to the inexistence of electrolytic capacitors, and the total cost of the converter is below 0.43 U/Wp. As a result, the system is a promising solution to be used in isolated locations and to deliver water to poor communities. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","AC motor drives; dc-ac power conversion; dc-dc power conversion; photovoltaic (PV) power systems; solar power generation","DC motors; DC-DC converters; Electrolytic capacitors; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Synchronous motors; Water treatment; AC motor drives; Constant duty cycle control; DC-AC power conversion; Dc-dc power conversion; Photovoltaic power systems; Three phase induction motor; Three-phase voltage source inverters; Two-inductor boost converter; Induction motors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893266079

The thermodynamic relationship between heat dissipation and energy storage is altered by the ingestion of high-energy diet content. Observation of thermal registers of core temperature behavior, in humans and rodents, permits identification of some characteristics of time series, such as autoreference and stationarity that fit adequately to a stochastic analysis. To identify this change, we used, for the first time, a stochastic autoregressive model, the concepts of which match those associated with physiological systems involved and applied in male HFD rats compared with their appropriate standard food intake agematched male controls (n=7 per group). By analyzing a recorded temperature time series, we were able to identify when thermal homeostasis would be affected by a new diet. The autoregressive time series model (AR model) was used to predict the occurrence of thermal homeostasis, and this model proved to be very effective in distinguishing such a physiological disorder. Thus, we infer from the results of our study that maximum entropy distribution as a means for stochastic characterization of temperature time series registers may be established as an important and early tool to aid in the diagnosis and prevention of metabolic diseases due to their ability to detect small variations in thermal profile.","Autoregressive models; High-fat diet; Metabolic disorder predictor; Thermal homeostasis; Time series temperature","animal experiment; article; controlled study; entropy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flame photometry; glucose tolerance test; homeostasis; lipid diet; magnesium blood level; male; mathematical model; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; rat; stochastic autoregressive model; systolic blood pressure; thermoregulation; algorithm; animal; biological model; caloric intake; energy metabolism; fat intake; metabolism; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; statistics; time; fat intake; Algorithms; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Male; Models, Biological; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stochastic Processes; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892988251

Sources non-systematic review of SciELO, LILACS, MEDLINE, Scopus, and VHL databases, and selection of the 52 most relevant studies. A total of 21 articles, specifically on the topic, were analyzed (nine related to type 1 diabetes and 12 to type 2 diabetes). Data synthesis the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding, as well as the early use of cow's milk, have been shown to be important risk factors for developing diabetes. It is believed that human milk contains substances that promote the maturation of the immune system, which protect against the onset of type 1 diabetes. Moreover, human milk has bioactive substances that promote satiety and energy balance, preventing excess weight gain during childhood, thus protecting against the development of type 2 diabetes. Although the above mentioned benefits have not been observed by some researchers, inaccuracies on dietary habit reports during childhood and the presence of interfering factors have been considered responsible for the lack of identification of beneficial effects. Conclusion given the scientific evidence indicated in most published studies, it is believed that the lack of breastfeeding can be a modifiable risk factor for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Strategies aiming at the promotion and support of breastfeeding should be used by trained healthcare professionals in order to prevent the onset of diabetes. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.","Blood glucose; Breast feeding; Type 1 diabetes mellitus; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","breast feeding; breast milk; child; childhood; diabetes mellitus; eating habit; energy balance; human; immune system; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; maturation; Medline; milk; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; review; risk assessment; risk factor; satiety; weight gain; artificial milk; child nutrition; diabetes mellitus; glucose blood level; insulin resistance; lipid storage; nutritional status; Review; social status; Aleitamento materno; Blood glucose; Breast feeding; Diabetes mellitus tipo 1; Diabetes mellitus tipo 2; Glicemia; Type 1 diabetes mellitus; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Animals; Breast Feeding; Cattle; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Milk; Milk, Human; Overweight; Risk Factors; Time Factors; glucose",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892810520

The TARC method was composed of moderating neutrons in lead or a composition of lead and water. Additionally, the target was surrounded by a moderator assembly and a graphite reflector district. Produced neutrons were investigated by (p,xn) interactions with 30 MeV and 300 μA proton beam on tungsten, beryllium, and tantalum targets. The 99Mo production yield was related to the moderator property, cross section, and sample positioning inside the distinct region of neutron storage as must be proper to achieve gains. Gathered thermal flux of neutrons can contribute to molybdenum isotope production. Moreover, the sample positioning to gain higher production yield was dependent on a greater flux in the length of thermal neutrons and region materials inside the moderator or reflector. When the sample radial distance from Be was 38 cm inside the graphite region using a lead moderator design, the production yield had the greatest value of activity, compared with the other regions, equal to 608.72 MBq/g. Comparison of the two designs using a Be target revealed that the maximum yield occurred inside the graphite region for the first design at 38 cm and inside the lead region for the second design at 10 cm. The results and modeling of the new neutron activator were very encouraging and seem to confirm that the TARC concept can be used for 99Mo production in nuclear medicine. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","98Mo position; Flux; Low energy proton; MCNP5; Moderator; Transmutation","beryllium; graphite; lead; molybdenum 99; tantalum; tungsten; water; adiabaticity; article; cyclotron; equipment design; neutron radiation; nuclear medicine; preservation and storage; proton radiation; radiochemistry; transmutation adiabatic resonance crossing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892748289

It not only predisposes individuals to serious chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, it is also a leading cause of premature death worldwide. Presently, there is no effective treatment against obesity, hence natural products and bioactive compounds that exhibited antiobesity effects are of intense medical interest. It is generally accepted that, at the most fundamental level, obesity results from a long-term imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. A wide variety of natural products and bioactive compounds were thus investigated for possible antiobesity effects, based on mechanisms that reduce food intake/absorption, promote energy expenditure, or prevent energy storage. However, recently, there has been a growing trend toward considering obesity as an epigenetic disease. There is also increasing evidence that epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, underlie the cause of obesity. To date, there is no review examining the antiobesity effects of natural products from an epigenetic perspective. In this chapter, we presented a current survey of the natural products and bioactive compounds that have been investigated for their antiobesity effects. We described their bioactivity, clinical data, and mechanism of actions against obesity. We further highlighted their activities against nucleic acid- and histone-modifying enzymes, providing insights into possible epigenetic mechanism underlying their antiobesity effects.

Humans living close to these wetlands express concerns about future mosquito nuisance situations, and request the necessary distance between human occupation and wetlands to avoid such problems. Wetland managers need to know the distance required, as well as the type of management needed for such buffer or barrier zones. Here we performed an extensive literature survey to collect quantitative information on mosquito flight distance and the relevant environmental conditions. Mosquitoes have an average maximum flight distance of between 50. m and 50. km, depending on the species. Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25. m and 6. km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56. m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6. km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved. Additional quantitative research is needed to better document the non-oriented dispersal patterns of the mosquitoes that populate rewetted and newly constructed wetlands, and the effects of vegetation types in barrier zones on mosquito densities. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Barrier zone; Culicidae; Dispersal; Flight distance; Migration; Mosquito; Mosquito management; Non-oriented flight; Nuisance","breeding site; constructed wetland; dispersal; environmental conditions; flight activity; mosquito; physiology; population density; population migration; preference behavior; rewetting; wetland management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892146125

Accelerated sulfur-vulcanizing systems (semi-EV and EV), peroxide, and mixed sulfur/peroxide-vulcanizing systems (semi-EV/peroxide and EV/peroxide) were observed and compared. The blends were processed on a two-roll mill, and a fixed amount of carbon black was also incorporated. Amongst the blends, accelerated sulfur-vulcanizing systems exhibited higher torques, state of cure, tensile strength and elongation-at-break, in comparison with the peroxide-vulcanizing system, whereas the tensile modulus, hardness and cross-link density showed lower trend. In the mixed sulfur/peroxide-vulcanizing systems, it showed intermediate behavior to the individual sulfur- or peroxide-vulcanizing systems. This was associated to the interference of peroxide during the cross-linking formation. SEM micrographs of semi-EV-vulcanizing system exhibited more roughness and cracking path indicating that higher energy was required towards the fractured surface. The high cross-link density observed from the swelling study could be verified from the storage modulus (E′) where peroxide vulcanized blends provided a predominant degree of cross-linking followed by semi-EV, semi-EV/peroxide, EV and EV/peroxide-vulcanizing systems, respectively. The glass transition temperature (T g) depicted at maximum peak of mechanical loss factor (tanδ max), indicating that semi-EV-vulcanizing system showed highest T g value.

The radial stress in the shell is kept compressive by integrating the electric machine, thereby avoiding delamination. Radial centering is achieved through eight active electromagnetic actuators.

Hydrogen could be produced using hydropower either alone or combined with other renewable energy sources. For this study, we analyzed two scenarios of energy availability based on data from the largest hydroelectric power plant in the country. The first scenario assumes that an amount of water equivalent to 30% of that spilled in 2011 could be used to generate additional electricity. Thus, an additional amount of energy equivalent to 5% of the energy produced in 2011 could be available. The second scenario doubles this amount of energy. Economic analysis showed that to obtain low-cost hydrogen (3.00US$/kg) it is necessary to operate the electrolysis plants 24h/day, using low-cost electricity (30US$/MWh). A continuous supply of energy could be possible when new hydroelectric utilities start operating or by integrating hydropower with solar and wind. Three possibilities for using hydrogen are discussed: 1) production of ammonia as a raw material for nitrogenous fertilizers, 2) hydro-treating heavy oils and bio-oils in oil refineries, and 3) as an energy storage medium to offset natural instability and unpredictability of renewables. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecuador; Hydrogen; Low carbon economy; Renewable energy; Smart grid","Crude oil; Economic analysis; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrogen; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Crude oil; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Environmental management; Heavy oil production; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Oil shale; Renewable energy resources; Ecuador; Electrolytic hydrogen; Low carbon economy; Low-cost electricity; Pre-feasibility studies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; cost-benefit analysis; electrokinesis; electrolyte; energy resource; heavy oil; hydroelectric power plant; hydrogen; renewable resource; data set; economic analysis; hydroelectric power; solar power; wind power; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891489965

A frequently discussed option is carbon capture and storage (CCS), where CO2 emissions from point sources are captured and stored in geologic structures. However, concerns about risks of leakages of CO2 from geological storage have been raised. These risks could be avoided with ex situ mineral carbonation, where the captured CO2 is stored in an inert and stable solid form after reacting with calcium and magnesium silicates. For a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and economic performance of this CO2 storage option in fossil-fueled power generation chains, life cycle assessment (LCA) and levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) calculations are performed. The implementation of CCS using mineral carbonation leads to life cycle GHG emission reductions of 15-64% and LCoE increases of 90-370% on a per kWhel basis compared to a reference power plant without CCS. The life cycle GHG emission reduction achievable with mineral sequestration is less substantial than with geological storage of CO2 due to significant energy and chemical additives requirements. Accordingly, LCA results for other environmental indicators are worse than those of the reference plant without CCS and the geological CO2 storage option. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Greenhouse gas emissions; Levelized cost of electricity; Life cycle assessment; Mineral carbonation; Power generation","Additives; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Climate change; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Magnesium compounds; Minerals; Power generation; Silicates; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Environmental and economic performance; European power generation; Levelized cost of electricities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; Mineral carbonation; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; risk assessment; silicate; structural geology; underground storage; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891285388

In this paper, we proposed a SEU Isolating DICE latch (Iso-DICE) design by combing the new proposed soft-error isolating technique and the inter-latching technique used in the DICE (Calin et al., 1996 [1]) design. To further enhance SEU-tolerance of DICE design, we keep the storage node pairs having the ability to recover the SEU fault occurring in each other pair but also avoid the storage node to be affected by each other. To mitigate the interference effect between dual storage node pairs, we use the isolation mechanism to resist high energy particle strikes instead of the original interlocking design method. Through isolating the output nodes and the internal circuit nodes, the Iso-DICE latch can possess more superior SEU-tolerance as compared with the DICE design (Calin et al., 1996 [1]). As compared with the FERST design (Fazeli, 2009 [2]) which performs with the same superior SEU-tolerance, the proposed Iso-DICE latch consumes 50% less power with only 45% of power delay product in TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology.

Drying of terebinth fruit was conducted to provide microbiological stability, reduce product deterioration due to chemical reactions, facilitate storage and lower transportation costs. Because terebinth fruit is susceptible to heat, the selection of a suitable drying technology is a challenging task. Artifi cial neural networks (ANNs) are used as a nonlinear mapping structures for modelling and prediction of some physical and drying properties of terebinth fruit. Material and methods. Drying characteristics of terebinth fruit with an initial moisture content of 1.16 (d.b.) was studied in an infrared fl uidized bed dryer. Different levels of air temperatures (40, 55 and 70°C), air velocities (0.93, 1.76 and 2.6 m/s) and infrared (IR) radiation powers (500, 1000 and 1500 W) were applied. In the present study, the application of Artifi cial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting the drying moisture diffusivity, energy consumption, shrinkage, drying rate and moisture ratio (output parameter for ANN modelling) was investigated. Air temperature, air velocity, IR radiation and drying time were considered as input parameters. Results. The results revealed that to predict drying rate and moisture ratio a network with the TANSIG--LOGSIG-TANSIG transfer function and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training algorithm made the most accurate predictions for the terebinth fruit drying. The best results for ANN at predications were R2 = 0.9678 for drying rate, R2 = 0.9945 for moisture ratio, R2 = 0.9857 for moisture diffusivity and R2 = 0.9893 for energy consumption. Conclusion. Results indicated that artifi cial neural network can be used as an alternative approach for modelling and predicting of terebinth fruit drying parameters with high correlation.

The cavity is filled with water (ice)-based nanofluid containing copper nanoparticles. Design/methodology/approach - This methodology eliminates the requirement of satisfying conditions at the phase change front. The combination of lattice D2Q9 and D2Q5 models is implemented to determine the density, velocity and temperature fields. The simulations are carried out for Rayleigh number of 105, various volume fractions of the nanoparticles and various positions of the cubic obstacle. Findings - The predicated results demonstrate that the use of nanoparticles leads to enhancement of thermal conductivity of nano-enhanced phase change materials in comparison with conventional PCMs. When the position of the obstacle changes from the top to the bottom of the cavity the melting rate increases 75 percent. The numerical study indicates that by increasing the solid concentration from 0 to 0.04, the heat release enhances 52.7, 41.2 and 30 percent when the obstacle is located on the top, middle and bottom sections of the cavity, respectively. It is also observed that, the employment of nanoparticles is more effective when the heat conduction dominates. Originality/value - The main unacceptable property of most PCMs is their low thermal conductivity, and hence, heat transfer enhancement using nanofluid will be useful for thermal energy storage applications.

Central CB1R antagonists, notably rimonabant, induced weight loss and improved the metabolic profile in obese individuals, but were discontinued due to psychiatric side-effects. The CB1R is also expressed peripherally, where its effects include promotion of liver fat accumulation, which consumes ATP. Type 2 diabetes in obese subjects is linked to excess liver fat, whilst there is a negative correlation between hepatic ATP content and insulin resistance. A decreased hepatic ATP/AMP ratio increases food intake by signals via the vagus nerve to the brain. The hepatic cannabinoid system is highly upregulated in obesity, and the effects of hepatic CB 1R activation include increased activity of lipogenic and gluconeogenic transcription factors. Thus, blockade of hepatic CB1Rs could contribute significantly to the weight-reducing and insulin-sensitizing effects of CB1R antagonists. Additionally, upregulation of the hepatic CB1R may contribute to chronic liver inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis from causes including obesity, alcoholism and viral hepatitis. Peripheral CB1R antagonists induce weight loss and metabolic improvements in obese rodents; however, as there is evidence that hepatic CB1Rs are predominately intracellular, due to high intrinsic clearance, many drugs may not effectively block these receptors and therefore have limited efficacy. Hepatoselective CB1R antagonists may be effective at reducing hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and bodyweight in obese, diabetic patients, with far fewer side-effects than first-generation CB1R antagonists. Additionally, such compounds may be effective in treating inflammatory liver disease, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, reducing the likelihood of disease progression to cirrhosis or cancer. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.","cannabinoid 1 receptor; diabetes; fatty liver; hepatic energy state; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; obesity","ABC transporter; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; am 6545; cannabinoid; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; endocannabinoid; fatty acid synthase; G protein coupled receptor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; ibipinabant; insulin sensitizing agent; jd 5037; leptin; liver X receptor alpha; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; multidrug resistance protein; organic anion transporter; pravastatin; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; rimonabant; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; taranabant; tm 38837; transcription factor; unclassified drug; cannabinoid 1 receptor; anxiety; appetite; article; blood brain barrier; cancer cell; clinical effectiveness; depression; diabetic obesity; diabetic patient; diffusion; disease course; drug blood level; drug brain level; drug disposition; drug efficacy; drug selectivity; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; fatty liver; feeding; food intake; gluconeogenesis; glucose homeostasis; hepatitis; human; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver; liver cancer; liver cell; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; liver metabolism; low drug dose; membrane permeability; mental disease; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; receptor occupancy; suicidal ideation; unspecified side effect; upregulation; weight reduction; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; drug effects; eating; fatty liver; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; pathophysiology; physiology; Animals; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Liver; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891109073

Due to its increasing portion of generation mix, wind farms are expected to play the role similar to the traditional power plants. Down the road toward this goal, the intermittency and uncertainty of wind are the two important factors that should be solved. Today, storage systems present a very interesting alternative to deal with the wind variability. Among various storage types, the hydrogen system is showing a promising future due to the high storage efficiency, low emissions, and wide applications. This paper presents a new coordination control scheme between the offshore wind farm and a hydrogen management system (HMS) for reducing the adverse impacts of wind variability. In the proposed scheme, the HMS is situated onshore to provide medium- to long-term energy balancing service. A supercapacitor bank is supplemented to the system for providing the short-term transient compensation. System configuration and control strategies are also presented. Simulation tests were conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control. Test results indicate that the proposed control makes the wind farm be more flexible to satisfy the grid operation. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy storage; Hydrogen system; Offshore wind farm","Coordination control; Hydrogen management; Hydrogen storage system; Hydrogen system; Renewable resource; Storage efficiency; Synergistic control; System configurations; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Offshore wind farms; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890986364

The energy from ocean waves bares tremendous potential as a source of renewable energy, and the related technologies have continually been improved during the last decades. In this paper, different types of wave energy converters are classified by their mechanical structure and how they absorb energy from ocean waves. The paper presents a review of strategies for electrical control of wave energy converters as well as energy storage techniques. Strategies of electrical control are used to achieve a higher energy absorption, and they are also of interest because of the large variety among different strategies. Furthermore, the control strategies strongly affect the complexity of both the mechanical and the electrical system, thus not only impacting energy absorption but also robustness, survivability, maintenance requirements and thus in the end the cost of electricity from ocean waves. © 2013 The Authors.","Electrical control; Energy storage; Wave energy converter; Wave power","Climate change; Electric energy storage; Energy absorption; Energy storage; Oceanography; Water waves; Wave power; Cost of electricity; Electrical control; Energy from ocean waves; Impacting energy absorption; Maintenance requirement; Mechanical structures; Renewable energy technologies; Wave energy converters; Wave energy conversion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890960637

The purpose is to time shift wind energy to maximize the expected daily profit following uncertainties in wind generation and electricity price. A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) framework is adopted to formulate this problem, and an objective function approximation method is applied to improve the SDP computational efficiency. Case studies on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas demonstrate that the resultant profits from SDP-based operation policy are considerably higher than those from deterministic policy, and comparable to those from the perfect information model. It is concluded that the presented SDP approach can provide operation policy highly adaptive to uncertainties arising from wind and price.

This may be due to a decline in soil organic matter (SOM) stability as the result of changes in the type, strength or turnover time of organo-mineral interactions with increasing organic C input. The goal of this study was to test whether the stability of organic matter bound to soil minerals decreases as organo-mineral complexes approach C saturation with increasing C loading. A series of batch sorption experiments with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soil mineral components was conducted to obtain organo-mineral complexes with a range of organic C loadings. The relative stability of C in these organo-mineral complexes was subsequently assessed using evolved CO2 gas analysis during thermal analyses and laboratory incubations. Results indicated that differences in dissolved organic C before and after sorption overestimated the amount of sorbed C when compared to differences in solid-phase C concentrations. Values of C/N, δ13C, and δ15N of the organo-mineral complexes were significantly smaller or more negative than initial soil samples or the stock DOM solution, consistent with the concept of molecular fractionation by sorption to minerals and suggesting that the composition of the organic matter in the organo-mineral complexes may have changed as the amount of sorbed organic matter increased. Observations that organic C loadings at maximum sorption did not substantially exceed 1mgCm-2 and linear rather than asymptotic relations between sorbed C and initial DOM concentrations suggest that organo-mineral complexes may not have reached C saturation under the conditions in the batch sorption experiments of this study. The temperature at which half of the CO2 evolved during thermal analysis (i.e., CO2-T50) increased with increasing C loading, suggesting the sorbed C required greater energy input for combustion. Results of the laboratory incubations to determine relative biological stability of sorbed C were not consistent with the initial hypothesis. The size of potentially mineralizable C pool relative to the total sorbed C decreased with increasing C loading, even though this pool was being degraded more rapidly. Overall, the results did not support the hypothesis that SOM stability decreases with increasing C loading. In spite of generating a wide range of C loadings substantially greater than previous studies, the conditions of the DOM sorption experiments conducted in this study appeared unable to generate organo-mineral complexes exhibiting C saturation behavior. We speculate that measurable decreases in SOM stability may occur only once the threshold of C saturation is reached. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon loading; DOM sorption; Incubation; Organo-mineral complexes; Stability; Thermal analysis","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon dioxide; Convergence of numerical methods; Soils; Sorption; Stability; Thermoanalysis; Carbon loadings; Dissolved organic matters; Incubation; Mineral interactions; Molecular fractionation; Organo-mineral complexes; Soil organic matters; Sorption experiments; Organic minerals; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolved organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; sorption; thermal alteration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890825260

To mitigate its impacts, particularly on a weak electricity network, a battery energy storage (BES) system can be used to smooth out and dispatch the output to the utility grid on an hourly basis. This paper presents an optimal control strategy of BES state-of-charge feedback (SOC-FB) control scheme used for output power dispatch of PV farm. The SOC-FB control parameters are optimized by using heuristic optimization techniques such as genetic algorithm (GA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in Matlab. In addition, an improved BES model is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC software package, in which GA is used to evaluate the optimal parameters. The studied multi-objective optimization problem also considers the evaluation of the optimal size of the BES. The performance of the proposed optimal SOC-FB control scheme is validated by comparing the results obtained from Matlab and PSCAD/EMTDC and with results from previous works. Finally, the best set of parameters are used to further validate the proposed method by using data obtained from the actual output of a grid-connected PV system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Very limited knowledge is available on the potential mechanism(s) of metal reduction among Gram-positive bacteria, despite their preponderance in the microbial communities that inhabit some inhospitable environments (e.g., thermal or hyperthermal ecosystems, extreme pH or salinity environments, heavy metal or radionuclide contaminated sediments). Here, we show that in the presence of pyruvate, this micro-organism is capable of reducing both soluble Fe(III)-citrate and solid-phase hydrous ferric oxide, although growth is sustained by pyruvate fermentation rather than Fe(III) respiration. Despite the fact that Fe(III) reduction does not support direct energy conservation, D. reducens uses it as a complementary means of discarding excess reducing equivalent after H2 accumulation in the culture headspace renders proton reduction unfavorable. Thus, Fe(III) reduction permits the oxidation of greater amounts of pyruvate than fermentation alone. Fe(III) reduction by D. reducens is mediated by a soluble electron carrier, most likely riboflavin. Additionally, an intracellular electron storage molecule acts as a capacitor and accumulates electrons during pyruvate oxidation for slow release to Fe(III). The reductase responsible for the transfer of electrons from the capacitor to the soluble carrier has not been identified, but data presented here argue against the involvement of c-type cytochromes. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",,"fermentation; heavy metal; metal; oxidation; pH; radionuclide; reduction; salinity; strain; sulfate-reducing bacterium; ferric ion; hydrogen; iron; pyruvic acid; article; Desulfotomaculum; fermentation; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Desulfotomaculum; Fermentation; Ferric Compounds; Hydrogen; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Pyruvic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890240669

Methods: IUGR was induced by maternal food restriction. The offspring (males and females) were assigned to: REF (non-IUGR, no mixture), IUGRc (IUGR, no mixture), or IUGRmx (IUGR, mixture). The mixture was given from day 7 to day 58, when tissues and plasma from half of the animals were collected for hormones, metabolites and microarray analysis. The rest received a high-fat diet (HFD) until day 100. Glucose tolerance was measured at 56 and 98 days, and body fat content at 21, 52 and 97 days. Results: IUGRmx had the greatest growth during lactation, but from day 22 to day 54, both IUGR groups gained less body weight than the REF (P < 0.05). In the short-term (58 days), IUGRmx tended to be longer (P = 0.06) and had less body fat (P = 0.03) than IUGRc. These differences were not seen after HFD. Microarray analysis of hepatic mRNA expression at 58 and 100 days revealed a gender-dependent treatment effect, and expression of genes related to lipid metabolism was the most affected. Twelve of these genes were selected for studying differences in DNA methylation in the promoter region, for some, we observed age- and gender-related differences but none because of treatment. Conclusion: The nutritional intervention promoted catch-up growth and normalized excessive adiposity in IUGR animals at short-term. The benefits did not extend after a period of HFD. IUGR and early diet had gender-dependent effects on hepatic gene expression. © 2013 Scandinavian Physiological Society.","Early growth; Intrauterine growth restriction; Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; Prebiotic; Probiotic","arachidonic acid; cholesterol; cytochrome P450 2C11; cytochrome P450 3A2; docosahexaenoic acid; fatty acid; hormone; leptin; messenger RNA; oligosaccharide; polyunsaturated fatty acid; somatomedin C; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body fat; body weight; bone length; catch up growth; controlled study; diet restriction; DNA methylation; energy metabolism; fat content; female; gene expression; glucose tolerance; intrauterine growth retardation; lactation; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; microarray analysis; milk; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; progeny; promoter region; rat; sex difference; triacylglycerol blood level; weight gain; early growth; intrauterine growth restriction; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; prebiotic; probiotic; Adiposity; Animals; Body Size; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Male; Milk; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890194746

The mechanisms by which diet-induced obesity leads to cardiac injury are not completely understood, but it is known that obesity is associated to impaired cardiac function and energy metabolism, increasing morbidity and mortality. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying cardiac metabolism impairment related to Western diet-induced obesity. After weaning, male Swiss mice were fed a Western diet for 16 weeks in order to induce obesity. After this period, the content of proteins involved in heart energy metabolism GLUT1, cytosolic lysate and plasma membrane GLUT4, AMPK, pAMPK, IRβ, IRS-1, PGC-1α, CPT1 and UCP2 was evaluated. Also, the oxidative phosphorylation of myocardial fibers was measured by high-resolution respirometry. Mice in the Western diet group (WG) presented altered biometric parameters compared to those in control group, including higher body weight, increased myocardial lipid deposition and glucose intolerance, which demonstrate the obesogenic role of Western diet. WG presented increased CPT1 and UCP2 contents and decreased IRS-1, plasma membrane GLUT4 and PGC-1α contents. In addition, WG presented cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced biogenesis, demonstrating a lower capacity of carbohydrates and fatty acid oxidation and also decreased coupling between oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cardiac metabolism impairment related to Western diet-induced obesity is probably due to damaged myocardial oxidative capacity, reduced mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondria uncoupling, which compromise the bioenergetic metabolism of heart. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Diet-induced obesity; Mitochondrial bioenergetics; Mitochondrial biogenesis; Mitochondrial impairment; Western diet","adenosine triphosphate; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; glucose; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 4; insulin; insulin receptor substrate 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; uncoupling protein 2; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; biogenesis; biometry; carbohydrate metabolism; cell lysate; cell membrane; controlled study; diet; diet restriction; energy metabolism; enzyme synthesis; epididymis fat; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; glucose intolerance; glucose transport; heart disease; heart mitochondrion; heart muscle cell; heart muscle metabolism; heart ventricle hypertrophy; lipid storage; male; metabolic disorder; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative coupling; oxidative phosphorylation; protein content; protein metabolism; respirometry; retroperitoneal fat; weaning; weight gain; Western diet; Diet-induced obesity; Mitochondrial bioenergetics; Mitochondrial biogenesis; Mitochondrial impairment; Western diet; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Glucose Tolerance Test; Glucose Transporter Type 1; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Heart; Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins; Ion Channels; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice; Mice, Obese; Mitochondria, Heart; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mitochondrial Turnover; Myocardium; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Transcription Factors; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889571154

The sintered samples show a perovskite crystal structure without impurity phases and have a rather compact interior, making them suitable for use as a fuel cell electrolyte.

The technique is well established, and there are approximately 50 facilities in Switzerland, many of which have been successfully using this technique for years. The planning of new facilities requires predictions of the effect of heat recovery on the wastewater temperature in the sewer because altered wastewater temperatures may cause problems for the biological processes used in wastewater treatment plants and receiving waters. A mathematical model is presented that calculates the discharge in a sewer conduit and the spatial profiles and dynamics of the temperature in the wastewater, sewer headspace, pipe, and surrounding soil. The model was implemented in the simulation program TEMPEST and was used to evaluate measured time series of discharge and temperatures. It was found that the model adequately reproduces the measured data and that the temperature and thermal conductivity of the soil and the distance between the sewer pipe and undisturbed soil are the most sensitive model parameters. The temporary storage of heat in the pipe wall and the exchange of heat between wastewater and the pipe wall are the most important processes for heat transfer.

The system consists of a dual purpose flat solar collector and a vertical water storage tank. Water and air have natural and forced convection in the collector, respectively. The reason why dual purpose systems are used is to achieve greater efficiency and lower heat dissipation. Furthermore, high temperature and high performance can be obtained using this solar collector. These systems can be used to heat water and air simultaneously or separately. The hot water can be utilized for domestic applications or as a PCM material for heating air through the night. Besides, the hot air can be used in air conditioning systems, industrial processes and dryers. Therefore, using these collectors brings high energy savings. Absorber plate temperature variation, storage tank average temperature, system efficiency and air velocity effects are presented. Moreover, hourly efficiency is compared for single purpose and dual purpose systems. The results indicate that the efficiency of the dual purpose system is 3 to 5% higher than a single purpose system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, its therapeutic benefits are partly outweighed by significant weight gain and other metabolic side effects, which increase the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Because olanzapine remains superior to other antipsychotic drugs that show less weight gain liability, insight into the mechanisms responsible for olanzapine-induced weight gain is crucial if it is to be effectively addressed. Over the past few decades, several groups have investigated the effects of olanzapine on energy balance using rat models. Unfortunately, results from different studies have not always been consistent and it remains to be determined which paradigms should be used in order to model olanzapine-induced weight gain most accurately. This review summarizes the effects of olanzapine on energy balance observed in different rat models and discusses some of the factors that appear to contribute to the inconsistencies in observed effects. In addition it compares the effects reported in rats with clinical findings to determine the predictive validity of different paradigms. © 2013 CINP.","Antipsychotic; energy balance; olanzapine; rat models; weight gain","agouti related protein; amino acid; cholecystokinin; estrogen; fatty acid; ghrelin; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; histamine H1 receptor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; leptin; olanzapine; peptide YY; testosterone; benzodiazepine derivative; olanzapine; anorexia; basal metabolic rate; body composition; body fat; body temperature; body weight; brain metabolism; cognition; dose response; drug half life; emotion; energy balance; environmental factor; exercise; experimental model; fat intake; feeding behavior; food intake; food preference; genetic variability; human; human versus animal comparison; lipid storage; locomotion; meal; motivation; nonhuman; outcome assessment; physical activity; predictive validity; priority journal; rat; rat strain; resting energy expenditure; review; reward; satiety; sedentary lifestyle; stomach distension; thermogenesis; weight gain; animal; biological model; caloric intake; disease model; drug effects; energy metabolism; predictive value; weight gain; Animals; Benzodiazepines; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Models, Biological; Predictive Value of Tests; Rats; Weight Gain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888604282

The impacts are greatest when large amounts of nutrient-rich slurry from livestock production cannot be adequately utilised on adjacent land. To facilitate nutrient redistribution, a range of different technologies are available. This study comprised a life cycle assessment of the environmental impacts from handling 1000. kg of pig slurry ex-animal. Application of untreated pig slurry onto adjacent land was compared with using four different treatment technologies to enable nutrient redistribution before land application: (a) separation by mechanical screw press, (b) screw press separation with composting of the solid fraction, (c) separation by decanter centrifuge, and (d) decanter centrifuge separation with ammonia stripping of the liquid fraction. Emissions were determined based on a combination of values derived from the literature and simulations with the Farm-N model for Danish agricultural and climatic conditions. The environmental impact categories assessed were climate change, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, natural resource use, and soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus storage. In all separation scenarios, the liquid fraction was applied to land on the pig-producing (donor) farm and the solid fraction transported to a recipient farm and utilised for crop production. Separation, especially by centrifuge, was found to result in a lower environmental impact potential than application of untreated slurry to adjacent land. Composting and ammonia stripping either slightly increased or slightly decreased the environmental impact potential, depending on the impact category considered. The relative ranking of scenarios did not change after a sensitivity analysis in which coefficients for field emissions of nitrous oxide, ammonia and phosphorus were varied within the range cited in the literature. Therefore, the best technology to implement in a given situation depends on the environmental problem in question, local policy, cost and practicality. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonia stripping; Composting; Life cycle assessment; Nutrient redistribution; Pig slurry; Slurry separation","ammonia; carbon; fossil fuel; natural gas; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; petroleum; phosphate; phosphorus; trace element; ammonia; climate change; composting; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; nutrient dynamics; pig; slurry; waste treatment; agricultural slurry; article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; cleaning; climate change; compost; composting; controlled study; Denmark; eutrophication; field emission; fossil energy; leaching; life cycle assessment; nitrous oxide emission; nutrient; soil acidification; swine; waste management; Denmark; Animalia; Suidae; Ammonia stripping; Composting; Life cycle assessment; Nutrient redistribution; Pig slurry; Slurry separation; Animals; Denmark; Environment; Sus scrofa; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888396298

The BES has several benefits and advantages in the MG-based applications such as short term power supply, power quality improvement, facilitating integration of RES, ancillary service and arbitrage. This paper presents the cost-based formulation to determine the optimal size of the BES in the operation management of MG. Also, some restrictions, i.e. power capacity of Distributed Generators (DGs), power and energy capacity of BES, charge/discharge efficiency of BES, operating reserve and load demand satisfaction should be considered as well. The suggested problem is a complicated optimization problem, the complexity of which is increased by considering the above constraints. Therefore, a robust and strong optimization algorithm is required to solve it. Herein, this paper proposes a new evolutionary technique named improved bat algorithm that is used for developing corrective strategies and to perform least cost dispatches. The performance of the approach is evaluated by one grid-connected low voltage MG where the optimal size of BES is determined professionally. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The model employs evolutionary algorithms to assess the optimal performance and cost of the power plant. To define the trade-offs required for maximizing gains and minimizing costs (and to identify 'optimal' hybridization schemes), two conflicting objectives were considered, namely, minimum required investment and maximum net present value (NPV). Optimization was performed for various feed-in tariff (FIT) regimes, with tariff levels that were either fixed or that varied with electricity pool prices. It was found that for the given combined-cycle power plant design, only small annual solar shares (∼1.2% annual share, 4% of installed capacity) could be achieved by retrofitting. The integrated solar combined-cycle design has optimal thermal storage capacities that are several times smaller than those of the corresponding solar-only design. Even with strong incentives to shift the load to periods in which the prices are higher, investment in storage capacity was not promoted. Nevertheless, the levelized costs of the additional solar-generated electricity are as low as 10 c€/kWh, compared to the 17-19 c€/kWh achieved for a reference, nonhybridized, ""solar-only"" concentrating solar power plant optimized with the same tools and cost dataset. The main reasons for the lower cost of the integrated solar combined-cycle power plant are improved solar-to-electric efficiency and the lower level of required investment in the steam cycle. The retrofitting of combined-cycle gas turbine plants to integrated solar combined-cycle plants with parabolic troughs represents a viable option to achieve relatively low-cost capacity expansion and strong knowledge building regarding concentrating solar power.

Increasing energy expenditure by inducing lipolysis followed by fat oxidation is one of the alternatives which could help to reverse this increasingly widespread condition. Currently, there is no approved drug targeting on stimulation of energy expenditure available. The use of herbal medicines has become a preferred alternative, supported by the classical consensus on the innocuity of herbal medicine vs synthetic drugs, something that often lacks a scientific basis (ban on Ephedra, for example). The inclusion of functional food in the daily diet has also been promoted although its efficacy requires further investigation.

The progressively stringent worldwide emission legislation and increasing greenhouse gas emission require significant research effort on alternative fuels. Therefore, biodiesels are becoming important increasingly due to its ease in adaptation, environmental benefits and prospect in energy security. Biodiesel derived from vegetable oils, waste cooking oils and animal fats are long chain fatty acid alkyl esters, which contains unsaturated portions that are susceptible to oxidation. Biodiesel oxidation is a complex process having a number of mechanisms involved. Autoxidation radical chain reactions are the primary cause of biodiesel degradation that leads to formation of hydroperoxide, which, after that decompose to form an array of secondary oxidation products like aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, oligomers, gum, sediment etc. Antioxidants are often used to inhibit biodiesel oxidative degradation. The present review attempts to cover the inhibition action of natural and synthetic antioxidants, methods used to analyze biodiesel oxidation and their effect on biodiesel derived from various feedstocks. Phenolic antioxidants are more effective compared to amine antioxidants. Pyrogallol is found to be the most effective antioxidant to improve the oxidation stability in case of almost all biodiesels reviewed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a printable micro-supercapacitor (MSC) device was designed and fabricated wherein a novel three dimensional (3D) nanocomposite consisting of cobalt oxide (CoO) nanoflowers woven with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks were used as the active material. The CoO/CNT nanocomposites were synthesized via a high-throughput hydrothermal method. High capacitance of 17.4F/cm3 and energy density of ~3.48mWh/cm3 were achieved for the CoO/CNT MSC at a current density of 0.25A/cm3. The high volumetric energy density is attributed to the widened operation voltage window ranging from 0 to 1.2V. Moreover, the printed CoO/CNT MSCs also showed remarkable cycling stability with ~85% energy density retention after 1700 cycles and high mechanical flexibility which can function well even after bending up to 180°. As a result, the printed CoO/CNT MSC is a possible contender in future energy storage devices for low-cost on-chip power applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cobalt oxide; Flexible; High energy density; Microsupercapacitor; Screen printing","Cobalt oxides; Flexible; High energy densities; Hydrothermal methods; Mechanical flexibility; Micro supercapacitors; Power applications; Volumetric energy densities; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Nanocomposites; Nanoflowers; Screen printing; Three dimensional; Weaving; Capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887272478

Usually, LiMPO4 can be synthesized via solid phase thermal (SPT) route, which is considered as a crucial process for improving the crystallinity of LiMPO4. However, in the conventional SPT process, e.g., common calcination, energy is generally transferred through heat convection, heat conduction and heat radiation from the surfaces to inners, which entail prolonged exposure to high calcination temperature (e.g. 700°C for 12h). Different from the heat treatment route of calcinaiton, microwave irradiation can provide ""inert and instant heating"" of LiMPO4 precursors and synthesize even crystallite LiMPO4 cathode materials. This microwave-assisted SPT (MW-SPT) method is not only energy- and time-saving (e.g., 700W, 4min), but also exhibits superiority in optimizing physical characters, improving Li-ion diffusion kinetics and enhancing high rate performance. Furthermore, the microwave-assisted liquid phase thermal (MW-LPT) method has been also employed to prepare LiMPO4 cathode materials. Recently, both MW-SPT and MW-LPT routes have led to increased interest in the development of LiMPO4 cathode materials and processing capabilities to enable high electrochemical performance. In this review, we focus on the LiMPO4 cathode materials synthesized by microwave irradiation assisted synthesis (MIAS) route, which conclude mainly two parts, MW-SPT and MW-LPT routes. The major goal is to highlight the reaction mechanism and current developments of LiMPO4 synthesized via MW-SPT and MW-LPT methods. The structural, morphological and electrochemical performance of LiMPO4 cathode materials prepared by MIAS has also been discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cathode materials; Energy storage; Lithium ion batteries; Microwave irradiation","Calcination temperature; Cath-ode materials; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; High-rate performance; Lithium-ion battery; Processing capability; Reaction mechanism; Calcination; Energy storage; Heat radiation; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Manganese; Microwave irradiation; Nickel; Olivine; Synthesis (chemical); Cathodes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887173069

This proposed secondary-modulation technique naturally clamps the voltage across the primary-side devices with zero-current commutation, eliminating the necessity for active-clamp circuit or passive snubbers. Switching losses are reduced significantly owing to zero-current switching of primary-side devices and zero-voltage switching of secondary-side devices. Soft switching and voltage clamping are inherent and load independent. The voltage across primary-side devices is independent of duty cycle with varying input voltage and output power and clamped at rather low reflected output voltage, enabling the use of semiconductor devices of low voltage rating. These merits make the converter promising for fuel cell vehicles application, front-end dc/dc power conversion for fuel cell inverters, and energy storage.

Three different alternatives were analyzed in this aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES), including: using ATES for cooling alone, for cooling and heating, as a heat pump, and for heating alone, employing flat plate solar energy collectors. A numerical simulation, based on the finite difference method, was carried out for velocity and temperature distributions as well as the heat transfer in the aquifer.

To perform the mentioned idea, a PV burp charge system (PV-BCS) proposed is to make PV energy pump continuous with optimum maximum power point tracking (MPPT), which increases the PV utilization, and to dispatch the remaining PV energy for further storage in the pulse break period. A smart charging management (CM) presents three kinds of charge statuses, a burp pulse (BP) charge and two pulse charges, which charges three batteries, Bm, B1, and B2 concurrently and individually. The two pulse charges provided are for accompanying the BP charge in order to keep the PV energy supply continuous and cherish the remaining energy for further storage. The BP charge for Bm is composed of a positive pulse (PP) charge in a positive burp pulse (PBP) period and negative pulse (NP) charge in non-PBP period. The other two batteries B1 and B2 are always with PP charge in the non-PBP period, in which B1 charges the remaining PV energy to keep the PV energy supply continuous, realizing the energy treasuring concept; B2 charges the discharge amount from Bm by intensely discharging, which indeed is equivalent to the NP charge, achieving the energy recovery concept. A laboratory prototype, 250-W PV-BCS, with elaborated simulation and experiment demonstrates the proposed concurrent charging idea, which is feasible for conceiving an energy-saving concept, especially applicable in a large-scale energy management for such as battery exchange station to electric vehicle service. In addition, the PV-BCS can be further as a hybrid charger for renewable energy application if additional renewable energy is mixed with the PV energy, such as wind energy. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery chargers; battery storage plants; photovoltaic (PV) power systems","Battery chargers; Battery storage plants; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic power systems; Remaining energies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy applications; Charging (batteries); Energy conservation; Photovoltaic cells; Wind power; Optical pumping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886714025

Among the different types of thermal energy storage, a phase change material (PCM) thermal energy storage exhibits superior efficiency and dependability due to its high storage capacity and nearly constant thermal energy. The present work experimentally investigates the use of a triplex tube heat exchanger with internal-external fins as thermal energy storage. The experiment examined the PCM charging process under steady and non-steady heat transfer fluid (HTF) inlet temperature and the influence of the mass flow rates on the PCM melting. The PCM solidification process under different mass flow rates was also investigated, and the PCM temperature gradients in the radial and angular directions were analyzed. The results indicated that the HTF inlet temperature has more influence on the PCM melting process than the HTF mass flow rate.

The finite volume method is used to discretize the system of equations and the associated boundary and initial conditions. A computer program was elaborated and the time and space grids were optimized to make the numerical solution insensitive to the grid size.

Despite its high costs, utilizing energy storage resources such as batteries is inevitable in the smoothing process of wind power fluctuations. In a wind power plant, the place where batteries are located has considerable direct effect on their required capacity and thus on the initial investment cost. Therefore, in this paper a suitable configuration which significantly reduces the batteries investment cost is proposed and then the wind power fluctuation of a large wind power plant connected to a smart distribution grid is smoothed. Additionally, existing configurations for installing batteries in large wind power plants are investigated. The proposed configuration utilizes smart parks as aggregated storage resources in load side and an aggregated battery energy storage system with limited capacity in plant side as well. Therefore, in addition to accurate smoothing of wind power fluctuations, the energy storage investment cost is reduced significantly utilizing the proposed configuration. Simulation studies in MATLAB software package are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed approach. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Large wind power plants; Smart parks; Wind power fluctuation","Battery energy storage systems; MATLAB software package; Optimum configurations; Power fluctuations; Simulation studies; Smart distribution grids; Smoothing process; Wind power capacity; Aggregates; Cost reduction; Energy storage; Investments; MATLAB; Reactive power; System stability; Wind power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884543482

In Alzheimer's disease, the capture of glucose by cells is impaired, which negatively affects the Krebs cycle, leading to problems with the generation of phosphocreatine. Furthermore, the creatine-phosphocreatine system, regulated by creatine kinase, is affected in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Aluminum ions are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Al(III) decreases cell viability and increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane, profoundly altering cell morphology. In this study, one of the complexes formed by Al(III) and phosphocreatine in aqueous solution was investigated by potentiometry, 31P and 27Al NMR, Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The log KAlPCr value was 11.37 ± 0.03. Phosphocreatine should act as a tridentate ligand in this complex. The 27Al NMR peak at 48.92 ppm indicated a tetrahedral molecule. The fourth position in the arrangement was occupied by a coordinated water molecule. Raman spectroscopy, 31P NMR and DFT calculations (DFT:B3LYP/6-311++G**) indicated that the donor atoms are oxygen in the phosphate group, the nitrogen of the guanidine group and the oxygen of the carboxylate group.

With such energy geostructures, it is possible to transfer energy from the ground to buildings by means of fluid-filled pipes cast in concrete. By injecting thermal energy in summer and extracting it in winter, the ground in the area of a building's piles can be used for seasonal energy storage, as long as the underground water flow in the storage remains low. This paper is a contribution to the improvement of the knowledge in the field of energy geostructures. The behaviour of a multi-pile seasonal storage system subjected to thermo-mechanical loading is examined numerically from both thermal and mechanical perspectives. The purpose of this paper is (i) to propose a thermo-hydro-mechanical 2D solution to the 3D problem, (ii) to explore the thermal behaviour of this type of storage and (iii) to evaluate its structural consequences. Coupled multi-physical finite element modelling is conducted. The efficiency of the storage is not dramatically affected by an increase in the annual mean temperature of the storage. It is shown that induced mechanical loads are less important when considering a wholly heated pile structure than when considering a single heated pile in a foundation. The evolution of stresses in the piles and in the soil during heating-cooling cycles also reveals possible critical phenomena. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy piles; Ground heat storage; Pile foundation; THM analysis","Annual mean temperatures; Energy piles; Finite element modelling; Ground heat storage; Seasonal energy storages; Thermo-mechanical loading; THM analysis; Underground water flow; Concretes; Groundwater; Heat storage; Pile foundations; Piles; finite element method; foundation; heat transfer; loading; numerical model; pile; stress; thermohydromechanics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883500833

The proposed stochastic framework would concurrently consider the uncertainties of load forecast error, Wind Turbine (WT) generation, Photovoltaic (PV) generation and market price. The proposed stochastic method consists of two main phases. In the first phase, by the use of Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of each uncertain variable and roulette wheel mechanism, several scenarios are generated. Now by the use of scenario reduction process, the most probable and dissimilar scenarios are selected. By means of this strategy, the stochastic problem is converted to a number of deterministic problems with different probabilities. In this regard, the Weibull and normal PDFs are utilized to model the stochastic random variables. In the second phase, a new optimization strategy based on Adaptive Modified Firefly Algorithm (AMFA) is employed to solve each of the deterministic problems generated in the first phase. The stochastic optimization problem is investigated while meeting different equality and equality constraints. In order to see the efficiency and satisfying performance of the proposed method, a typical grid-connected MG including WT/PV/Micro-Turbine/Fuel Cell and Energy Storage Devices is studied as the test system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The increased demand in energy consumption due to economic growth requires additional energy supply and generation which would subsequently increase the carbon emissions. Nevertheless, most countries are now committed to reduce carbon emission to achieve long term sustainability goals. However, the development of alternative energy sources or carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives for power plants entails major capital investments. This paper demonstrates how these issues may be handled using CCEP with insight- and optimisation-based targeting techniques for multi-period scenarios. Both approaches were developed recently for CCEP problems, but previous techniques were limited to single-period planning. The extensions to multi-period scenarios are demonstrated in this work with hypothetical illustrative examples, as well as a Malaysian case study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Energy sector planning; Process integration","Carbon capture; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Investments; Alternative energy source; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon sequestration; Emission reduction; Energy sector planning; Long-term sustainability; Low-carbon technologies; Process integration; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; economic growth; energy planning; energy use; environmental planning; investment; optimization; power generation; sustainability; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882979797

In the basic form, it allows such changes to be decomposed to give contributions associated with three different effects, namely activity, structure and intensity effects. In the literature, IDA studies on the residential sector, unlike those on industry and transport, show large variations in the choice of the activity indicator that drive energy consumption. Such variations greatly affect the decomposition results obtained and what these results capture.

A Microgrid is assumed to be portion of a low voltage distribution feeder including sources such as microturbine, diesel generator, fuel cell and photovoltaic system with slow response for frequency control. A BESS due to its very fast dynamic response can play an important role in restoring balance between supply and demand. In this paper, overloading capacity of the BESS is employed for fast handling of the primary frequency control of a MG. To achieve this purpose, by considering overloading characteristics and limitations of the state of charge (SOC) of battery, a control scheme of dc/ac converter for the BESS is developed. Based on this scheme, overloading capacity of the BESS and its permissible duration for participating in primary frequency control is determined. Simulation studies are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC software package to evaluate the performance of the proposed control scheme. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, this electrolyte is promising for high-energy, high-power, and high-safety supercapacitor applications. The addition of 0.01 M LiTFSI in the IL improves the oxide capacitance from 90 F g-1 to 120 F g-1, which is due to the incorporated Li+ ions promoting Mn valent state variation (between trivalent and tetravalent) during charge-discharge. However, excessive LiTFSI doping causes a capacitance decay due to reduced electrolyte ionic conductivity. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the energy storage mechanism. A capacitance activation process of α-MnO2 in the Li+-doped BMP-DCA IL is found. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The positive terminal of the solar cell array can be directly connected to the ground to avoid unexpected degradation of the special thin-film solar cell array. The proposed PGPGS consists of a solar cell array, two DC-DC power converters, a battery set, a switch set and a three-port power converter. The three-port power converter comprises a high-voltage DC port, a low-voltage DC port and an AC port. The solar cell array is connected to the high-voltage DC port through two DC-DC power converters whose positive terminal is directly connected to the ground. The battery set is connected to the low-voltage DC port, and the AC port is connected to the utility. No transformer is required in this PGPGS even when using the low-voltage battery set. A prototype is developed and tested to verify the performance of the PGPGS. The experimental results show that the proposed power converter has the expected performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By using submodules equipped with dc-capacitors excellent output voltage waveforms can be obtained at low switching frequencies. The rated energy storage of the submodule capacitors is a driving factor of the size, cost, and weight of the submodules. Although the modular multilevel converter has been thoroughly investigated in the literature, a more detailed analysis of the energy-storage requirements will provide an important contribution for dimensioning and analysis of modular multilevel converters. Such an analysis is presented in this paper. The analysis relates the power transfer capability to the stored energy in the converter and the findings are validated by both simulations and experimental results. The required size of the submodule capacitors in a 4.5$\,$ MW grid-connected converter is first calculated and the calculated operating range is then compared with simulation results. The experimental results show that if the average capacitor voltage is allowed to increase 10% above the nominal value an energy storage to power transfer ratio of 21 $\,$J/kW can be achieved. It is concluded that the presented theory can relate the power transfer capability to the energy storage in the converter and is thus a valuable tool in the design and analysis of modular multilevel converters. © 2013 IEEE.","AC-DC power converters; energy storage; HVDC transmission","AC-DC power converters; Grid-connected converters; High power applications; HVDC transmission; Low switching frequency; Modular multilevel converters; Power transfer capability; Storage requirements; Capacitors; Electric converters; Energy storage; HVDC power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880863213
