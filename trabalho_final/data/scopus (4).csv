Ecto-ATPase activity can be stimulated independently and to a similar extent by either Ca-2+ or Mg-2+ Apparent Km-values for ATP are 79 μM and 53 μM for Ca-2+ and Mg-2+ respectively. Apparent Km-values for Ca-2+ and Mg-2+ at 1 mM ATP are 0.71 mM and 0.61 mM respectively. The enzyme is also activated by Mn-2+ and GTP can replace ATP as a substrate. Presence of 5′-nucleotidase activity suggests that adenosine is the final hydrolysis product. Thus hydrolysis of nucleotides released during exocytosis of synaptic vesicle contents and purine salvage may be a major role of this ecto-enzyme. We furthermore suggest that the ecto-ATPase may provide the key to understanding the storage of the high energy compound ATP in cholinergic synaptic vesicles. On depolarization of the nerve terminal and exocytosis, ATP represents the signal for activating the ATPase whereby concentrations of Ca-2+ and Mg-2+ are already saturating. Following depolarization induced Ca-2+ influx, a possible function of the ATPase may be the outward transport of Ca-2+ from the nerve terminal. © 1983.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; calcium; animal cell; cholinergic nerve; electric organ; invertebrate; nerve ending; nervous system; nonhuman; synaptosome; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Animal; Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase; Ca(2+)-Transporting ATPase; Electric Organ; Glycerophosphates; Guanosine Triphosphate; Hydrolysis; In Vitro; Kinetics; Receptors, Cholinergic; Synaptosomes; Torpedo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021070507

In this sector, storage can make a considerable contribution to energy savings by levelling out the discrepancy between energy available and need. Often the larger quantities of available energy have low temperature, i.e. have a low energy density. The un derground has great potential for economical storage of large volumes of low energy density and for substituting prime energy with ""new energy"" extracted from the near subsurface. This has been increasingly recognized and confirmed in recent years in the Swedish Energy Programme, which has several hundred projects for research and development with connection to the ground and energy. Examples of most important underground storage concepts are reviewed in the paper. Limiting factors and potentials are briefly discussed. The paper concludes that underground storage is technically well suited for small systems for single houses and for incorporation into large district heating systems. In connection with the increasing number of heat pumps now being introduced in Sweden (including very large ones of 10-15 MW), subsurface systems are expected to contribute up to 10% of the Swedish energy supply for heating before the end of the 1980s. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049127940

The use of underground space has become more attractive with the increasingly intensive use of the land surface and rising land values in developed countries. It enables multiple use of the land and it can produce significant energy savings because of the insulating effect of the ground itself. Large caverns have been mined for storage in a number of countries but there is as yet little experience in the UK. Because of its interests in the fields of land use, conservation and pollution control, the Department of the Environment sought to inform itself on an area of possible future policy interest by determining the advantages, disadvantages, potential and implications of underground cavern storage in the UK. Therefore, in November 1981, the Department commissioned Dames & Moore to undertake research on the use of underground caverns for storage and disposal. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049123053

A latent heat storage section with high storage capacity at moderate operating temperatures. Additional advantageous characteristics: the maintenance costs are negligible, and the performance is highly insensitive to inadequate control of the system by the inhabitants. A first global design of the system showed significantly higher predicted gains than a conventional storage wall at however still high manufacturing costs, although the cost-benefit ratio was already competitive with a similar active solar system.

Above grade, wood frame supported, thermal mass floors, which can be low-cost, low maintenance, and attractive, have been developed in two residences designed and constructed by SUNSTRUCTURES. The finished result is a mass floor with a dark color added to the concrete with a tile pattern of oak strips set in the floor in one house and a dark slate tile finish in the other.

The kinetics of thiamine uptake and turnover in brain are such that any fall in circulating levels of the vitamin may significantly impair the supply to the brain.The brain depends on an adequate supply of glucose both as an energy source and as a donor of carbon fragments for protein and lipid biosynthesis. Glucose utilisation is, however, thiamine dependent and it is likely that this is a major factor in the production of thiamine deficient brain damage.Ethanol alone can cause a number of structural alterations in brain tissue and these lesions may be found in alcoholics either in association with or in the absence of thiamine deficient lesions. It is also probable that ethanol and thiamine deficiency act synergistically to produce structural damage.Recurrent deficiences of many different kinds also play a part in the production of cumulative brain damage in the alcoholic. © 1983 Medical Council on Alcoholism.",,"alcohol; cyanocobalamin; glucose; nicotinic acid; pyridoxine; thiamine; alcoholism; brain atrophy; brain injury; central nervous system; computer analysis; computer assisted tomography; diagnosis; etiology; human; intoxication; nervous system; neurotoxicity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020963631

The effect of nitrogen compounds on sediment formation was determined by using pure nitrogen compounds in model petroleum-derived fuel systems. The rate of sediment formation was dependent on the presence of nitrogen compounds, the nature of the diluent employed, and the storage conditions. Detailed studies of the effects of reaction conditions were carried out with 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DMP) as the model. Air, increased temperature, dissolved oxygen, and light all strongly accelerated the sediment forming reaction while moisture had a variable effect. The initial reaction rate was approximately first order in nitrogen concentration. The reaction has a low apparent activation energy and appears to involve a free-radical oxidative self-condensation of the nitrogen compound. © 1983, American Chemical Society.

These are the most common form of solar still and the only type which have been installed in any significant size. The equations describing the internal heat and mass transfer in a solar still are presented and used as a basis for indicating the conditions which lead to high outputs from solar stills. It is shown that the potential for increasing the efficiency of solar stills is not large. A number of the more successful materials which have been used for the cover, basin liner, structure, basin insulation and seals are presented, with comment on their advantages and disadvantages. The operational problems and ways of overcoming them are given and areas identified where field experience is still required. A method for approximately sizing solar still area and the required water storage volume is presented, with some comment on storage features. There is some scope in the future for increasing the unit area output of solar stills by the use of dyes and supplementary waste heat.",,"DESALINATION; DISTILLATION; RESERVOIRS; SEAWATER - Salt Removal; WATER TREATMENT - Salt Removal; CONSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS; MULTIPLE EFFECT STILLS; OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS; SOLAR DISTILLATION; SOLAR STILLS; WASTE HEAT UTILIZATION; SOLAR ENERGY",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020948809

This is associated with land fracture where the elastic energy storage capacity of the flowing polymer is exceeded periodically near the wall. In the usual shear stress-rate-of-shear diagram, such behavior can be seen as a hysteresis loop. The commercial rubber, based on ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) exhibits this behavior. A reinforcing filler, finely divided silica, when added to the EPDM, increases the loop size. On the other hand, treatment of the EPDM-silica mixture with a silane coupling agent can decrease the size of the loop. Two other measures of energy-storing capacity are the Bagley end correction (stored shear strain) and die swell, Both of these are affected somewhat by the filler-coupling agent combination. © 1983, American Chemical Society.

These wastes were originally managed by shallow land burial. In 1970 a change in policy occurred which required that wastes contaminated with TRU elements above 10 nCi/gm be placed in retrievable storage pending development of a permanent isolation method. The concentration limit of 10 nCi/gm was selected to be no higher than the upper range of radium-226 occurring naturally in the earth's crust. Plutonium-239, the principal isotope in TRU waste, and radium-226 are comparable in half life and radiotoxicity. It was reasoned that since man had lived in the vicinity of such alpha activity levels without apparent ill effects, placing materials with such contamination levels in carefully selected near surface disposal sites would present no significant hazard. It is now felt, based on discrimination factors, relative biological effectiveness and pathway analyses, that this concentration limit was overly conservative, and will likely be raised to 100 nCi/gm in the near future.",,"INDUSTRIAL WASTES - Treatment; WASTE DISPOSAL - Management; ALPHA ACTIVITY LEVELS; LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT; NEAR SURFACE DISPOSAL SITES; RADIOTOXICITY; RETRIEVABLE STORAGE; TRANSURANIC WASTES; TRANSURANIUM ELEMENTS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020929661

Production temperatures of HDR systems can be closely tailored to fit the temperature requirements of the intended end use. By using the experience gained from the hydraulic fracturing of crystalline basement rock, a number of feasible options are now possible for storage of solar and waste industrial heat.",,"ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION; ENERGY RESOURCES; CRUSTAL HEAT ENERGY; GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS; HOT DRY ROCK FIELD PROGRAM; WASTE INDUSTRIAL HEAT; GEOTHERMAL ENERGY",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020929040

As one of the first steps, DOE is required by the Act to identify states having potentially acceptable sites for a waste repository. Based on the information acquired thus far, Secretary Hodel has formally notified the governors and legislative leaders of the states of Louisiana, Texas, Utah, Mississippi, Nevada and Washington that each state contains a potentially acceptable site for a repository. The Act also requires that the DOE issue guidelines for the recommendation of sites for a repository within 180 days of enactment. The proposed guidelines were published in the Federal Register for public review and comment on February 7, 1983. These guidelines will be used to identify and nominate sites for characterization and eventually to determine the suitability of a site for development as a repository. The next steps under the Act are DOE'S initial nomination of five locations suitable for site characterization, based on a consideration of the guidelines and the environmental assessments to be prepared for each of the five nominated sites, followed by a recommendation of three candidate sites to the President for his approval.",,"NUCLEAR INDUSTRY - Legislation; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS - Storage; HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE; MONITORED RETRIEVABLE STORAGE; NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT; NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT; REPOSITORY SITE RECOMMENDATION; SPENT FUEL STORAGE; NUCLEAR FUELS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020926348

Numerical results are presented for the two-dimensional window cavity (R//A equals 10**3, 10**4, 10**5, 10**6) and three-dimensional window cavity (R//A equals 10**3 and 10**4) problems and a concentric cylindrical annulus problem. From the three-dimensional simulation of the flows, it is concluded that the fixed wall in the three-dimensional cavity has the (kinematic as well as thermal) effect of reducing the strength of the flow field. Due to the lack of quantitative results on the three-dimensional window cavity problem in the open literature, comparison of the results to assess the quality is not possible. However, it is noted that the global behaviour of solutions predicted by the penalty finite element model is very accurate despite the use of coarse meshes. In order to analyse higher Rayleigh number flows, mesh refinements must be made. Toward this end it is more practical to use out-of-core solution methods to meet the storage demands.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Finite Element Method; RINGS; WINDOWS; CYLINDRICAL ANNULUS; ENERGY EQUATION; HEAT CONDUCTION; PENALTY FUNCTION METHOD; WINDOW CAVITY PROBLEMS; HEAT TRANSFER",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020926116

FTIR spectroscopy showed the pellets to be uniformly reacted. The ratios of the 965-cm-1 absorption band (trans RCH=CRH′) to the 909-cm-1 band (RCH=CH2) increased with increasing radiation dosage, up to 18 Mrad. Gel contents reached a maximum of 75% at the 13.5 Mrad dosage, indicating that other reactions, in addition to cross-linking, occurred at the highest (18 Mrad) dosage level. © 1983, American Chemical Society.

The models are used to specifically investigate the performance of bottom-insulation relative to reducing earth-coupled losses in ponds. Model results show that as much as 20% of the incident solar flow may be lost due to conductive earth coupling, unless the bottom is insulated. Results from a second model focused on the performance of solar thermal storage. Specifically, above-ground storage, with several different insulation thicknesses, was compared with underground storage performance; environmental conditions similar to those expected in Kuwait were imposed on the model. Results show that a modest amount of insulation on storage tanks stationed above-ground can be as efficient as underground storage. Further, small storage tanks need more insulation than large tanks: the insulation thickness required to produce equal performance in three typical tank sizes is quantified. One-fifth as much insulation is required on typically large tanks as is required for the same performance in typically small tanks.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION; HEAT INSULATING MATERIALS; HOT WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; RESERVOIRS - Energy Storage; HEAT STORAGE TANKS; INSULATION THICKNESS; MICROCOMPUTERS; SOLAR PONDS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; UNDERGROUND STORAGE; SOLAR ENERGY",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020919998

The costs during the 1-th stage of control of the waterwork are the function of the decision concerning the quantity of water pumped to the system and of the quantity of distributed water which took place in that period. The quantity of distributed water in each interval is a random variable, thus the obtained effects of control (costs) in any period of time will result from the accuracy of prediction of the water pumped. An analytical approach is developed that allows an optimal control decision table to be prepared for all possible states of water storage in the reservoir in the time interval of the control process.",,"FLOW OF WATER - Control; HYDRAULICS; ANALYTICAL APPROACH; CONTROL PROCESS; OPTIMAL CONTROL DECISION TABLE; PUMPED WATER QUANTITY; TIME INTERVALS; WATER QUANTITY DISTRIBUTED; PUMPING PLANTS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020919924

Described is the vapor sampling method and the associated equipment used at United States gaseous diffusion enrichment facilities. Using data from field test experiments at the Oak Ridge and Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plants, liquid-phase and vapor-phase UF//6 sampling methods are compared to statistically validate the vapor-phase sampling method in determining **2**3**5U enrichment. Savings in cost, time, and sample storage and transportation are shown, as well as a large decrease in the amount of necessary sample inventory indefinitely held out of the process.

Therefore, there is a real technical possibility to gain the high energy content of solar energy. The first demonstration plants realize temperatures up to a level of about 500 degree C. The possibility of higher operating temperatures (up to a level of about 1300 degree C) has been demonstrated in test facilities. From the thermodynamic point of view temperatures of about 2000 degree C are optimum, depending on absortivity, emissivity and light concentration. In the paper, the design and experiences gained with the 500 kW solar plant in Almeria and the 20 MW plant GAST are discussed. For the future development the thermochemical cycles are of special interest. Some possible examples are discussed and it is shown that there are specific advantages when solar energy is applied compared to systems with conventional energy sources.",,"HYDROGEN FUELS - Manufacture; POWER GENERATION - Solar Energy; SOLAR POWER PLANTS - Spain; SOLAR RADIATION - Heliostats; WASTE HEAT UTILIZATION; COLD STORAGE TANK; DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM; GAS COOLED SOLAR PLANT; THERMOCHEMICAL CYCLES; TOWER PLANTS; SOLAR ENERGY",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020898548

The electricity is generated from PV cells along the focal line of the parabolic trough concentrators. The resulting electrical power is converted and conditioned by the power conditioning system to supply alternating current electricity at 480V, three phase to the hospital, eliminating the necessity for electrical storage. The thermal energy and cell cooling system consists of a closed-loop coolant circuit; a storage tank with an immersion-type heat exchanger for heating the hospital portable water.

The model used is an idealized one, which emphasizes the role of the heat capacity factor, but neglects heat transfer resistances, losses, and hydrodynamic non-idealities. The approach is shown to resemble that used classicaly in non-linear adsorption, and analogous concepts, such as shock waves and dispersive waves are introduced. The shapes and propagation characteristics of the temperature profiles generated during loading and unloading of the bed are discussed, for various fusible materials, operating temperatures, initial and boundary conditions, and flow direction. The non-linear dependence of the enthalpy of the storage material on temperature is shown to play a central role in determining the qualitative features of these profiles. The aims of the article are mainly qualitative, conceptual and didactic. © 1983, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

General concept of such additional peak load unit consists in storage of some fuel gas from gasification process in suitable reservoir at the night-time and burning it in peak load gas turbine during the day-time. The main problems occuring, namely, the selection of a gas storage method, reasonable from the technical and economical point of view, and the choice of the gas turbine arrangement are discussed.

The plant was designed and constructed to reprocess spent fuel from commercial power reactors utilizing the basic solvent extraction technology ('Purex Process') for chemical separation which has been successfully employed for more than 380 plant-years of world operation. However, no spent nuclear fuel has thus far been stored or processed at the Barnwell Plant, owing to a Government prohibition against reprocessing by the plant's private owners. The most important result achieved at Barnwell has been the demonstration of advanced safeguards for reprocessing plants to prevent nuclear proliferation. The owners remain hopeful that it will be possible for the Plant to operate under new ownership (presumably the Government), but it is imperative that a solution be provided before the funding ceases in order to preserve and fully utilize this valuable national asset.",,"NUCLEAR INDUSTRY - Energy Policy; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS - Waste Disposal; COMMERCIAL POWER REACTORS; FUEL REPROCESSING PLANTS; NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION SAFEGUARDS; SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY; SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL; NUCLEAR FUELS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020872608

Cyclic GMP has been proposed as the transmitter because a light-activated cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) has been found in rod disk membranes5,6 and because intracellularly injected cyclic GMP7 reduces rod membrane potentials. Free Ca 2+ has also been proposed because increasing external [Ca 2+] quickly and reversibly reduces the dark current and divalent cationophores increase the Ca2+ sensitivity8. Ca 2+ efflux from rod outer segments (ROS) of intact retinas occurs simultaneously with light responses9,10. Vesicles prepared from ROS disk membranes become more permeable on illumination, releasing trapped ions or molecules11-13, but intact outer segment disks have not previously been found to store sufficient Ca2+ in darkness and to release enough in light to meet the theoretical requirements for control of the dark current by varying cytoplasmic Ca2+ (refs 14-18).

In nerve cells, it is believed that electrical activity raises [Ca2+]i, by allowing influx of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent channels in the surface membrane 4,5. Elevation of neuronal [Ca2+]i may also occur due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites 6-8. Transient increases in [Ca2+]i are thought to trigger neurotransmitter release9, and to modulate axonal transport10, energy metabolism11 and growth cone movement12. Intracellular Ca2+ also appears to regulate membrane potassium channels and thereby to regulate electrical excitability 13. Although [Ca2+]i transients have been measured in a few giant invertebrate neurones14, detection of such transients in a vertebrate neurone has not been previously reported. We have measured [Ca2+]i in bullfrog sympathetic neurones by photometry of a microinjected calcium indicator dye, arsenazo III (refs 14-16), and report here that action potentials and voltage-clamped depolarizations cause long-lasting increases in [Ca2+]i. Also, exposure to the drug theophylline can cause spontaneous periodic increases in [Ca 2+]i. Comparisons of [Ca2+]i signals with simultaneous intracellular recordings of membrane potential suggest that the kinetics of the post-tetanic hyperpolarization (PTH) following a series of action potentials or the spontaneous hyperpolarizations induced by theophylline directly reflect the kinetics of the [Ca2+]i, transient. © 1983 Nature Publishing Group.",,"arsenazo 3; calcium; neurotransmitter; theophylline; arsenazo 3; azo compound; calcium; manganese; theophylline; action potential; animal cell; autonomic nervous system; bullfrog; cytology; drug efficacy; frog; nerve cell; nerve cell membrane potential; nervous system; nonhuman; photometry; sympathetic nerve cell; adrenergic system; animal; article; frogs and toads; kinetics; metabolism; nerve cell; Action Potentials; Animal; Anura; Arsenazo III; Azo Compounds; Calcium; Kinetics; Manganese; Neurons; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Sympathetic Nervous System; Theophylline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020645536

This class of materials exhibits a unique writing mechanism that yields relatively low writing energies even when materials with high melting points are used. Here, the physics of this writing mechanism are examined. Transmission electron micrographs of exposed areas clearly indicate that the writing mechanism is laser induced coalescence of the metal particles resulting in a dramatic change in optical properties. It is shown that the observed coalescence mechanism is consistent with a theoretical analysis for the sintering of small particles. Calculations based on this mechanism indicate that writing can occur at temperatures well below the melting point of the bulk material. However, detailed thermal modeling of the writing process coupled with measured threshold energies, indicates that melting almost certainly occurs. Furthermore, experimental results indicate a sharp threshold to the writing process. This is inconsistent with the theory of particle coalescence, but a necessary characteristic for a practical optical storage material. This threshold can be attributed to the necessity of bringing the metal particles into physical contact before coalescence can proceed. © 1983 SPIE.",,"ARCHIVAL OPTICAL STORAGE MATERIAL; LOW WRITING ENERGIES; OPTICAL CONTRAST; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF WRITING MECHANISM; TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROGRAPHS; WRITING THRESHOLD; DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020927674

In the recording mode, the reflectivity of TeOx thin film recording layer evaporated on a pregrooved PMMA substrate is changed by the absorption of the irradiated thermal energy of focused recording laser beam and the signal is recorded on the disc in the form of a chain of micron-sized flat and non-deformed dots. The optical memory using a laser diode as a light source is capable of storing up to 700 MBytes in user data on one side of a preformatted and pregrooved disc, 200 mm in diameter with an access time below 0.5 seconds. Input NRZ digital data are converted to 4/5 MNRZ code which has less DC component and recorded on the optical disc rotating at 900 rpm. Recording data speed on the disc is 6.8 Mbps and the length of the shortest bits is 0.8 μm The error rate of less than 10-8 has been achieved by the implementation of an error correction scheme with 5.4 % redundancy. © 1983, SPIE.",,"OPTICAL DIGITAL MEMORY; SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PLAYBACK SIGNAL; TELLURIUM SUB-OXIDE THIN FILM; DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020904196

In thin-film form, significant optical contrast can be produced at visible wavelengths on switching from low to high temperature phases. If the film is locally heated (e.g. by means of a laser) so that the temperature is driven above the transition point, the color or reflectance is changed only in that local region. Upon removal of the heat source the temperature returns to equilibrium. The local contrast, however, is either removed (dynamic operation), or stored indefinitely (memory operation) depending on the equilibrium or ""bias"" temperature. This storage option is possible because the material deposited as a thin film exhibits hysteresis, e., the curve describing the state of the film vs. temperature is double valued in the transition region. In order to erase information from a film region, that region must be lowered in temperature to a level below the onset of hysteresis. The general properties of vanadium dioxide thin film suggest a material suitable for recording optical information in a high density, digital format allowing erasure and reuse. Practical feasibility has been examined at Vought during the past year by a series of performance measurements. For example, laser writing of one micron diameter spots in less than 50 nanoseconds has been accomplished, and the amount of energy required for writing is compatible with laser diodes. These measurement results and data on contrast, storage time, and film surface morphology will be presented. The size of individual crystallites comprising the vanadium dioxide film is expected to fix ultimate spatial resolution. © 1983 SPIE.",,"DIELECTRIC SPACERS; GENERIC MULTILAYER CONFIGURATION FOR RECORDING; THERMALLY INDUCED FIRST ORDER PHASE CHANGE; THIN-FILM FORM PROPERTIES; VANADIUM DIOXIDE REFLECTANCE HYSTERESIS LOOP; VIDEO RECORDING",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020890080

There were 22 studies in formula-fed infants and 15 studies in premature infants fed own mother's milk. Despite their lower metabolizable energy intake, the infants fed own mother's milk grew in weight, length, and head circumference at a rate approximating those of the formula-fed group. The metabolic rate was significantly lower in the infants fed own mother's milk (56.0 ± 0.9 v 62.6 ± 0.8 kcal/kg/d; P < .001). The protein intake, oxidation, and accretion were similar in the two groups. The infants fed own mother's milk had a significantly lower fat intake (P < .001), higher fat oxidation (P < .025) and consequently lower fat accretion (P < .001) than the formula-fed infants. The proportional fat content of the daily weight gain was lower in the infants fed own mother's milk (16% v 33%; P < .001) but protein content was similar (13% v 12%). The accretion of energy, fat, and protein correlated with the respective metabolizable intakes in both groups (r = .81 to .98; P < .001), suggesting that accretion rates and hence composition of weight gain are dependent on levels of energy and macronutrient intake.",,"fat; protein; article; breast; breast milk; calorimetry; clinical article; computer analysis; diagnosis; energy; fetus; fetus growth; human; human experiment; infant; metabolism; normal human; normal value; prematurity; weight gain; Animals; Body Weight; Calorimetry, Indirect; Cattle; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Food, Formulated; Humans; Infant; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Milk; Milk, Human",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020551474

These multiplicity correlations are reproduced following our method of classifying each (pp) interaction in terms of the effective hadronic energy available. It is this energy, and not the long-range correlation, which produces low or high multiplicities in both hemispheres of a (pp) collision. The (log s)-dependence of the correlation strength follows from the energy dependence of the multiplicity. The (log s)-dependence is shown to follow our prediction from FNAL and SPS, to ISR, and up to Collider energies. © 1983 Società Italiana di Fisica.","Other topics in specific reactions and phenomenology of elementary particles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249183140

The model accounts for changes in geometry of the sensitive film, for adhesion of the film to the substrate, for surface tension gradients in the sensitive film and for evaporation or sublimation at the film-substrate interface.

Chemically, thin tellurium films degrade mainly through the uniform oxidation of tellurium to TeO2. In addition, localized degradation occurs at regions where initial defects on the substrate are present. Thin tellurium and tellurium alloy films can also degrade physically through crystal growth for an initially polycrystalline film and phase transformation for an initially amorphous film. While no significant difference in the uniform degradation rate is observed between films deposited onto poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and those deposited onto glass substrates, more localized degradation is detected for the films deposited onto PMMA substrates because of the higher initial defects of the substrate. The presence of a low surface energy subbing layer tends to degrade both the chemical and physical stability of these films. The degradation in the chemical stability is attributed to the change in the microstructure or thickness of the film due to the presence of the low surface energy subbing layer. © 1983.",,"DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL; TELLURIUM",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020830386

The relatively low output power of these devices necessitates sensitive optical storage media if reasonable data rates are to be achieved. At the same time, it is desirable that the material exhibit archival properties. One method of reducing the writing energy for a wide variety of materials is to incorporate them within an optical structure that improves the optical efficiency. In particular, trilayer structures consisting of an aluminum layer 30 nm thick, a spacer layer about 100 nm thick and a thin storage layer offer the potential of improved sensitivity for a wide range of active materials, but their use requires the fabrication of a low thermal conductivity optically clear spacer layer approximately one-quarter wave thick. Because of manufacturing considerations, it is desirable that this layer be deposited at relatively high rates in an inexpensive process. Here we describe the investigation of the plasma polymerization of various monomers for this purpose. It has been found that stable films of perfluoro-2-butene can be deposited at rates greater than 1 nm s-1. Trilayer structures using this material as the spacer layer are compared with more conventional materials. © 1983.",,"DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL; PLASMAS; POLYMERIZATION; FILMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020830354

It is the refraction of the Alfvén waves in combination with a drastic decrease of the instability growth rate with an increase of the angle between the directions of the wave vector and the stationary magnetic field that leads to the possibility of the long-term storage of the flare protons.

Predictions of the single-mode version are presented for homogeneous elongational flows including stress growth following start-up of steady flow, stress decay following sudden stretching and following cessation of steady flow, elastic recovery following cessation of steady flow, energy storage in steady-state flow, and the velocity profile in constantforce spinning. Using parameters of the multiple-mode version which fit the linearviscoelastic data, the Leonov-model predictions of elongational stress growth during, and elastic recovery following, steady elongation are calculated numerically and compared to the experimental results for Melt I and to the Wagner model. It is found that the Leonov model, as originally formulated, agrees qualitatively with the data, but not quantitatively; the Wagner model gives quantitative agreement, but requires much nonlinear data with which to fit model parameters. Quantitative agreement can be obtained with the Leonov model, if the nonequilibrium potential which relates recoverable strain to strain rate is adjusted empirically. This can most simply be done by making each relaxation time dependent upon the recoverable strain. The Leonov model, unlike the Wagner model, is derived from an entropic constitutive equation, which is advantageous for calculating stored elastic energy or viscous dissipation. The Leonov model also has an appealingly simple differential form, similar to the upper-convected Maxwell model, which, in numerical calculations, may be an important advantage over the integral Wagner model. © 1983 Steinkopff.","elongational flow; Leonov constitutive model; Melt I; nonequilibrium potential; Wagner model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001327171

In the first part of this paper MIRENE is described and its characteristics are given. The core uses only 1 kg of enriched uranium in solution state. It works in a self-limited pulse mode. The neutron pulses are collimated in two beams which cross the concrete pro-tection walls surrounding the reactor. The main characteristics are : • peak power : 161 kW, • exponential rise time : .87 sec, • overall energy in a pulse : 2.9 MJ (6.8 × 1016 fissions), • axial beam : – exposure aera : 30 cm × 30 cm, – useful fluence per pulse : thermal neutrons : 9 × 108 n/cm2 ; γ-rays : 22 rads (Cd ratio on gold detector : 2), • lateral beam : – exposure aera : 18 cm × 24 cm, – useful fluence per pulse : thermal neutrons : 2.6 × 108 n/cm2 ; γ-rays : . 7 rad (Cd ratio : 9). In the second part of the paper, many applications of MIRENE in much different fields are indicated. The results we have obtained since MIRENE started to operate, in 1977, are shown : – In nuclear engineering : • testing of first neutron reactor fuel-pins, • control of “neutrophage screens” used in transport and storage of nuclear-fuel materials to secure the criticity-safety, • observation of irradiated-oxyde samples in order to determine the Equation of State of the fuel used in fast-neutron reactors .observation of UO2–H2O mixing conditions in the field of cri-ticity experiments, – In engineering, MIRENE has a large field of applications, two examples are given : • the control of the sealing of an electric isolator, • the visualization of the bonding layer between two high density metals, – Finally we show an original application in agronomy which has given very good results : the observation of the in-situ-growth of a corn-root. All these results prove that MIRENE as well as similar reactors can bring about an important contribution as Non-Destructive-Testing stools in the most large field of applications. Their simplicity of design and working connected to their intrinsic safety enabled them to have a high competitive performance/cost ratio.

Net radiation and rural soil heat flux density were directly measured, suburban heat storage was parameterized, and the turbulent heat flux densities were evaluated using the Bowen ratio-energy balance method. Most comparisons were conducted during a period of drying following an unusually wet early summer. These conditions produced atypical but very interesting results. With cloudless skies and high radiant input, suburban-rural differences of both net radiation and evapotranspiration were contrary to previous results and intuition. In both cases, suburban values were greater than their rural counterparts. In most respects the rural site behaved as expected, and the explanation for these findings is thought to be related to advective assistance of evapotranspiration from the suburban area. Under lesser radiant forcing the suburban budget acted in greater conformity with past experience and suburban-rural differences were similarly more in agreement with expectation. © 1983 D.

The drop in the adiabatic index below 4 3 in this region, due to the negative nuclear pressure, disturbs the homology of the inner core and decreases its size. The initial shock energy and formation dynamics are particularly sensitive to matter in this regime. Only matter at low entropies (S ≤ 1.5) in the unshocked inner core approaches nuclear densities. We derive a simple equation of state for this material and find that nuclear properties are close to those at S = 0. The entropy associated with the nuclear surface can be absorbed into an ""effective mass"" which decreases towards one with increasing density, giving an accurate accounting for the storage of entropy in the excitation of the large nuclei. Such thermal excitation drains energy with little contribution to the pressure and thus may have important effects on the launching of the shock. Two phase transitions are considered. The first, from the heavy nucleus to the ""bubble"" phase, occurs at half nuclear matter density and is accomplished by use of simple expressions for the energy and pressure that include effects of the transition implicitly. The second, that to uniform nuclear matter, is done by requiring continuity of the pressure and entropy at the transition. The density at which this transition takes place is calculated and is found to decrease with entropy in a simple manner. With the use of suitable approximations, the equation of state is presented in a non-iterative form easily adapted for use in full hydrodynamical calculations of the supernovae process. Comparison with more detailed equations of state is made and the simplified one is found to represent well all important features. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010859249

Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, greatly enhanced the release of hypoxanthine.

The high-energy state created, known in the photographic literature as the latent image, enables reactants in contact with the membrane to form products that would otherwise be unfavored thermodynamically. Phenomenologically, the photosynthetic process shows certain similarities to the photographic process, the most obvious of which is that absorption of light by the chloroplast thylakoid membrane drives the reactants in contact with the membrane to form thermodynamically unfavorable products. The precise nature of the high-energy state of the photosynthetic membrane has yet to be clearly delineated. It is suggested here that, in analogy with the photographic state,,where the membrane is considered to host an electrochemically active redox couple, Ag+ Ag0, the membrane protein involved in phosphorylation (H+-ATP synthetase) is the site of an electrochemically active H+ H0 couple, whose thermodynamic state is determined by the number of electrons trapped by mobile protons in the form of stabilized atomic hydrogen, as well as the concentration of protons in the solution in contact with the membrane. The analysis leads to an energy storage mechanism in the thylakoid which is achieved by charging up a hydrogen electrode couple until the energy state of the membrane-protein/reactants system favors the conversion to products. The mechanism is hypothesized to involve a heterogeneous reaction on a metal-like hydrogen-electrode speck (comprising a few atoms of H0) whose size (area) determines the mixed or corrosion system potential. The resultant equations suggest some new experiments and predict their results. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749145914

Room temperature discharge test results indicate that there is little self-discharge in those cells stored at either room temperature or at -40° C. Even when the cells were subjected to elevated storage temperatures, the discharge results show that the cells exhibit a low self-discharge rate. However, cells stored at an elevated temperature do exhibit a decreased rate capability when compared to those results obtained from fresh cells. From the 56 ohm load discharge performance results, the self-discharge rate for cells stored at -40, 24, 50 and 72° C was calculated. Further, the activation energy over the temperature range was found to be 27.6±1.7 kJ. Also, the self-discharge rate was monitored under light load conditions. The results for Li/BrCl in SOCl2 D cells discharged under a current density of 2.38 to 0.016 mA cm-2, show that the operationally induced self-discharge rate reaches a maximum of 4.5 μA cm-2 for cells discharged under a current density of 0.034 mA cm-2 and decreases to 2.9 μA cm-2 as the discharge current density decreases to 0.016 mA cm-2.

At present, time resolved excitation and emission studies can be carried out routinely with a resolution of at least 1 ns, and measurements have been made on the fluorescence decay of individual vibronic levels of small molecules, on emission from low quantum yield vapours (∼10-4) at low pressure (∼1 Torr) and on quenching mechanisms in rigid matrices. Pure rare gas solids and mixtures have been studied extensively in an attempt to understand the kinetic processes associated with exciton formation. Also, for the first time, quantum coherence effects have been seen in rare gases. Using polarised light for excitation, orientated atomic states can be produced by photoselection and periodic fluorescence modulation can then be seen in the presence of an external applied field. The data give information about lifetimes, spins, multipolarities and ""g"" factors - even when the substates are unresolved in energy. Photoselection of an individual residue within a protein with pulsed, polarised light can, and has, led to an understanding of the microenvironment within the large molecule and has enabled initial estimates to be made of the flexibility of such large structures as well as of their overall size and shape. The best time resolution obtained so far using standard photon counting techniques is about ±50 ps and has been limited by the time response of the photodetector used. The narrow pulse width and the associated broad frequency spectrum (extending beyond 1 GHz) from storage ring sources has led to the study of phase shift and modulation techniques at a number of different frequencies. Preliminary results have revealed that in the frequency domain times of the order of a few ps can be measured. It is highly probable that, in the future, time domain measurements will be improved to give a resolution of about 1 ps and will be extended to include excitation over an extensive range of wavelengths in the VUV and X-ray regions. In this paper, a description of the actual time modulation of synchrotron radiation is followed by a comparison between several subnanosecond timing techniques which have been used at synchrotron radiation sources. The broad range of possible applications of these methods is illustrated by some slected examples. Finally a discussion is included on the prospects for reducing the bunch length into the picosecond region in future storage rings. © 1983.",,"ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON - Storage Rings; Spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049123223

In this wavelength range the atomic cross sections are not considerably smaller than those for electrons in the energy range in which electron microscopy is performed. The absorption cross sections for soft X-rays are appropriate for the investigation of unstained and undried biological specimens, e.g. cell organelles or whole cells with high resolution. The attenuation of soft X-rays is dominated by photoelectric absorption leading to an absence of multiple scattering in the specimens. Microscopy with soft X-rays requires intense X-ray sources as well as high resolution X-ray lenses. Intense X-radiation is provided by the synchrotron radiation of electron storage rings whereas the most important parameter is the average spectral brilliance.

The system is coupled by electric currents, flowing along (both upward and downward) and across the magnetic field lines, powered by the dynamo process driven by the neutral wind in the photosphere and the lower chromosphere. A self-consistent formulation of the proposed coupling system is given. It is shown in particular that the coupling system can generate and dissipate the power of 1029 erg s#X2212;1 and the total energy of 1032 erg during a typical life time (103 s) of solar flares. The energy consumptions include Joule heat production, acceleration of current-carrying particles along field lines, magnetic energy storage and kinetic energy of plasma convection. The particle acceleration arises from the development of field-aligned potential drops of 10-150 kV due to the loss-cone constriction effect along the upward field-aligned currents, causing optical, X-ray and radio emissions. The total number of precipitating electrons during a flare is shown to be of order 1037-1038. © 1983 D. Reidel Publishing Co.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001663909

This generates high-energy ions that interact with the oxygen, producing the long-lived metastable, O2(1Δ). Current experiments use 1 to 5 Torr of O2 in 100 to 200 Torr of Ar carrier gas. The 1.27-μm emission from O2(1Δ) is monitored 8 meters from the excitation region and nearly 1 second after the reactor pulse (-10 msec wide). Results to date indicate O2(1Δ)/O2(3Σ) fractions obtained are well above the 17% required to invert iodine in a flowing transfer laser. The O2(1Δ)-I2 laser is of particular interest as a candidate driver for an inertial confinement fusion reactor.

Further, the long-lived O2(1Δ) state provides the energy storage time (fractions of a second) needed between pellet implosions. © 1983 SPIE.",,"FLOWING TRANSFER LASER; GENERATION OF HIGH-ENERGY IONS; NUCLEAR PUMPING EXPERIMENTS; NUCLEAR REACTIONS IN BORON COATING; TIME DEPENDENT BEHAVIOR OF SPECIES; TRIGA REACTOR; LASERS, GAS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020593028

On an average dietary mixture for Americans they gained a mean of 2.68 kg, and on a diet high in carbohydrate (60 per cent of energy) they gained 2.73 kg. However, on a diet high in protein and fat (70 per cent of energy), they gained significantly less, 1.75 kg. On all three diets the subjects should have gained 5 kg, if adipose tissue has an energy density of 6 kcal/g, and had there been no adaptation. There was adaptation, as evidenced by an average 7 per cent increase in thermogenesis, which was measured by 24-h direct and indirect calorimetry. Energy balances were calculated from: bomb calorimeter values for food and body waste; change in fuel stores from body composition measured by densitometry; and daily expenditure estimated from the net food intake needed to maintain body weight during a 30-d control period. During overeating, energy intake matched energy losses (including fuel storage) for the average diet and the high-carbohydrate diet, but on the diet high in protein and fat energy intake exceeded losses by more than 500 kcal/d (2093 kJ/d). Thus smaller than expected weight gains from overeating (luxuskonsumption) were largely explained by increased thermogenesis, except when the diet was high in protein and fat.

In an effort to reduce the cost of the containment material while maintaining corrosion resistance, alloys with aluminide coatings have been examined while in contact with molten drawsalt for more than 6000 hours at 600 °C. The alloys examined were 2.25 Cr-1 Mo, 5 Cr-0.5 Mo, and 9 Cr-1 Mo low-alloy steels, and 316 stainless steel. The results show a steady, albeit slow, net weight loss over the course of the experiment. The weight loss has been attributed to spoiling of Al2O3 from the surface (the occurrence of Al2O3 is a result of the aluminizing process) and dissolution of corrosion products NaAlO2 and/or NaFeO2 during post-immersion handling. Scanning electron micrographs of exposed surfaces revealed little or no corrosion of the base metal. It has been concluded that aluminide coated alloys could provide significant cost savings (~50 pct) relative to INCOLOY Alloy 800, and provide at least equivalent corrosion resistance. © 1983 American Society for Metals.",,"SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; SOLAR RECEIVERS; STEEL CORROSION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020721228

If energy were limiting, then after accumulating KCl (i) the rate of O2 uptake would be less; (ii) the ATP content might be less; (iii) external glucose and/or sucrose would stimulate O2 uptake and Cl- influx; and (iv) respiratory uncouplers would stimulate O2 uptake less. In each case the opposite was found. The ratio of O2 uptake in KCl-loaded tissue to that in nonloaded tissue was 1.25±0.21 (7); the ATP concentration was the same after KCl loading; glucose did not stimulate O2 uptake (except indirectly in the same way as a nonmetabilized glucose analogue) nor did glucose or sucrose stimulate Cl- influx; and the maximal O2 uptake in the presence of the uncoupler ClCCP was the same after KCl loading. The decrease in Cl- influx must therefore be due to a negative feedback signal from internal Cl-, as previously suggested. It is pointed out that normal energy supply must be regarded not as an independent, controlling variable; but rather as a dependent variable of the KCl accumulation system. Conditions where energy supply is or becomes limiting are discussed. The distinction is drawn between pumps operating near equilibirium when energy supply may normally be a controlling factor (e.g., many H+-ATPases); and other pumps (possibly most of those for the uptake of nutrients and osmotica) which operate far from equilibrium and for which energy supply is a dependent variable. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.","chloride flux/accumulation; dependent/independent variables; energy supply; homeostasis; plant root cells; respiration; sugar levels","carbohydrate; cell respiration; chloride transport; energy resource; higher plant; in vitro study; ion transport; nonhuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020578978

DeKalb XL-45) seedlings was examined. Five-d-old plants that had been pretreated with 50 mM 14NO3-for 20 h were exposed for 8 h to nutrient solutions containing either no nitrate or 50 mM 15NO3-, 98.7 atom % 15N. The ambient solution, xylem exudate, and plant tissue were analyzed to determine the quantities of previously-accumulated (endogenous) 14NO3-that were translocated to the xylem, lost to the solution, or reduced within the tissue during the 8-h period. Energy was continuously available to the roots from the attached endosperm. In the absence of incoming nitrate, appreciable reduction and translocation of the endogenous 14NO3-occurred, but efflux of 14NO3-to the external solution was minimal. In contrast, during 15NO3-uptake, there was considerable efflux of 14NO3-as well as translocation of 14NO3-to the xylem, but little 14NO3-was reduced. Thus there appeared to be an inverse relationship between 14NO3-efflux and reduction. The data are tentatively interpreted on the basis of a model which envisages (a) two storage locations within roots, one of which primarily supplies nitrate for translocation and the other of which primarily supplies nitrate for outward passage through plasmalemma, and (b) the majority of nitrate reduction as occurring during or immediately following influx across the plasmalemma, with endogenous 14NO3-initially moving outward being recycled inward and thereby being reduced. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.","Nitrate translocation, reduction, efflux; Zea (NO3-partitioning)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001846831

We have confirmed that while the former senses that part of the modulated absorbed radiation not used in photosynthesis, but converted into heat, the latter, at low modulation frequencies, senses not only this heat but also the modulated oxygen evolution resulting from photosynthesis in the leaf. When photosynthetic activity is saturated upon additional excitation with strong non-modulated light, the photothermal radiometry signal increases (virtually all absorbed modulated light being converted into heat), while at the same time the photoacoustic signal decreases, because virtually no modulated oxygen evolution occurs any more. At higher modulation frequencies the behaviour of the photoacoustic signal closely follows that of the photothermal radiometry signal. We have used combined photothermal radiometry / photoacoustic measurements to estimate directly the yield of chemical energy storage in various plant species which applies for different times after excitation. Measurement of light saturation curves for wheat and Siberian pea bush leaves and of action spectra for the latter confirm the similarity between photothermal radiometry and high-frequency photoacoustic signals, and their difference from the low-frequency photoacoustic signal. Combined use of photothermal radiometry (or high-frequency photoacoustics) and low-frequency photoacoustics can thus provide more information than any one method alone. Experiments on intact chloroplasts and on a blue-green alga demonstrate that photothermal radiometry and photoacoustic methodologies can also be used for these tissues. © 1983.","(Intact leaf); Oxygen evolution; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Photosynthesis; Photothermal radiometry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001307344

However, due to the capital costs required to use natural gas as a transportation fuel in either compressed (CNG) or liquefied (LNG) forms, some applications are more advantageous than others. Generally, fleets provide the best opportunity for conversion because of the sheer volume of fuel required and because most vehicles return to a single location each day. The advent of small compressors may make conversion to natural gas feasible for private individuals. Presently, the most popular conversions are to CNG due to the limited availability of liquefiers to produce LNG. The available conversion kits favor vehicles with certain characteristics: vehicles should have spark-ignition engines, be large enough to support the weight of the CNG fuel cylinders, consume at least 5 gallons of gasoline each day on average and have sufficient storage volume so that the fuel cylinders do not infringe on required load-carrying volume. The ease of conversion depends greatly on the vehicle. Pickup trucks are usually easy to convert while subcompact cars can present formidable challenges due to space requirements and load-carrying capacity. The costs of converting to CNG include vehicle conversion costs, refueling station costs, and required operating and maintenance costs. These costs vary according to vehicles (how many storage tanks and how difficult the conversions are), the planned utilization of compressor capacity, whether the vehicles are refueled using slow-fill or fast-fill techniques and the refueling site preparation required. In this paper, these costs are explained and compiled for the conversion kits and refueling equipment presently available. A few case studies are explored to demonstrate what must be known to evaluate whether a fleet of vehicles has potential to save money using natural gas and how long it may take to see a return on the initial investment. Also discussed in the paper is an overview of CNG safety aspects, especially as related to road and operating restrictions that may exist in some local jurisdictions. Thus, in keeping with the intent of this paper to be a practical guide for decision-makers, reference is made to safety-related considerations and the restrictions which may be imposed by some states or municipalities on CNG vehicle operation.",,"Compressed natural gas; Costs; Decision making; Diesel fuels; Energy resources; Engine cylinders; Fleet operations; Fuel storage; Gases; Gasoline; Highway engineering; Natural gas transportation; Trucks; Compressor capacity; Economic considerations; Fleet of vehicles; Highway vehicles; Maintenance cost; Space requirements; Transportation fuels; Transportation vehicles; Natural gas vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072498129

The latter part of the model involves the calculation of stresses and strains in the formation as well as in the surrounding rocks, as a result of pressure and temperature changes, which are used to calculate the fracture length at various times. Fluid flow in the cyclic steam stimulation process is simulated hy a three-phase heat-fluid flow model, with implicit solution and and special procedures to minimize computational time. A coupled well model allows for six different well operation conditions, including fluid storage in the fracture. Rock stresses and strains were computed using a finite element model, developed for this study, which also gives the displacements and stresses at the fracture tip. Several fracture propagation criteria were tested, and as a consequence, all the pertinent criteria from the literature were rejected for the case pf non-isothermal fractures. Instead, it is postulated that for materials containing a propagating fracture, whose strain and/or surface energy is supplied by loading of. the fracture face and/or pore pressure or thermal expansion, the strain energy may not fully balance the imposed loads. A new criterion for fracture propagation and closure is offered that seems to reflect the reported behaviour in the field. © 1983 Petroleum Society of CIM.",,"Elasticity; Fracture; Steam; Strain; Strain energy; Structural design; Thermal expansion; Computational time; Cyclic steam stimulations; Displacements and stress; Fracture propagation; Implicit solutions; Numerical treatments; Operation conditions; Pressure and temperature; Flow of fluids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057065177

By analysis of the structural behavior of equations describing the transfer of carbon and carbon dioxide between their several reservoirs we have been able to demonstrate that this characteristic can be explained to result from approximately linear behavior and exponentially growing carbon dioxide release rates, combined with fitting of carbon cycle model parameters to the last twenty years of observed atmospheric carbon dioxide growth. These conclusions are independent of the details of carbon cycle model structure for projections up to 100 years into the future as long as the growth in atmospheric carbon dioxide release rates is sufficiently high, of the order of 1.5% per annum or more, as referenced to p re-industrial (steady state) conditions. At low rates of growth, when the longer response times of the carbon cycling system become important, for most energy use projections the resultant CO2 induced climate changes are small and the uncertainties in predicted atmospheric carbon dioxide level are thus not important. A possible exception to this condition occurs for scenarios of future fossil fuel use rates designed to avoid atmospheric CO2 levels exceeding a chosen threshold. In this instance details of carbon cycle model structure could significantly affect conclusions that might be drawn concerning future energy use policies; however, it is possible that such a result stems from inappropriate specification of a criterion for an environmental threat, rather than from inherent inadequacy of current carbon cycle models. Recent carbon cycle model developments postulate transfer processes of carbon into the deep ocean, large carbon storage reservoir at rates much higher than in the models we have analysed. If the existence of such mechanisms is confirmed, and they are found to be sufficiently rapid and large, some of our conclusions regarding the use of the constant fractional retention assumption may have to be modified. © 1983 D.

Postweld heat treatment was required to avoid stress corrosion cracking at the welds during service of the tanks. To successfully heat treat each tank a total of ten Cooperheat compact burner trains were used, each comprising a high velocity 8 million Btu burner, motorized fan blower and semi-automatic control station with automatic gas shut-off feature. The heating cycle over 50 hours was controlled to 600 degree C maximum and used only 30 tons of propane gas for each tank firing. The complete process was program-controlled using microprocessor. An important feature of the treatment is the maintenance of a constant positive pressure within the thin-wall tank to prevent distortion. Monitoring by magnahelic gauges positioned at the top and bottom of the tank with adjustment of damper at the exhaust flues, provided the correct positive pressure. To provide temperature measurement and control, a total of 326 type 'K' nickel-chromium/nickel-alumel thermocouples were affixed to the tank by the capacitance discharge method. For quality assurance, one-third were connected to multipoint temperature recorders and two-thirds to a data log printer.

Critical over potentials and induction times for roughness initiation and propagation of roughness elements are determined. Morphological stability analysis explains why certain electrodes remain smooth whereas others evolve dendrites, and defines conditions for smooth deposition. Once roughness evolution is indicated, the complete growth history of the nodules is proved in terms of the current density and the applied potential, the convective flow, chemical composition and the macroscopic and microscopic geometry.

An urgent need for both the conservation of energy and the development of new energy resources is well recognized today. Heat transfer plays an important role in fulfilling the need, as it is directly involved in the processes of energy conversion, transfer, disposal, and storage. Both the United States and Japan represent high energy consuming countries and are technically advanced in heat transfer research. Therefore, it is very timely for Japanese and U.S. scientists in heat transfer engineering to meet to exchange first hand information, to identify key problems, to discuss research strategies, and to promote areas of future cooperative heat transfer research. For this purpose a joint seminar was held September 29- September 29-October 2, 1980, in Tokyo, under the financial support of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program. This programme is jointly administered by the U.S. Division of International Programs (INT)/National Science Foundation and the Japan Society for the Promotion for Science (JSPS). This volume, the edited version of the proceedings, begins with an introduction to current Japanese heat transfer research in energy problems, including basic research, the Sun-shine project, the Moon-light project, and the Green project, and to the new research endeavours in the United States.

Assumptions are: (a) the usual lubrication conditions for two-dimensional flow, (b) small oscillations, and (c) constant viscosity. Specific conditions are established for the latter assumption, which may be in force for stably operated squeeze film bearings. Relatively simple expressions are presented for the thermal performance variables (temperature field, average temperature, Nusselt number) for a variety of cases. The results are interesting from a heat transfer point of view in that the proper energy balance consists of dissipation, conduction, and storage terms, rather than convection terms as is usual in lubrication studies. Thus inferences drawn from other thermal analyses may be in error. Both average cross-film temperature rise and heat transfers are seen to increase from zero Pe'clet number and asympotically approach constant values. Due to the negligible convection conditions, the conventional definitions of bulk temperature, Nusselt number, and Pe'clet number are not appropriate. As a result of the thermal storage effect, interesting temporal phase-shift and temperature swing effects are exhibited. © 1983 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024545618

For example, a developer consisting of a methanol-water solution of silver salt (0.5mol/l) and p-benzoquinone (0. 47mol/l)2)3) showed little or no deterioration after storage for two days in the dark. The resolution of developed image depended on the anion species in the solution and also on the species of the nucleus metal. The typical value of the resolution was 200 line pairs/mm. Though the developing time as short as 4~5 minutes could yield an image of transmission density 3, the developing rate had to be improved further for meeting practical requirements. In this paper, an investigation was made to find out better precursors for the developing agent (reductant). Precursors were chosen from families of quinones and diazonium salts. Among many compounds, p-diethylaminobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate was found to give the best result. When this compound was chosen as the precursor and dissolved into a methanol-water solution (0.13mol/l) together with a silver salt (0. 5mol/l), the developing rate was 3 times higher than that of the former p-benzoquinone type developer. This rate is satisfactorily rapid for practical use. The stability during the storage in the dark and resolution were not lost by the replacement of p-benzoquinone with the diazonium salt. For the palladium nucleus, the exposure energy required for getting the transmission density of unity was 0.8 mJ/cm2, which was lower by factor of 4 than that for silver nucleus. © 1983, The Chemical Society of Japan.

Although BET's monolayer moisture value (ML) of Nori was corresponding to aw 0.11, the most suitable condition to keep AH2 was in aw 0.05 system. According to our estimation method, an optimum water content was at aw 0.02, which was also below BET's ML. This could be due to the difference of adsorption ability of a hydrophilic surface from that of a hydrophobic one. Both the surfaces could not be covered with the monolayer of water molecules at the same time because of the differences of surface-energy. This suggests that BET's ML is an apparent value which exceeds as a ML of the hydrophilic surface. DH increased at lower aw below 0.3 and decreased at higher aw. The ratio of DH to AH2 increased with the increase in aw and storage time. DH is considered to be stabler than AH2 with regard to the influence of water.

The interaction energy, gross charges, dipole moment, and the electron density in the middle plane of the complexes have also been evaluated. The STO‐3G π‐split basis set is appropriate for the calculation of large π–π stacking complexes from two points of view, production of reliable results and ease of computations. The approximation scheme based on the semiorthogonalized orgitals is revealed to be very efficient to save CPU time and storage in such calculations.

In all these areas, scientists, engineers, and planners make use of mathematical models; these models describe the relevant transport processes that occur within controlled porous medium domains and enable forecasting of the future behavior of these domains in response to planned activities. The mathematical models, in turn, are based on the understanding of phenomena, often within the void space, and on theories that relate these phenomena to measurable quantities. Because of the pressing needs in areas of practical interest such as the development of groundwater energy storage and geothermal energy production, a vast amount of research in all these fields has contributed, especially in the last two decades, to our understanding and ability to describe transport phenomena in porous media. In recent years these research efforts have been significantly accelerated, attracting scientists from many disciplines. The practical needs of solving boundary value problems in heterogeneous domains, irregular boundaries, coupled phenomena and multiple dependent variables led to the development of a variety of powerful numerical techniques. The realization that fields are highly heterogeneous and that the degree of heterogeneity depends on the scale of the problem led to the introduction of stochastic concepts as an additional tool for the description of phenomena. ©1983.

The utilization of subsurface space has largely been confined to developed countries so far, and the purpose of the meeting was to focus attention upon its potential use in developing countries. Participants at the Workshop discussed the utilization of subsurface space in relation to the underground storage of food and commodities, water, petroleum and gas, and also energy production and utilization. Additional topics included transportation systems and public utilities. The implementation of such projects is discussed with respect to technology and technology transfer and to the economics of subsurface development. As capital, in particular, is a limited resource in developing countries, attention was devoted to the financing of such undertakings. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the conclusions reached with specific attention to the possible role of United Nations organizations in this increasingly important area.

The various aspects of injecting singly and multiply charged ions into harmonic and nonharmonic ion trap devices are discussed. Injection of a continuous ion beam into an active trap was evaluated by numerical integration of the Mathieu equations to determine the finite confinement time of the injected ions. Three different modes of operation of the ion trap, namely, the radio-frequency (RF), the Penning, and the combined RF and Penning modes were considered. On the other hand the phase space method was used for a pulsed ion beam injected into the RF quadrupole ion trap for which the RF quadrupole field was switched on after the ion injection. In this way, a high trapping efficiency is reached for a suitable combination of the chosen initial RF voltage phase angle and the delay time after the ion injection. In addition, the trapped ions are confined indefinitely and energy- and mass-selective storage of the injected ions are also possible. The occurrence of ion motion induced side bands in the spectrum of stored ions and their importance for determining the ion temperature are discussed. Scaling relations are given which relate the results obtained for singly charged ions to the storage properties as they pertain to highly charged ions. Use is made of the unique environment of ion traps to speculate about novel collision and high resolution spectroscopy experiments on highly charged ions. © 1983 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956248885

At the time, the highest steady operating pressure available from commercial-sized turbocompressors was about 65 bar (950 psia), which was being used in the partial oxidation process for ammonia or methanol synthesis. For advanced coal conversion plants, compressors operating at 115 bar (1667 psia) would be needed. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) entered into an agreement with the West German firm of Mannesmann Demag, AG, to develop a high-pressure oxygen compressor. Mannesmann Demag designed and fabricated a third casing centrifugal compressor (to be used in a train with available compressors) having a nominal inlet pressure of 65 bar (950 psia) and a nominal discharge pressure of 115 bar (1667 psia). In exchange, the U.S. DOE agreed to fund the modification and operation of a NASA-owned test facility for testing the compressor. The facility, CTL-V, was modified and operated by the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International. Test management and reporting was carried out by DOE's Energy Technology Engineering Center (ETEC), operated by Rockwell International's Energy Systems Group. This paper presents a brief description of the compressor test article and test facility. The test program, test results, and analysis are presented in greater detail. The scope of the test program included low- and high-pressure nitrogen shakedown tests, oxygen performance and steady-state tests, and oxygen maximum suction pressure tests. The facility is unique because it is the only one of its kind nationally that can provide the power to drive the compressor and that has liquid oxygen/liquid nitrogen capability (the facility is utilized for development and testing of rocket engine turbopumps). Also, testing and data acquisition, reduction, and analysis were performed in a facility that normally runs tests of few minutes duration (for rocket engine components) but that had to be converted to run endurance tests lasting several hundred hours.

The greenhouse was installed with double layer movable thermal screen. The heat exchange fans were operated, in principle, when the inside air temperature was above 22-23°C or below 13°C. The oil heater for auxiliary heating was switched on when the inside air temperature was below 11°C. Thermal properties of the greenhouse were analyzed as follows: 1) Average solar energy collection factor, V, was 0.11. 2) Average oil reduction factor, r, was 0.93. 3) The coefficient of performance of the greenhouse system, C.O.P., was 2.4, on average. C. O.P. of the system was considered to be much improved if the friction loss of spiral air ducts in the heat storage and heat exchange tank (1.2 mmAq/m at an air speed of 5 m/s) was reduced to that of a normal rigid PVC pipe with a diameter of 90 mm (0.4 mmAq/m at an air speed of 5 m/s). Average solar energy collection factor could probably be improved as high as 0.15 if the setpoint inside air temperature for ventilation was raised from 23-24 °C to 27-28 °C, while the setpoints for heat exchange fans were remained the same. As for the solar greenhouse, the split-night air temperature control was considered to be essential to improve the oil reduction factor. Much more work will be needed for making clear the effects of that on crop growth, as well as on the thermal properties of the greenhouse. © 1983, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

The predominant part of these variations can be explained by blocking of the upward solar flux by sunspots. The observations are consistent with current theoretical models of energy storage in which the energy blocked by the sunspots is temporarily stored in the convective zone. We present modelled solar constant variations on a day by day basis selected from model calculations for the period 1874 through 1981 (Hoyt and Eddy, 1982). Because neither faculae nor bright rings about sunspots balance the net blocking by sunspots, there is a net eleven year modulation in irradiance with a relative depression of as much as 0.07% for the period 1969‐1981.

Other model predictions indicate that large container sizes and rapid fluctuation regimes result in the greatest thermal stability at interior locations in bulk‐stored peas. Thermal properties of frozen peas were also determined as part of the experimental verification. The model can be used to evaluate quality changes in frozen products due to di‐thermal storage and the energy needed to maintain a certain final quality. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to study the use of alternative fuels for transportation with respect to their future use as a long term solution. The ideal, i.e. the generally applicable and universally available alternative fuel, cannot be expected to exist, since a country will try to make the best use of its own resources. For this reason, ""energy independence"" is often regarded as of greater importance than economic considerations. As far as engines are concerned, the availability of alcohols, i.e. of high octane number fuels, suggests their use in high-compression spark-ignition engines. But the desire for propulsion systems capable of using a great variety of alternative fuels will lead to the development of special diesel engines. In any cases, a decision in favour of one or the other solution can neither be based on the engine nor on the fuel alone. The evaluation must include all aspects, like raw material costs and availability, fuel production, storage and distribution, engine production costs, engine efficiency and durability, as well as environmental aspects and strategic considerations. An evaluation approach concerning the use of new fuels in engines for commercial vehicles is presented and discussed. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749148578

Some of the problems with using natural gas (NG) in spark ignited engines are its high minimum ignition energy, long ignition delay, and low flame speed relative to gasoline, which results in a significant power loss. This paper examines the possibility of solving some of these problems by using a more efficient ignition source to reduce ignition delay and to enhance the initial burning rate. The ignition sources considered are a multiple electrode spark plug, plasma jet igniter, and conventional spark plug. Each of these ignition sources was also supplemented with varying amounts of additional energy from a high voltage storage capacitor. The experiments are performed in a constant volume combustion chamber. The pressure in the bomb during combustion was measured, and from this the mass fraction burned was determined. The time to burn 10% of the mixture (which includes flame initiation and initial propagation) was compared for each ignition source. The multiple electrode spark plug, using only the energy of a conventional ignition system, reduced this time by 12% compared to a conventional spark plug. Larger reductions (up to 45%) were found for the multiple electrode spark plug and plasma jet igniter when additional energy (up to 4.5 J) was supplied to the discharge. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749147610

The aim of this investigation is to determine whether the yield of products is increased on increasing the temperature which would be useful for the storage of solar energy. The system studied here consists of the electron transfer from a metalloporphyrin (zinc tetramethylpyridylporphyrin) to methyl viologen. This system has proved to be very efficient for sensitizing the photoreduction of water to hydrogen. Many factors affect the efficiency of the system but we find that increasing the temperature favours charge separation. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949175493

Salt/phosphate (NaCl/PO4) combinations of 0/0, 1/0, 1/0.25 and 2%/0.5% were blended with each fat level. Each treatment combination was stored at 3°C for 7 days in air‐permeable film (AP), 21 days in vacuum pouches (VP) and at −23°C for 90 days in double‐wrapped (DW) freezer paper. Fat level did not affect pH, expressed moisture (EM), peroxide value (PV), 2‐thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values or cooking losses. Patties with 30.0% fat were jucier and required less energy to compress. A combination of 1%NaCl/0.25%PC4 reduced cooking losses, enhanced sensory properties and moderated the oxidation effects of NaCl up to 60 days of frozen storage. The NaCl treatment accelerated lipid oxidation most during all storage conditions while the control remained the least oxidized. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

The mobility, =m, of the droplets is measured using the strain-gradient method. The magnitude and temperature dependence of the scattering time are found to be in agreement with the phonon scattering model of EHD-momentum damping. The phonon-wind force that transports droplets at a velocity V is measurable via the drift relation F=V. The phonon-wind force for a given cw laser excitation is calibrated and compared to that produced by pulsed-laser excitation. In the pulsed case, the wind persists for up to 4 s after a 100-ns laser pulse, indicating a storage of energy. Time-resolved images reveal a cloud shape very different from the steady-state cloud and show that the phonon storage is localized to within 300 m of the excitation point. With a simple phonon-wind model, the droplet-velocity data give quantitative information on the energy flux leaving the storage region, and thus the total stored energy.

Allinger's MM2 cyclopropane parameters were examined for diverse structures including bicyclo[n.1.0]alkanes, spiropentanes, and bicyclopropyls. For the bicyclopropyls, a new parameter set was introduced. Experimental structures and energies of these cyclopropane derivatives were well reproduced by MM2 calculation with these parameters.

Various strategies were considered for controlling a fan and heater from the relative humidity of the air, heated by its passage over the fan. Weather records for the years 1968-1972 were used from Turnhouse, Kinloss and Leeming, which are the nearest meteorological stations keeping hourly records to the major grain growing areas of Northern Britain. Aspects of grain deterioration modelled were the time taken for mould to grow and the decrease in grain viability. For an initial moisture content of 0·25 (dry basis) and a bed depth of 3 m it was never necessary to use supplementary heat unless final moisture contents less than 0·17 (d.b.) were required. Switching off the fan when the relative humidity in the air supply duct was above a set level gave similar energy consumption and storage time to using the average value of relative humidity or adding just enough heat to maintain a constant relative humidity level. A setting of about 80% gave reasonable energy consumption and storage time without the risk of mould growth. It was always found beneficial to cool the grain after drying. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042965157

Box 143, Leicester, LEI 9BH, United Kingdom","A 2.54cm diameter punch and die set has been used in conjunction with a Mayes Hydraulic Machine to examine strain movements within the die of compacts maintained at constant stress. These were prepared from the bases Avicel PH 101 (AV), Sta-Rx 1500 (ST), Paracetamol DC (PC), Emdex (ED) and Eacompress (EC). Compression force and punch movements were simultaneously monitored using a CBM nicroconputer with disk storage of data. All compacts showed time dependent consolidation under constar. stress when held at 'holding time' of up to 60s. PC, AV and ST exhibited comparable movements but that of ED and EC ware less. Elastic recovery on sudden release of load was followed using machine code logging over a period of 90ms. Large recoveries were recorded for AV, PC and ST. If load release was immediate (zero holding time) then the recovery was greater when compared with recovery after holding tines of 30 and 60s, suggesting that some elastic energy was dissipated during the holding time. Elastic recovery of ED and EC was about half that of the other bases. Although these bases also showed reduced recovery with holding tine, percentage reduction was smaller than for the other bases. Following elastic recovery, a much slower viscoelastic movement could be demonstrated. It was difficult to clearly demarcate the division between viscoelastic and elastic movement but it appeared that the movement on viscoelastic consolidation was comparable to that en recovery when the load was removed. There are many references to tine dependent effects during tablet compression to be found in the literature. One of the earliest was due to Rees and Shotton (1) who found that the crushing strength of sodium chloride tablets could double after the lapse of one hour from ejection. This has recently been shown by Rue and Barkworth (2) to be due to the existence of a work hardened outer shell which inhibits relaxation by viscoelastic flow. Several authors (3,4,5) have investigated the stress decay that occurs when a tablet is held at a nominally constant force. Thus Wells and Langridge (5) monitored the fall from a peak pressure of 332MN/m2on a tablet prepared in a single punch machine turned by hand. Similar techniques have been described by Rees and Rue (3), Kiestand and others (4) and Shlanta and Milosovich (6). However as Rees and Rue have pointed out, these methods measure stress relaxation under constant strain conditions. Their results and conclusions differed from those of David and Augsburger (7) who compressed the same direct compression bases on a rotary tablet machine. In a rotary machine compression takes place under virtually constant, stress conditions because of the buffer effect of the powerful springs fitted to the compression wheels. This paper describes some techniques and observations on the compression of some direct compression bases using a Mayes Hydraulic Testing Machine (WH Mayes (Windsor) Ltd) which is capable of maintaining constant stress conditions on a compact formed in a punch and die set mounted between the platens. © 1983 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344419088

Various examples of this evolution have been given in this paper. It has been shown for instance that new materials (sometimes metastable ones) can be prepared, either by ion exchange or by chemical (or electrochemical) intercalation-deintercalation methods. The structural requirements of such reactions will be discussed. Another example is provided by the way one selects fast ionic conductors for energy storage. Various factors like amorphous nature, covalency, bond competition, presence of vacancies, influence of cationic lone pairs are discussed in the case of alkali ion or fluorine ion electrolytes. Attention is also paid to the stabilization of unusual electronic configurations, particularly for high oxidation states of transition elements, on the base of relevant structural and bonding considerations. In the field of magnetic properties, the possibility of obtaining new ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic materials is discussed, as well as the ability to modify 1D-or 2D-behaviour of chain-or layer-type materials. Examples are also given showing how the performance of non-linear materials can be modified by playing with the factors determining structural distortions.

As in a Schottky barrier electrode system, the maximum photovoltage attainable with these electrodes is limited by the barrier height at the Si/ITO heterojunction. Both n- and p-Si substrates have been studied. In regenerative PEC systems designed for the conversion of solar energy to electricity, the efficacy of charge transfer at the ITO/electrolyte interface is shown to be a crucial factor. Of the redox electrolytes tested (S2-/Sx2-, I3- /I-, [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- and Fe2+/3+ EDTA), the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- couple was by far the most efficient in terms of charge transfer across the ITO/electrolyte interface. Optical-to-electrical conversion efficiencies (η)) of 1.57% and 5.7% (~AM 1 illumination) were attained for PEC cells based on n- and p-Si substrates, respectively. Detailed tests have revealed long-term stability in [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- electrolytes once the ITO film thickness (&gt;50 Á) and solution pH (~ 12-14) were optimized. n-Si/ITO electrodes were used for the photooxidation of Cl- from concentrated LiCl and NaCl electrolytes to illustrate the chemical inertness and stability of these electrodes. Catalytic modification of the ITO surface with RuO2 was found to be necessary to sustain Cl2 production. Values of η up to 2.7% were recorded with this PEC system at 100 mW/cm2. Finally, the applicability of Si/ITO heterojunction electrodes for the photoassisted splitting of water was demonstrated. Preliminary experiments have revealed a 40% reduction in the threshold voltage required for water photolysis. Catalytic modification of the ITO surface was again a prerequisite for efficient performance of these electrodes. Pt and RuO2 electrocatalysts were used for p- and n-Si substrates, respectively. Experiments with ITO thin-film electrodes on inert Ti substrates show that the observed behavior of Si/ITO electrodes may be rationalized on the basis of electrocatalytic activity of the ITO/electrolyte interface biased by the ITO/Si heterojunction. Kinetics at this interface are a key factor and in the extreme case (e.g., regenerative systems based on the I- /I3- redox couple) may nullify any voltage gained by illumination at the Si/ITO heterojunction. © 1983, American Chemical Society.

By itself, however, this translates into a modest reduction at best in the total energy requirements of crop production. The exception is where other energy-intensive inputs, especially irrigation water and fertilizer, are minimal. Also, the tillage fuel reduction may be offset wholly or in part by an increase in herbicide applications. However, other benefits of conservation tillage, such as improved water storage and reduced soil loss, can greatly increase the direct energy saving. Of course, if yields decline with conservation tillage, the saving in energy consumption could be more than offset. In such a case, the system ends up being less energy efficient than conventional tillage.-Author",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021074398

Their potential value as a source of dietary energy during exercise was compared with that of maltodextrins (MD). Twelve subjects exercised for 1 h on a bicycle ergometer (60% {Mathematical expression}O2 max), 1 h after the test meal (1MJ). The metabolism of MCT was followed using 1-13C-octanoate (Oc) as tracer and U-13C-glucose (G) was added to the 13C-naturally enriched MD. After MCT ingestion no insulin peak was observed with some accumulation of ketone bodies (KB), blood levels not exceeding 1 mM. Total losses of KB during exercise in urine, sweat and as breath acetone were small (&lt;0.2 mmol·h-1). Hence, the influence of KB loss and storage on gas exchange data was negligible. The partition of fat and carbohydrate utilization during exercise as obtained by indirect calorimetry was practically the same after the MCT and the CHO meals. Oxidation over the 2-h period was 30% of dose for Oc and 45% for G. Glycogen decrements in the Vastus lateralis muscle were equal. It appears that with normal carbohydrate stores, a single meal of MCT or CHO did not alter the contribution of carbohydrates during 1 h of high submaximal exercise. The moderate ketonemia after MCT, despite substantial oxidation of this fat, led to no difference in muscle glycogen sparing between the diets. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.","1-13C-octanoate; Ketones; Muscle glycogen; Respiratory exchange ratio; U-13C-glucose","glucose c 13; medium chain triacylglycerol; octanoic acid c 13; unclassified drug; article; carbohydrate metabolism; clinical article; diagnosis; endocrine system; energy transfer; exercise; glycogen muscle level; human; human experiment; lipid metabolism; normal human; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Glucose; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Energy Metabolism; Exertion; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glycerol; Humans; Insulin; Ketone Bodies; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Male; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021067508

The did response of the thermal structure of Esthwaite Water to prevailing meteorological conditions was analysed for seven selected days, covering different phases of stratification. Meteorological measurements were combined with published empirical relations to compute 24‐h thermal energy budgets for 2 days. Amplitudes of diel changes were controlled by the seasonal phase of stratification and the magnitude of incident solar radiation. Heat storage usually followed a sinusoidal curve with a minimum during the night and early morning and a maximum during the late afternoon. Wind‐induced turbulent mixing, and vertical circulation induced by nocturnal cooling of the surface water through evaporative and conductive processes, also modified depth‐time trends in thermal structure. The budget accounted for almost all the thermal energy exchanges of the lake. Possible sources of a slight imbalance are considered. Although there was a positive daily surplus of net radiation, it may not always imply heat gain by the lake as it may be counter‐balanced by heat losses through fluxes of latent and sensible heat, Net back‐radiation was a major component of daily heat loss. The combined latent and sensible heat fluxes also accounted fora high proportion of heat loss to the atmosphere. Net flow of sensible heat to the lake was small but not always inappreciable. Net daily heat storage represented 26% (9 May) and 13% (17 June) of solar radiation Input. Advected energy due to lake inflow and outflow was negligible. Qualitative comparisons are made with long‐term (seasonal and annual) energy budgets and heat fluxes. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

The variation of free to bound folate with hemoglobin concentration showed that a single molecule of the pteroylpolyglutamate is bound by deoxyhemoglobin tetramers and by αβ dimers in oxyhemoglobin. Although the binding sites are different, the affinity constants are the same and very similar to the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate binding energy. Nevertheless, in view of the small proportion of dimers in oxyhemoglobin much more pteroylhepta(glutamate) is bound by deoxyhemoglobin over a wide range of hemoglobin concentrations. Because even 2% deoxyhemoglobin is enough to bind all of the erythrocyte folate as polyglutamate, the bulk of it will be bound at physiological oxygen pressure. Free folate could only be expected in fully oxygenated erythrocytes. Therefore, the reaction of pteroylpolyglutamates with hemoglobin represents an oxygenation-dependent storage mechanism that can account for the 40-fold excess of the vitamin in the erythrocyte over the amounts in the serum.

In the future, the amounts of radioactive wastes deliberately released into the Pacific Ocean may increase in connection with planned commercial‐scale nuclear fuel reprocessing operations, recommencement of plutonium production for weapons purposes, and resumption of sea dumping of low‐level wastes. Proposed storage of spent nuclear fuel on Pacific island sites or disposal of high‐level wastes in the deep seabed of the Pacific could also expose the ocean to a risk of contamination by long‐lived radio‐nuclides. The consequences of all these activities should be assessed in practical terms—their likely effects on the living marine resources of the Pacific and the economic development of the societies benefited by them; in terms of the legal principles which govern activities such as marine radioactive waste disposal that could pollute the marine environment; and in relation to current and future organizational arrangements that could achieve political resolution of outstanding international nuclear energy issues. Despite the prospective dangers of marine nuclear activities, the use of relatively remote or extraterritorial marine locations including those in the Pacific basin for nuclear operations could provide a basis for international cooperation on management of the “back end”; of the nuclear fuel cycle, including storage and reprocessing of spent fuel and high‐level waste disposal. A broadly recognized international regime for the nuclear fuel cycle could be based on regional organization of such back‐end operations, provided local acceptance could be obtained. © 1983 by Crane, Russak and Company, Inc.",,"radioisotope; geographic distribution; nonhuman; nuclear power plant; prevention; radioactive waste; theoretical study; therapy; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021040240

In a sequence of three papers, an analytical technique together with a numerical solution method will be presented to describe the sloshing phenomenon accurately and efficiently. This first paper introduces a linear theory of viscous liquid sloshing and formulates a boundary value problem subject to appropriate conditions. Viscosity is included in the problem formulation and its effects are properly accounted for. The second paper will describe a solution of the problem in function space by the truncation of infinite series. Boundary conditions are satisfied through the use of Fourier series expansions. However, the no-slip condition at the side walls can also be treated in a least-squares sense. Among the results that will be reported in the third paper are the effects of viscosity on liquid sloshing phenomenon and the dependence of viscous dissipation on the Reynolds and Froude numbers. Furthermore, the influence of the tank aspect ratio on viscous dissipation has been explored. These results demonstrate some unknown features of the functional relationships that exist between the dissipated energy and the Reynolds and Froude numbers. Similarly, the dependence of the dissipated energy on the aspect ratio has been analytically studied. The results obtained agree with the physical laws for the range of parameters investigated. © 1983.",,"storage tanks; FLOW OF FLUIDS - Viscous; MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATIONS - Fourier Transforms; TANKS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021030721

The sequence within each major volcanic cycle (six occurred in the last 17,000 years) seems to be characterized by an inverse power distribution of energy release. The large-scale Plinian eruptions are the main perturbing events. Subsequent episodes tend to restore the pre-Plinian quasi-equlibrium conditions. The clear direct relation apparent between the length of the repose intervals, the volumes of erupted products and the degree of evolution of the erupted magmas, strongly suggest a continuous supply and storage of deep basic magma within a shallow magma chamber where magma is subject to crystal fractionation. A vertical compositional stratification forms within the reservoir because differentiation proceeds with continuous feeding of deep magma. The longer the repose-time and the larger the volume of stored magma, the more highly-evolved is the top of the stagnant magma. Triggering of the eruptions in closed conduit conditions essentially can be ascribed to the volatile pressure increase related to crystallization. The load of cover rocks is then a critical factor in determining the length of repose-time and the type of eruption. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021019667

Other manipulations which increase energy expenditure (e.g., cold exposure or overfeeding) enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and stimulate BAT fatty acid synthesis/uptake. We examined the effect of estradiol treatment on the in vivo distribution of newly-synthesized fatty acids in OVX rats and hamsters. In both species estradiol treatment increased BAT fatty acid synthesis/uptake (incorporation of tritium from (3H)2O into lipid), consistent with the possibility that enhanced thermogenesis in BAT may contribute to estradiol-induced energy expenditure. Estradiol treatment increased BAT lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in hamsters, but not in rats. Thus, hamsters may utilize fatty acids synthesized in other tissues as a fuel for BAT thermogenesis, whereas rats may rely more on in situ lipogenesis. Estradiol-induced decreases in carcass adiposity (white adipose tissue mass) may be accomplished by different means in rats and hamsters. Estradiol treatment reduced white adipose tissue LPL activity and fatty acid synthesis/uptake in rats, but not in hamsters. While there are some species differences in the effects of estradiol on lipid metabolism, it appears that in both rats and hamsters estradiol acts to direct metabolic fuels (especially lipids) away from white adipose tissue storage depots and into tissues where they are oxidized (e.g., BAT). Finally, cold acclimation and estradiol had similar effects in OVX hamsters including increases in BAT fatty acid synthesis/uptake. BAT LPL activity, and energy expenditure. These findings, too, are consistent with a role for BAT in estradiol-induced thermogenesis. © 1983 Pergamon Press Ltd.","Brown adipose tissue; Energy expenditure; Lipogenesis","estradiol; estradiol benzoate; animal experiment; brown adipose tissue; cold exposure; drug distribution; drug efficacy; endocrine system; energy expenditure; fatty acid h 3; female genital system; lipogenesis; nonhuman; ovariectomy; rat; thermogenesis; Acclimatization; Animal; Body Composition; Brown Fat; Castration; Estradiol; Fatty Acids; Female; Glycerol; Hamsters; Lipoprotein Lipase; Mesocricetus; Muridae; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tissue Distribution; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021018736

In man, the control system for food intake may be overwhelmed by psychological or social influences and the thermogenic response to a variable energy input may play an important role in the energy regulatory system. Energy expenditure can be divided into 3 components: basal metabolic rate, thermogenesis and physical activity. Of these 3 components, thermogenesis, (i.e. the energy expended above the metabolic rate in the resting state) is the expenditure. The two main factors which contribute to thermogenesis, i.e food intake and cold exposure, elicit diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), respectively. It is of interest to study thermogenesis in individuals who present a tendency to gain weight, in order to assess whether the thermogenic responses may be lower in these subjects than in lean controls. It has recently been shown that DIT consists of two separate components which can be described as ""obligatory"" and ""regulatory"" thermogenesis. The former is due to the energy costs of digesting, absorbing and converting the nutrients to their respective storage forms. The latter is an energy dissipative mechanism, mainly studied in animals. There is good experimental evidence showing that brown adipose tissue (BAT) is involved in the adaptive thermogenesis observed in rats fed a varied and palatable ""cafeteria"" diet. In addition, a thermogenic defect in BAT has been demonstrated in adult as well as young genetically obese animals, and this defect is present not only in adult, but also in young (12 day old) ob/ob mice, i.e. before the development of obesity. Thus, a defective thermogenesis seems to be a cause, rather than a consequence, of obesity in these animals. In man, the role of thermogenesis in energy balance regulation is not yet understood. Some conflicting results may have arisen from inadequate techniques to measure energy expenditure. In our laboratory, we have developed three different techniques to measure energy expenditure in man, namely direct calorimetry, indirect calorimetry using an open-circuit ventilated hood system, and a respiratory chamber. Data from recent studies on DIT in man support the concept that a defect in thermogenesis may contribute to energy imbalance and weight gain in obese individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"adult; age; aged; animal; biological model; body weight; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; diet; digestion; energy metabolism; fat intake; female; human; male; metabolism; obesity; protein intake; review; thermoregulation; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Animals; Body Temperature Regulation; Body Weight; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Digestion; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021010770

The isolation of radiation resistant strains was performed by irradiation with screening doses ranging from 10 to 35 kGy and test pieces containing 106 to 108 CFU in dried serum-broth, representing 100 to 5000 colonies of primary cultures of microorganisms from 7 different sites. In an examination of 16900 colonies of aerobic microorganisms from 3 hygienically controlled production sites and 4 uncontrolled ones, 30 strains of bacteria were isolated. Of those 15 were classified as genus Bacillus, 9 as Micrococcus and 6 as Sarcina. All of the 15 strains of Gram positive sporeforming aerobic rods exhibited an exponential decrease in the surviving fraction as a function of dose, indicating that the inactivation of spores of aerobic rods is a consequence of a single energy deposition into the target. All strains were found to be moderately resistant to radiation with D-6 values (dose required to reduce survival to 6 log cycles) between 18 and 26 kGy. All of the isolated Gram positive cocci showed inactivation curves having a shoulder, indicating that different processes are involved in the inactivation of these cells, e.g. accumulation of sublethal lesions, or final repair capacity of potential lethal lesions. Moderate radiation resistance was observed in 13 strains with D-6 values between 16 to 30 kGy. Two slow-growing, red pigmented strains tentatively classified as genus Micrococcus isolated from uncontrolled sites (human dwellings) were exceptionally resistant with D-6 more than 45 kGy. For hygienically controlled sites, Gram positive spereforming rods composed two thirds of the resistant microflora, while Gram positive cocci comprised one third. For hygienically uncontrolled sites this ratio was reversed. An assumption is made that one isolated strain has grown up from one CFU in the original microflora. In the light of the observed proportion of radiation resistant bacteria in microflora from hygienically controlled radiation sterilization processing environments, and assuming an initial contamination of 50 CFU per product unit, there is no more than one chance of a contaminated item remaining within a population of 107 items subjected to sterilization by exposure to a radiation dose of 25 kGy. © 1983.",,"DUST; ELECTRON BEAMS; GAMMA RAYS; AEROBIC MICROORGANISMS; BACILLUS; GRAM POSITIVE SPORE-FORMING AEROBIC RODS; MICROCOCCUS; SARCINA; GAMMA RAYS; BACTERIOLOGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021005740

To store energy for space heating a building, two approaches can be adopted: store the energy as thermal energy, or convert the energy for storage with a subsequent conversion to heat when there is a demand. The conversion method is illustrated by the storage of solar radiation in electrical batteries for subsequent use as the supply to resistance heaters. Of course, duration of storage has a bearing on the choice of method. While 12 hours of storage may be sufficient to take advantage of off-peak electricity tariffs, storing the summer sun's heat over six months for winter use would maximize the impact of a solar heating system. Energy can be stored by heating up a substance.

For passive layers with low permeation rates, the pressure exponent increases from 0. 5 to 1 and the activation energy from 60-70 kJ/Mol to 130-170 kJ/Mol, indicating completely different permeation mechanisms compared to the unscaled alloy.

A 3‐month injection‐storage‐recovery cycle followed by a 7.3‐month cycle constituted the main experiment. The injection volumes were 25,402 m3 and 58,063 m3 at average temperatures of 58.5°C and 81°C respectively. Unlikely previous experiments at the Mobile site, no clogging of the injection well due to clay particle swelling, dispersion, and migration was observed. This is attributed to the fact that the supply water used for injection contained a cation concentration equal to or slightly greater than that in the native groundwater. For cycles I and II, the fraction of injected energy recovered in a volume of water equal to the injection volume was 0.56 and 0.45 respectively. Both groundwater temperature and tracer data support the conclusion that this relatively low recovery was due to the detrimental effects of free thermal convection, possibly augmented by longitudinal zones of high permeability. Construction of a partially penetrating recovery well improved recovery efficiency but is not thought to be an adequate solution to thermal stratification. A maximum increase of 1.24 cm in relative land surface elevation was recorded near the end of second cycle injection. The engineering implications of such an elevation change would have to be considered, especially if an ATES system were being designed in an urban environment. A third cycle was started at the Mobile site on April 7, 1982. This final experiment contains a partially penetrating, dual‐recovery well system which is expected to maximize energy recovery from a thermally stratified storage aquifer.

However, the influence on the chemical and microbiological composition of groundwater is insufficiently known. The nature and the extent of this influence can best be studied in the field. An understanding of the transport of heat in the aquifer will be indispensable for the planning of field experiments. For this purpose several aspects of non-steady and periodic heat transport are discussed, with special attention to the heat exchange between an aquifer and its adjacent layers. As in the case of steady heat transport, the changes of the temperature around an injection well can be expressed as a function of the retention time of the injected water. Hence, the heat flow pattern can be found by the calculation of groundwater streamlines and retention times. © 1983.",,"FLOW OF WATER - Underground; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION; AQUIFERS; heat storage; numerical solution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020971542

Exchanging dietary carbohydrate with fat diminished refeeding adaptations in carbohydrate pathways (glycogen contents of liver and muscle, glucose incorporation into carbon dioxide, and triglyceride in adipose tissue), but instead facilitated lipid storage (weight of and lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue). An early specific effect of carbohydrate refeeding was an increase in the insulin response in glucose metabolic pathways in adipose tissue. Inhibiting carbohydrate absorption by a glucosidase inhibitor (Acarbose) caused a delay in energy accumulation during refeeding both in glycogen stores, and, more markedly, in adipose tissue triglyceride stores.

Capacitors for example, are one of the weakest elements in high-power pulsed systems especially when operated at high-repetition frequencies for extended periods of time. Switches are by far the weakest active components of pulse power systems. Improved insulation in systems and components is essential to increasing energy density and reliability.

Mainly the variation is built up by three components: &#x02022; seasonal variations due to the climate; &#x02022; power demand variations caused by the fluctuating production rates; &#x02022; variations due to the choice of equipment and processes. To make the best use of an energy storage it should be charged and discharged. Thus energy storages would play an important role in levelling power demand variations having short periods, e.g. differences between production and non-production hours. The transfer of energy between seasons is more advantageously solved by other means. The needs and possibilities for the use of energy storage depend upon the following factors: &#x02022; mismatch between energy source and sink; &#x02022; existence of surplus energy; &#x02022; sufficient potential levels. Energy use patterns vary according to branch due to the choice of processes. Thus the potential for short time energy storage has been investigated branch by branch. Energy storage possibilities are of different kinds in different branches of industry. Heating of buildings and tapwater as well as the use of process surplus heat for other production processes are considered. Case studies from four of the investigated branches (plastics, heat treatment, brick works and foundries) are presented including potential solutions to the storage applications. Swedish industrial energy use amounts to 417 PJ annually, corresponding to one third of the country's energy use. This study comprehends industrial branches outside the process industries (by process industries we mean the paper and pulp, chemical and iron and steel industries). Energy use within the studied branches is 135 PJ and the potential for short time energy storage is approximately 18 PJ. © 1983.",,"HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020902695

The objective of the research reported here, is the evaluation of this potential for U.K. industry. A detailed survey of a representative sample frame of U.K. industry has shown that the technical and economic potential represents about 1% of the total energy use in the manufacturing sector of the U.K. economy. Using technical constraints based on achievable power densities for a variety of storage technologies and economic constraints based on annual charge cycle frequencies, the feasible percentage of processes has been established for a variety of storage technologies. These results have been scaled using the 1980 reference energy use as a function of process operating temperature. Final scaling of the results to determine the U.K. industrial potential for storage cascades was obtained by evaluating the probability of two or more 'on-site' process cascade matches. The highest probability of a satisfactory cascade match occurs in the temperature range 100°C < T < 250°C. Steam accumulators appear to be able to contribute most to industrial energy conservation in intermittent processes.

It is known that in a ring with low beam energy the spin can be flipped by imposing a perturbation resonating with the spin motion. In high-energy rings, however, the effect of the synchrotron radiation becomes important in the above spin-flip process. This effect is quantitatively estimated in the present paper, together with the effect of synchrotron oscillations which exists in proton rings as well.

The analysis indicates that the upset threshold for DRAMs will not decrease with increased levels of integration and may improve relative to present technology. Potential improvement may be limited by statistical effects in gamma energy deposition.

Extreme value statistical techniques are used to determine worst-case cell memory loss.

Nonreproducing females have significantly more energy in somatic tissues. The bulk of this energy is in fat tissues. Standard length and 'protein' do not differ significantly. The extra energy in nonreproducers is therefore devoted predominantly to energy storage, as opposed to somatic growth. Most of the energy 'saved' by not reproducing does not appear in somatic tissues. The cause of this loss is unknown. A 2nd experiment compares the somatic growth of different stocks of Trinidadian guppies which had previously been demonstrated to devote different quantities of energy to reproduction. Increases in the amount of energy devoted to reproduction were matched by decreases in the energy devoted to somatic tissues. All stocks have equal total production.

Results of a parametric study showed that, in general, a ground-coupled storage tank performs better than a storage tank placed outdoors in the Knoxville area. Application of a next generation heat pump resulted in the most significant impact on the seasonal performance factor.

In the foreseeable future, there is far less need to retrieve nuclear waste for later use then to dispose of it in a publicly acceptable manner, beginning in the near future (middle 1980s). It is, therefore, more important to assure safety in the weakest link of this disposal process-transportation into near-Earth orbit-than to engage in a retrievable disposal beyond Earth. The disposal ""site"" should lie at minimum safe transfer energy level. Primary candidate is the space between Venus and Earth. The number of propulsion phases should be a minimum, preferably only one (out of near-Earth orbit). Lunar gravity assist can be helpful to achieve higher inclination of the heliocentric orbit relative to the ecliptic. Solidified spent fuel isotopes and actinides, sufficient to reduce the residual terrestrial waste to the radiation level of natural uranium deposits after 30-40 yr instead of 1000-1500 yr, is deposited into heliocentric orbits.

The Shuttle, with one Orbiter modified as Nuclear Waste Carrying Orbiter (NWCO) and an out of near-Earth orbit booster, provides a safe and economic transportation system at (1979$) disposal mission costs from surface to disposal orbit of less than 0.5¢/kWhe or ≤ 0.1¢/kWhe (some 70% of overall exo-disposal cost), depending on level of orbital operations (this at basic Shuttle flight cost of $30M). The orbital operations mode can be selected according to lead time and costs, and can be advanced sequentially, lowering disposal costs while at the same time financing the development of orbital operations techniques needed also for other and larger-scale exo-industrial activities. An average of 10-15 disposal missions of the NWCO is required annually, at the given conditions, to service the spent fuel of 173 reactors 1978 in operation in W.

The device was designed for use in fisheries acoustics and to analyze echoes from the sea floor. The instrument simultaneously performs the functions “echo integration” and “echo peak detection” on the sonar signal. The “echo integration” circuitry measures the relative acoustic energy of the echo while the “echo peak detection” electronics measure the probability density function (PDF) of the peak of the echo envelope. Each process is gated so the echoes may be processed in many short time intervals. In fisheries applications, estimates can be made of fish density (fish per unit volume), average backscattering cross section, and a combination of fish size and behavior. When using the device to analyze bottom echoes, it is possible to measure both the returned energy from the bottom sediment interfaces and the microrelief characteristics. The durability, flexibility, computer link, and floppy-disk data-storage features of the system are discussed. Data are presented of the processed echoes from biological organisms and the ocean bottom from a recent research cruise on the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, NC.

The second is the direct measurement of the cell heat generation using a new high temperature battery calorimeter. The results obtained by these two methods are in excellent agreement. The rate of heat generation is 40–50W per cell during the last 30% of discharge at 100A. Under certain conditions the cell reaction, initially exothermic, becomes endothermic and then exothermic again during discharge.

The high intensity and good collimation of SR overcome the problems of low throughput and resolution-limiting penumbra associated with using conventional x-ray sources. The design of a beam line for SR has to deal with two problems. First, the beam line must meet the ultrahigh vacuum standards of the storage ring, and second, the emitted radiation is horizontally uniform but very nonuniform vertically. The beam line optics consist of an oscillating cylindrical mirror that scans the reflected light vertically over the exposure area and collimates the incident radiation horizontally, thus increasing the intensity by a factor of 3.

It is assumed that the buying and selling price of electricity varies frequently during the day and that the relevant price and demand data may be accurately projected into the near future. With this system description, a mathematical model is formulated and solved by linear programming to obtain a series of periodic buy and sell decisions so as to maximize the profit from operating the small power production facility.

Utilization of a cost-effective energy storage system capable of being located near the load centers could improve load factors and maximize utilization of installed capital equipment.

Several possible configurations for an HCPS are described, together with a summary of the features and benefits.

The original formulation of this model is suitable only for power systems in which all generators are of the thermal type, which can produce unlimited energy. In modeling real utility systems, it is often necessary to include limited energy plants and storage plants. Modeling these technologies requires modifying both the master problem and the subproblems of the generalized Benders' model. The production costing subproblems require extensive changes, particularly to determine the proper loading order positions for plants of these types and to implement new formulas to compute the dual multipliers. Significant advances in this work include the discovery of energy invariance properties which reduce substantially the computation required and a new treatment of the manner in which charging storage units modify the equivalent load duration curves. Modifications of the production costing subproblem are described in this paper. A sequel, Part II, describes the modifications necessary in the master problem linear program.

Thus one advantage of SMES is the inherent high storage efficiency that is possible because energy conversion processes are avoided. The actual round-trip efficiency of a large unit is expected to be 90 percent or greater. The fast response (< 100 ms) of the system to power demand means that a diurnal storage unit can also function as a swing generator or provide system stabilisation. The major components of a SMES system are a large superconducting coil cooled by liquid helium, an ac-to-dc convertor, and a refrigerator that maintains the temperature of the helium coolant.

In this device, the transmission through the two-dimensional buried-channel CCD may be electroabsorption modulated near the GaAs cutoff wavelength since the electric field in each storage well is controlled by the transferred charge. One of the primary advantages of this modulator is the ability to electrically address the device at high speed. Analysis of the two-dimensional modulator with a silicon CCD detector array yields a projected dynamic range approximately equal to the number of modulator array elements. For arrays containing greater than 1000 elements, detector performance and nonuniformities can limit the maximum range to 30-40 dB. The device can also be optically addressed, and in this mode of operation it has a comparable dynamic range to the electrically addressed structure with an optical write energy an order of magnitude lower than liquid crystal or photorefractive light valves. An alternative mode of device operation is a waveguide mode in which the light propagates along an epitaxial layer and is modulated as it passes under a one-dimensional CCD. The detection is done by a second linear CCD. The higher modulation efficiency results in a dynamic range approximately one hundred times the number of elements but is again limited to 30–40 dB because of detector response and nonuniformities. © 1983 IEEE",,"ELECTROOPTICAL DEVICES; OPTICAL DATA PROCESSING; SEMICONDUCTING GALLIUM ARSENIDE; SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES, CHARGE COUPLED; LIGHT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020812472

A model has been developed for Environment Canada to examine the constraints on development arising from limited water availability. The model compares monthly water availability and demands at specified locations throughout a basin or basins and produces statistics of failure. Water demands are related to the level of economic activity in each major sector of the economy and, if desired, the intersectorial effects can be handled using an input-output matrix. Changes in activity in each region arising from demands in the other regions of Canada are dealt with in a similar way. As well as the demands arising from the growth in each major economic sector the model will also handle specified individual large-scale users, such as major energy-related projects. At present the demands are deterministic based on the level of economic activity, actual water demands where available, population levels for municipal supply, and area and crop type for irrigated land. The model runs on an IBM-PC and has a modular structure so that each major component can be upgraded as required. At present the model deals with surface water only. Test runs in parts of the Saskatchewan Basin show the importance of agricultural demands and some of the energy developments and the much smaller effects of growth in other sectors of the economy. Ongoing and proposed work includes modifying the agricultural model to take into account the correlation between low river flows and high irrigation demands, allowing for future changes in instream storage and including groundwater sources. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"DATA PROCESSING - Distribution Applications; ENERGY RESOURCES - Planning; WATER SUPPLY - Economics; WATER MANAGEMENT MODEL; WATER RESOURCES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020811892

The results of field observations of snowmelt and meltwater flow are used to determine parameters describing the hydraulic properties of the snowpack, and surface energy balance measurements are used as input to the model. Tests of the performance of the model show a high sensitivity to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the snowpack and to liquid water content of the snow. Saturated hydraulic conductivity can be measured with acceptable precision by simple field methods; however, measurement of liquid water content is more difficult and constitutes the major limitation affecting calibration of the model. The model is relatively insensitive to exponents in the power law equations relating conductivity, capillary pressure, and liquid water content. Meltwater wave speeds predicted by the model are somewhat slower than those observed in the field. Observations of snowpack layering and horizontal inhomogeneity of flow suggest that these features affect transient storage of meltwater and consequently cause meltwater wave speeds to differ from those predicted by a one‐dimensional model.

After 57 days of storage, production began with a dual recovery well system.

The degree of aquifer heterogeneity at the location of the present experiments was not apparent during previous experiments at a location only 109 m away, although pumping tests indicated similar values of transmissivity. Therefore aquifers with the same transmissivity can behave quite differently in a thermal sense. Heat conduction to the upper aquitard was a major energy loss mechanism. Water sample analyses indicated that there were no important changes in the chemical constituents during the third set of experiments. There was a 19% increase in total dissolved solids.

To avoid the excessive production of ozone or of corrosive products in the air surrounding the vacuum chamber it is proposed to apply the lead shield directly onto the aluminium profile. In this way the cooling circuits of the vacuum chamber can cool the lead shield which will later be necessary at increased LEP energies. Different methods of bonding the lead to the aluminium have been studied and have resulted in a cladding process using a tin-lead solder joint.

It can be explained asa parasitic mode loss due to the wall currents induced by the longitudinal Schottky noise. This noise as seen at the wall of a circular chamber of radius a extends to a typical frequency of the order w cγ/a limited by the finite opening angle of ~1/γof the fields created by a relativisitic particle. Due to the statistical longitudinal distribution of the particles the total energy loss due to the induced wall current is proportional to the total number of particles and the loss per particle becomes independent of current. This loss leads to a steady decrease of the orbit radius which can be observed for long storage times. Using these results obtained at different energies, the frequency dependence of the resistive longitudinal impedance in the range of several tens of GHz is obtained. This impedance is omparedwith the prediction of the diffraction theory.

The “PETRA instability” was explained in terms of head-tail mode coupling2and according to this model the vertical blow-up was cured by bunchlengthening changing the longitudinal damping nartition. The disadvantage of this kind of bunchlengthening is the increase of energy spread leading to a reduction of quantum life time during energy ramping. The satellite resonances are avoided by a careful steering of the longitudinal and transverse tunes. A more effective method of bunch lengthening is the use of a higher harmonic rf system. Such a system was installed in PETRA. With the higher harmonic rf system the threshold current of the vertical “PETRA instability” could be increased from 3 mA (natural bunchlength) to 15 mA (with higher harmonic rf system). Besides bunchlengthening the” higher harmonic system leads to a considerable reduction of satellite effects in the range of normal PETRA tunes.

The insertion has been used to assess the problems of running a superconducting insertion in a storage ring as well as to provide high luminosity for physics. The luminosity is increased at intersection 8 by a factor of 7. By means of dedicated collimators and orbit corrections, safe working conditions could be established for the superconducting magnets during injection, accumulation, stable beam periods and when dumping the beams. Quenches were mainly caused by large accidental beam losses. Operating parameters for all standard beam energies, including acceleration to 31.4 GeV/c, have been established. At 26.6 GeV/c, with currents of 30.6 A in ring 1 and 30.3 A in ring 2, a luminosity of 1.4 1032cm-2s-1 was obtained in the insertion. This is the highest luminosity reached so far in storage rings and it was obtained during a physics run. Satisfactory beam conditions could also be provided for antiproton physics at 26.6 GeV/c in ISR with both low-ß insertions on, in I1 and I8, respectively.

The first goal is important to the future of electron-positron physics because the rapid increase of synchrotron radiation with energy causes the cost of circular storage ring colliders to increase as the square of the center-of-mass energy whereas the cost of linear colliders increases only in proportion to the center-of-mass energy.

Beam accumulation takes place for hundreds or thousands of turns. Ring buncher frequencies for these modes are 2.795 and 503.125 MHz, respectively. The bunching waveforms must be accurately correlated with the linac frequency standard so that the injected bunches fall into the ring rf buckets at precisely zero phase angle during accumulation. The PSR's rf wave also must have excellent phase stability. Long-term stability is assured by locking the PSR frequency reference to the linac's low-noise, temperature-stabilized crystal standard and by using delay-correction circuits in the transmission-line paths. However, the short-term stability of the rf reference signal is not as easily controlled because additive spurious signals can enter the long rf-signal transmission path (1-km linac-to-PSR), causing sideband energy increases very close to the carrier frequency. This increases time jitter. Also, some phase noise is spuriously developed by the signal-processing circuits providing frequency multiplication and division, the required processes for generating the necessary harmonic and subharmonic bunching frequencies at 503.125 and 2.795 MHz, respectively. The measure of control pursued by the described circuit design will provide rf references with timing uncertainty much less than the expected uncertainty in the micropulse time of arrival at the ring, ΔT ≈ ±80 ps. For the short-bunch PSR mode where timing is much more critical than for the long-bunch mode, and where the bunching wave has a ≈2-ns period, a maximum uncertainty of ±10 ps was chosen as the error budget for the low-level rf system. This paper discusses the steps taken to develop the low-level rf reference signal with some measure of margin relative to this ±10-ps budget. Phase-locked loop stabilizers, narrow-band high rejection-rate filters, and low-noise multipliers/dividers provided the means to achieve the goal. The multiplier described in this paper is part of a considerably larger system whose function is to generate several synchronizing signals for the PSR. Without examining the details, the larger sync system must, from a basic 201.25-MHz clock rate, generate phase-coherent, low-noise cw signals of 2.795 MHz for the LF buncher, 100.625 MHz for low-precision timing, and 16.77 MHz for the prebuncher in addition to the 503.125-MHz HF buncher described above. In very general terms, implementing these requirements involved dividing the 201.25-MHz clock rate by 72 to obtain 2.795 MHz and multiplying this rate by 6 to obtain 16.77 MHz using techniques very similar to those described in this paper.

At 200 MeV the proton beam lifetime in the storage ring is extended from 10 to 4000 sec with electron cooling. The cooling times with an electron beam current of 1 A were approximately 2 sec for momentum and 5 to 10 sec for transverse cooling of the proton beam.

An extra RF system is designed to cure both these effects. The basic component of the system is an extra cavity driven through a power RF amplifier by a signal whose spectrum is composed by the even harmonics of the revolution frequency and the nfo -fs side bands. The proper input is achieved from the signal induced by the beam on a radial pick-up electrode by means of a pulsed window amplifier. The amplifier equalizes the two components of the picked-up signal, one due to energy oscillation and the other to phase oscillation and thus realizes the suitable spectrum for the input. A feedback loop ensures the normalization of that signal. Synchrotron movement stabilization and bunch length control are expected to work for stored currents up to 100 mA.

The storage ring magnet has been carefully mapped, resulting in more precise determination of beam energy and better radiometric data. The RF system has been augmented by an auxiliary second harmonic system, terminating in a novel, dual purpose cavity. This structure performs the function of the bump coil during injection, while during acceleration and stored beam operation it functions as a second harmonic cavity. In the latter mode it can either be tuned passively to suppress longitudinal bunch oscillations, or it can be driven actively to modify the longitudinal bunch shape. With proper amplitude and phasing relative to the main RF cavity, bunch lengthening can be achieved, resulting in improved beam lifetime without an increase in vertical size.

A changeover design was used. Dietary energy and nitrogen were partitioned by duplicate, 22-h indirect respiration calorimetry measurements of heat and methane production on each animal concurrent with 7-d total feces and urine collection trials. Feed and feces were analyzed for energy, N, starch and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The partial efficiency and(or) heat increment of metabolizable energy (ME) used for gain and maintenance was partitioned by regression of energy storage vs intake. At equalized gross energy intakes (adjustments made by covariance), monensin improved (P less than .01) the apparent digestibilities of energy, from 71.8 to 74.8%; NDF, from 50.5 to 57.5%, and crude protein, from 61.6 to 65.8%. Methane production averaged 5.7% of the control gross energy (GE), but was reduced by 26% (P less than .01) by monensin additions. Metabolizable energy was increased (P less than .01) from 63.3 to 66.8% of gross energy intake by monensin, resulting in an increase (P less than .01) in retained energy (64.7 to 72.3 kcal/W.75). Heat production was increased (P less than .05) by monensin, but only in proportion to the increased ME. Daily energy retentions adjusted to equal ME intake were similar with or without monensin (69.9 vs 67.1 kcal/W.75). No significant effects of monensin on the heat increment of ME use for maintenance or gain were observed. Both NEm and NEg were improved by approximately 7% by monensin; however, the relative effect on NEm vs NEg depends on method of calculation. At equalized GE intakes, approximately one-third of the improved energy utilization was explained by the reduced methanogenesis caused by monensin and two-thirds by reduced fecal losses.",,"food additive; furan derivative; methane; monensin; animal; article; biosynthesis; body weight; cattle; diet; digestion; drug effect; energy metabolism; maize; male; physiology; silage; Animals; Body Weight; Cattle; Diet; Digestion; Energy Metabolism; Food Additives; Furans; Male; Methane; Monensin; Silage; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020792114

A simple multivariable weather model, including the wind speed, the solar radiation and the rainfall, was developed. This model is used with the Monte Carlo simulation method to evaluate the reliability of the mixed generating system. Different percentages of wind and solar generation capacities were tried as well as the tilt of the solar arrays. On the basis of the simulation performed, the optimum share of wind power in the system is discussed looking at the corresponding probability of loss of load. In an existing generating system with a strong penetration of hydro power providing a significative storage capacity, like the Portuguese system, the introduction of wind and solar power appears attractive from the reliability point of view.

The theory is applied to water level observations made in six open boreholes located in crystalline rock at a test site at the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. The boreholes were uncased and intersected many open fractures so that a definitive test of the theory could not be made.

Most of the analysis and design methods are based on the concept of power supply during a number of autonomous days (NAD). This NAD value refers to the number of consecutive days in which no power is supplied to the system from the solar cell array(SCA). The storage system capacity is thus based on the required energy during NAD. Though the NAD method is simple and in many cases will assure reliable power supply, it is uneconomical. With the relative high costs of solar cells and storage batteries, this means a system that may not operate at its optimum. A new method for analysis and design of SESs is presented in this paper, which enables to determine the minimum (and thus the economical) sizes of the SCA and storage system capacity. The reliability of the system is studied by the newly introduced “loss of power supply” (LOPS) probability concept. Some systems have been designed using the new method and compared to other design methods. One of the SESs has been in operation for over two years. The measured results verify the usefulness of the new method.

In large continuous heat grids - for example Hamburg - the consumers are directly connected to the grid. The flow temperature is operated flexibly depending on the external temperature and even on the coldest day can be limited to about 135 degree C. This is a good energetic basis for combined heat and power generation with steam turbines. On the other hand, regional ″district heat rails″ connect individual, mostly smaller local district heat grids with one another. They are designed for different flow temperatures and due to the high operating pressure of the rail they have to be supplied from the rail via heat exchangers. This fact, plus the large transportation distances in the rails (up to approx. 20 km on the Lower Rhine), leads to flow temperatures of max. 180 degree C. The Lower Rhine district heat rail is discussed in detail.

A 12 in. long, 1 in. diam Inconel 617 container filled with a eutectic PCM of 64 LiF- 30MgF2-6KF salt was tested. The phase-change characteristics of the salt during melting and solidification were observed by monitoring the external axial temperature profile of the container. Energy was supplied to the sample by radiation from a resistance heater and energy was rejected to the calorimeter by radiation. The sample container was mounted in an ion-pumped vacuum chamber. Analysis of phase-change heat transfer in cylindrical geometry was based on the modified heat balance integral method of Tien which provided the solidification rate and time. The thermal diffusivity of the salt at its fusion temperature was then calculated. The experimental results obtained for the eutectic salt melting point (710°C), freezing point (671°C), latent heat of fusion (782 J/g), and thermal diffusivity (0.00799 cm2) were in good agreement with those found in the literature.

Utilization of latent heat materials for thermal energy storage has been plagued by the build‐up of solids on cooling surfaces and the resulting low heat transfer rates. A novel system has been investigated in order to alleviate these difficulties. Small droplets of latent heat material were suspended in an immiscible heat transfer fluid to form an emulsion. The generation of stable emulsions is an empirical art, for which the selection of surface‐active agents and the method of mixing play the key roles. A total of 42 latent heat storage emulsion samples were prepared using a diphenyl compound as the organic phase. Most of the samples were prepared using a high speed mixing apparatus. Several emulsified blends exhibited favourable prolonged storage and cycling behaviour. Estimates based on apparent viscosity measurements indicated that high rates of heat transfer could be obtained with this system. Assuming turbulent flow conditions and 60 per cent salt loading, a value for the mean film coefficient of heat transfer was calculated to be about 1045 J/m2 s °C. The concept offers potentially large heat exchanger cost reductions, while retaining 60 per cent of the volume savings attainable in latent heat systems.

The optimum energy storage device, in the sense of minimizing the expected cost of meeting demand, is found. The model minimizes the statistical data and permits a separation of the fuel cost from it, so that a change in fuel cost would not require a great deal of recomputation.

Insulin was infused at five rates to achieve steady-state hyperinsulinemic plateaus of 62 ± 4, 103 ± 5, 170 ± 10, 423 ± 16, and 1,132 ± 47 μU/ml.

Glucose storage (calculated from the difference between total body glucose uptake and minus total glucose oxidation) was 0.25, 0.29, 0.43, 0.49, and 0.52 g/min for each group, respectively, and represented over 60-70% of total glucose uptake.

Throughout the physiological and supraphysiological range of insulinemia, there was a significant relationship (r = 0.95, P <0.001) between the increment in energy expenditure and glucose storage, indicating an energy cost of 0.45 kcal/g glucose stored. However, at each level of hyperinsulemia, the theoretical value for the energy cost of glucose storage (assuming that all of the glucose is stored in the form of glycogen) could account for only 45-63% of the actual increase in energy expenditure that was measured by indirect calorimetry. These results indicate that factors in addition to glucose storage as glycogen must be responsible for the increase in energy expenditure that accompanies glucose infusion.",,"glucose; insulin; diagnostic agent; glucose; insulin; calorimetry; drug metabolism; endocrine system; energy expenditure; glucose blood level; glycogen synthesis; human; human experiment; intravenous drug administration; liver; thermogenesis; adult; article; energy metabolism; glucose blood level; infusion; kinetics; male; metabolism; Adult; Blood Glucose; Calorimetry; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Human; Infusions, Parenteral; Insulin; Kinetics; Male; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020731948

Even so, over the next few years much must be done to reduce fabrication cost and increase the life of arrays. The leading candidate for achieving these goals is the concentrator array, in which highly reflective surfaces concentrate solar energy onto the solar cells. Two types of concentrator arrays are being considered. One is a concentrating array element having a low geometric concentration ratio, while the other employs a cassegrainian concentrator. The cassegrainian approach requires a new cell to be developed and new techniques of incorporating the cell into the system. While the predominant problem in solar arrays has been cost, the big concerns in energy storage have been mass and lifetime. Historically, energy storage has been accomplished almost entirely by secondary nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries, which are very heavy. An attractive lighter alternative may be the bipolar nickel-hydrogen (NiH//2) battery under study at NASA-Lewis. This hybrid fuel-cell/battery uses a hydrogen electrode similar to that of the hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell to replace the cadmium plate in the NiCd system. Another, even lighter system for energy storage is being pursued at both NASA Johnson Space Center and NASA Lewis. Unlike the hybrid NiH//2 battery, it uses two fuel-cell-related technologies.

Using today's technology, two items within an electric vehicle have the greatest influence on these factors. The battery is the primary determinant of range and to a lesser extent of performance. The design of the propulsion system sets the performance level of the vehicle and has a smaller effect on range. While the battery has the greatest impact on the life cycle cost of a vehicle, the propulsion system is a much larger contributor to the purchase price. Propulsion subsystem weight, efficiency, and cost are related to the specified combination of components used. Under the United States Department of Energy's Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program, propulsion component and system advancements have been made which will result in weight savings of 35–50 percent, efficiency gains of 25 percentage points, and significantly lower cost when compared to the state of the art at the inception of the program.

Another application being considered is the storage of radioactive material. In order to avoid possible future environmental risk, extremely high security has to be guaranteed in advance for a long period. Therefore, a very precise exploration is absolutely necessary. Exploration methods already known—which are applicable during and after drilling of test holes—help in the recognition of structures in the salt only in the close vicinity of the holes. Radiowave electromagnetic methods developed for routine measurements in salt mines provide a penetration of some hundred meters. Appropriate well‐logging equipment has been designed here for measurements from surface boreholes. Discontinuities around one borehole in the salt can be detected through the electromagnetic reflection method. When measuring between two boreholes, additional reflecting zones can be detected, and attenuation of directly pathed waves can point out material with greater absorption properties between the holes. Additional attempts to use acoustic waves of nearly the same wavelength proved that it is possible to recognize the direction of signals arriving at the receiver and allow separation of P‐ and S‐waves.

The ad lib fed rats showed a clear nocturnal increase in M and H, which consisted of several discrete increases associated with discrete rises in feeding activity. In each increase, however, M and H were somewhat out of phase with each other. During feeding, a positive shift of heat storage occurred, which was repaid by H being higher than M thereafter. No such increases of M and H were observed in either the fasted ad lib fed rats or the 2-hr fed rats. The 2-hr fed rats showed a very large increase in M and H following the meal, which obscured the nocturnal increase of metabolic rate. Without food, this diurnal increase was greatly reduced but not to the minimum level, and two definite peaks of M and H associated with increased food exploratory activity, one in the day and the other at night, were obtained. There was a sharp fall in RQ 1-2 hr prior to the diurnal feeding. These observations suggest that, besides diet-induced heat production, feeding can be an additional time cue for increasing energy metabolism, but a more basic biological clock mechanism synchronizing the day-night cycle drives circadian rhythms of physical activity and biochemical processes related to energy expenditure in rats. © 1983.","Circadian rhythm; Diet-induced heat production; Direct and indirect calorimetry; Diurnal feeding; Heat balance","animal experiment; calorimetry; central nervous system; circadian rhythm; endocrine system; energy transfer; heat loss; nonhuman; rat; thermogenesis; thermoregulation; Animal; Body Temperature Regulation; Calorimetry, Indirect; Circadian Rhythm; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Feeding Behavior; Male; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020673381

In the presence of Ca2+, K+ markedly reduced the amine content of the synaptosomes, indicating an acceleration of spontaneous amine release. In the absence of Ca2+, K+ had much less effect. Monensin, nonactin and FCCP caused a release of all the three labelled amines. This release was considerably faster and more marked than that induced by K+ and showed no dependence on Ca2+.

NaCN, a blocker of oxidative energy production, did not enhance the spontaneous release of [3H]‐5‐HT nor did it influence the monensin‐induced release of [3H]‐5‐HT.

Steers fitted with simple rumen, abomasal and sometimes duodenal cannulas were given isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets consisting of pellets containing equal amounts of rolled barley and chopped straw together with tapioca alone (B), or with some tapioca replaced by coarse soya-bean meal (M) or finely ground soya-bean flour (F). Diet B had an estimated rumen degradable nitrogen (RDN): metabolizable energy (me) value of approximately 0.8 g/MJ. The corresponding value for each of the supplemented diets was 1.3-1.4. Diets were given at two levels of intake designed respectively to provide ME intakes to support weight gains of 0.5 kg/d (L) and 1.0 kg/d (H). Chromic oxide and polyethylene glycol were given as indigestible markers. Values were calculated for flows (g/24 h) at the abomasum of organic matter (om), non-ammonia-n (NAN) and microbial (bacterial)-N (MN). Estimates of MN were based on RNA and a-e-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) measurements. The steers had low rumen protozoal counts throughout the whole experiment with fewer than 8000 ciliate protozoa/ml of rumen fluid. 2. Proportions of om apparently digested between the mouth and abomasum were significantly lower for H than for L intakes but showed no other significant differences. Mean estimated efficiency of microbial protein synthesis was approximately 17 g N/kg om apparently digested in the rumen for the LB diet, but was significantly greater at approximately 26 g N/kg om apparently digested for the HB diet. The protein-supplemented diets gave values of 31–32 which were significantly greater than the value for the LB but not the HB diet. 3. Amounts of feed nitrogenous constituents surviving between the mouth and the abomasum were estimated from NAN minus MN corrected for endogenous N. Values for the proportions of feed N degraded, derived from these estimates, were 0.71, 0.66, 0.72, 0.69, 0.67 and 0.70 for diets LB, HB, LM, HM, LF and HF respectively. There were no significant differences due to level of feeding, supplementary protein or the physical form of that protein. 4. Estimates of MN flows at the abomasum based on RNA determinations in fresh samples did not differ significantly from estimates based on DAP determinations. However, storage of aqueous suspensions of mixed rumen bacteria by deep-freezing or freeze-drying resulted in significant losses of RNA. No such losses were observed for abomasal digesta. This meant that if samples were stored by these means before analysis, the use of RNA as a microbial marker was vitiated. 5. In some experiments digesta samples were taken from the duodenum as well as the abomasum. Estimates of total N flows did not differ significantly between these sites. © 1983, The Nutrition Society.

FFAs remain elevated for at least 60 minutes following the termination of exercise and may supply 30% of the total energy requirement. FFA levels return to basal levels, which may be lower than normal in trained athletes, as the muscles meet their energy demand. The transport vehicle for FFAs is albumin, which also transports a number of drugs. While FFAs are bound primarily to the primary site of the albumin molecule and drugs are bound to the secondary and tertiary sites, increased FFAs have been reported to decrease drug binding to albumin. Valproic acid, which is structurally similar to FFAs, is highly protein bound and is subject to interactions by displacement from proteins. Because low concentrations of FFA have resulted in displacement of valproic acid from protein binding sites in vitro and because exercise increases FFA in vivo, this study was conducted to determine the effects of exercise on the pharmacokinetics of valproic acid.",,"valproic acid; central nervous system; drug blood level; exercise; human; human experiment; pharmacokinetics; Adult; Exertion; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Human; Kinetics; Male; Random Allocation; Time Factors; Valproic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020663831

Chylomicron TG are first hydrolyzed by the action of lipoprotein lipase prior to tissue uptake of the TG-derived fatty acids: Although the removal of these TG by fat cells appears to favor a storage function, uptake by skeletal muscle accounts for a significant portion of the TG removed from plasma. Further, uptake of TG-derived fatty acids by skeletal muscle is increased during exercise. This could contribute to an increased rate constant for TG removal from the plasma during exercise. A significant portion of the TG-derived fatty acids that enter muscle during exercise remain in the non-esterified fatty acid pool of the muscle where they could provide a substrate for beta-oxidation. Indirect estimates of the contribution that TG-derived fatty acids may make to the total energy costs during exercise in a fasting condition may be minor.

Laser parameter requirements for undersea applications are: Wavelength (transmission window 430-550 nm); Pulse Energy (10-1000 mJ); Pulse Width (3-30 ns); Beam Divergence (5-40 m rad); Pulse Repetition Rate (10-1000 Hz); Average Power (2-20 W); Efficiency (0. 1-1%); Bandwidth (0. 1-1 nm); Beam Polarization. Present technology of blue-green lasers includes: Frequency-doubled Nd-YAG lasers (532 nm); Dye lasers (430-450 nm, tunable); Copper-vapor laser (510. 6 nm). All three of these lasers have one or more shortcomings. To attain the desired laser performance, the laser medium of choice now seems to be a gas directly excited by an electrical discharge. Rapid gas flow can be used effectively to remove excess heat from the laser medium via an external heat exchanger and a gas recycling system to replenish the gas supply. Further, to obtain maximum energy storage and conversion efficiency, molecular lasers rather than atomic are preferred. 12 refs.",,"LASERS, DYE - Research; LASERS, GAS - Research; LASERS, SOLID STATE - Research; SEAWATER - Optical Properties; BLUE-GREEN LASERS; COPPER VAPOR LASERS; NEODYMIUM-YAG LASERS; Light sources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020647992

Twenty-five adult mongrel dogs were divided into five equal groups. All dogs underwent left nephrectomy and 30 min of warm ischemia followed by Collins' C-4 flush and 24 hr of cold-storage preservation. Heterotopic autotransplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy were then performed. Group A served as controls; Group B was pretreated with intravenous ATP-MgCl2 (2.5 mM); Group C with intravenous dipyridamole (10 mg), and Group D with both ATP-MgCl2 (2.5 mM) and dipyridamole (10 mg). Group E was treated with ATP-MgCl2 (2.5 mM) at the time of transplantation. All kidneys underwent cortical biopsies at the end of preservation and 1 hr after restoration of blood flow for determinations of AMP, ADP, and ATP. In Groups A and E there were no survivors, whereas Groups B, C, and D had 40, 60, and 40% graft survival. In Groups B and D, ATP and energy charge (EC) were greater than that of controls after 24 hr of preservation, with Group D values being significantly greater (P &lt; 0.01). AMP and ADP levels were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.02) in Group C when compared to Group A. One hour posttransplantation biopsies demonstrated greater ability to regenerate cortical nucleotides in the surviving animals, but no absolute value could be identified as a predictor of viability.

Addition of simple hydroxamic acids, R1C(O)N(OH)R2 (R1 = CH3, R2 = H; R1 = C6H5, R2 = H; R1 = R2 = CN3), to an aqueous solution of ferrioxamine B at pH = 4.30, 25.0°C, I = 2.0, results in the formation of ternary complexes Fe(H2DFB)A+ and Fe(H3DFB)A2+, and tris complexes FeA3, where A- represents the bidendate hydroxamate anion R1C(O)N(O)R2-. The addition of a molar excess of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to an aqueous solution of ferroxamine B at pH 4.30 results in a slow exchange of iron(III) to eventually completely form Fe(EDTA)- and H4DFB+. The addition of a hydroxamic acid, HA, catalyzes the rate of this iron exchange reaction: {A figure is presented}. A four parallel path mechanism is proposed for reaction (1) in which catalysis occurs via transient formation of the ternary and tris complexes Fe(H2DFB) A+, Fe(H3DFB)A2+, and FeA3. Rate and equilibrium constants for the various reaction paths to products were obtained and the influence of hydroxamic acid structure on catalytic efficiency is discussed. The importance of a low energy pathway for iron dissociation from a siderophore complex in influencing mircrobial iron bio-availability is discussed. The system represented by reaction (1) is proposed as a possible model for in vivo catalyzed release of iron from its siderophore complex at the cell wall or intenor, where EDTA represents the intracellular storage depot or membrane-bound earrer and HA represents a low molecular weight hydroxamate-based metabolite capable of catalyzing interligand iron exchange. © 1983.",,"deferoxamine; edetic acid; ferric ion; ferrioxamine; hydroxamic acid; iron; edetic acid; ferrioxamine; iron; article; bioavailability; mathematics; metabolism; blood and hemopoietic system; drug binding; hemochromatosis; nonhuman; Biological Availability; Deferoxamine; Edetic Acid; Ferric Compounds; Hydroxamic Acids; Iron; Mathematics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020643331

The most cost-effective methods of waste heat dissipation involve the evaporation of water, yet most of the important hydrothermal resources of the U.S. are located in areas where cooling tower makeup water for power plants is in short supply. Flashed-steam power cycles can use condensate derived from the geofluid for tower makeup unless reinjection is necessary, as is already required at some sites. Condensate is not available from binary cycles because the geofluid is reinjected. Geothermal station makeup water requirements have been estimated at 50-100 m3/yr per kW of electrical capacity. Some of the more interesting and significant methods that are currently being studied in the U.S. for reducing waste heat dissipation system costs and water consumption are (1) allowing plant power output to vary with ambient conditions, (2) use of ammonia to transport waste heat from the turbine condenser to air-cooled coils, (3) development of a plastic-membrane type wet/dry tower, (4) marketing of steam turbines that can tolerate a wider range of back pressures, (5) use of circulating water storage to delay heat dissipation until more favourable ambient conditions exist, (6) development of tubes with enhanced heat transfer surfaces to reduce condenser capital costs, and (7) use of evaporative condensers to reduce costs in binary cycles. Many of these projects involve large-scale tests that are now installed and producing some preliminary data.

The objective is to enable the selection of the available sites in such a manner as to maximise the desirable benefits from the installation of the wind powered generators, i.e. either installed capacity displacement or fuel savings.

The results suggest that a modest size system can readily carry the entire heating load of an energy efficient home in any geographical region of the U.S. The energy required to drive the system, i.e. rolling cylinder drive energy plus air blower drive energy, is always an important fraction of the total system output. In Boston 1958 weather the seasonal COP varies from 2.5 to 5.8 depending on the particular rolling cylinder design configuration selected. 90 per cent of the system drive energy is base load for the electric utility. There are no ""coldest day peaks"" resulting from electric backup heating. A system using the highest drive energy configuration may be sized for 99.5 per cent solar system heating using the same design chart at any northern region of the U.S.A. One system sized for Boston was evaluated at seven other geographical locations. The resulting house size was always in the acceptable range. This raises the possibility that one or a few standardized system sizes could serve an area as large as the U.S. Individualized solar system design calculations would not be necessary. Cloudy weather performance was noticeably improved in Boston (1958 weather). On a seasonal basis the FMTC collector delivered three times more heat than a typical flat plate (TFP) collector and 60 per cent of that heat was collected at insolation levels which were below the functional cut-off level of the TFP collector. © 1983.",,"SOLAR ENERGY - Energy Storage; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020621621

Among the bases for new thought has been the realization that all body tissues receive an autonomic innervation and that this system affects all functions. It is involved in the minutia of reactions studied by the reductionists and in activity of the total organism studied by behaviorists. Newer knowledge suggests that the system's functions can be subdivided into 2 major categories: (1) a role in basic metabolic or vegetative functions. There are 3 realms of such involvements: in energy storage and release; in control of endocrines and neuroendocrine secretions; and in control of exocrine secretion and thus intake, conservation or loss and transformation of energy. The hypothalamus is most highly involved in these autonomic system functions; (2) a role in behavior. The hypothalamus is also highly involved, especially in alerting and defense reactions, concepts relating to Cannon's ideas of emergency function and Selye's concepts of stress. It can be said that the normal, phasic functions of the autonomic system and its involvement in organ and body reactivity are controlled in parallel with the regulation of somatic performances. The several newer interpretative ideas originating from studies of reflexes, reflex patterns and sequences, and of general behavior are the integrative role, the supportive role, the modulatory and finally the anticipatory or determinative role in behavior. The similarity of the role of the autonomic nervous system function in all species, from birds to man, has caught the attention of investigators. This rather than the specializations of the system that are appropriate to the peculiar characteristics of individual species has been emphasized; but species specializations do exist and these should be worthy of future investigation. New concepts of the system's role are evolving from old ideas and new discoveries. Newer concepts of transmitter genesis and tissue receptors are developing that add more detail to our major channels of thought concerning the autonomic system's function. There is a new realization of the system's involvement in pain. Its' directives affect and integrate organ and tissue activity; it determines behavior and expresses the sympathies and judgements of man. © 1983.","behavior; conditioning; control of secretion; geriatrics; integration; metabolism; modulators; receptors; stress; transmitters","animal; autonomic nervous system; autonomic reflex; behavior; conditioning; endocrine system; energy transfer; exocrine secretion; hypothalamus; nervous system; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; short survey; stress; Aging; Animal; Arousal; Autonomic Nervous System; Behavior, Animal; Conditioning, Classical; Neurotransmitters; Receptors, Neurotransmitter; Reflex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020606977

The recyclable liquid carrier is ⇄ The system is called MTH for Methylcyclohexane, Toluene, Hydrogen.) All the technical processes proposed for this system are well established. The dehydrogenation reaction occurs in a catalytic reactor (>400°C, approx. 20 bar) on the vehicle. The hydrogenation occurs in a regional plant, servicing approx. 195 vehicles in which the hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water [22 MW (el)] and catalytically reacted with toluene, transforming it into methylcyclohexane. As a reference vehicle a 17 ton lorry having a 150 kW (mec) engine and an operating range of approx. 250 km per day for 250 days per year is taken. The catalytic reactor for the dehydrogenation on the vehicle has a volume of approx. 501. The tank for methylcyclohexane, the carrier of hydrogen, is approx. 7101. (equivalent: 100 kg gasoline). The cold start is based on the direct burning of toluene. The overall energy consumption is split up as 90% from hydrogen (electrical energy) and 10% from the direct burning of toluene (fossil fuel). The complete MTH system after 30 years with approx. 15,000 lorries consumes 5.4 TWh (el) per year during the night and at weekends during 235 days of 'summer'.

The basic methods of heating and cooling of buildings are: out-going long wave radiation, water evaporation, solar radiation and nocturnal radiation cooling. Long wave radiations emitted by the surface of the earth to the atmosphere and outer space is very strong in a desert climate and is effective from a roof surface area. Water evaporation by desert coolers is the method of cooling in arid regions. Solar absorption cooling and solar dehumidification and evaporative cooling are the two approaches which utilize solar energy for the generation of working fluid and cooling the dwellings. Nocturnal radiation both heats in winter and cools in summer, in suitable climates, and does so with no non-renewable energy other than a negligible amount required to move the insulation twice a day. The difficulty encountered in the utilization of natural energies is the large area to be exposed with suitable orientation for collection of energy and large space requirement for the storage of thermal energy.",,"HEATING - Solar; HUMIDITY CONTROL - Applications; SOLAR RADIATION - Applications; WATER - Evaporation; PASSIVE SOLAR COOLING; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020593202

Electricity demand and available power are specified by empirically based probability distribution functions and the plant mix which minimizes the total annualized costs of the generating system is determined.

Explicit expressions for the transient rate of heat extraction and the temperature at which heat can be extracted, as a function of time, depths of convective as well as non‐convective zones and the flow rate, are derived. Extensive analytical results for the optimum performance of a pond during its year round operation are presented. In a pond with an upper convective zone depth of 0.2 m optimum heat extraction efficiencies of 24 per cent, 29 per cent and 32 per cent corresponding to heat extraction temperatures of 89, 55 and 42°C are predicted for water flow rates of 2 × 10−4, 5 × 10−4 and 10−3 kg/s m2, respectively. The load levelling in the extracted heat flux as well as in its temperature improves as the flow rate is lowered and the non‐convective zone is over sized. An increase in the total depth of the solar pond improves the load levelling in extraction temperature, but influences the extracted heat flux differently; shifts its maximum to winter months and deteriorates the load levelling. The variability in flow rate required for the maintenance of constant temperature of the heat extraction zone is also investigated. It is found that the required variability is less for higher temperatures of the heat extraction zone and larger depths of the non‐convective zone.

The aims of this project are to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production by the solar-assisted electrolysis of water, and to improve the storage processes, in particular those using hydrides, with a view to designing, building and demonstrating a prototype system at a later stage. Titanium electrodes were developed for producing hydrogen from solar energy, at an efficiency of approximately 2%, and an Australian patent was obtained for the process. Further improvements in efficiency were sought by preparing other semi-conducting films, modifying the titanium electrodes, and investigating the mechanisms of hydrogen production. The spectral response of titanium oxide electrodes was broadened slightly by chromium, but the overall efficiency decreased. Iron/iron oxide and several metal/metal sulphide and selenide systems appear promising. Hydrogen was stored as iron-titanium hydride using alloys prepared by argon arc melting and induction melting in batches of up to 2 kg weight. Facilities are available for 100 kg batches.

Aqueous dispersions of both of the modified starches exhibited non‐Newtonian, pseudoplastic flow with little thixotropy and some irreversible shear breakdown. Apparent viscosities, determined from the apices of flow curves obtained at constant maximum shear rate, decreased progressively with increase in temperature over the range 10–50 °C. An Arrhenius plot gave a low apparent activation energy of flow for Primojel. The two modified starches showed a marked rise in apparent viscosity with rise in pH from 3 to 11 of the dispersion medium. Only Instant Clearjel dispersions exhibited a linear viscoelastic region in creep testing, studies which confirmed that this system behaved as a viscoelastic liquid. Sedimentation studies on 10% w/v sulphadimidine suspensions containing varying concentrations of either suspending agent indicated that 3% w/v Primojel could form permanent suspensions even after 6 months storage at room temperature.

In the first, the separation of the gases NH3 and CO2 is achieved by compression and liquefaction of NH3. In the second, a method of separation of the gases is proposed which is based on the solubility of NH3 in ethanol while CO2 is practically insoluble. The operation of this system is examined both in closed form and in the case in which CO2 is rejected in the atmosphere, and it is taken from alcoholic fermentation or from the combustion gases of power plants burning lignite. The mass and energy balance is given, for each case, and the amount of energy losses by the use of this storage system is calculated.

The control system features a modular local computer network, whose redundancy can be designed to meet any availability requirement of a specific application, using the same hardware building blocks. The intrinsic redundancy applies to the component level, with an orderly overlapping, as opposed to a complete system redundancy which Is more costly and less reliable. The control software is hierarchical and distributed with a redundant structure and topology. The local computer network uses simple packet switching and routing decision making techniques, based on a contention method which presents the advantage to convey messages in the order of their priority.

The development of a new, advanced, water electrolyser has become necessary for use in hydrogen energy systems and in electricity storage systems. All the new possible electrolysis processes, suitable for large-scale plants, are being analysed, in view of their combination with solar electricity source. A study of system interactions between large-scale photovoltaic plants, for electrical energy supply, and water electrolysis, is carried out. The subsystems examined include power conditioning, control and loads, as they are going to operate. Water electrolysis systems have no doubt been improved considerably and are expected to become the principal means to produce a large amount of hydrogen in the coming hydrogen economy age. Thus, the present paper treats the subject of hydrogen energy production from direct solar energy conversion facilities located on the earth's oceans and lakes. Electrolysis interface is shown to be conveniently adapted to direct solar energy conversion, depending on technical and economical feasibility aspects as they emerge from the research phases. The intrinsic requirement for relatively immense solar collection areas for large-scale central conversion facilities, with widely variable electricity charges, is given. The operation of electrolysis and photovoltaic array combination is verified at different insolation levels. Solar cell arrays and electrolysers are giving the expected results during continuously variable solar energy inputs. Future markets will turn more and more towards larger scale systems powering significantly bigger loads, ranging from hundreds of kW to several MW in size. Detailed design and close attention to subsystem engineering in the development of high performance, high efficiency photovoltaic power plants, are carried out. An overall design of a 50 MWp photovoltaic central station for electricity and hydrogen co-generation is finally discussed. © 1983.",,"ECONOMICS; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR POWER PLANTS; WATER - Electrolysis; BIPOLAR ELECTROLYZER; PHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATOR; SOLAR-HYDROGEN PLANTS; HYDROGEN FUELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020237895

These are: (1) its diffuse nature and relatively low level of intensity, and (2) its diurnal intermittency and periodic variations. The first-mentioned factor implies a need for large collecting and concentrating devices and vast land areas, which may not always be available, especially in densely populated and industrialized localities, where the energy need will be most. Location of the collectors far removed from the centers of demand will engender the problems of energy transmission. The obvious solution to these problems is to provide an effective means by which sunshine energy can be stored in a form that can be transported and used subsequently when and where required. Conversion to hydrogen through the highly endergonic dissociation of water provides a very capacious and versatile means for solar energy storage and distribution. More importantly, it 'decouples' the primary energy source completely from its end-uses and thus enables it to subserve all the energy needs of industrialized society, unhampered by the constraints characteristic of the prime source and indeed, as efficiently as petroleum fuels. The paper discusses the merits of this proposal and the methods by which it may be achieved in the near term and long term. © 1983.",,"ECONOMICS; HYDROGEN FUELS; OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION; SOLAR POWER PLANTS; DESERT SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION (DESEC); SOLAR-PHOTOVOLTAIC (SPV); SOLAR-THERMAL-ELECTRIC CONVERSION (STEC); SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020220841

Fissile fuel is produced by the Spallator which depends on the production of spallation neutrons by the interaction of high energy (1 to 2 GeV) protons on a heavy metal target. The neutrons are absorbed in a surrounding natural uranium or thorium blanket in which fissile Pu-239 or U-233 is produced. Advances in linear accelerator technology makes it possible to design and construct a high beam current continuous wave proton linac for production purposes. The target is similar to a sub-critical reactor and produces heat which is converted to electricity for supplying the linac. The Spallator is a self-sufficient fuel producer, which can compete with the fast breeder. The APEX fuel cycle depends on recycling the transuranics and long-lived fission products while extracting the stable and short-lived fission products when reprocessing the fuel. Transmutation and decay within the fuel cycle and decay of the short-lived fission products external to the fuel cycle eliminates the need for long-term geological age storage of fission product waste.

Hydrogen produced by electrolysis using hydro- or nuclear-generated electricity will be available in Canada at prices competitive with other portable forms of energy before the end of the century. This paper examines the use of carbon-free electrolytic hydrogen as a motor vehicle fuel and as a fuel for fuel cells. A review of onboard hydrogen storage systems indicates that the propulsion power unit of hydrogen-fueled vehicles must be considerably more efficient than present gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines in order to compensate for the larger size and greater weight of hydrogen storage systems. Hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines are more efficient than similar gasoline-fueled engines, but the improvement is not sufficient to offset the storage system limitation. Fuel cells operate with much higher efficiency than internal combustion engines, especially at partial loads. A comparison between H3PO4 and KOH fuel cells show that where carbon-free hydrogen is available from the onboard storage system, the KOH fuel cell offers the higher level of performance. © 1983.",,"HYDROGEN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019694756

The rate of growth in total demand slowed in he post-1973-1974 era, yet is expected to double within the next 10 years. This situation places a heavy burden on the balance of foreign trade and payments and makes a vigorous energy saving policy mandatory. Indigenous oil began to be tapped in 1980 and its use is expected to increase considerably, yet imported oil will remain the principal source of energy in the years to come. The development of indigenous lignite and shale oil has to await the perfection of appropriate technologies and is earmarked for the post-1990 period. The Government's energy saving policy was initiated in 1973 and culminated in the appointment of a National Energy Conservation Committee. Its four subcommittees act in the following areas: 1. (1) ""Communication & Transportation"" focuses on improving energy efficiency of motor vehicles by ensuring a smooth flow of traffic in Bangkok. 2. (2) ""Industry"" promotes efficiency in industrial energy uses by counselling, advising and monitoring. 3. (3) ""Electricity"" faces shortages because successive years of drought have seriously depleted the storage basins of hydroelectric plants. Remedial action consists principally in measures for leveling peaks in the energy demand. 4.

This is mainly because of errors involved in forecasting the natural inflows to the reservoirs or demands for water and energy or both. Current models used for operation usually require the use of large computers because of their core-storage and computation-time requirements. Frequent use of such models for the purpose of updating will often result in high computation cost and usually involves long turnaround times. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for the monthly operation of a system of two parallel multipurpose reservoirs that is solved with a minicomputer. The operation model is applied to Shasta and Folsom reservoirs of the California Central Valley Project, and the results are reviewed. © ASCE.",,"MATHEMATICAL MODELS; WATER RESOURCES - Management; WATER SUPPLY; ALGORITHMS; RESERVOIRS; California; Folsom reservoir; minicomputer; Shasta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013731988

The heat stored is used by the fan coils depending upon their regulation requests. All the components were tested separately on site or/and in the laboratory. Those preliminary tests, allowed better understanding of the system when everthing was working. Complete measurements were made during the winter in the normally occupied house. The results showed an unfortunately low global coefficient of performance because of the auxiliaries, consumption and several irreversibilities. Some optimization and improvement should be necessary to get better performance with such a system, nevertheless, it seems to be possible to reach effective energy savings.

Heat is extracted by injecting water into one well, flowing it through the fractured region and recovering the heated water from the second well. The produced fluid is cooled on the surface and reinjected into the system. The first reservoir was formed by fracturing the injection well at a depth of 2.75 km where the initial rock temperature was 185° C. A heat-extraction experiment conducted in this reservoir was run from January 27 to April 13, 1978. A second, larger reservoir was created after cementing the fracture-to-wellbore connections at 2.75 km in the injection well and refracturing 180 m deeper. This second reservoir was tested from October 23 to November 16, 1979. During each of these experiments, samples of the geothermal fluids and gases were collected at regular intervals from the injection wellhead, the production wellhead, and at the make-up pump which provided the water from storage ponds to replace the water lost downhole by permeation into the reservoir walls. Changes in the composition of the produced fluid provide a means for studying the reservoir behaviour under normal (recirculating) operating conditions. Certain of the dissolved species appear to be derived by displacement of an indigenous pore-fluid, while others appear to be derived by dissolving minerals known to be present in the reservoir rock. In this paper we describe the results of the chemical analysis of the geothermal fluids and relate the fluid and gas chemistry to geochemical processes that result from the heat- extraction experiments. In particular, the implications of the silica and NaKCa geothermometers and the pore-fluid displacement theory are examined for insight about the long-term effects of fluid geochemistry on heat extraction from HDR reservoirs. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011550866

Since chB is a nonsolvent for polystyrene, the S blocks precipitate to form spherical microdomains, and micelles with S cores and B cilia are formed in the blends. As long as the SB content is low, such a blend shows a Newtonian behavior in the region of low frequency. However, when the SB content exceeds a certain critical value, the blend exhibits a plateau in the low-frequency tails of the storage (G’) and loss (G”) moduli. The plateau is often called a second plateau and is related to some slow relaxation process existing in the system. The critical concentration almost coincides with the concentration at which the micelles begin to contact and their cilia begin to overlap with each other. Nevertheless, the activation energy of flow for the SB/chB blends in any concentration is the same as that of the chB homopolymer. These results suggest that the slow relaxation mechanism is related to the motion of the entangled B blocks with one end anchored on the S core. The longest relaxation time τp for such slow relaxation process increases exponentially with increasing concentration. This exponential enhancement is typical to the relaxation of a polymer chain with a spatially fixed end, often employed as a model for the star-shaped polymers. From this viewpoint, the ‘tube’ model of Doi and Edwards was employed for partially entangled B blocks with one end anchored on the S core. The dependencies of τp for the five SB /chB blends on the concentration and molecular weight of SB could be reduced to a universal relation, which coincided with the theoretical results derived from the tube model. © 1983, American Chemical Society.

The angular distribution of the dipion axis relative to the collision axis is found to be independent of both the effective mass m of the dipion system and the centre-of-mass energy √s of the proton-proton collision. The cross-sections dσ dm at the values of √s satisfy a scaling law of the form dσ dm = G(x) mn, where x = m(π0, π0)//trs and n = 6.5 ± 0.5. We show from our data that the leading π0 carries most of the momentum of the scattered parton. Given this fact, the axis of the dipion system follows closely the direction of the scattered constituents, and we exploit this to determine the angular dependence of the hard-scattering subprocess.

New wide energy bandwidth monochromators now being developed will provide intense monochromatic beams which will make practical the use of the wavelength dispersive crystal spectrometers. The sensitivity calculations presented are applied to representative thin biological and geological samples. The storage ring parameters used are the design parameters of the National Synchrotron Light Source. The quantitation limits (σ=10%) for a thin biological sample using a solid state detector is less than 1 ppm for low Z elements and 1-10 ppm for high Z elements for one minutev irradiations. Using fixed multicrystal wavelength dispersive spectrometers quantitation limits range from 3-30 ppb for biological samples and 30-300 ppb for geological samples.

(in the absence of any added energy source) accomplished by the catecholamine storage organelle of bovine adrenal medulla was studied and correlated to changes of the components of ΔμH generated by the organelle across its membrane. These data were compared with those of ATP-P. exchange (in the presence of ATP-Mg, the substrate of the H -translocating ATPase of the storage organelle). The ADP-Mg induced ΔμH across the membrane was only slightly lower than that induced by ATP-Mg. Membrane ghosts were not able to form ATP because of low ΔμH values. With the increase of pH of the medium (pH 6-8) ΔμH increased (increase of ΔpH and decrease of ΔΨ). Δ Ψ Contributed to ΔμÍ 70% at pH 6 and 35% at pH 8, when ATP-Mg was the ΔμH inducing nucleotide; in the case of ADP-Mg corresponding figures were 60 and 17%. The intravesicular pH shifted by l pH unit by changing the medium pH 2 units. pH optimum for ATP-Pi exchange was at pH 7.0, while ATP synthesis increased up to pH 8.0. ADP-Mg evoked a 2-fold enhanced catecholamine efflux compared to that with ATP-Mg. Ca2+ abolished both the ATP forming reactions; chelation of Mg2+ only affected ATP synthesis, while ATP-Pi remained unchanged. Addition of Pi at various times after the addition of the nucleotide resulted in acceleration of the ATP forming reactions, particularly of ATP synthesis, and in a drop of ΔΨ at an unchanged ΔpH. Raising the temperature from 0 °C to 31 °C resulted in abrupt liberation of 10 - 12% of the stored catecholamines, followed by a more moderate release with constant rate over 30 min. ADP-Mg was more effective than ATP-Mg. Catecholamine release due to rise of temperature was paralelled by instant generation of ΔμH increasing from 65 mV (0 °C) to 150mV(31 °C), to which both components of ΔμH have contributed. A ΔpH of 0.6 -0.7 pH units indicated an internal pH of 6.9 - 7.0 at 0 °C. Cooling down to 0 °C after heating for 10 min resulted in the decay of ΔΨ within 1-2 hours, while ΔpH remained constantly high over 5 hours. The high concentration gradient of catecholamine across the membrane is proposed to represent the source from which - due to heat - and particularly ADP-induced catecholamine release - a ΔμH is generated that drives ATP synthesis. The ATPase-driven H influx contributed only a small portion to ΔμH. Thus, ATP synthesis at the expense of catecholamines, released from the catecholamine storage organelle, represents the complete reversal of the ATP hydrolyzing reaction, by which ATP is consumed to accumulate catecholamines. © 1982.","ΔμH induced by ATP-Mg or ADP-Mg; ATP synthesis; ATP-P exchange; catecholamine release; energy source for ATP synthesis; internal pH; revers bility of ATP hydrolysis; temperature dependence of ΔμH",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049134487

The review consists of three parts; preflare magnetic energy storage, magnetic energy conversion mechanisms, and preflare triggers. In Section 2, the relationship between magnetic energy storage and the electrodynamic coupling of the solar atmosphere is developed. By accounting for the electrodynamic coupling of the solar atmosphere, we are able to examine the fundamental problems associated with the concept of in situ versus remote magnetic-energy storage. Furthermore, this approach permits us to distinguish between the roles of local and global parameters in the storage process. Section 3 is focused on the conversion mechanisms that can explain, in principle, the rapid energy release of a flare. In addition, we discuss how electrodynamic coupling eventually dictates which mechanism(s) is responsible for releasing the stored magnetic energy, and how the global coupling dictates the final evolution of the relevant mechanism. Section 4 examines preflare triggers and Section 5, we examine the most promising directions for future research into the problem of magnetic-energy storage and conversion of the Sun. © 1982 D.

This article reports the results of that investigation. These results indicated that, on the average, less than half of the preestablished EPI cold chain standards were being met. Cold chain implementation and control activities at the airport and main supply center appeared especially deficient - most notably in ensuring regular arrival of vaccine shipments at the scheduled times; securing advance customs clearance for these shipments; recording temperatures; and equipping the main supply center with a self-contained energy source, rooms dedicated excusively to vaccine storage, and permanent alarm and temperature monitoring systems. Notable deficiencies found at the regional storage facilities had probably encouraged these facilities to become mere intermediaries that sent vaccines on to local clinics as soon as they were received.It was decided that a study of the cold chain should be conducted in Chile in an effort to identify situations that could be corrected and to improve the technical and administrative development of the program. Specifically, study objectives were as follows: to determine the degree to which the EPI standards for procurement, receipt, transfer, control, maintenance, and distribution of vaccines were being met; to assess the turnover, knowledge, and training of auxiliary vaccination personnel against the relevant standards established for vaccine and cold chain management; to determine the antigenic potency of measles vaccine samples available at the time visits were made to local clinics, regional health storage sites, and the central supply facility; and to test a written instrument designed for the express purpose of assessing achievement of the first 2 objectives cited. The study sought to provide a descriptive assessment of work being performed at the central, regional, and local levels in the Metropolitan Region. The operating units involved included the airport and main supply center at the central level; the 7 storage facilities of the Metropolitan Region's 78 local clinics providing maternal and child health care. 40 clinics, selected by lot, represented 51% of the region's 78 clinics and provided coverage for 49% of the population assigned to the region's health services. The units studied failed to satisfy half the investigated Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) standards, i.e., the average achievement rating of the 3 levels combined (49.3%) fell short of half the desired 100%. The airport unit met very few of the EPI implementation standards, scoring only 20% in this area. Deficiencies were found in systems for shipping vaccine in cold boxes, for making cold rooms permanently available, and for providing adequate vaccine transportation. The central supply facility, responsible for the purchase, storage, distribution, and maintenance of an adequate vaccine stock, had an achievement score of only 41%. The regional level, represented by the 7 storage facilities studied, obtained a lower overall achievement score than the other 2 levels and appears to be a high-risk link in the cold chain. The local level, represented by the 40 clinics studied, attained the highest average achievement score of any level (57%). Yet, serious deficiencies also emerged at this level, particularly regarding implementation and control activities. These deficiencies were aggravated by the fact that vaccines undoubtedly encounter a larger number of potentially damaging contingencies at the local level than they do elsewhere. Suggestions are made for overcoming these difficulties.",,"chile; geographic distribution; health program; immunization; prevention; short survey; Americas; Chile; Delivery Of Health Care; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Health; Health Services; Immunization; Latin America; Organization And Administration; Primary Health Care; Program Evaluation; Programs; South America; Transportation; Vaccination; Chile; Cold; Drug Storage; Evaluation Studies; Humans; Immunization; Measles Vaccine; Refrigeration; Vaccines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020410533

Triggering: a sudden inhibition of flexor activity to allow the shortening of the contracted extensors and the release of the energy stored during the co-contraction phase. The neural circuitry controlling these three phases is now reasonably well understood. Some of its major features are: (1) pairs of large identifiable interneurons in the thoracic ganglia for evoking the cocking response (C-neurons) and for triggering the jump (M-neurons), (2) a central excitatory pathway from extensor to flexor tibiae motoneurons to ensure simultaneous activation of extensor and flexor motoneurons during the initial part of the co-contraction phase, (3) a positive feedback pathway from cuticular receptors to extensor motoneurons for maintaining extensor activity during the co-contraction phase, (4) proprioceptive feedback to the trigger interneurons for increasing their excitability during the co-contraction phase and thereby allowing a variety of external stimuli to activate the trigger neurons and evoke a jump, (5) presynaptic inhibition of visual pathways to the trigger neurons to ensure that the trigger neurons are not activated by the simultaneous occurrence of visual and auditory stimuli in the absence of proprioceptive input, and (6) a pair of multifunctional visual movement detecting neurons which can initiate cocking or trigger the jump depending on the animal's state.",,"anatomy; animal experiment; arthropod; interneuron; jumping; motor control; musculoskeletal system; nerve cell network; nervous system; nonhuman; proprioception; Animal; Behavior, Animal; Grasshoppers; Interneurons; Motor Neurons; Neural Pathways; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020390244

This NAD value refers to the number of consecutive days in which no power is supplied to the system from the solar cell array(SCA). The storage system capacity is thus based on the required energy during NAD. Though the NAD method is simple and in many cases will assure reliable power supply, it is uneconomical. With the relative high costs of solar cells and storage batteries, this means a system that may not operate at its optimum. A new method for analysis and design of SESs is presented, which makes it possible to determine the minimum sizes of the SCA and storage system capacity. The reliability of the system is studied by the newly introduced 'loss of power supply' (LOPS) probability concept. Some systems have been designed using the new method and compared to other design methods.

Gothenburg, S41345 Gothenburg, Sweden","The demand of the untrained skeletal muscle to produce additional mechanical work by utilizing more nutrients is the origin of the structural and metabolic adaptation of the muscle. The expanding capillary surface, in response to a lower vascular resistance during repeated contraction, enables the different fibre types to increase their oxygen extraction, and to adapt their uptake of substrates (glucose, FFA). The muscle fibre types in humans are selectively recruited for differing work intensity but the oxidative potential (SDH) increases in all types with long-term physical training. Details of the mechanism by which insulin promotes glucose uptake are unclear but there is some evidence that the hormonal stimulation involves cellular uptake of the insulin-receptor complex of the membrane. Hypoxia and raised cytoplasmic levels of calcium in muscle cells after work exert an insulin-like action on glucose uptake, which may be ascribed to the intracellular acidity. The interrelationship between glucose and FFA oxidation is in part regulated by known key enzymes of the contracting muscle, but the exact extramuscular substrate mobilization appears to require both hormonal and supplementary feed-back control in storage organs. During prolonged muscular exercise, the successive utilization of carbohydrate and fat from endogenous and exogenous stores can, however, in principle be attributed to known hormonal regulation. Oral intake of glucose solution before and during work evokes a prolonged glucose utilization with relative hyperinsulinemia and hypoglucagonemia, preventing hepatic glycogenolysis. A prerequisite for successful endurance training is the improved capacity to use FFA as substrate. The necessary lipolysis in adipocytes is mainly mediated by an increased cellular exposure and sensitivity to catecholamines, but the delayed adaptation of the fat cells to their hormonal environment, especially insulin, in relation to the progress of the training is likely to modify the lipolytic response.",,"adipose tissue; diagnosis; endocrine system; etiology; lipid metabolism; muscle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prevention; review; therapy; training; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus; Energy Metabolism; Exertion; Glucagon; Human; Insulin; Muscles; Obesity; Physical Education and Training; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020324154

Food was given as equal hourly meals during the first 12 h (day) and subjects were fasted for the remaining 12 h (night). In both lean and obese subjects rates of body protein synthesis and leucine oxidation were higher during the feeding phase, but body protein breakdown was higher during fasting. Simultaneous measurements of metabolic rate showed that overall the rates of protein synthesis were correlated with the oxygen consumption, but this correlation resulted mainly from differences due to feeding. Within a homogeneous group of obese women this correlation was not apparent when fed and fasted states were examined separately. The diurnal pattern of feeding and fasting was accompanied by storage and withdrawal from store of both protein and energy. There was no detectable difference in the pattern of storage between lean and obese subjects.",,"radioisotope; energy transfer; food intake; leucine c 14; obesity; protein metabolism; Adult; Aged; Body Weight; Carbon Radioisotopes; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Female; Food; Human; Kinetics; Leucine; Male; Middle Age; Nitrogen; Obesity; Oxygen Consumption; Proteins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020318382

Box 688, Richardson, TX 75080, United States","In this work a xenon-F2 plasma diluted in helium has been operated as a pulsed amplifier for the B→X transition of XeF. Two synchronously excited plasmas were produced by preionized discharges in atmospheric electrical avalanche devices switched by hydrogen thyratrons. The principle output obtained at 352 nm from the tube serving as an oscillator was optically delayed and then was threaded through the second discharge. Calibrated attenuation of this beam injected into the amplifier provided data on the overall amplification ratio. From these data effective saturation intensities of 620 and 860 kW/cm2 were found for operation at pressures of 2.7 and 3.7 atmospheres, respectively. Corresponding small signal gains were found to be moderately high, reaching 0.11 and 0.13 cm-1, for the two conditions, respectively. Based upon these results for the gain and saturation parameters, a self-excited oscillator was designed to be optimized simultaneously for energy density and efficiency. By matching the ringing time of the driving circuit to the characteristic time of the discharge a XeF device was realized which produced 10-ns output pulses representing an energy density of 2.7 J/liter and an efficiency relative to storage of 1.6%.",,"LASERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020289901

However, the magnetic properties and the film structure are strongly dependent on the sputtering condition, especially on the negative bias voltage ( minus V//B) applied to a substrate during sputtering. An uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy (K//u) increases with minus V//B up to about 200V, and then it decreases gradually with minus V//B. In order to make clear the origin of K//u and the bias effect on the film structure, the authors have studied the bias voltage dependence of electrical resistivity and the change in the magnetic properties due to thermal annealing.",,"ELECTRIC PROPERTIES - Thin Films; MAGNETIC PROPERTIES; SPUTTERING; BIAS EFFECT; BIAS VOLTAGE EFFECT; MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY ENERGY; GADOLINIUM COMPOUNDS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020234761

The Static Induction Transistor (SIT) corresponds to the maximum operating limits of both the high speed field effect transistor (FET) and the high speed bipolar transistor (BPT) and it can be of MIS structure because static electric force can penetrate through the insulator and induce a change of potential and a change in the thickness of the depletion layer. There is no storage effect; the speed is expected to be several picoseconds. Very low power operation of 70 pw can be realized because of the low noise characteristic. Extremely low energy switching can be accomplished at levels below 1fJ and high power rating is possible.",,"TRANSISTORS, BIPOLAR; STATIC INDUCTION TRANSISTOR.; TRANSISTORS, FIELD EFFECT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020232849

The broad 1.4-eV band present in as-grown material is weakened by Te firing and typically enhanced by Cd firing. These results do not support earlier connections between this luminescence and the VCd-InCd complexes predicted by defect chemistry calculations to be dominant in CdTe:In. Alternatives to straightforward interpretation are discussed for both experiments and defect modeling. The effects of the heat treatments on the injection-level dependence, frequency response, and temperature dependence of the 1.4-eV luminescence are described. This luminescence arises from localized transitions within compact complexes in our as-grown material, but different species of complexes or competing transition mechanisms are involved in heat-treated material. The edge emission, present in both as-grown and fired material, peaks near 1.57 eV at 80 K and thus is close to the band-gap energy of CdTe.

The magnetic resonance signals occur at the center frequency and at the center frequency plus or minus integral multiples of the characteristic ion macromotion frequencies. The experiment was performed on 3He+ using the ion storage exchange collision technique. Contributions of the side-band intensity arose predominantly from the standing microwave field inside the cavity. The effect of a small traveling wave component was also included. The microwave field was fed into the trap structure which, in addition to being used for trapping, was also employed as a broad band cavity in the TE013 mode. The dependence of the intensity distribution of the side-band spectrum on different ion motion temperatures and energy distributions of the ions was studied numerically. It was demonstrated experimentally that initially the stored ions have a uniform energy distribution. Since the stored ion cloud samples different microwave fields at different times, the induced perturbation of the microwave field is spread out in frequency and a correlation function approach is suitable to interpret the side-band spectra. The present experiment was carried out in the microwave region where narrow-band coherent radiation fields are readily available. However, the same side bands should also occur in the optical spectrum of stored ions and are of interest to laser cooling experiments.",,"IONS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020141203

One transducer generates a stress wave which will travel into the magnetic block adjacent to it. Its dipoles will line up parallel to the applied field if the stress is high enough. This corresponds to the writing process. If a stress wave interacts with a magnetic block which is magnetized antiparallel to the applied field, the block will reverse its magnetization direction.

Existing electronic computers dissipate energy vastly in excess of the mean thermal energy kT, for purposes such as maintaining volatile storage devices in a bistable condition, synchronizing and standardizing signals, and maximizing switching speed. On the other hand, recent models due to Fredkin and Toffoli show that in principle a computer could compute at finite speed with zero energy dissipation and zero error. In these models, a simple assemblage of simple but idealized mechanical parts (e.g., hard spheres and flat plates) determines a ballistic trajectory isomorphic with the desired computation, a trajectory therefore not foreseen in detail by the builder of the computer. In a classical or semiclassical setting, ballistic models are unrealistic because they require the parts to be assembled with perfect precision and isolated from thermal noise, which would eventually randomize the trajectory and lead to errors. Possibly quantum effects could be exploited to prevent this undesired equipartition of the kinetic energy. Another family of models may be called Brownian computers, because they allow thermal noise to influence the trajectory so strongly that it becomes a random walk through the entire accessible (low-potential-energy) portion of the computer's configuration space. In these computers, a simple assemblage of simple parts determines a low-energy labyrinth isomorphic to the desired computation, through which the system executes its random walk, with a slight drift velocity due to a weak driving force in the direction of forward computation. In return for their greater realism, Brownian models are more dissipative than ballistic ones: the drift velocity is proportional to the driving force, and hence the energy dissipated approaches zero only in the limit of zero speed. In this regard Brownian models resemble the traditional apparatus of thermodynamic thought experiments, where reversibility is also typically only attainable in the limit of zero speed. The enzymatic apparatus of DNA replication, transcription, and translation appear to be nature's closest approach to a Brownian computer, dissipating 20-100 kT per step. Both the ballistic and Brownian computers require a change in programming style: computations must be rendered logically reversible, so that no machine state has more than one logical predecessor. In a ballistic computer, the merging of two trajectories clearly cannot be brought about by purely conservative forces; in a Brownian computer, any extensive amount of merging of computation paths would cause the Brownian computer to spend most of its time bogged down in extraneous predecessors of states on the intended path, unless an extra driving force of kTln2 were applied (and dissipated) at each merge point. The mathematical means of rendering a computation logically reversible (e.g., creation and annihilation of a history file) will be discussed. The old Maxwell's demon problem is discussed in the light of the relation between logical and thermodynamic reversibility: the essential irreversible step, which prevents the demon from breaking the second law, is not the making of a measurement (which in principle can be done reversibly) but rather the logically irreversible act of erasing the record of one measurement to make room for the next. Converse to the rule that logically irreversible operations on data require an entropy increase elsewhere in the computer is the fact that a tape full of zeros, or one containing some computable pseudorandom sequence such as pi, has fuel value and can be made to do useful thermodynamic work as it randomizes itself. A tape containing an algorithmically random sequence lacks this ability. © 1982 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010146684

By thus measuring the heat released during pulse-wise irradiation of leaves, conclusions can be drawn as to the gross efficiency of photosynthesis: More heat means less photochemically stored energy. Saturation of photosynthesis, by employing additional strong continuous-wave background light, affords an internal photothermal radiometry signal reference corresponding to the photochemical zero efficiency level, against which the signal in the absence of saturation can be compared. Through such means, gross energy storage efficiencies approaching 30% have been observed in Caragana arborescens Lam. at low light intensities.

Maximal hydrolysis rates are higher with Mg2+ than with Ca2+. Micromolar Ca2+ in the presence of maximally stimulating Mg2+ concentrations produces a small additional enhancement of activity. The Mg2+ ATPase has a broad activity maximum between pH 6.5 and 8.5, and an activation energy of 11.8 Kcal/mol. Several independent observations suggest that the ATPase could be involved in H+ translocation across the granule membrane: (a) the activity is stimulated upon disrupting membrane continuity by either hypotonic lysis or addition of nondenaturing detergents; (b) proton ionophores enhance the activity in intact but not in disrupted α granules; (c) permeating anions stimulate the ATPase more than slowly permeant or impermeant ones; (d) addition of NH3 (as either NH4Cl or (NH4)2SO4) activates enzyme activity; (e) silicotungstate and disulfonic stilbene derivatives, which are inhibitors of other H+-transporting ATPases, also inhibit the α-granule enzyme. These findings are compared with the reported properties of H+ pumps of other storage and secretory organelles. © 1982.",,"adenosine triphosphatase (magnesium); adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphatase (calcium magnesium); Ca(2+) Mg(2+) ATPase; animal cell; blood and hemopoietic system; nonhuman; proton transport; swine; thrombocyte; active transport; animal; article; blood; cell granule; enzymology; intracellular membrane; kinetics; thrombocyte; ultrastructure; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Animal; Biological Transport, Active; Blood Platelets; Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase; Cytoplasmic Granules; Intracellular Membranes; Kinetics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020334863

Besides thrombin, those ionophores [monensin, nigericin, and the combination of carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) with nonactin and/or valinomycin] which cause a rapid collapse of H+ gradients induced a fast and virtually total release of 14C-labeled 5-hydroxytryptamine and [3H]noradrenaline into the various media. FCCP alone, which causes an inversion of the membrane potential to inside negative values, induced a considerably slower amine release. Changes in the K+ and Na+ gradients did not lead to amine release, nor did interference with energy transduction by antimycin A with or without glycolysis inhibitors. Monensin and FCCP did not release ATP, whereas thrombin, added before or after incubation of platelets with FCCP and monensin, caused a marked liberation of the nucleotide. It is concluded that in intact human platelets (a) the intragranular storage of 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline mainly depends on the proton gradient across the granular membrane, and (b) ionophores causing a collapse of H+ gradients induce non-exocytotic release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline from intracellular storage granules.",,"adenosine triphosphate; antimycin A1; carbonyl cyanide 4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; ionophore; monensin; nigericin; nonactin; noradrenalin h 3; proton; radioisotope; serotonin c 14; thrombin; unclassified drug; valinomycin; article; blood and hemopoietic system; drug binding; human cell; in vitro study; normal human; thrombocyte; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimycin A; Biogenic Amines; Blood Platelets; Glycolysis; Humans; Macrolides; Monensin; Nigericin; Norepinephrine; Potassium; Protons; Serotonin; Sodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019958952

It is well known that the effect of a corrosive environment on structural steelwork is to reduce its fatigue life, and this paper describes work in progress to determine whether or not the same is true for structural concrete, both reinforced and prestressed. Reinforced and prestressed concrete beams are being tested in unidirectional bending, and in reverse bending, in jackets containing sea-water, at slow cycling rates (about 0.17 Hz)which approximate to sea-wave frequencies. The sea-water is pH and temperature controlled and is continuously circulated from a storage tank. Control specimens are tested at higher frequencies (3 to 5 Hz) and these show the expected reduction in fatigue endurance, compared with•tests in air. However, the wave-frequency test results show that deposits are formed in the flexure cracks after 3 to 4 days of cyclic loading, and this has the effect of increasing, rather than decreasing, the fatigue lives of the beams - certainly when the bending is unidirectional. Under reverse bending this effect is not yet confirmed, although the crack-blocking is observed to take place, Electron-microscopy of the failure surface is being utilised to establish the mechanism by which corrosion fatigue failure occurs wnder these conditions. © 1982 American Concrete Institute.

It was shown that explosive MHD generators, which are compact sources of powerful pulses of electrical energy, are characterized by their relative simplicity, autonomy, and maneuverability of firing and they are capable of operating in the frequency-periodic mode. The moderate, compared to MC generator, weight-size characteristics of the generator (∼1 J/g, ∼1 J/cm3) are the necessary tradeoff for the new operational quality, namely, the nondestructibility of the setup. At the present time, a considerable amount of experimental information has been accumulated on the study of processes that determine the efficiency of the generator. Based on this information, a number of projects have been proposed for explosive MHD generators in the megajoule range. Practical experience has been gained in creating frequency-periodic action generators as well as autonomous setups using superconducting magnetic systems. The increase in the operational efficiency of an explosive MHD generator is primarily related to increasing the magnetic Reynolds number of the flow, which can be attained, in particular, by using different schemes for accumulating the energy of the explosion. The use of a metallic liner, which expands under the pressure of the detonation products, in an explosive MHD generator is, in the practical sense, apparently hopeless. The general information available in the literature on the parameters and properties of explosive MHD generators give a basis for concluding that this generator is a promising source of powerful energy pulses. In a certain range of parameters, it can be an alternative to the use of storage batteries, inductive accumulator, and an explosive magnetic generator, and according to a number of indicators (nondestructibility, autonomy, frequency-periodic operational mode) has advantages over them. © 1983 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,"EXPLOSIVES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020180018

Therefore, equilibrium solubility is readily achieved in a short-path batch extractor which permits high gas flow rates. Soybean oil extracted with SC-CO2 is lighter in color and contains less iron and about one-tenth the phosphorus of hexane-extracted crude oil from the same beans. The lower phosphorus content is reflected in a chromatographic refining loss of 0.6% compared to 1.9% for hexane crude. Refined oils from hexane and SC-CO2 extraction had equivalent odor and flavor scores initially and after 4 days' storage at 60 C. Carbon dioxide, an ideal solvent for extraction of food products, is low-cost and readily available from fermentation processes and could free over 20 million gallons of costly hexane per year for essential energy uses. © 1982 the American Oil chemists' Society.",,"CARBON DIOXIDE; EXTRACTION - High Pressure Effects; EXTRACTORS - Design; SOY OIL; SOYBEANS; SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE; VEGETABLE OILS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020160368

The first pulse generator uses an 18 kJ capacitor bank at 0·8, 1·6 or 2·4 kV discharged through the chest by two series-connected silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs). Two other series-connected SCRs in parallel with the bank terminate the discharge. The second pulse generator uses an 18 kJ bank at 5, 10 or 15 kV. Ceramic-enveloped hydrogen thyratrons in series with the chest initiate the discharge, and in parallel with the bank terminate the discharge. The third pulse generator supplies a reverse-current pulse when used with either the first or second pulse generators to produce bidirectional waveforms. An 18 kJ bank at 2·5, 5 or 10 kV is discharged by an SCR chain in series with the chest. The discharge is terminated by an SCR chain in parallel with the bank. Symmetrical bidirectional rectangular, truncated exponential, and untruncated exponential waveforms are generated by the first and third pulse generators with their respective banks at 2·4 and 2·5 kV, the second and third pulse generators with their banks at 5 kV, or the second and third pulse generators with their banks at 10 kV. The full energy-storage capabilities of the capacitor banks can be used in the first two arrangements; usable energy storage in the third arrangement is limited to about 10 kJ per bank. © 1982 IFMBE.","Bidirectional exponential waveforms; Bidirectional rectangular waveforms; Defibrillator; High-energy defibrillator; Large-animal defibrillator","ELECTRON TUBES, THYRATRON - Medical Applications; ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS, PULSE SIGNAL - Medical Applications; HYDROGEN THYRATRONS; BIOMEDICAL EQUIPMENT; computer analysis; defibrillation; heart; heart ventricle fibrillation; theoretical study; Animal; Cattle; Electric Countershock; Equipment Design; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020154398

Useful kinetic parameters can be deduced although their accuracies are limited due to the porous nature of the materials studied. The results presented will primarily be for one kind of graphite material and for ZrC. The performance of the ZrC electrode is promising and exhibits a significant improvement over carbon electrodes. The effects of lead chloride as a catalytic additive to the solution have been studied.

Over a three-day period (5-7 April, 1980), sheared photospheric velocity fields inferred from spot motions are compared both with changes in the orientation of transverse magnetic fields and with the flare history of the region. Rapid spot motions and high inferred velocity shear coincide with increased field alignment along the BL= 0 line and with increased flare activity; a later decrease in velocity shear precedes a more relaxed magnetic configuration and decrease in flare activity. Crude energy estimates show that magnetic reconfiguration produced by the relative velocities of the spots could cause storage of ∼ 1032 erg day-1, while the flares occurring during this time expended ≲1031 erg day-1. Maps of vertical current density suggest that parallel (as contrasted with antiparallel) currents flow along the stressed magnetic loops. For the active region, a constant-α, force-free magnetic field (J = αB) at the photosphere is ruled out by the observations. © 1982 D.

A significant reduction in body size (32.1-56.1% of initial wet wt) was observed. Compared with wild animals starved E. superba decreased their oxygen uptake, ammonia excretion and phosphate excretion considerably (24-52%), but no significant changes in wet: dry wt ratio, and chemical compositions (C, N, P) were observed. The mortality of the starved group was similar to that of controls fed Tetra Marin and frozen copepods and less than that of controls fed a mixture of microalgae (Dunaliella and Phaeodactylum). Because of insufficient lipid storage, E. superba is hypothesized to switch from herbivorous feeding to omnivorous or carnivorous during the Antarctic winter. The present results suggest, however, that body shrinkage could be an alternative way for this animal to conserve energy during the winter. The advantage of this is discussed in the light of the characteristics of body structure and life style of E. superba. © 1982.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000382649

The experiment has provided the first data on hadron multiplicity, angular distributions, and correlations in lepton pair events at ISR energies. The average associated charged multiplicity 〈nch〉 is found to increase as the invariant mass of the hadronic system Mh increases, similarly to the observed s dependence in e+e- annihilation into hadrons at high energies. The multiplicity also increases with pT in the hemisphere opposite to the transverse momentum pT of the dimuon. Small clusters appear to be produced, whose correlation with the μ-pair can be explained in a simple Monte Carlo model incorporating the production of a weakly collimated jet of low multiplicity, recoiling against the dimuon. © 1982.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049134582

Typically, these databases contain quantitative information (such as population counts) and a combination of descriptive information (such as race and sex) for each quantitative measure. Examples of statistical databases can be found in many application areas that include: -Scientific databases, such as -Results of experiments; e.g. laboratory animal experiments or chemical tests. -Observations over a period of time; e.g. erosion of materials, atmospheric patterns or seismological measurements -Socio-economic databases, such as: -Population or income counts -Health and medical statistics -Commodity flows between geographic regions -Energy production and consumption -Business databases, such as: -Sales forecasting -Financial summary reports. It is generally agreed that conventional DBMSs are in many ways inadequate to manage efficiently these databases [1]. The important issue of managing statistical databases are as follows: 1. What are the characteristics of statistical databases? How are they different from the 'ordinary databases'? Some example characteristics are that -they contain a variety of data types such as matrix, vector, set, text and graph, etc. -they very often contain sparse data -they are usually large databases, and as a result, subsets or summary sets are derived 2. What are the important requirements of managing these databases? Most importantly, what are the areas that conventional DBMSs do not handle well? For example, do we need -data models tailored for statistical databases? -data compression techniques? -better data dictionary facilities? -special hardware (or software) to take advantage of the characteristics of statistical databases? 3. What special techniques have been developed to tackle these problems? Examples are conceptual modeling tools, metadata/data integration, compression techniques, access and storage methods, security techniques, automatic aggregation and disaggregation and user interface (see [1] for description of these techniques). 4. How difficult is it to extend conventional DBMSs to handle statistical databases? 5. What are the requirements of supporting applications running on statistical databases? - What kind of data management functions are most important to the applications? - Are there special needs that cannot be supported by general purpose statistical or data management tools?. © 1982 ACM.",,"Digital storage; Information management; Sales; User interfaces; Automatic aggregations; Compression techniques; Data compression techniques; Data management tools; Descriptive information; Management functions; Quantitative information; Quantitative measures; Population statistics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051485698

The problems associated with the use of electric vehicles are discussed; the main problem being that of range. The possible use of hydrogen as a fuel is analysed in some detail. Since its supply can be tied directly to nuclear energy sources, rather than hydrocarbon feed stocks, it could be an alternative in the long term. The main problems of the storage of hydrogen on the vehicle and of its propensity to “backfire” into the engine intake are discussed. The first can be ameliorated and the second eliminated by dual fuelling; with petrol. It is advocated that the on-board storage of hydrogen be by the use of hydrides for private cars.

Energy consumed for the same capacity and vehicle performance may be reduced by coasting, cutting vehicle weight, and use of regenerative braking, on electrically-powered systems, to convert the otherwise wasted braking energy into useful form. Particular attention is paid to the last-named, identifying results of past experience and recent simulations. Practical constraints limiting the amount of energy actually recovered are discussed, including proportion of vehicle weight braked electrically, receptivity of the supply system, stop spacing and number of vehicles operated simultaneously. Reference is also made to battery vehicles and flywheel energy storage. It is suggested that considerable scope exists in urban electric rail operation for reduced energy consumption, as existing fleets are replaced by lighter weight vehicles, fitted for regenerative braking. Further savings may come from use of inverter equipment. Rate of fleet renewal may be an important factor. Buses are already much more energy efficient, and dramatic gains are unlikely. However, there is some scope for use of flywheel energy storage, and regenerative braking on trolleybuses. © 1982, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In both approaches a large system of linear equations with little or no change in the coefficient matrix has to be solved repeatedly, either in the eigensolver or in the time integrator. The efficiency of the linear equation solver determines, to a large extent, the cost of the numerical production. The present linear equation solver has been designed to meet a number of objectives. The system matrices are assembled in terms of node-oriented submatrices instead of individual coefficients. Nodal quantities considered are not restricted to displacements. The Gauss elimination scheme is geared to sparseness rather than bandedness of the coefficient matrix. This eliminates trivial arithmetic and storage of zeroes. Matrix decomposition, and forward and backward substitutions, are separated. Thus, in an eigensolution iteration, or in a time integration, a sequence of right-hand-sides may be operated on with the coefficient matrix decomposed only once. Prescribed degrees of freedom are retained in the system of equations. Oblique excitations are treated directly through individual coordinate reference systems. Support forces are computed directly by multiplication of the unmodified coefficient matrix with the solution vector. Accuracy checks are conducted via comparison of total potential and kinetic energies. Application of the solution algorithm to a typical nuclear plant computer model is compared to other storage and solution schemes. The operation count of the present scheme indicates its performance advantage. © 1982.",,"STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS - Dynamic Response; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019574210

It is concluded that the suitability of earth tempering as a practice and of specific earth-sheltered design stereotypes varies geographically. While the subsurface almost always provides a thermal advantage on its own terms when compared to above-ground climatic data, it can, nonetheless, compromise the effectiveness of other, regionally more important climate-control techniques. Also contained in the report are reviews of above- and below-ground climate mapping schemes related to human comfort and architectural design, and a detailed description of a theoretical model of ground temperature, heat flow, and heat storage in the ground. Strategies of passive climate control are presented in a discussion of the building bioclimatic analysis procedure which has been applied in a computer analysis of 30 years of weather data for each of 29 locations in the United States. Energy performance is ultimately a matter of effective design. While the data presented in the report can be interpreted on one hand as suggesting the regional appropriateness, or lack thereof, of earth-sheltered design, it also can and should be used to inform the design itself. The data may be regarded as the main contribution of the study, and other researchers are encouraged to read and interpret them. Earth sheltering is always a means to an end, whether energy efficiency, storm or fallout protection, preservation of open space, or some other end. In the author's view, it is not an end in itself. From the standpoint of energy-efficient design, this requires the evaluation of earth-tempering techniques within the context of all practices of climate control.

The two basic points of these authors were: i) by using an improved «new» version of the reconstruction programs a factor ∼ 9 in efficiency can be achieved with respect to the «old» SFM reconstruction programs; ii) with two Čerenkov counters, each 1 m long, and each with a large area of coverage as in the SFM structure, a rejection power of 1.5·10-4 against charged hadrons can be achieved. Point i) would mean that the previous programs, used for five years at the SFM, were incredibly inefficient despite the efforts, by all people concerned, to produce a reasonable program for the SFM users. The proof that the old programs produce a correct figure for the track detection efficiency is given by our measurements of the average charge multiplicity &lt;nch&gt; at three total c.m. (pp) energies: {Mathematical expression}. These values of &lt;nch&gt; are in excellent agreement with previous measurements and corroborate our confidence in the «old» SFM reconstruction programs. Our estimate of the efficiency for the «new» programs gives at least a factor of ∼3 less than the claimed factor of 9. Concerning point ii), it is well known that the correct figure cannot be better than ∼ 10-3. Any experimental physicist can check this point if he has not done so already. Our measurement (7.1±2.0)·10-4 for incident-particle momenta between 0.8 GeV/c and 3.0 GeV/c, performed at the SFM facility of the CERN ISR, is perfectly consistent with the universally accepted figure for the abovementioned rejection power. The conclusion of our study is that the R416 group has not the necessary rejection power against charged hadrons. Therefore, their claim to be able to observe «beauty» production at the ISR is unfounded. © 1982 Società Italiana di Fisica.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449142008

Large collection angles are possible with this arrangement and reasonable resolution can be obtained using spherical surfaces. Astigmatism is much lower than for Rowland circle mountings.

In this paper the kinetic energy of the limbs and body relative to the centre of mass (EKE, tot of paper two) is combined with the potential plus kinetic energy of the centre of mass (ECM, tot of paper three) to obtain the total mechanical energy (excluding elastic energy) of an animal during constant average-speed locomotion. The minimum mass-specific power required of the muscles and tendons to maintain the observed oscillations in total energy, Etot/Mb, can be described by one equation: Etot/Mb = 0.478 . vg 1.53 + 0.685 . vg + 0.072 where Etot/Mb is in W kg-1 and vg is in m s-1. This equation is independent of body size, applying equally as well to a chipmunk or a quail as to a horse or an ostrich. In marked contrast, the metabolic energy consumed by each gram of an animal as it moves along the ground at a constant speed increases linearly with speed and is proportional to Mb-0.3. Thus, we have found that each gram of tissue of a 30 g quail or chipmunk running at 3 m s-1 consumes metabolic energy at a rate about 15 times that of a 100 kg ostrich, horse or human running at the same speed while their muscles are performing work at the same rate. Our measurements demonstrate the importance of storage and recovery of elastic energy in larger animals, but they cannot confirm or exclude the possibility of elastic storage of energy in small animals. It seems clear that the rate at which animals consume energy during locomotion cannot be explained by assuming a constant efficiency between the energy consumed and the mechanical work performed by the muscles. It is suggested that the intrinsic velocity of shortening of the active muscle motor units (which is related to the rate of cycling of the cross bridges between actin and myosin) and the rate at which the muscles are turned on and off are the most important factors in determining the metabolic cost of constant-speed locomotion. Faster motor units are recruited as animals increase speed, and equivalent muscles of small animals have faster fibres than those of larger animals. Also, the muscles are turned on and off more quickly as an animal increases speed, and at the same speed a small animal will be turning muscles on and off at a much higher rate. These suggestions are testable, and future studies should determine if they are correct.",,"animal; article; biological model; biomechanics; bird; body constitution; comparative study; energy metabolism; gait; human; locomotion; mammal; mathematics; Animal; Biomechanics; Birds; Body Constitution; Comparative Study; Energy Metabolism; Gait; Human; Locomotion; Mammals; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020124019

Xanthi) were monitored by the photoacoustic effect. A reference signal was obtained using brief simultaneous illumination of the leaf with continuous light of saturating intensity. 1. The effect of the direct continuous light depends on the modulation frequency: A decrease in the photoacoustic signal, 'negative effect', is observed at low frequency (under approx. 200 Hz) and an increase of the photoacoustic signal, 'positive effect', at high frequency (above approx. 200 Hz). Both effects are reversible. 2. When leaves are water-infiltrated only a 'positive effect': of the direct continuous light is observed, at any frequency. Leaves infiltrated with aqueous DCMU solution (50 μM) do not show any direct continuous light effect. 3. The 'negative effect' develops, as the leaf is illuminated, in parallel to the (low frequency) photoacoustic signal itself which increases gradually after an initial lag period. This transient phenomenon takes a few minutes under our conditions. The differential increase of the signal during the induction period matches the size of the negative effect obtained by applying the direct continuous light at various times during the induction or in the steady state. 4. In a similar way, the 'positive effect' increases during the induction period, due to a transient decrease of the photoacoustic signal measured at high frequency. This change in the 'positive effect' is less noticeable, as a sizeable effect is already observed in a dark-adapted leaf, upon illumination, and the extent of the photoacoustic transient is relatively small. 5. No photoacoustic transients are observed when direct continuous light is used continuously. 6. It is concluded that the photoacoustic signal is due to two contributions: At low frequency there is a considerable contribution from modulated oxygen evolution, which tends to zero as the direct continuous light is applied. At high frequency the main contribution is from the conversion of photon energy to heat, and direct continuous light effects reflect mainly photochemical energy storage. Both low and high frequency photoacoustic transients reflect the induction period of photosynthesis. 7. Preliminary calculations on the relative damping of modulated oxygen evolution and thermal photoacoustic contributions with the modulation frequency, are consistent with the above model, taking into account diffusion and the rate-limiting step in O2 evolution. 8. Photoacoustic data were used to construct a relative quantum yield spectrum for both oxygen evolution and photochemical energy storage. © 1982.","Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Photosynthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049137335

VMH-lesioned rats fed a high-carbohydrate diet ad libitum for 4 weeks following surgery were not hyperphagic, but they gained 50% more body energy than control rats. VMH lesions extended the half-life of 3H-NE in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) by 42%, in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) by 201%, in heart by 61% and in pancreas by 85%, and reduced total NE turnover (ng/organ/hr) in BAT (38%), WAT (57%), heart (30%) and pancreas (53%). Reduced SNS activity in BAT is consistent with the decreased energy expenditure (heat production) and increased energy efficiency observed in VMH-lesioned rats. In WAT, decreased SNS activity coupled with hyperinsulinemia would facilitate energy storage as fat by reducing lipid mobilization. In the pancreas, reduced SNS activity would contribute to hyperinsulinemia. These results support the hypothesis that VMH lesions decrease SNS activity in several organs. This change in autonomic tone is very likely a major factor in the development of obesity in VMH-lesioned animals. © 1982.",,"noradrenalin; radioisotope; adrenergic system; animal experiment; autonomic nervous system; brain injury; brown adipose tissue; central nervous system; endocrine system; etiology; hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus; noradrenalin h 3; obesity; rat; soft tissue; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Body Temperature Regulation; Body Weight; Female; Hypothalamus; Norepinephrine; Obesity; Pancreas; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Sympathetic Nervous System",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020083243

Natural treefall, rather than silvicultural activities, accounts for the majority of log steps. During low-flow conditions, dissipation of potential stream energy by log steps amounts to 6 percent, approximately equal to that by falls. There are no statistically significant differences regarding spatial distribution of log steps between study basins with contrasting silvicultural and natural stream inputs of large woody debris. However, significant spatial differences are revealed between streams of various orders, a finding that points to channel flushing capacity and stream-adjacent topography as dominant controls on log step development. Application of thermodynamic principles to stream systems demonstrates that neither falls nor log steps cause a statistically significant difference in equilibrium conditions of stream networks. The volume of sediment stored behind log steps in third-, fourth-, and fifth-order streams is 123 percent of the mean annual sediment discharge (suspended load and bed-load). Depriving some streams of log steps by stream clean-out or repeated harvest of stream-adjacent trees may initiate an episode of progressive erosion by nor dissipating stream energy in excess of that needed to transport imposed sediment supplies. Addition of log steps to streams with energy already insufficient to balance sediment inputs and outputs may only serve to accentuate progressive deposition. Functions of instream large woody debris nor incorporated as log steps must also be addressed in forest management decisions. © 1982, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The method employed was a urease/glutamate dehydrogenase procedure where the decrease in absorbante of NADH is monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The repeatability expressed as a coefficient of variation, was 1.4 % and 0.8 % for whole milk and skim milk, respectively. The accuracy of the method for urea determinations in whole milk was satisfactory (coefficient of variation, 2.6 %). Adding the preservative bronopol (0.02%) to the milk or freezing of the milk samples for one week did not alter urea levels significantly (P > 0.05). The storage of preserved whole milk in a refrigerator for 14 days, however, increased milk urea levels measured by 3.1 % (P < 0.001). It was concluded that the method evaluated is simple, rapid (40–50 samples/h) and yields reliable results also when whole milk is used. Since the determination of milk urea may be useful in assessing the feeding of energy and protein, the method is suitable for integration in the existing milk recording system in Sweden. © 1982, The Author(s).","cows; milk; urea determination","urea; animal; animal disease; article; cattle; comparative study; female; laboratory diagnosis; methodology; milk; spectrophotometry; Animal; Cattle; Comparative Study; Female; Milk; Specimen Handling; Spectrophotometry; Urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020017254

The flow system is made up of a pipeline and a compressor located along its path. The mathematical solutions in a closed form are obtained for the boundary and initial conditions which currently appear in practice. They are used to describe the flow behaviour in system during the nonsteady flow. A compressor operating policy that meets the delivery objective to satisfy the peak consumption imposed by consumer and all pressure constraints at the pipeline ends is also formulated. The solutions obtained in this investigation suggest how a policy of compressor working with consideration of storage capacity could be used to cover the peak demand in an optimal manner. The useful information to determine the optimum location of the compressor station along the pipeline minimizing the operation and energy expenses could be also obtained. To compare the efficiency of this flow system with a looped pipeline network, an analysis of nonsteady flow through such a flow system is also performed. Several numerical examples taken from the practice are presented in order to illustrate the behaviour of the solutions developed in the paper. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,"FLOW OF FLUIDS - Compressible; GAS PIPELINES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019900553

Best results were obtained with micromolar concentrations of the glutamine synthetase inactivator l-methionine-dl-sulfoximine (MSX). Inactivation of cellular glutamine synthetase by MSX was followed by prevention of cell growth and by a significant increase in the rates of uptake and reduction of nitrate. Between 85 and 90% of the ammonia resulting from the photosynthetic reduction of nitrate by the cells was found to accumulate in the outer medium. High rates of ammonia production (25-30 μmol per mg chlorophyll per h) were sustained for longer than 24 h, without interferences of the accumulated ammonia on the process. The MSX-treated cells actively producing ammonia did not appear to suffer of a general nitrogen deficiency, but they rather exhibited a specific deficiency in glutamine and abnormally high levels of carbohydrates. The results indicate the feasibility of using whole cyanobacterial cells for the photoproduction of significant amounts of ammonia from nitrate at the expense of light energy, in a simple version of photobiological energy transduction and storage. © 1982.","(Anacystis nidulans); Ammonia production; Cyanobacterium; Nitrate reduction; Solar energy conversion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049129881

It has been shown, based on practice oriented considerations, that the utilization of landfill gases can be worthwhile even in small landfills. A scheme has been given which shows all the possibilities for collection, pretreatment, storage and combustion of the gases. The question of energy storage and energy utilization has also been addressed. The scheme has been discussed, as well as some of the processes, using the example of the hot water generation plant in the Croglio sanitary landfill in Tessin (Switzerland). Calculation of the running costs shows that this plant, which is designed for a 335 MJ/h production, is working economically. © 1982 Birkhäuser Verlag.",,"methane; domestic waste; energy resource; landfill; solid waste management; theoretical study; therapy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020076559

In the Antares power amplifier, electron guns produce a discharge sustaining 8 kA beam of 500 kV electrons. Eight 300 kJ, 3 s Marx pulsers provide a direct electrical pumping discharge through the laser gas. The electro-optic systems developed allow the measurement of pulsed analog waveforms and trigger timing information within the laser and power systems by a computer based control and data acquisition network.* Each fiber optic system consists of a signal powered transmitter, a fiber optic cable, and an optical receiver that interfaces through a CAMAC module to the data acquisition network. The data channels are capable of operating with 1.2 MV of common mode voltage in the electromagnetic interference environment, 500 kV/m and 50 kA/m, produced by the Marx pulsers. The analog transmitters send 10 MHz bandwidth information to CAMAC waveform digitizers in the data acquisition system. About 200 data channels monitor voltage and current in the pulsers and current density in the laser power amplifiers. The laser transmitters send 2 ns resolution timing information from each stage of the Marx trigger amplification and the Marx output to CAMAC time-to-digital converters. These 120 channels of information are processed to provide prefire diagnostics for the energy storage systems. © 1982 SPIE.",,"Carbon dioxide lasers; Computer control systems; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Electromagnetic pulse; Electron guns; Fiber optics; Frequency converters; Optical fibers; Optical pumping; Power amplifiers; Pulsed lasers; Signal receivers; Timing circuits; Transmitters; Bandwidth information; Computer based control; Data acquisition networks; Data acquisition system; Electro-optic systems; Energy storage systems; Optical fiber systems; Time to digital converters; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957510717

The process is divided into three parts. In the pre-initiation stage the absorbed heat makes the temperature of the film rise, even above the melting point, and superheating occurs. When the layer is completely molten, separation of the film from the substrate can be initiated by a temperature-induced gradient in the surface tension or by a gradient in the external pressure. Initiation can also be due to surface irregularities, to blister formation or to boiling. In the post-initiation stage of hole formation ablation of the molten material occurs. Whether a rim is formed or whether one or more droplets are produced surrounding the hole depends on the film thickness and on the surface energies of the substrate and of the film material. The minimum size of a hole that can be formed also depends on these parameters. The theoretical concepts which are presented are applied to the case of laser hole burning in thin tellurium films. © 1982.",,"TELLURIUM - Thin Films; DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019913043

Thermohydraulic aspects of air, water and dissolved air are modelled using the two fluid approach. Variations in design and constitutive relationships were studied to show that reduction of dissolved air, an increase of friction and a deep compensation reservoir mitigate the champagne effect. The most conservative results are obtained when homogeneous flow and equlibrium deaeration of the water are assumed.

Utilizing production fluid or non-treated lease water as the power transfer medium, fluid power is transmitted from a skid mounted surface unit to a downhole stroker which directly actuates a standard API rod type pump. This Fluid power is cyclicly applied and relieved at the surface unit to create a pumping action downhole. The fluid utilized for power transfer is contained in a small diameter tubing string and with the exception of a small amount of slippage downhole, remains in this string thus eliminating the need for a large fluid supply or fluid storage and treating facility. Field testing now underway has demonstrated that the Fluid Rod Pump is a viable alternative for the production of low volume wells. Prototype system testing has been under way in Brea, California since October of 1981. During that time the system has been tested at various production rates up to 155 BFPD and the optimization of components has been carried out. A production version of the system has been operating in Wilmington, California since June of 1982.

Even though steam drive is the most successful of all EOR processes, it is not without its problems. Gravity segregation and poor areal and vertical sweep efficiencies have limited recoveries in many heavy oil reservoirs. In many instances the injected steam prematurely breaks through into producing wells creating steam channels. If this steam channeling can be controlled to some degree and the steam is forced to contact more of the reservoir, overall recoveries can be improved. This paper documents efforts under a Department of Energy cost sharing contract to reduce steam channeling in a conventional steam drive using ancillary materials. A steam foam solution and a steam foam encapsulated in a polymer gel are being introduced in four steam injection patterns In the North Kern Front Field near Bakersfield, California. The ability of the ancillary materials to improve recovery will be determined through injection profiles, chemical tracer surveys, casing vent gas analyses, core and log data, and residual oil saturation data, as well as through temperature and production monitoring. It has been shown that in-situ steam foams can be used to alter the steam injection profiles to prevent excessive steam channeling. Results after injection of ancillary materials for approximately 18 months indicate that improvements in both the areal and vertical sweep efficiencies have been found in the four treated patterns when compared to the untreated control patterns.- Several techniques are still under evaluation to determine the exact amount of incremental oil produced. Disscussion of production response will be limited to two of the four treated patterns, Witmer B2-3 and Witmer B2-5. A comparison of these two patterns to the Witmer control pattern, Witmer A2-7, indicates approximately 52 B/D (8 mv/d) of incremental oil is being produced as a result of the weekly chemical treatments. © Copyright 1982, Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME.",,"Chemical analysis; Cost effectiveness; Crude oil; Digital storage; Engineers; Enhanced recovery; Gasoline; Heavy oil production; Oil field equipment; Oil well logging; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Recovery; Steam; Thermal logging; Chemical treatments; Department of Energy; Enhanced oil recovery; Heavy oil reservoirs; Production monitoring; Production response; Residual oil saturation; Steam injection profiles; Injection (oil wells)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057285809

Additional studies have been conducted on economics and load requirements for wind machines. Six field experiments were completed in 1980 with two each in Building Heating, Irrigation and Product Storage and Processing. Building Heating projects were conducted using a 15-kW cycloturbine to power a water churn to produce hot water. Both projects in Product Storage and Processing provided refrigeration with short and long term storage systems. Milk was cooled at a dairy and exhaust heat from the compressor was used to preheat the hot water. In the other project, apples were cooled and stored for six months.

Temperature, pressure, liquid water content, relative humidity, and withdrawn mineral particles were monitored and analyzed to enable comparisons of reservoir behaviour with numerical and experimental models.

A model tank test using artificial ground freezing —with an in-ground LNG storage tank in view. Eng. Geol., 18: 395-408. As a clean form of energy able to replace oil, the demand for LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) has been increasing. LNG must be stored in a cryogenic temperature of -162°C. The storage tanks now existing throughout the world can be divided into above-ground and in-ground types. In the Tokyo area, there are now 22 in-ground LNG storage tanks, either in operation or under construction, which are constructed with primary consideration given to safety and earthquake-proof design because of the circumstances around the LNG terminals. In the feasibility study of a very large-scale, in-ground LNG storage tank, comparative preliminary studies were made of various construction methods. Among them, the method using artificial ground freezing was proposed, in which it was planned to utilize the frozen soil as the means of ground water control and the temporary retaining wall. To confirm the feasibility of the design, a model tank test was conducted by freezing the actual tank yard. The yard ground, composed of sand and silt layers, was artificially frozen 10 m in diameter and 50 m in depth; in the frozen soil a shaft of 4 m in diameter was sunk to a depth 26 m below the ground level for various tests and measurements. The purpose of the test was mainly to confirm the construction method and to examine the agreement between theory and practice. Although this construction method has not been adopted in the actual tank work, the feasibility of the method itself has been confirmed as a result of the test. In this paper, the outline and major results of the test and analysis are described. © 1982, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012675287

Experimental eveluations of thermal properties of the eutectic mixtures were carried out by thermogravimetry (TG), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calori-metry (DSC), because heats of fusion have not been reported and thermal behaviors, such as supercooling, have large effects on the performances of the thermal enegy storage equipments. The eutectic mixtures were dried and melted in an electric vacuum oven, and the thermal analyses were made by using a poly (tetrafluoroethylene)-coated aluminum sample container under the flow of nitrogen. The hydroxides, especially KOH, are highly hygroscopic, and the residual water has effects on their thermal properties, such as transition points and heats ∗i transition (Fig. 1). Every eutectic mixture shows little supercooling (Fig. 4~6), and the eutectic points and heats of fusion for LiOH-NaOH, LiOH-KOH and NaOH-KOH were 213.5°C, 330 J/g; 222°C, 184J/g and 165°C, 172 J/g, respectively.

Ross and others has been developed. It uses three sets of levels between which radiative, non‐radiative and storage transitions are possible. Maximisation of the rate of power storage with respect to the absorption threshold yields wavelengths of the order of 680 nm is in good agreement with the absorption peak of chlorophyll a. Departure from the experimental spectra, for example by the substitution of equivalent black‐body spectra, and passage to two sets of levels only, tends to destroy this agreement, which presents chlorophyll a as a materia! optimised through evolution for a maximum rate of power storage in day light. Various meteorological conditions are considered. The results found are not very sensitive to cloud cover. The simplified model for two sets of levels yields an interpretation in terms of transition probabilities of the parameters which occur in the simple solar cell theory. Both types of conversion are thus covered by the same theory. The model is also general enough to deal with photochemical or photovoltaic conversion in undersea conditions.

The light‐induced primary charge separation which occurs across the biological complex couples electrically with the SnO2 but not with the metal electrode on the time scale of observation. As the working electrode in a two‐electrode photoelectrochemical cell, RC‐coated SnO2 generated photovoltages as high as 80 mV and photocurrents as high as 0.5µA·cm2 when exposed to light of λ &gt;600nm. The number of quinone molecules per RC strongly influences the photovoltage and photocurrent observed. Photo‐effects generated by RC electrodes persist after several days of storage; however, the kinetics and polarity of the effects are subject to change. The potential use of RC electrodes lies more as a new probe of photosynthetic electron transport rather than as a solar energy conversion device because modification to the RCs and their environment affect the electrical properties of the cell. An energy‐level model is proposed to explain how the photoelectrochemical cell functions. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985478712

The effects of air ventilation and infiltration, the heat capacities of the isothermal storage mass inside air and walls/roof, heat loss into the ground, and the presence/absence of the window/door have been incorporated in the realistic time dependent periodic heat transfer analysis to evaluate the overall heat flux coming into the room and the inside air temperature. A numerical computer model using typical weather data for Delhi has been made to appreciate the analytical results quantitatively. It is found that the heat fluxes through different walls have different magnitudes and phase lags w.r.t. the corresponding solair temperatures. The overall heat flux coming into the room as well as the room air temperature are sensitive functions of the number of air changes per hour, closing/opening of the window and the door ventilation. The effects of the heat capacity of the isothermal mass and the basement ground are found to reduce the inside air temperature swing and the presence of a window is found to increase the inside air temperature even when the window area is much smaller than the wall/roof area. The model presented would be an aid to a building architect for good thermal design of non‐airconditioned buildings.

Each student has a personal diskette for data files and basic utility programs for an entire semester. The ease of disk data manipulation under program control is exploited in the following ways: (i) a wide variety of data reduction techniques are introduced that permit quantitative comparisons between experimental results and theoretical expectations; (ii) facile data reduction and analyses permit preliminary processing of experimental data during the course of the lab period, so that decisions can be made by students concerning the course of the remainder of the experiment; (iii) accumulated data from various experiments become a course database permitting subsequent analyses of old data adapted in several different logical ways (e.g., RC curcuit data first treated as energy storage, later as one of a number of exponential relationships); (iv) comprehensive course database formed by merging regarding the reliability of experiments.

These species permit the redistribution of energy via collision processes yielding kinetic or vibrational heating, ion formation, the formation of other metastable species and the nonlocal deposition of the energy, as opposed to spontaneous radiative decay. While thermospheric species such as O(¹S) have been studied for decades, and indeed provided the first evidence for forbidden transitions, others have a relatively short history. The body of information concerning metastable constituents of relevance to the thermosphere has grown considerably over the past decade, to the point where it is timely to consider the status and future needs of research in this area. In this paper we review the developments leading to the current photochemical picture of O(¹D), O(¹S), O+(²D), O+(²P), N(²D), N(²P), N+(¹S), N+(¹D), N2(A³Σu+), NO+(a³Σ), O2+(a4πu), and the vibrationally excited states of N2, O2, O2+, and N2+. Because a primary significance of these constituents is their role in the thermospheric energy budget, we quantify the major metastable channels by which solar EUV radiation is redistributed in the thermosphere. A few of the major highlights are as follows: A major fraction of the kinetic heating of the thermosphere takes place via the single constituent O(¹D); N2(A³Σu+) and vibrationally excited N2 also are important heating channels. O+(²D) is a primary factor in determining the thermospheric ionic composition. Species such as O+(²P) and N+(¹S) provide valuable ways in which to determine optically the concentrations of certain major species; measurement of emissions from the former yield the atomic oxygen concentration as well as the ion drift speed, and measurement of emissions from the latter provide the concentration of N2; N(²D) remains a major source of NO; and a recent finding is that vibrationally excited N2+ plays a vital role in converting N2+ into O+.

The potential future market for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system is substantial. The savings realized by utilizing CAES power plants can be very attractive with the proper generation mix. The thermodynamic parametric performance studies that were conducted to screen the various aquifer charging and discharging cycles are discussed. Equations are presented to directly calculate the optimum (minimum required total compressor work and air cooler heat rejection) intercooler(s) location for a compressor train utilizing one and two intercoolers. An equation is also presented which directly determines the reheat combustor location required to maximize the turbine train output. A discussion is included why the performance of CAES power cycles must be optimized by considering the total power production energy costs not on a basis of maximum turbine output power or heat rate. Hardware and economic considerations which lead to CAES LP turbomachinery component standardization are discussed. Such standardization allows a manufacturer to economically adapt its CAES turbomachinery to a range of different air storage pressures.

A model for interpreting recrystallization of ice in frozen beef was established considering that in this phenomenon the driving force is the tendency to a decrease in surface energy of the crystalline phase and that rate of movement of the grain boundary is proportional to its curvature. Meat samples were frozen and submitted to higher storage temperatures. Histological analysis of tissues immediately after freezing and of samples stored at different times made it possible to measure evolution of ice crystal size and obtain kinetic constants for proposed recrystallization model. Mechanisms for interpreting the phenomena were discussed, determining that transition of molecules occurs preferently through the liquid phase. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

The CRSU is conceived to meet primarily the domestic energy requirements for space heating and hot water production of a community. It normally operates to provide low grade heat with sensible seasonal heat storage and district heating systems. However, there are institutional problems connected with using sensible heat storage and low grade energy distribution systems into dwellings. An alternative to this would be to produce hydrogen and hydrogen-rich fuels by using an advanced conversion technology and eliminate low grade heat storage and distribution systems. Two developing technologies, namely high temperature electrolysis and thermochemical processes, are considered for production of the vector. Then, an assessment is carried out at the conceptual level for fully dedicated Central Receiver Solar Utility Plants which integrate a central receiver system, thermochemical plant or electrical power generating system and synthetic fuel production plant with necessary auxiliary sub-systems. It is shown that for a 10% capital recovery factor, the cost of hydrogen at the plant will be about $18 per GJ using thermochemical processes and about $20 per GJ using high temperature electrolysis processes. The solar-hydrogen can also be converted to a more easily stored fuel for domestic use such as methanol, ethanol, ammonia or fuel oil. In this case, there is a distinct possibility that by using waste heavy fuels, tar sands and biomass, the cost of synthetic fuel can be considerably reduced. © 1982.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049142635

Active and passive background shielding will be employed and, by applying various techniques, particles of different species, including electrons, protons, alpha particles and pick-up ions of cometary origin may be detected over a wide spectrum of energies extending from the tens of KeV into the MeV range. The instrument can operate in two modes namely (a) in a cruise phase or storage mode and (b) in a real time mode. During the real time mode, observations at high spatial (octosectoring) and temporal (0.5s) resolution in the cometary environment permit studies to be made of accelerated particles at the bow shock and/or in the tail of the comet. In conjunction with magnetic field measurements on board Giotto, observations of energetic electrons and their anisotropies can determine whether the magnetic field lines in the cometary tail are open or closed. Further, the absorption of low energy solar particles in the cometary atmosphere can be measured and such data would provide an integral value of the pertaining gas and dust distribution. Solar particle background measurements during encounter may also be used to correct the measurements of other spacecraft borne instruments potentially vulnerable to such radiation. Solar particle flux measurements, obtained during the cruise phase will, when combined with simultaneous observations made by other spacecraft at different heliographic longitudes, provide information concerning solar particle propagation in the corona and in interplanetary space. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049135664

A numerical model was developed using these experimental data and it is presented in the second part of this study. These enclosures find application as storage systems in solar energy power plants. It is shown that the walls of the container can have a strong effect in destroying the thermocline. This effect was studied for an initially established thermocline where the hot fluid (in the top) and the cold fluid (in the bottom) are separated by an adiabatic partition, and the container is well insulated outside. The flowfield that results from this initial condition is symmetric with respect to the partition (except for variations in the fluid and wall properties which were neglibible in our experiments), and it was only necessary to study the development of the initially cold fluid. Both the axial and radial components of the velocity were measured as a function of time and position. Two Rayleigh numbers (based on the temperature difference) were studied: 3.7 × 108 and 7.5 × 108. The velocities measured ranged between 0.01 cm/sec and 0.45 cm/sec.

Conventional production techniques of such components become more difficult to apply as the material and geometrical complexity of the multi-strand composite increases, and the problem of integrity and homogeneity of the structure acquires an overriding importance. This is particularly so with the axisymmetric assemblies-intended for heat exchangers, remote control rods, transition joints and light, but strong, laminated or mesh-reinforced pressure vessels-in which structural integrity may well have to be combined with good anti-corrosive heat transfer, high pressure and, possibly, the high temperature characteristics of the finished product. In a number of applications, particularly in the field of atomic energy, the more ""exotic"" refractory metals are not always available in bulk form and therefore components have to be manufactured out of compacted powders, short-length rods and similar prefabricates. This may preclude the possibility of employing standard metal-forming operations and, again, may call for an unconventional approach. A possible solution to these manufacturing difficulties is found in the implosive welding of assemblies and geometrically prearranged arrays of different materials which would then form integral structures. Where required, a more conventional post-welding processing, such as drawing or extrusion, can follow and will be made easier by the lessening of the differentially in metal flow. Additional advantages of an implosive or explosive operation lie in its ability to provide efficient and complete joints on curved surfaces, and to effect the welding in combinations of materials that, conventionally, are often incompatible. This investigation assesses the technological aspects of the hydrostatic extrusion of implosively prewelded arrays of mild steel/copper assemblies to determine the optimum conditions that produce a high-quality final product. The chosen material combination is, in itself, of no particular practical significance, but conveniently represents the use of two basic engineering alloys of different material properties. Hydrostatic extrusion of such composites serves the double purpose of sizing without affecting the basic properties of the prefabricate. It improves the homogeneity of structure without impairing the quality of the weld. With reductions of up to 45%, and the volume fraction of copper varying from 0.08 to 0.92, the strength of the weld in shear is between 100 MPa and 400 MPa, while the tensile strength of the composite is in the range of some 400 MPa to 700 MPa. © 1982.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049133927

It is now evident that initial growth occurs at the expense of energy derived from carbohydrate metabolism with the consequent formation of organic acids, alcohols, carbon dioxide, etc. Subsequently, lactic acid, amino acids and possibly nucleotides are metabolised with the formation of similar end products, and, in addition, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, mercaptans etc. Breakdown of protein and lipid occurs only at a very late stage of the storage.

Analysis of the hydrogen-metal bonding in these systems indicates that, while a partially empty d band is necessary for reasonable hydrogen storage capacity in a metal, there is an additional requirement to produce exothermal hydrogenation and hence extensive hydrogen solubility.

The analysis involves a simulation of the protein constraint by an effective steric potential, assuming a limited relaxation of the protein cavity during the isomerization time. It is found that a reasonable estimate of the protein flexibility confines the isomerization pathway in a unique way and simulates the trapping of bathorhodopsin as a strained type intermediate. Adjusting the single parameter that represents the protein rigidity to simulate the energy storage and resonance Raman lines of bathorhodopsin leads to a quite unique prediction of its structure and explains the difference in quantum yield for the formation of bathorhodopsin from rhodopsin and isorhodopsin. © 1982, American Chemical Society.

These two limits on the building auxiliary energy requirements result from considering the building and collector-storage wall to have either zero thermal capacity or infinite thermal capacity. With zero thermal capacity, all solar gain in excess of the load, on an instantaneous basis, is not useful and must be dumped. With infinite thermal capacity, the house is able to store any gain in excess of the instantaneous load and use it at some later time. Auxiliary energy use by real systems will fall between these two theoretical bounds. An empirical correlation is presented for the fraction of the load met by the collector-storage wall, F, for systems with finite capacity. The correlation is based on the solar radiation statistic, utilizability. The correlation is compared to yearly TRNSYS simulation results for a wide variety of system types. The root-mean-square difference between F found from the un-utilizability method and from TRNSYS simulations is less than 4 per cent.

Refrigeration, therefore, has an important role to play, hence much improvements are needed in the freezing and transport of fish, including underutilised species. Even though refrigeration techniques on board and on land are fairly advanced, they must be modified and adapted to new conditions. Areas in which major advances can be made are as follows: one, improving fish quality; two, preserving a large variety of fish species, and three, saving energy. In several cases, current techniques employed are inadequate but they can nevertheless be improved by resorting to well known and proven techniques. Some important examples are cold storage, transport and frozen fish display.

In this work a time-delayed, double resonance technique was used for the study of the state selective photolysis excited at visible wavelengths in a thermal equilibrium distribution of populations of Cs2, Cs2Kr, and CsKr existing at 523 K in the presence of 0.132 amagat Kr. Two independently tunable dye lasers were synchronously pulsed, the first being used to dissociate the constituents of the sample along the various possible channels and the second, delayed pulse being used to identify the products by exciting them selectively into easily detected Rydberg states. The time between photolysis and detection could be varied, starting from a value too short to permit collisional mixing or radiative cascading of the products. Particular attention was paid to the photolytic production of the fine structure components of the second electronically excited state of cesium 52D. Not only were the prompt sources from dissociation and predissociation of excited states of CsKr and Cs2Kr confirmed, but new kinetic channels for delayed photolysis were found. Over the visible wavelength range examined in these experiments two delayed processes for the production of Cs(5 2D) atoms were characterized. One appeared to proceed through the intermediate production and dissociation of CsKr(7pΠ) having a lifetime of the order of 100 ns under these conditions. The other seemed to involve a newly observed metastable molecule persisting in the medium for times of the order of 1 μs. It was tentatively identified as Cs2(1Δu) and represented a relatively high level of energy storage. © 1982 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18444369078

Studies on pigment spectra have demonstrated that appropriately positioned charged or polar amino acids are responsible for producing the colors of visual pigments. Electrostatic interactions also appear to play an important role in the light transduction mechanism. A related problem, not considered in this work, concerns the nature of the photoisomerization in the excited state of the chromophore. The quantum yield for this process is 0.67 in the pigments, an order of magnitude greater than the solution value. It is not unlikely that the same charges responsible for wavelength regulation and energy storage play a catalytic role in the photochemistry. Electrostatic interactions are believed to play a central role in many enzyme mechanisms) and it is to be expected that their relative contribution will be even greater in the low dielectric medium provided by the interior of membranes. Thus, the emphasis on these factors in membrane proteins such as rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin is not unwarranted. © 1982, Elsevier Inc.

The form and extent of the constraints depend on assumption about the energy coupling mechanisms, specifically on the relative importance of electromagnetic coupling (MHD flows effects), ionospheric conductivity effects (through Birkeland currents), and the viscous coupling. The effective viscosity coefficient scales in a well-defined manner with solar wind parameters, and its effect is dimensionally the same as that of more general finite-gyroradius mechanisms. We obtain the general form of the expression for energy transfer which takes all these effects into account and which can then be specialized to specific assumptions about the coupling mechanism. We point out the needed changes in energy transfer formulas previously used in the littrature, which make them conform to the requirements of dimensional analysis. Electromagnetic coupling yields the most restrictive formulas for energy transfer, although a unique expression cannot be obtained either on solely dimensional grounds or from presently available theory. Modifications required by the addition of viscous or finite-gyroradius effects are well defined but small and likely to be difficult to detect in practice. Assumptions of energy transfer by solar wind plasma entry leads to expressions equivalent, as far as dimensional arguments go, to those based on assumptions of electromagnetic or viscous coupling. Ionospheric conductivity effects are likely to be minor since Joule heating in the ionosphere is a relatively small fraction of the magnetospheric energy budget. All energy transfer formulas discussed presuppose a well-defined set of solar wind parameters and hence can be valid only on time scales longer than the solar wind flow time past the magnetosphere, which is also the expected time scale for energy storage (if any) in the magnetotail. © 1982.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12244299395

In this water heater the absorber plate performs the dual function of absorbing the solar energy and storing the heated water. In the theoretical study, the transient performance of the system is predicted by solving the mathematical models consisting of energy balance equations which are written on different collector nodes by considering their capacity effects and various heat loss effects. These equations are converted in the finite difference form and then solved by digital computer. Solar radiation and ambient temperature are represented by Fourier series in the theoretical analysis. Its night cooling drawback is somehow checked by covering the collector system by an insulation cover during cooling hours and also by using a insulated baffle plate inside the tank adjacent to the absorber plate. It is observed that by using the insulation cover, the collector performance can be improved by 70 per cent.

Prediction of quality changes under temperature fluctuations is therefore important in assuring high product quality and, by optimizing storage temperature, in conserving energy. This study is focused on applying kinetic models in analyzing Time‐Temperature‐Tolerance (TTT) data for frozen food storage and investigating the potential for use of kinetic parameters to describe quality degradation in frozen foods. Based on theoretical considerations, quality life and activation energy are related by the equation: ln tQ= ln B+Ea/R· 1/T where B is a function of the pre‐exponential of Arrhenius equation, initial and end point quality magnitude. Reasons for some TTT data to deviate from this relationship are: Different standards for measuring quality lives of different storage temperatures or experiments. Negative effect of temperature. Variations in initial or final quality magnitudes for a given experiment. Variations in packaging material and other factors influencing the quality magnitude or mode. ITT experiments are suitable approaches for obtaining activation energy constants, although they are not applicable for determination of reaction order and rate constant. When dealing with overall quality life of several contributing factors, quality life for each component is needed to get a better description. Quality changes in terms of fraction of initial quality magnitude retained can be described by quality life, activation energy, temperature history and the constant, α= CtQ/C0.

The uptake of 14C-labelled compounds and their respiration was measured with consideration of the natural concentration of the substrates which were measured directly by high performance liquid chromatography with fluoresencent detection. All incubations were carried out at in situ temperatures with trace amounts of labelled compounds without kinetic approach. The results show wide variations in microbial activity and actual substrate concentration which may be related to the physiological state and biomass of phytoplankton standing stock, dominated by Phaeocystis sp. and Thalassiosira sp. Microbial activities and biomass production were found to be comparable with others areas, e.g. the Baltic Sea. The composition of the dissolved and particulate matter in terms of amino acids, proteins, sugars and polysaccharides show many differences to other ecosystems. High levels of bound amino acids (dissolved proteins) often exceeding mg levels were found, particularly in waters with high chlorophyll contents (up to 30 μg·1-1) where the plankton populations' physiological state was poor. Analysis of filtered particulate matter after water extraction and exhaustive hydrolysis showed that healthy plankton cells produced large quantities of high energy nitrogen compounds centred around glutamine and its degradation products. These products could be found in the free-pool of amino acids, only traces following the breakdown of planktonic organisms. A storage of proteinaceous matter seems to be characteristics feature of the Antarctic ecosystem. © 1982.",,"Bransfield Strait; Falkland Islands; Phaeocystis; phytoplankton; Thalassiosira; Weddell Sea",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020458168

More than two-thirds of the total production of this crop is used as food for humans, with lesser amounts being used for animal feed and industrial purposes. The ingestion of high levels of cassava has been associated with chronic, cyanide toxicity in parts of Africa, but this appears to be related to inadequate processing of the root and poor overall nutrition. Although cassava is not a complete food it is important as a cheap source of calories. The crop has a high yield potential under good conditions, and compared to other crops it excels under suboptimal conditions, thus offering the possibility of using marginal land to increase total agricultural production. Breeding programs that bring together germ plasm from different regions coupled with improved agronomic practices can markedly increase yields. The future demand for fresh cassava may depend on improved storage methods. The markets for cassava as a substitute for cereal flours in bakery products and as an energy source in animal feed rations are likely to expand. The use of cassava as a source of ethanol for fuel depends on finding an efficient source of energy for distillation or an improved method of separating ethanol from water.

The injected volumes ranged from 500–1700 m3. Temperature profiles were measured daily in 12 boreholes distributed along two perpendicular axes within 13 m of the injection well. Individual temperatures were measured by ten thermistors placed in the caprock. The results are discussed and used to calibrate two mathematical models. An axisymmetric model allows the calibration of average values of the parameters, while a three‐dimensional model is used to determine their spatial variation in the horizontal plane. The latter model leads to the identification of a nonhomogeneous transmissibility field which fully accounts for both hydraulic and thermal contour curves. The models, which were matched against particular experiments, proved accurate when simulating other periods. Evidence is given of the importance to the recovery ratio of thermal dispersion in the aquifer and of the water content of the caprock. In a final section, experimental results of single well storage at Bonnaud, Campuget, and Auburn are compared with general type curves derived in the companion paper.

The introduction gives a general idea of the status of the SSP technology among various solar energy applications. This part also surveys designs and performance of both water bag type and large scale SSP, already experimentally studied by other workers. The analysis of thermal process of SSP takes the input energy, the mechanism of thermal absorption and various losses in the system, into consideration. The methods for the improvement of the system performance suggests the materials that can be used and designs that can be incorporated in the various components of SSP. Here, a detailed study of the module, the glazing, the glazing supports and the insulation is done. The auxiliary systems viz, the mode of water transfer and water storage, play an important part in the optimum performance of the SSP systems. The ""modes of operation"" gives an account of the three different ways of circulating the liquid through the system-batch heating, closed cycle continuous flow heating, and open cycle continuous cycle flow heating. The theoretical analysis of the thermal performance of the SSP is done by making use of the Hottel-Willier-Bliss model for the flat plate collectors. A computation based on this model is employed in evaluating the values of monthly average daily collections efficiency with respect to the ambient temperatures for various initial water temperatures. The results obtained from the experiments conducted by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, gives an idea of the system performance. The review also looks into the effects of various parameters, such as, the mass flow rate of the liquid, the total mass of water required per day, water depth, radiation intensity, average day-time ambient temperature, number of glazings, total heat loss coefficient, etc. The different modes of flow of the liquid are compared. An incorporation of the reflector in the SSP by various workers proved to provide a marked improvement in the system performance. The aspects such as, the cost effectiveness, maintenance and reliability of the SSP are briefly dealt with. It was felt that the review would be incomplete without a mention of the limitations and potential applications of the SSP. Based on these studies on SSP, done by various workers, the conclusion was that the performance of the system can be improved by the proper choice of the material, and by optimizing the design and the modes of operation. © 1982.","Hottel-Whillier-Bliss model; Industrial process heat; Shallow solar pond","SOLAR RADIATION - COLLECTORS; SOLAR PONDS; SOLAR ENERGY - APPLICATIONS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020429306

The system uses the airlift pump principle, whereby the flow of gas maintains circulation of the perfusate through the heart; no other energy source is required. Performance on ex vivo functional testing of 10 pig hearts stored for 20 to 24 hr using this system (group 3) was compared with that of freshly excised hearts (group 1) and hearts stored simply in the perfusate under hypothermic conditions, but not perfused (group 2). Group 2 hearts performed less well on functional testing than those of groups 1 and 3 which showed little statistical difference, suggesting good preservation by hypothermic perfusion. This has been confirmed by orthotopic transplantation of similarly preserved baboon hearts with survival until rejection at a mean of 27 days.

We studied PMN energy metabolism in fresh and stored PMN. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) decreased slightly in unstimulated PMN after 48 hours of storage at room temperature. Exposure of fresh PMN to opsonized zymosan resulted in a 12 percent decrease in ATP. In contrast, PMN stored for 24 or 48 hours at room temperature and then exposed to opsonized zymosan, showed significant decreases in ATP. Incubation of fresh or stored, stimulated (opsonized zymosan) or resting PMN with potassium cyanide resulted in no change in the pattern of ATP decrements during storage. Likewise, incubation of fresh or stored, stimulated or resting PMN in the presence or absence of extracellular glucose, resulted in no change in the pattern of ATP decrements during storage. Preincubation of PMN with 2‐deoxy‐glucose obscured the differences in ATP maintenance between fresh and stored PMN. ATP decrements were also observed in unstimulated PMN which had been stored at high cell concentrations. Decrements in ATP correlated stronglywith decreased glucose (r = .82) and pH (r = .89) in the storage medium. These decrements were partially reversed by incubation of PMN in fresh buffer. The ATP decrements in stored, concentrated granulocyte preparations thus were prevented by maintenance of pH. ATP decrements were not prevented by additional glucose. Thus, in PMN stored for 24 or 48 hours at room temperature, there was a defect in ATP maintenance which was occult in unstimulated cells, but was evoked by the energy‐dependent process, phagocytosis. These findings are compatible with a major role for glycolysis and glycogenolysis in maintaining ATP in fresh and stored PMN. Storage of PMN at high cell concentrations was accompanied by impaired ATP maintenanceand decreased pH in the storage medium, both of which were preventable by addition of alkali to the PMN concentrate prior to storage. 1982 AABB",,"adenosine triphosphate; glucose; blood and hemopoietic system; cell metabolism; human; human cell; neutrophil; normal human; Adenosine Triphosphate; Blood Glucose; Blood Preservation; Deoxyglucose; Energy Metabolism; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; N-Formylmethionine; N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine; Neutrophils; Oligopeptides; Phagocytosis; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Zymosan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020422973

The addition of a liquid having a high affinity, such as isopropyl myristate, fatty oil, lauryl alcohol, etc., remarkably accelerated the transition, whereas that of a low affinity liquid had little effect. The transition rate evaluated from the time course of transition degree (kT) increased linearly with the weight fraction ratio of liquid phase (fl) to solid phase (1-fl). The case where liquid phase was produced only from molten vehicle containing no liquid additive was also examined. The relation between kT and fl/(1 —fL) was investigated 1) for the transition of Witepsol H-15 in the temperature range from 26 to 32°C, and 2) for several commercial vehicles at 30°C. Linear relations also appeared to hold for both cases. Here, the weight fraction of liquid phase at a given temperature was determined by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The activation energy of transition (E≠) was compared in the presence and absence of liquid additives. E≠ values of Witepsol H-15 containing 10 and 25% fatty oil were about 40 kcal, less than one-half of that of Witepsol H-15 not containing any liquid additives. The transition mechanism was considered to involve dissolution of the solid A-form in the intervening liquid phase followed by crystallization as solid B-form. © 1982, The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

Factor V bound to membranes containing acidic phospholipids with a high collisional efficiency. For membranes of 20% phosphatidylserine—80% phosphatidylcholine, an association rate constant of (1.13 ± 0.10) × 108 M−1 s−1 was obtained. These membranes contained about 20 factor V binding sites per vesicle of 3.6 × 106 daltons. This association rate represented about a 30% collisional efficiency. Dissociation of factor V was measured by a fluorescence energy transfer method with a dissociation rate constant of 0.0055 s−1 at 10 °C. The equilibrium dissociation constant for binding to these membranes at 10 °C and 0.14 M ionic strength was 5 × 10−11 M. Ionic strength, pH, calcium, and charge density in the membrane had large effects on the rate of factor V—membrane dissociation, indicating a strongly ionic interaction between protein and membrane. In contrast, the association rate was nearly insensitive to ionic strength. The membrane-binding properties were relatively unchanged after thrombin digestion of factor V or after long-term protein storage which resulted in loss of procoagulant activity. Other proteins of the prothrombinase reaction greatly decreased the rate of factor Va—membrane dissociation. At protein saturation, factor V increased the hydrodynamic radius of phospholipid vesicles by 11.4 nm. In contrast, factor Va increased the hydrodynamic vesicle radius by only about 5 nm. The mass of membrane-bound protein was comparable for both proteins. © 1982, American Chemical Society.

The decay of the post‐depositional remanent magnetization (post‐DRM) during desiccation in magnetic field free space is measured as a function of the loss of water. The decay is ascribed to the drying effect and the time decay of viscous remanent magnetization (VRM). The VRM forms only 10 per cent of the total of loss of remanent magnetization. The decay due to the drying effects depends both on the loss of water and on either the evaporation rate or the period of storage. The percentage of loss of magnetization is independent of its intensity. A critical drying stage appears (about 60 per cent in water content on a dry basis) which is characterized as a vanishing point of mobile particles or particle units. The mobile particles or units play an important role both in acquisition and demagnetization through physical rotational motion within wet sediments before the critical drying stage. More than 80 per cent of the total loss of the post‐DRM is destroyed before the desiccation proceeds to the critical drying stage. The decay of post‐DRh4 is concluded to be mainly due to the physically random rotation of the magnetic particles trapped in shallow energy wells which are overcome by the torques caused by the application of the alternating magnetic field less than 200 Oe.

This leads to a greater work output when compared to a simple shortening contraction. The subjects performed vertical jumps with and without preliminary counter‐movement and with small and large knee angular displacement. The results indicated that those subjects who had more fast twitch (FT) fibers benefited more from the stretching phase performed with high speed and short angular displacement. The amounts of elastic energy stored in this phase were 30 and 26 N × kgBW‐1, respectively, for FT and slow twitch (ST) type subjects. The recoil of elastic energy was proportional to the amount of energy storage. In large amplitude jumps where transient period between stretch and shortening is long the both types of subjects demonstrated similar amount of storage of elastic energy (17 and 16 N × kgBW‐1, respectively). However, the re‐use of this elastic energy was greater in ST group (24%) as compared to the FT group (17%). The results can be interpreted through differences in sarcomere cross‐bridge life times between fast and slow muscle fibers.

The first is through photosynthesis and the generation of 'biomass' for use as fuel. While the storage of solar energy in the form of fuel may be indefinite, the second method of solar energy storage as sensible heat storage in water, rocks and the ground, is more truly interseasonal since storage is not indefinite, and stored energy which is not used during the following heating season will leak away naturally.

The first section (A: Waves and beaches) briefly deals with the transformation of deep-water wave energy as it crosses the shelf, nearshore and surfzone. Depending on the deep-water wave characteristics and shelf and inshore morphology, resultant breaker wave energy may be high, moderate or low, and the accompanying beach surfzone morphodynamic state in fine to medium sand beaches either dissipative, intermediate or reflective. Dissipative beaches have wide surfzones with shore parallel bar(s) and channel(s) and predominantly shore-normal circulation; intermediate beaches are characterised by rip circulation, crescentic-transverse bars and megacusps; and reflective beaches by a barless surfzone and steep, cusped or bermed beach. Each beach form has a characteristic level of beach stability, zone of sediment storage and mode of beach and dune erosion. Landward aeolian sediment transport of swash-deposited sand (Section B) is dependent on the subaerial beach topography and the aerodynamic flow regime across that topography. Characteristic profile shapes are ascribed to each beach type (dissipative, intermediate and reflective). Aeolian sand transport rates are potentially highest on dissipative beaches, moderate on intermediate beaches and lowest on reflective beaches. These rates determine the potential size of foredunes which are correspondingly largest on dissipative beaches and smallest on reflective beaches. The combination of mode and frequency of beach/dune erosion, rates of aeolian sand transport, and foredune volume and morphology provide an explanation of the nature and morphology of landward-occurring, large-scale dune systems. Dissipative beaches are frequently characterised by large-scale transgressive dune sheets; intermediate, by a trend from large-scale parabolic dune systems (high-wave energy) to small-scale blowouts (low-wave energy); and reflective beaches by minimal dune development. © 1982.",,"GEOLOGY - Geomorphology; OCEANOGRAPHY; COASTAL ZONES; BEACHES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020336220

From these results, type curves are plotted for several sets of dimensionless parameters, covering the range of practical applications.

With this in mind, long-term leaching tests on full-scale radioactive waste blocks were carried out by the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) in France. The monoliths investigated were 200-L cylinders, consisting of liquid and solid wastes containing α, β and γ emitters, embedded in cement or bitumen. Leaching was carried out by a procedure derived from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recommendations, with a combined concern for specific safety requirements and the radiological capacity of the storage sites. The tests were conducted at a testing station built for this purpose at the Saclay Nuclear Research Center, featuring several instrumented loops (volume = 3000 L). Counts and analyses of the leachates served to calculate the cumulative fractions of radionuclides released, and to estimate the structural and chemical changes in the waste forms (blocks). The fractions released in eighteen months of 137Cs and 239Pu respectively, were 1 × 10-2 and 5 × 10-6 for cement matrices, and 1 × 10-4 and 1 × 10-5 for bitumen matrices. The assessment of changes in the matrices served chiefly to note incipient carbonatation in the cement matrices. These tests should be continued for several years, in order to provide an understanding of the exchange mechanisms between the waste forms and the environment. © 1982.",,"CHEMICAL OPERATIONS - LEACHING; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS - WASTE DISPOSAL; cesium 137; plutonium 239; radioisotope; leaching; nonhuman; radioactive waste; theoretical study; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020331030

A mixed-integer programming model is used which incorporates time-of-day on-farm energy use and options for: electricity load management, conventional waste disposal, sales of electricity to the utility by the farmer, installation of a heat exchanger in conjunction with the digester, and biogas storage. A second aspect analyzes the effect of some of the institutional and technological changes affecting adoption of anaerobic digestion systems. The few institutional arrangements considered are marginal cost pricing versus average cost pricing by the utility and the impact of allowing the farmer to sell electricity to the utility. The technological changes considered are a 20% increase in digester efficiency and a 20% decrease in digester fixed cost. The 20% decrease in digester fixed cost could also be attained through an institutional arrangement such as capital tax credits. However, no particular tax policy is analyzed in this paper. It was found that under baseline marginal cost prices of $3.69/GJ for natural gas, $0.036/kWh (off peak), $0.061/kWh (peak) and $0.04/kWh (partial peak), a 100-head dairy should not install an anaerobic digester. Under marginal cost pricing, breakeven prices are $7.64/GJ, $0.78/kWh (off peak), $0.115/kWh (peak) and $0.082/kWh (partial peak) for a system which incorporates a plug flow digester with a heat exchanger, a 32 kW generator and sale of electricity to the utility. Optimal management implies sale of electricity in peak and partial peak periods, purchase of electricity in off peak and partial peak periods and that all thermal demands are met by waste heat from the 32 kW generator. Without the option of selling to the utility, the breakeven prices are significantly higher. Comparing average cost pricing to marginal cost pricing by the utility indicates that average cost pricing acts as a greater incentive to the adoption of anaerobic digestion. Load management has significant returns under marginal cost pricing. A 20% increase in digester efficiency or decrease in digester fixed cost will result in similar reductions in breakeven prices by 6 to 9% if sales of electricity to the utility can take place. When sales cannot occur, increasing efficiency is no stimulus to adoption, because excess biogas is flared. However, decreasing digester fixed cost still has a strong effect. © 1982.",,"methane; dairy industry; energy recovery; manure; prevention; sludge digestion; theoretical study; therapy; ECONOMICS - ANALYSIS; METHANE - MANUFACTURE; AGRICULTURAL WASTES; BIOGAS MANUFACTURE; DAIRIES - WASTE UTILIZATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020330153

Since the resistivity of CA is a sensitive function of humidity, resistivities of control samples were also measured and these controls were subjected to the same storage conditions and humidity controls as the irradiated samples. Our measurements showed that the decrease in resistivity for the irradiated samples was only about 10% when compared to the control samples.

By use of inductive energy storage, current through the surge arrestor is maintained in spite of device impedance changes. The energy storage inductor is energized by a self-excited homopolar generator. Current levels of up to 65 kA, corresponding to a stored energy of 3 MJ, are obtained by selecting initial generator speed. Discharge of this inductor into a surge arrestor results in a decaying current pulse with a duration determined by the L/R time constant of the circuit.

Neutron diffusion problems require substantial computer storage arising from the energy and spatial dependence, while in the case of transport problems the angular dependence of the neutron flux and of the neutron scattering process gives rise to a further considerable increase in storage. In the present work, a method has been developed which greatly eases the bandwidth problem in the solution of large systems of linear equations and algorithms have been developed to assemble and solve such systems of equations in one and two dimensions. The formalism used is the variational method and, for simplicity, linear interpolating functions have been used to derive a symmetric banded system of equations. Finite element algorithms have been implemented in the codes FEED1 and FEED2, which treat one and two space dimensions, respectively. Three benchmark problems are analysed in this paper and results are compared with finite difference discrete ordinate method solutions. It is shown that the finite element method provides fast and accurate solutions to neutron diffusion and transport problems.

The room is assumed to have losses on three faces and 8.36 m2 (90 ft2) of south glazing. Let r denote the ratio of the surface area of the mass wall to the area of the south facing glazing. The effect of r on mass walls 10.16, 20.32 and 30.48 cm (4, 8 and 12 in.) thick was determined for values of r equal to 1, 2, 4, 8 and 11.1. The temperature and solar insolation values for a typical January day in Nebraska were duplicated thirty consecutive times and were used for the weather data input to the modeling program. Using thirty consecutive like days has the advantage of damping out the transient solution to the point where it is negligible. It was found that for each thickness of wall, the temperature fluctuations over a day decrease as r increases, and it was also found that for a fixed value of r, the daily temperature fluctuations decrease as the wall thickness is increased. These results are consistent with those reported by Mazria. In addition cloudy day storage was considered for both the 10.16 and 20.32 cm (4 and 8 in.) walls, with r fixed at 4, runs were made with 20, 33, 50 and 100 per cent cloudy days. The results are presented in graphical form and indicate a rapid recovery of the system in most cases. © 1982.",,"BUILDINGS -THERMAL INSULATION; ENERGY STORAGE; SOLAR ENERGY; HEATING - SOLAR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020294345

The flow of fluid and heat capacity of the storage material in the container is considered simultaneously and an evaluation is made for the resulting outlet fluid temperature for various flow rates and materials by solving the Fourier heat conduction equation with appropriate boundary conditions in different regions. This evaluation, combined with energy balance considerations, yields an expression for the transient rate at which heat can be retrieved-by keeping flow rate constant. Numerical calculations, corresponding to a typical winter day in Delhi have been carried out. The heat retrieval efficiencies are of the order of 50-25%. A phase difference of about 12-18 h is obtained between the maxima of solair temperature and outlet water temperature. The efficiency of the system increases with flow rate and decreases with depth of plane of heat retrieval. Concrete is found to be the best inexpensive sensible heat storage material out of those materials considered. © 1982.","Ground collector; Solar energy; Storage system","SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; SOILS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020289470

When the rocks used for storage contain significant concentrations of uranium, 222Rn and its daughters may be released to the living area. A microcomputer model was used to simulate variations in air filtration rate and source strength through several days of operation. Source strengths were estimated from theoretical considerations and literature data. Resulting 222Rn and daughter concentrations were computed by solving system equations by fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration. During the day, when the living space is isolated from the radon source, interior 222Rn concentrations approach those of the outdoors. A nighttime steady-state concentration is approached about 6 h after heat discharge begins. Due to the dynamic nature of the simulation, equilibrium between 222Rn and its daughters is not reached. Time-weighted average nighttime exposures (6 p.m.-8 a.m.) for 10 simulation runs varied from 0.001 to 0.018 working level (WL). Comparison with one set of measurement data showed the model to overpredict concentrations but to approximate the 222Rn buildup rate well. Combinations of source strength, infiltration rate, and exterior radon concentration which would lead to exposures exceeding 0.02 WL were calculated. © 1982.",,"AIR POLLUTION - Analysis; COMPUTER SIMULATION; HOUSES; SOLAR ENERGY - Energy Storage; RADON; radioisotope; radon 222; radon daughter; uranium; housing; indoor air pollution; model; nonbiological model; nonhuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020285664

The external heat has been used to raise the temperature of the gas. Most of the previous measurements were done adiabetically, and the specific heats were found to decrease with increasing frequencies. Unlike the previous adiabetic studies the present non-adiabetic measurements show an increase of the specific heat with increasing frequencies. The measurements were done in both the kilocycle and megacycle regions. For measurements in the kilocycle region frequencies ranging from 30 kHZ to 50 kHZ were used. In the megacycle region four frequencies namely 1.5 MHZ, 2 MHZ, 2.5 MHZ and 3 MHZ have been used. No appreciable change of specific heat was observed in the kilocycle region. But in the megacycle region a definite increase of the specific heat has been observed. This increase has been found to be 1.21 fold for 1.5 MHZ, 1.64 for 2 MHZ, 2.06 fold for 2.5 MHZ and 2.48 fold for 3 MHZ. These phenomena are comparable with the relaxation of refractive indices or the dielectric constant. Hence Kramer-Kronig's equations have been used to correlate the real and imaginary parts of the specific heats. These suggest that the specific heat vs. frequency curve in non-adiabetic cases will have a singularity in the gigacycle region, i.e. the non-adiabetic specific heat will tend to infinity in this region. An infinite specific heat means, the gas will not warm up no matter how large the applied heat may be. The energy will be stored up in the molecules and can be used when the ultrasound is turned off. Thus this effect may lead to the development of a new energy storage-technique and a new source of energy. © Copyright 1982, by Walter de Gruyter & Co.",,"AIR - Specific Heat; SPECIFIC HEAT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020276031

In a once-through system, the storage tank can be placed below the collector, therefore, the load on the roof will be cut down significantly. This system also has the advantages of no mixing of hot and cold water, no reverse flow and being able to provide hot water earlier, etc. Both theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted to compare the collector efficiences between the once-through and natural circulation systems and they coincide with each other very well. The once-through system performs worse in the morning but better in the afternoon than the natural circulation system and the difference of daily collector efficiency between these two systems is negligible. © 1982.",,"MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020273607

Since this neglects mixing, eddy currents and other degradation mechanisms, it provides an upper limit to the performance of a stratified thermocline storage tank. The calculation can be carried out for any selection of dimensions, temperatures, and choice of insulation. The results indicate that heat conduction through the insulation to the ambient can be a larger loss mechanism than conduction across the thermocline, except in large diameter tanks with very heavy insulation. With a properly designed tank (length/diameter &gt; 10, diameter &gt; 1.5 ft, insulation resistance &gt; 20 hr ft2 °F/B.t.u.) efficient storage of heat through a daily cycle should be routinely simple based on conduction. Experiments were carried out in static and dynamic modes. In the static experiments, a fixed thermocline was established, and temperatures were monitored at spatial intervals above and below the thermocline. Some mixing occurred during formation of the thermocline, which caused an initial broadening not present in the calculations. Aside from this, it was found that the spreading of the thermocline was only slightly faster than predicted by conduction theory. If a thinner wall tank had been available, agreement between experiment and theory probably would have been closer. Dynamic experiments were conducted with a moving thermocline (both upward and downward). The results indicate preservation of the initial thermocline was excellent at linear flow rates below about 0.2 ft/min. It is believed that stratified thermocline storage has been shown to be technically viable. © 1982.","Conduction; Energy storage; Heat loss; Solar energy; Stratification; Thermal storage; Thermocline","ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020267512

For the reaction to be carried out in the liquid phase, under pressure, some comparisons have been made among heat storage capacities (HSC) with respect to different processes. An hypotetical plant based upon the reversible reaction has HSC from 1.7 to 3 times greater than one employing direct heating of water; the latter being based upon a ΔT of 30-100°C. The investigated reaction has one of the lowest turning temperatures (about 60°C) among those useful for the storage of solar energy by means of flat collectors.

The system consists of storage volumes with the condenser and absorber of the conventional absorption cycle heat pump to store liquid refrigerant, weak and strong solutions during the generation period, which are required for the heat pump operation during the generation off period. A time dependent mass and energy storage analysis based on mass and energy balance equations for various components of the heat pump system has been carried out to evaluate energy storage concentration and storage efficiency for combined and separate storage schemes for the weak and strong solutions. Two possible performance modes, viz constant pumping ratio or the constant flow of the strong solution from the absorber to the generator have been analysed: the latter is preferable over the former from a practical point of view. Numerical computer simulation has been made for a typical winter day in Melbourne (Australia) with the desired heating load specified. It is found that the concept of refrigerant storage within the absorption cycle heat pump is technically feasible for efficient space heating. The energy storage concentration in the condenser store is slighly higher while that in absorber store is slightly lower for the separate storage mode as compared to the combined storage. However, the combined storage has an advantage of less storage volume and hence is more cost effective than separate storage and the disadvantage of limited system operation due to the decrease of solution concentrations. © 1982.","Absorption heat pump; energy storage; Mass storage; Simulated heat input; Thermodynamic feasibility","HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020249226

Storage of whole or ground grains or of moistened whole corn did not result in differences in their fat content, in the metabolizable energy (ME) of the diets containing these grains, or in the performance of chicks fed these diets, but moistened whole sorghum affected performance adversely. Fat content in moistened ground grains decreased markedly during storage, but fatty acid ratios, vitamin E, carotene, xanthophyll, and protein levels were not markedly affected.

The need for this term is especially apparent when the applied field is directed along an easy magnetization direction, a condition that occurs in the model transfer gates.

Tracing the history of the subject, the paper explains the general characteristics of lyoluminescence of organic compounds and outlines the range of materials suitable as LL phosphors. The effect in organic solids is a consequence of reactions of radiation-induced free radicals, which in solution are free to react. The Russell-Vassil'ev scheme of reactions of secondary peroxy radicals is apparently involved in the lyoluminescence of substances dissolved in pure water. In solutions of chemiluminescent sentizers, like luminol or lucigenin, radicals initiate a sequence of processes leading to intensely luminescent reactions, thus enchancing the LL yield. Another technique of increasing the sensitivity of dosimetry based on lyoluminescence is based on the energy transfer to intensely luminescent dyes, ions or complexes added to the solution. LL dosimetry employing inorganic phosphors (alkali halides) depends on a different physical mechanism i.e. on the formation of electron and hole defects in the crystal, and the subsequent reactions of electron and hole products near the surface of dissolving material. In pure water both F- and V2-centres are needed, but in solutions of certain sensitizers (luminol, fluorescent dyes, thallous chloride) only F-centres are required. Part I gives examples of dose-LL yield relationships for typical materials, both organic and inorganic, and deals with the environmental effect on the storage and read-out of dosimeters. © 1982.",,"dosimetry; lyoluminescence dosimetry; methodology; nonhuman; theoretical study; DOSIMETRY; CHEMILUMINESCENCE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020208422

A criterion based on empirical evidence is formulated which shows a limit is approached as steady operating conditions are attained. For sodium chloride ponds, the criterion indicates a dependence between salt and temperature gradients during steady-state conditions. At the present time, appropriate data for explaining the physical basis of this relationship are not available. Significant results are found as a result of the gradient zone criterion. First, the gradient zone criterion leads to an explanation for the formation of an upper convecting zone. Results obtained with the gradient zone criterion relate to salt maintenance in a pond. Depending on the temperature operating conditions of a pond, a specific amount of salt must be in the pond. Also, salt concentration levels maintained in the upper and lower convecting zones are shown to significantly affect a pond’s thermal energy performance. © 1982 by ASME.",,"WATER RESOURCES; SOLAR ENERGY - ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020206122

As part of this research program, four buried tank experiments were operated between December 1978 and March 1981 in order to determine the feasibility of ground-coupled tanks in these systems. Heat was added to or removed from the tanks according to a weekly schedule derived from computer simulations of solar heat-pump systems in the local (New York) climate. Each tank was operated according to a different control strategy. This paper presents experimental results from these tank experiments for this period, and compares these results to those generated by a computer model, GROCS, developed at BNL. The model is found to be valid, for the most part, using undisturbed soil thermal properties which provide the best fit to the data most of the time. Its results are very sensitive to soil thermal conductivity during periods of large heat addition to the tanks. A ground coupled tank is found to be desirable in series solar-assisted heat-pump systems.

This is the situation faced by a state agency which is responsible for the purchasing of oil products to satisfy the demand of a country in which demand for energy has stabilized at a certain level. An important feature of the model is that the price of the commodity is described by a stochastic process. This reflects the volatility of prices of oil products. Furthermore, the model takes storage capacity constraints explicitly into account, and thus can help to assess the optimal level of storage capacity expansion. The relevant stochastic dynamic programming equations are derived and solved for the least cost function, which turns out to be piecewise linear in the inventory level. The storage capacity enters only in the computation of the constant term of the value function. The solution of the dynamic programming equation leads also to the optimal purchasing strategy of agencies with different levels of flexibility in their policy: in the model, an agency can be allowed or not to resell from the stock and it can have finite or infinite storage capacity. © 1982.",,"MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING, DYNAMIC; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020204642

Enhanced sensitivity was achieved by use of a commercial concentrator which permitted the Introduction of 40 µL of eluant onto fused silica capillary and packed columns. Estimated from recovery studies, detection limits were In the 0.1-0.2 µg/m3 range for seven volatile nitrosamines. The method was applied to the analysis of air In tire storage areas. N-Nitrosodimethylamine In the 0.1-0.3 µg/m3 range and N-nltrosomorphollne (NMOR) In the 0.3-12 µg/m3 range were determined by both GC/MS and the GC/thermal energy analyzer (TEA). Cartridges not preeluted tended to yield lower TEA values by a factor of 2-3. A suppressive TEA Interference Is suggested. © 1982, American Chemical Society.

In particular, we propose liquid phase Diels‐Alder cycloaddition chemistry as an important class of reversible reactions for such low or moderate temperature thermochemical energy conversion systems. One of the important attributes of thermally driven Diels‐Alder reactions is their concerted mechanism, with consequent high yields and efficiencies relative to liquid photochemical systems. Since the systems we propose involve organic species, with thermal stability concerns above about 400°C, it is important to demonstrate equilibrium shift capability for the highly energetic reactions sought. We have therefore carried out experimental studies with model liquid Diels‐Alder systems that clearly demonstrate the degree of control over equilibrium available through substituent entropy effects. For example, Keq is unity at about 420°C (T*) for the anthracene/maleic anhydride system (in solvent) while a phenyl substituent on the anthracene or isopropyl substituent on the anhydride reduce T* to about 200°C at constant ΔH0. These results are of importance as regards subsequent systematic identification of Diels‐Alder reactions having ideal thermochemical and physical properties. We also have developed a rapid NMR technique for qualitative screening of candidate reactions, and have applied this technique to the study of various bicyclic diene/fumaric acid ester systems. Our paper further points to the need for better understanding of the catalysis likely required for these liquid phase Diels‐Alder reactions.

The hydrides of Zr1-xTix MnFe alloys have dissociation pressures in the range 1-2 atm at room temperature (23 °C).

Thus, MNOS memory has the drawback of short life. It is difficult to understand the change in the aging characteristics by means of functional tests, but for digital LSI the operation‐limited supply voltage variation method can be used to characterize the variation of intrinsic device characteristics. In this paper the above‐mentioned method is actually applied to the MNOS memory, and a capacitor charging and discharging model is proposed to quantify the aging‐caused changes. The agreement between the test results and the model, the activation energy for the changes, as well as the calculation method for the lifetime are presented. It is shown that the MNOS device change can be estimated by the operation‐limited supply voltage test method, the magnitude of the change in the characteristics due to aging is modeled as an exponential function exp (‐t/τ) with respect to the time t and time constant τ, which can be shortened with an increase in temperature.

In both species, respiration with 100% N2 resulted in a decrease of tissue oxygen tension to near 0 mmHg and reduction of cytochrome aa3. However, N2 respiration resulted in only moderate elevation of [K+]0 in turtle brain while [K+]0 in rat brain was elevated to levels greater than 50 mM. In additon, N2 respiration in turtles had no effect on the rate of recovery of [K+]0, which was elevated by direct electrical stimulation of the brain. Electrocorticographic activity (ECoG) of the turtle brain was only moderately depressed during N2 respiration for up to 4 h whereas the ECoG of rat brain became isoelectric within 2 min. Inhibition of glycolysis with iodoacetate (IAA) resulted in rapid elevation of [K+]0 in turtle brain during anoxia, but IAA had little effect on [K+]0 during normoxia. These results indicate that the remarkable resistance of the diving turtle to anoxia does not result from continued provision of oxygen to the brain either by redistribution of systemic blood flow or from blood O2 storage. In addition, the turtle brain does not rely on cellular stores of high-energy compounds for maintenance of ionic homeostasis. We conclude that potassium ion homeostasis in the anoxic turtle brain must result from increased glycolytic ATP production and from decreased energy utilization.",,"cytochrome c oxidase; potassium; cytochrome c oxidase; potassium; animal experiment; brain metabolism; brain oxygen tension; central nervous system; electrocorticography; energy transfer; glycolysis; hypoxia; rat; reptile; animal; anoxia; article; brain; homeostasis; metabolism; microelectrode; oxidation reduction reaction; species difference; turtle; Animal; Anoxia; Brain; Cytochrome-c Oxidase; Homeostasis; Microelectrodes; Oxidation-Reduction; Potassium; Rats; Species Specificity; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Turtles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020189438

As such, these simulation tools calculate detailed production statistics by modeling the hour by hour operation of a power system over the planning horizon. An example of such a production analysis code is GLIMPS, described in reference 1–2. By integrating the hourly operation of central storage into the unit commitment and economic dispatch routines, production analysis codes can be used to assess the production credits associated with the storage technologies. These credits can then be used to value central storage by determining the present worth production costs with and without storage over the planning horizon. The methodology proposed dispatches the generation system and central storage in a way that levelizes the incremental cost of production over a predefined interval of time. The premise is, that if the incremental cost of energy is the same for each hour in the interval that the production costs over the interval will be a minimum. Formulated as a Kuhn-Tucker constrained optimization problem, the charging and discharging rate constraints can easily be satisfied. Further, the Kuhn-Tucker dual variables can be used to determine the extent to which improvements in levelized incremental cost operation can be made by relaxing the constraints on charge and discharge rates. A simple example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in determining levelized incremental cost operating strategies for a system with central storage.

For a broad class of technically and economically practical solar energy systems, storage costs need only be low enough to make a system employing very small amounts of storage practical. Reductions in the cost of collectors will thereafter produce greater reductions in the total system costs or provide greater fuel displacement at constant total system cost than will reductions in the cost of storage, within the limits discussed in the body of the paper.

Background voltammograms were obtained for these electrolytes on carbon and n-GaAs electrodes. The anodic stability limit was found to be enhanced on n-GaAs relative to carbon in all cases. The cathodic decomposition potential of the electrolyte showed a smaller positive shift on n-GaAs with the exception of the 3:1 AlCl3-BPBr electrolyte. The difference in electrolyte stability behavior on carbon and n-GaAs is interpreted in terms of carrier density effects. Cyclic voltammograms were compared on carbon in the various electrolytes for a model redox system comprising the ferrocene Iferricenium couple. The separation of the cathodic and anodic waves in all the cases was consistent with a quasi-reversible redox behavior—the most sluggish electron transfer being observed in the case of the 3:1 AlCl3-BpBr electrolyte. These results are compared with those obtained previously on the AlCl3-butyl pyridinium chloride (BPC) system. Capacitance-voltage measurements were made on n-GaAs electrodes in contact with the various electrolytes. Flatband-potentials (Vfb) were deduced from these data using Mott-Schottky plots. The relative positions of the n-GaAs band-edges and the redox levels were mapped on a common potential scale utilizing these data.

A new concept of latent heat storage of solar energy via the refrigerant‐absorbent mass storage in absorption cycle heat pump systems used for solar space heating/cooling has been proposed and assessed thermodynamically. A computer modelling and numerical simulation study shows that the concept of refrigerant storage is fundamentally sound, technically feasible and yields the following advantages over other storage methods: (i) the storage capacity per unit volume is high as the latent heat of vaporization of the refrigerant is high; (ii) the heat loss from the storage to the surroundings is minimum as the storage temperature is near the ambient; (iii) prolonged energy storage is possible with no degradation in system performance and hence suitable for combined solar heating and airconditioning. The effects of operating parameters on the energy storage concentration and storage efficiency have been studied in detail.

The solidification interface, which is at uniform temperature, will form in a shape such that the non-uniform energy convected to it is locally balanced by conduction into the solid. The interface shape is of interest relative to the crystal structure formed during solidification; regulating the crystal structure has application in casting naturally strengthened metallic composites. The results also pertain to phase-change energy storage devices, where the solidified configuration and overall heat transfer are needed. The analysis uses a conformal mapping technique to relate the desired interface coordinates to the components of the temperature gradient at the interface.

The control and monitoring functions are grouped into six categories. The requirements described in each category provide a basis for more detailed design and for specifications which can be more utility - and DSG-dependent.

Various storage concepts have been extensively investigated. However, little research has been done on energy storage in the heat-of- adsorption of chemical compounds. Zeolite is, perhaps, the only substance that has been studied for its heat-of- adsorption properties (1). A recent proposal utilizes the hygroscopic properties of sodium sulfide for thermal storage (2). Sodium sulfide has a storage capacity of 3600 kJ per kilogram. The system is economically desirable as sodium sulfide costs a mere $0.27 per kilogram (3). Experimental research has been continuing for a year on the feasibility of the system. The performance of the model has been reasonably close to the expected level. It is believed that further work can raise the storage temperatures to levels suitable for space heating and other low temperature ap plications. This system has two problems: 1) the salt has to be under vacuum, 2) the chemical odor in the vacuum pump exhaust. A new conceptual design has been developed that eliminates the problem of odor and the need for a vacuum pump. © 1982, Sage Publications.

At the first level a quadratic programming procedure optimizes the operation of pumped hydrostorage plants over a period of one day for specified terminal stored energy levels. At the second level a dynamic programming successive approximations procedure determines optimal stored energy levels at the beginning of each day. Uncertainty resulting from generating unit forced outages, electric load and run of the river variations is incorporated at this level. The method has been implemented using sparcity techniques. Results obtained with a realistic 46-generating unit, 11,900 MW peak load system are included. The results indicate that the impact of generating unit forced outages and load uncertainty on storage plant scheduling is substantial. In general, thermal unit outages amplify the economic benefits from storage plants. Also for a given electric power system there exists an optimal total capacity of storage plants. The methodology of this paper is applicable for scheduling other storage plants and can be used for operations planning as well as expansion planning.

One possibility is to run a detailed numerical simulation of the system. However, for a single‐well system in which fluid flow is limited to steady radial flow, a characterization scheme based on a set of four dimensionless parameter groups allows production temperatures and energy recovery factors to be read from graphs. The assumption of radial fluid flow is valid when buoyancy flow can be neglected and a well is fully screened in a horizontal aquifer which is confined above and below by impermeable layers. Criteria for little buoyancy flow include a low permeability or vertically stratified aquifer, a small temperature difference between injected and ambient water, and short cycle length. The basic energy transport equations for the aquifer‐confining layer system with steady radial fluid flow in the aquifer are nondimensionalized to derive the key parameter groups. Next a numerical model which calculates the heat transfer in the aquifer and confining layers for an injection‐storage‐production cycle is run for a range of values of these groups. The calculated production temperatures and energy recovery factors are then presented graphically as a function of the parameter groups. Comparisons between results of field experiments and recovery factors read from the graphs show good agreement.

New data on trap density, trapping length, and capture cross section for A12O3 and Si3N4 were derived from these measurements. The trapping length in A12O3 is about 5 times larger than in Si3N4. The charge-detrapping rate in Al2O3 is smaller than in Si3N4. The experimental charge-centroid relation during charge trapping and charge detrapping is described by two expressions which include the capture cross section as the only physical parameter. The calculated capture cross section is constant for MNOS and also during charge trapping in MAOS, but decreases linearly with propagating centroid position after onset of charge detrapping within Al2O3. Trap-assisted tunneling over multiple deep trap levels in Al2O3 is proposed to interpret the results for MAOS. Oxygen annealing of Al2O3 enhances storage capability of injected negative charge within the lower bandgap Si3N4 region of the MANOS structure. This behavior is related to blocking of detrapped nitride charge at the oxygen densified energy barrier created at the Si3N4-Al2O3 boundary.

However, the advantage of the high operating efficiency afforded by these fuel cells is partially offset by (a) the limited viability and high cost of the catalysts, (b) the highly corrosive electrolytes, and (c) the elevated operating temperatures. The possibility exists to reduce some of these problems through the development of bioelectrochemical fuel cells. Such biological/electrochemical systems incorporate either microorganisms or enzymes as an active component within the specified electrode compartments. Recent studies with microorganisms as part of the anode compartment have been aimed at defining the mechanism of the observed electrochemical reactions. Recent investigations on the use of cell-free enzyme preparations in the electrode compartments have dealt primarily with developing methodology and defining mechanisms for enhancing the rate of electron transfer from the enzyme-cofactor active site to the solid electrode surface. Applications of this developing technology have been envisioned for analytical chemistry, medical devices, energy transfer, electrochemical synthesis, and detoxification. In this review, the theory and problems of bioelectrochemical fuel cells are described and related to research, both recent and proposed, for the practical development of this area. © 1982.","Electrochemistry; enzyme electrode; fuel cell; immobilized cofactors; mediators; microbial electrode","BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ENZYMES AND ENZYME TECHNOLOGY; BIOELECTROCHEMICAL FUEL CELLS; FUEL CELLS",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020128477

Both Approaches Are Essentially Two-Dimensional, Corresponding To Waves Normally Incident Upon The Duck String, And Comparison Of The Two Sets Of Results For A Duck On A Fixed Axis Shows Good Agreement.236 with a corresponding theoretical wave has been made by Brevig et al. (1981), where the agreement between the time progression of the two waves is fair, the differences being due to the method of generation of the experimental wave differing from the sinusoidal wave used as the initial condition for the theoretical wave. In this paper we present more realistic initial conditions suggested by the start of the photograph sequence shown in figure 4. Here the duck has been positioned in the water at the nominal breaking point of the wave (as if the duck were absent) and held on a fixed axis. The sequence shown in figure 4 is in fact made up from separate runs of the wave, taking one photograph per run. This requires good repeatability of the wave profile, which is demonstrated by comparing the photographs of figure 5 where three separate runs are photographed at a particular instant.From a series of extensive tests undertaken at the University of Edinburgh in 1978 (see Edinburgh Wave Power Project 19786) we know that an undamped duck on a rigid axis will have higher angular velocities, and consequently greater angular displacements than those of ducks on a compliant axis. Therefore we regard the undamped duck on a rigid axis as a good check for the theory.Figure 6 presents measurements of the wave profile without the duck, and the forces on the axis in the heave-and-surge direction. The sign convention is positive upwards for heave, positive opposite the wave direction for surge, and positive anticlockwise for nod.Before we start the time-stepping we need to provide the following initial conditions: wave elevation and velocity potential on the free surface, and position and velocity of the body. In principle it should be possible to start the body from rest in locally calm water with an incident wave some distance from the body; in practice this would require prohibitive amounts of computer storage and time to run a wave break. We therefore obtain initial conditions from the photographs just before the wave break as described below.Figure 7 shows theoretical results for initial conditions as follows: the centre of gravity, mass and moment of inertia are taken from experimental data; the initial displacement and velocity is taken from the photographs ((0 = 0); behind the duck the wave elevation and velocity potential are taken to be zero; the incident wave is given from linear theory for deep water waves (wavelength 110 m, crest-to-trough height 20 m and water depth 60 m, corresponding closely to the experimental wave); at distances greater than ¾ wavelength from the duck the elevation and velocity potential on the free surface is decreased linearly with distance to zero at 5/4 wavelengths from the duck. Thus we are able to apply periodic boundary conditions over this control volume. Returning to figure 7, we see that the duck capsizes fully during the sequence, and the numerical solution breaks down because the duck submerges. Comparison with the sequence of photographs of figure 4 shows that the duck velocities and positions look correct, but the wave profile generated by the above initial conditions is incorrect and does not lead to the spilling breaker seen in the experiments, but rather simulates duck capsize in large but non-breaking waves. Furthermore, the sharp corners in the free surface are almost certainly due to the numerical scheme used, and more especially to the placing of the point of intersection of the body and the free surface.We refine the initial conditions as shown in figure 8, where the control volume length is increased to 7/4 wavelengths, and the linear decrease is applied both behind and in. © 1982, Cambridge University Press.

The most efficient of the EPDM impact modifiers had melt viscosities similar to that of the starting PP under the conditions of mixing. The course of maximum load at rupture (Fmax) and notched impact strength as functions of temperature showed some analogies with one another as well as with the dynamic mechanical storage (E′) and with the mechanical loss factor (tan δ). Thus, linear regression analysis was applied to the following relations: Fmax vs. (E′; tan δ; impact strength), F2max vs. (tan δ, impact strength) and impact strength vs. tan δ. The optimum correlation coefficients were obtained for Fmax vs. E′ and impact strength vs. tan δ. The supposed linearity of the former relation suggested that notched small Charpy specimens behaved as linear elastic bodies at high-rate three-point bending while the latter function referred to the significant role of relaxation of the EPDM impact modifier in the dissipation of impact energy during brittle or semi-brittle fracture of the two-phase PP/EPDM blends. The above relations are rendered probable by the fact that frequency of impact load is 102 to 103 Hz while that of the dynamic mechanical measurements is about 101 Hz. © 1982.","dynamic mechanical properties; ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymers; fracture mechanics; impact strength; polymer blend; Polypropylene","MATERIALS TESTING - Impact; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES; POLYPROPYLENE - Blending; RUBBER, SYNTHETIC - Blending; POLYMER BLENDS; POLYMERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020126938

Hormone release, monitored by immunoassay or protein measurement, was dependent on time, pH and temperature. Release was higher at alkaline pH and the calculated activation energies of 10.1 and 16.1 Kcal/mol were consistent with physiological energy requirements. Glutathione (GSH) and other thiols, but not nonthiol reducing compounds, stimulated hormone release, whereas disulfides inhibited. The high potency of GSH (50% protein release at 0.94 mM) suggested that it might be physiologically relevant for GH and PRL release. Associated with major release caused by 5 mM GSH (85 ± 5% of the total protein; n = 10) was nearly complete disruption of granule structure as visualized by electron microscopy. Granules treated with thiols displayed an increased number of hormonal antigenic sites, since immunoassays of GH and PRL revealed more than 100% of the hormone measured without thiols. Electrophoretic characterization of released proteins demonstrated mobilities identical to those of purified GH and PRL, regardless of preincubation conditions. When total granule proteins were electrophoresed in nondenaturing gels or in sodium dodecyl sulfate without mercaptoethanol, some high molecular weight protein failed to enter the gels. This band was abolished in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels containing mercaptoethanol, in which the only stainable proteins had hormonal mobility. The sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide and 5, 5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibited release but could not prevent GSH stimulation. These data suggest that thiols may influence GH and PRL release from isolated secretory granules at multiple sites, including the disulfide-bonded hormone oligomers (granule storage forms) and/or thiol-sensitive granule membrane proteins. © 1982 by The Endocrine Society.",,"cystamine; dithiothreitol; drug derivative; glutathione; glutathione disulfide; growth hormone; mercaptoethanol; prolactin; protein; thiol derivative; adenohypophysis; animal; article; cattle; cell granule; kinetics; metabolism; pH; thermodynamics; Animal; Cattle; Cystamine; Cytoplasmic Granules; Dithiothreitol; Glutathione; Glutathione Disulfide; Growth Hormone; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Mercaptoethanol; Pituitary Gland, Anterior; Prolactin; Proteins; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020121105

When the collected charge distribution is Gaussian, the error rate is well approximated by a complementary error function of the critical charge, which can explain the voltage dependence of the soft error rate; the dispersion of the distribution is also obtained experimentally. The dispersion depends on the thickness of the polyimide film coated on a chip, and the coating improves the error rate by absorbing alpha particles as well as attenuating their energies.

The storage and loss moduli and the gel times of the resin with various concentrations of initiator (methyl ethyl ketone peroxide) were determined at several temperatures. The activation energy for the curing process studied was about 40 kJ/mol. Temperature effects on films partially cured below the ultimate glassy transition temperature (Tg) were studied similarly using the tensile mode on the Rheovibron from room temperature to 120°C. Two modulus peaks were observed upon heating and these were independent of precure conditions. The lower temperature peak was the result of continued curing and the higher temperature peak was attributed to the glassy relaxation of the cured product.

Air-dried cells observed in the STEM mode of the SEM show numerous polyphosphate bodies in the cells. By using this system as a probe to analyse cell sectors it was determined that the heavy metals Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn are all taken up and sequestered in the cell sectors with polyphosphate bodies. Smaller amounts of the metals Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn are also concentrated in the cell sectors without polyphosphate bodies. Control polyphosphate bodies cell sectors generate high P and K signals and a low Mg signal. Sometimes a Ca peak is also generated. In Cd-exposed cells the K and Mg signal is lost from the polyphosphate body cell sectors. In Cu-treated cells the Mg and K peaks are lost from the polyphosphate body cell sectors. In Pb-treated cells the K signal is reduced from both the bodies and the cell sectors without bodies. In Hg-treated cells the K signal is lost and the Ca signal is enhanced. The other metals did not significantly affect the elemental peaks generated in the polyphosphate body cell sectors or the cell sectors without polyphosphate bodies. The sequestering of heavy metals in the polyphosphate bodies is suggested as serving a dual purpose in cells by providing a storage site for essential metals and acting as a detoxification mechanism. © 1982.",,"HEAVY METALS; X-RAY ANALYSIS; WATER POLLUTION; heavy metal; polyphosphate; alga; in vitro study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020097167

Isothermal torsional braid analysis showed the apparent activation energy to be approximately 42 kJ/mol. The reaction kinetics were also considered from the unreacted freshly mixed condition and a partially reacted “B‐staged” condition using infrared spectroscopy, The B‐staged condition is unreactive and stable at room temperature due to the quenching of the primary amine reaction by the glassy structure and the steric hindrance of the secondary amine reaction. Apparent activation energies for these two conditions were found to be 49.4 kJ/mol and 49.0 kJ/mol respectively. The storage life at room temperature of the B‐staged resin system is predicted to be at least three months based on extrapolation of the experimental kinetic data.

The heat storage capacity of the system is considerably diminished by the separation of α-CaCl2.4H2O, forming a new phase. In externally non-mixed systems the separation of the tetrahydrate is practically irreversible and this causes the rapid deterioration of the heat storage system. During the experiments described in this paper the effects of the change in composition of the CaCl2, 6H2O heat storage material, of the impurities (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2) and of thermoconvective flow on the formation of α-CaCl2.4H2O were investigated in externally non-mixed systems. It has been established that with a heat storage packing of more dilute (CaCl2.6·3H2O) total composition than the peritectic composition, favourable storage properties can be attained. To achieve this, the solid impurities have to be removed from the molten phase and the electric cable providing the heat input must be arranged to provide for adequate concentration equalisation by the convective thermal flow. © 1982.",,"SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020089734

The two styles consisted of a hop approach where the payer lands simultaneously on both feet prior to take-off, and a step-close (SC) approach where one foot is placed in its take-off position followed by the trailing foot being placed adjacent to it before take-off. A total of 15 variables from the curves for each style were compared using analysis of variance techniques. The hop jump was characterized as having a higher velocity at the end of the approach resulting in a faster and larger absorption impulse. This produced a faster positive impulse with a higher average force, peak force, and acceleration which is consistent with a greater storage and utilization of elastic energy of the muscles. No significant differences were found in the time and average force for the final unweighting phase of the impulse, and no differences were noted in take-off velocities. Thus, the hop jump resulted in decreasing the time of the impulse by increasing the average and peak forces during the impulse with no apparent effect on jump height.© 1982 The American College of Sports Medicine.","Approach velocity; Elastic energy; Ground reaction force; Take-off velocity; Vertical impulse","human cell; jumping; kinetics; major clinical study; methodology; normal human; short survey; volleyball; Biomechanics; Comparative Study; Female; Human; Kinetics; Male; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020082791

The subjects wore regulation cross-country ski uniforms. An additional vest was worn on 2 d, 1 d with the wind and 1 d without the wind.

The myalgia of viral prodromes, the muscular cramps of hyponatremia and the weakness of potassium deficiency are well known examples. Although investigation of the myopathic components of these illnesses is fragmentary, those that have been examined show abnormalities compatible with subtle alterations of ion transport and, when sought out, histologic changes of muscle fiber injury or necrosis. Certain electrolyte and divalent ion deficiencies are likely to cause such findings, especially those related to potassium and phosphorus. The precise mechanism by which cellular injury occurs in electrolyte derangements has not been clearly elucidated. However, in potassium deficiency, for example, at least three potentially harmful effects occur: (1) abnormally low muscle blood flow with exercise; (2) suppression of glycogen synthesis and storage in muscle; (3) deranged ion transport. In consonance with these observations, it can be shown that once a muscle cell is injured, even when the injury is subclinical, superimposition of any stress that demands substantial expenditure of energy so as to deplete muscle energy stores can apparently precipitate frank rhabdomyolysis. The combined influence of exericise and fasting is a prime example. New information based upon observations in patients and limited experimental studies in animals suggests that skeletal muscle cells, under conditions of certain specific electrolyte derangement, show a common pattern of changes characterized by abnormal electrogenesis (abnormal resting transmembrane potential difference) and elevation of intracellular Na concentration. Such changes could well set the stage for irreversible cellular injury by another important mechanism. Thus, depression of the normally high concentration ratio of sodium ions between extracellular and intracellular fluids or depression of membrane potential could impair the normal exchange of extracellular sodium for intracellular calcium ions. Impressive evidence suggests that if calcium ions thereby attain a critical elevated value in the sarcoplasm, autodestructive proteases are activated that can destroy the cell. The field of interest concerning electrolyte and divalent ion disorders and their implication in rhabdomyolysis is newly emerging. In this paper, the current information on these disorders is reviewed. With license, considerable speculation will be inserted on those disorders not yet adequately examined. © 1982.",,"carbenoxolone; diuretic agent; glycyrrhiza; methamphetamine; adverse drug reaction; blood and hemopoietic system; caloric restriction; electrolyte balance; exercise; glycogen muscle level; hypokalemia; hyponatremia; insulin release; muscle; muscle blood flow; muscle cramp; muscle disease; myalgia; neuromuscular disease; rhabdomyolysis; thyroid gland; Animal; Biological Transport, Active; Calcium Metabolism Disorders; Glycogen; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypernatremia; Hypokalemia; Hyponatremia; Magnesium; Membrane Potentials; Muscles; Myoglobinuria; Neuromuscular Diseases; Phosphorus Metabolism Disorders; Potassium Deficiency; Water-Electrolyte Imbalance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020072978

Thus, inherited red cell enzyme deficiencies of the glycolytic pathway often result in chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA). The hexosemonophosphate (HMP) shunt is normally relatively inactive and enzyme deficiencies, such as G-6-PD deficiency, usually result in episodic hemolysis secondary to oxidative stress. Deficiency of G-6-PD is the most common red cell enzymopathy. Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency of the glycolytic pathway, followed in frequency by glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency. Other glycolytic enzyme deficiencies are rare. Red cell phosphofructokinase deficiency can be associated with muscle weakness; triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and phosphoglycerate kinase deficiencies with neurologic abnormalities. Since its original description, pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase deficiency has been recognized with greater frequency as a cause of CNSHA. Enolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactic dehydrogenase deficiencies are not associated with hemolysis. The newborn with CNSHA can develop anemia and significant jaundice in the first 24 hrs of life. Precise diagnosis may be difficult owing to the volume of blood required and the laboratory facilities available. Screening tests for G-6-PD, GPI, TPI, and PK deficiencies and the red cell concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate can all be done with small amounts of blood obtained with a heel puncture. Data obtained for red cell glycolytic intermediates and quantitative enzyme assays must be compared to normal values for neonates since red cells at birth and during the first two months of life have unique metabolic characteristics.",,"2,3 diphosphoglyceric acid; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glucose 6 phosphate isomerase; pyrimidine 5' nucleotide nucleosidase; pyruvate kinase; blood and hemopoietic system; enzyme deficiency; erythrocyte metabolism; hereditary hemolytic anemia; human cell; newborn; review; 5'-Nucleotidase; Adenylate Kinase; Anemia, Hemolytic; Bisphosphoglycerate Mutase; Erythrocytes; Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase; Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Glutathione Peroxidase; Glutathione Reductase; Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII; Hexokinase; Human; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Nucleotidases; Phosphofructokinase-1; Phosphoglycerate Kinase; Pyruvate Kinase; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Triose-Phosphate Isomerase",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020066108

The study projects future hydrogen markets during the period 1980-2025 in the investigated sectors, estimates the probable range of hydrogen production costs for various manufacturing methods, and evaluates the expected market shares in competition with alternative energy carriers. A general scenario for the economic and industrial development in Sweden during the period was evaluated. The average increase in gross national product was assumed to become 1.6% per year and equal over all society sectors except for residential housing construction and the total energy supply, which are assumed to increase with 0.81 and 0.90% per year, respectively. Three different energy scenarios based on the economic scenario were developed with the following characteristics: an alternative based on nuclear energy; an alternative based on renewable indigenous energy sources; and an alternative based on the present energy picture with free access to imported natural or synthetic fuels. Within each of the three scenarios, an analysis was made of the competitiveness of hydrogen on both the demand and the supply sides of the agreed sectors: chemical industry; steel industry; peak power production; residential and commercial heating; and transportation. Costs were calculated for the production, storage and transmission of hydrogen according to technically feasible methods and were compared to those of alternative energy carriers. Health, environmental and societal implications were also taken into consideration.

In particular, one can avoid the cost and performance penalties associated with storage of solar heat, if the backup can operate at variable heating rate. Hence, these applications are particularly relevant for the near future when solar equipment is still relatively expensive and one is looking for solar applications with the lowest possible cost. This paper develops a method for designing and optimizing installations of this type, including a quick procedure for selecting the most cost effective collector and calculation of pumping energy. The economic optimum is shown to imply a slightly oversized collector field with dumping of excess energy during peak insolation. Using recently developed correlations for the annual energy collectible by the principal collector types, we state all results as explicit algebraic equations which are readily evaluated with a hand calculator.

Since drag torque on the flywheel represents an undesirable energy drain during storage, windage can be eliminated by operation in a vacuum, leaving bearing drag as a significant item. Using a vertical shaft configuration, a passive repulsion-type permanent-magnet thrust bearing is virtually frictionless while small, low-loss, oil-lubricated pintle bearings maintain the shaft radially. This paper discusses the analytical design of the passive magnetic-thrust bearing, including its nonrotating damper.

The subgrain size decreases systematically with increasing stress, independent of T, according to the relation d = 190sigma -1, which is in substantial agreement with the work of others on single-crystals and polycrystals of synthetic rock salt. For two-stage creep experiments it is observed that while subgrain size decreases upon increasing the stress, it does not increase upon lowering the stress. Thus the stress deduced for seven naturally deformed, bedded, domal and anticlinal rocksalts, 0.5- 1.1 MPa, reflect maximum stress differences experienced.

The most striking change was in phosphofructokinase (PFK), which decreased an average of 33% (P &lt; 0.005).

Ten platelet concentrates (PC) were stored at each temperature with five in each group having a final volume of 50 ml and 30 ml. The total ATP and ADP content of platelets decreased following storage in all 4 groups of PC, with the decrease being greater in the PC stored at 22°C than those at 4°C. The mean thrombin secretable ATP+ADP content of platelets from PC stored at 22°C and 4°C were 29.7% and 19.7% of the total content, respectively (p &lt;0.001). Thus, cold stored platelets have a higher total content of ATP+ADP but secrete distinctly lesser amounts than 22°C stored platelets. Labeling of the metabolic pool adenylates with 14C-adenine revealed a greater decrease in the adenylate energy charge of the platelets stored at 4°C. The secretion defect demonstrated in cold stored platelets may be related to the inability of these platelets to maintain ATP homeostasis.",,"adenine; blood and hemopoietic system; cryopreservation; human cell; metabolism; methodology; normal human; thrombocyte",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019954744

Glucose oxidation was measured in a group of 6 normal subjects by means of continuous indirect calorimetry during a 100 g oral glucose tolerance test for 3 hr, comparing the control state with experimental inhibition or stimulation of glucose oxidation. Suprabasal oxidation, corresponding to oxidation in response to the load, mainly by insulin-dependent tissue, was obtained by subtracting basal oxidation (essentially by non-insulin dependent tissues) from total oxidation. Suprabasal oxidation of glucose was inhibited by a neutral fat infusion, and stimulated by means of dichloracetate. In the control test, from the 100 g glucose administered, 18 g participated to suprabasal oxidation during the 3 hr of the test. A neutral fat infusion, started 2 hr before the glucose load and lasting throughout the test, decreased suprabasal oxidation to 7.5 g, i.e. to 42% of the control value. With the fat infusion, a larger fraction of the energy consumption was shown to originate from lipid oxidation (37% versus 25% in controls, p < 0.05) at the expense of carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation (44% versus 60% in controls, p < 0.05). However, these major changes in peripheral glucose oxidation were accompanied by only a moderate decrease in glucose tolerance. Dichloracetate administered prior to the test increased suprabasal oxidation to 25 g glucose oxidized in the 3 hours following the glucose load, i.e. an increment of 39% above the control value. A larger fraction of energy consumption was derived from carbohydrates (77% versus 60% in controls, p < 0.05). However, no significant change was observed in glucose tolerance. These results indicate that marked changes of peripheral glucose oxidation have little influence on glucose tolerance and suggest that another mechanism, i.e. glucose storage, plays a larger role in regulating plasma glucose levels during oral glucose tolerance tests. © 1982.",,"endocrine system; glucose oxidation; glucose tolerance test; normal human; Adult; Blood Glucose; Calorimetry; Dichloroacetate; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test; Glycolysis; Humans; Kinetics; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019945421

As it is well known, the Trombe wall collector is a self convective flow solar air heating collector with thermal energy stored in the mass of the wall. One of the major problems of this system is the excessive heat losses from the wall, which is insulated from outside with only a double window. The objective of this study was to investigate the possibilities of reducing these excessive heat losses by separating the heat collector panel from the heat storage mass. Thus, a collector panel with a minimum thermal inertia is used to collect the solar energy which is transferred to the inside of the house for storage. During the night time operation, the well insulated collector panel with no thermal inertia serves as a thermal buffer, to reduce the heat losses from the house. An analytical study has been carried out and the results have been verified with the experimantal studies obtained at the Solab, the Solar Research House of Ecole Polytechnique. © 1982.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION; VENTILATION; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019938903

About 10,000 barrels per day, roughly 10 per cent of domestic consumption is produced indigenously, the rest being imported mainly in the form of crude oil, diesel fuel and kerosene. Although the volume of imports has increased at a rate of only 5.2 per cent per annum, as a result of price increases Pakistan's import bill has gone from $611 million in 1978–1979 to $1.58 billion in 1980–1981. The Fifth Five‐Year Plan (1978–1983) enumerated policy strategies for power and fuel. Regarding power, maximum priority was given to hydroelectric generation conserving fuel through use of extra‐high voltage transmission lines, reduction of system losses, expansion of village electrification, and putting power corporations on a sound financial basis. As regards fuel, the plan stresses exploration for new oil and gas fields, accelerated development of proven fields, expansion of gas consumption for industrial use, strengthening of transport and storage of oil and research and development on non‐conventional sources of energy. $3.39 billion was allocated to the energy sector. This represents 22.6 per cent of public sector funding. The National Energy Policy Committee regulary reviews the energy situation in the country with a view to effecting proper development and utilization of energy resources.

Environ 10.000 barils par jour, soit approximativement 10 pour‐cent de la consommation domestique, sont produits localement, le reste étant importé sous forme de brut, de fuel diesel ou de kérosène. Bien que le volume des importations ait augmenté seulement au taux annuel de 5.2 pour‐cent à cause de la hausse des prix, la facture énergétique du Pakistan est passée de 611 millions de dollars des E.‐U en 1978–79 à 1,58 milliards en 1980–81. Le cinquième Plan quinquennal (1978–83) énumère des stratégies à suivre en matière de politique pour l'énergie électrique et les combustibles. En ce qui concerne l'électricité, priorité absolue a été accordée à la production hydroélectrique grâce à l'utilisation du fuel par l'emploi de lignes à très haute tension, la réduction des pertes dans le système, le développement de l'électrificatron rurale et l'assainissement des finances des compagnies d'électricité. En ce qui concerne les carburants, le Plan met l'accent sur la recherche de nouveaux gisements de gaz et de pétrole, la mise en valeur accelérée des champs déjà découverts, l'augmentation de la consommation du gaz à usage industriel, le renforcement des secteurs de transports et de stokage du du brut ainsi que celui de la recherche et du développement des sources d'énergie non classiques. 3,39 milliards de dollars des E.‐U. ont été alloués au secteur énergétique, ce qui représente 22,6 pour‐cent du financement du secteur publique. El consumo per capita de energía comercial y electricidad en Pakistán en 1978 fue 0.2 toneladas equivalentes de carbón y 180 kWh respectivamente, esto es, eproximadamente la mitad del promedio de los países en desarrollo, 10 por ciento del promedio mundial y cerca del 1.7 por ciento del consumo de los Estados Unidos. Cerca de 10,000 barriles diarios (aproximadamente 10 por ciento del consumo nacional) son producidos en el país, y el resto se importa en forma de petróleo crudo, diesel y kerosene principalmente. Aunque el volumen de importaciones a crecido solamente al 5.2 por ciento al año, debido al aumento de precios el valor de importación ha subido de $611 millones en 1978–1979 a $1,580 millones en 1980–1981. El Quinto Plan Quinquenal (1978–1983) enumera estrategias de política de desarrollo de electricidad y combustibles. Con relación al primero, se da máxima prioridad a la hidroelectricidad y conservación de combustibles a través del uso de la transmisión a alto voltaje, reducción de pérdidas en las redes, expansión de la electrificación de poblados y saneamiento financiero de la corporación de electricidad. Con respeto a los combustibles, el plan insiste en la acelerada exploración y desarrollo de petróleo y electricidad, expansión del uso del gas para uso industrial, reforzamiento del sistema de transporte y almacenaje de petróleo, e investigación y desarrollo de recursos no convencionales de energía.

This model is used with the Monte Carlo simulation method to evaluate the reliability of the mixed generating system. Different percentages of wind and solar generation capacities were tried as well as the tilt of the solar arrays. On the basis of the simulation performed, the optimum share of wind power in the system is discussed looking at the corresponsing probabilities of loss of load. In an existing generating system with a strong penetration of hydro power providing a significant storage capacity, like the Portuguese system, the introduction of wind and solar power appears attractive from the reliability point of view. The small reserve margins required also decrease the high investment associated with the conversion of these two sources of energy. (A)",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019929738

Solar energy is converted by photovoltaic arrays to electricity which is then used for the electrolysis of water. The hydrogen produced is stored in the form of hydride and can be used either for direct burning, to meet the thermal energy requirements, or in a fuel cell to supply the electric energy needed. Particular emphasis was given to designing a control system that could guarantee a smooth intermittent operation of the electrolytic unit and the utilization of the maximum output of the photovoltaic cells. The system selected can operate with minimum attendance and very little maintenance. However, the cost of the electricity produced is at present prohibitive, being as high as $3.30 k Wh-1. © 1982.",,"WATER - Electrolysis; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019928110

The energy requirement for the loading of liquid hydrogen in a cryogenic storage tank is substantially higher than the amount needed to charge a corresponding hydride vehicle tank. However, the hydride tank must provide a considerable part of its hydrogen fuel energy content in order to meet the energy requirements due to its own weight. This amount increases rapidly with increasing design range. Considering the total primary energy flow for both cases, it turns out that a clear break-even point exists. For design ranges higher than about 200 km the liquid hydrogen storage requires less energy expense than the hydride storage tank, the difference being very substantial (more than 100%) in the usual 400-500 km range. Similar results are found in the costs of the on-board storage of hydrogen for different design ranges. A comparison of these results with the storage costs studied earlier for large-scale stationary hydrogen storage facilities indicates that, from the specific capacity point of view, the break-even conditions are very similar in both cases, although due to different reasons. © 1982.",,"FUELS - Storage; AUTOMOTIVE FUELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019926651

After storage for a suitable period, heat is normally retrieved by some form of artificial plumbing which may involve energy input (pumping) but which is commonly so costly as to cast doubts on the economic effectiveness of the system. This paper describes simple physical model experiments which demonstrate that low-grade heat derived from hot water can be stored for significant periods in unsaturated permeable material at shallow depths and subsequently utilised without artificial plumbing. The experiments enabled the behaviour of heat plumes in unsaturated repacked chalk (chosen for its favourable thermal characteristics) to be studied; results confirmed that conduction is the principal mechanism of heat movement although under the particular constraints of the model convection in the vapour phase may have played a minor part. © 1982.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019923603

The vehicle system is modelled on the analog computer whereas the optimization algorithm and overall control is performed in the digital section. The ’on-line’ features and the high computing speed of the analog model proves very advantageous in both the preliminary design and the system optimization process. The drive system consists ofa small IC-engine, a hydrostatic transmission and a hydraulic accumulator energy storage. The hydraulic accumulator assists the engine during acceleration and allows for regenerative braking which results in a high overall efficiency in urban driving, where frequent stops occur. In the first stage of the design, the feasibility of the drive concept was evaluated. Thus preliminary designed system is repeatedly ’driven’ through a short driving cycle under the control of the digital computer. A direct search optimization routine known as complex method evaluates the drive performance andreadjusts four drive controller parameters. The objective of the optimization is to minimize the fuelconsumption without any loss of drive dynamics.

Electron-transfer reactions involving the chlorophyll triplet state and donor and acceptor species have been investigated by both steady-state and transient techniques, and understanding of detailed mechanisms is beginning to emerge. Under appropriate conditions it has been possible to achieve high degrees of conversion of excited states into energy-rich products (∼60 per cent), and energy-wasting recombinations have been considerably retarded. Most recently, mechanistic studies of vectorial electron transfer across a lipid bilayer from donor to acceptor via the chlorophyll triplet state have begun, which promise to provide a new level of insight into the factors which control energy storage efficiency in these systems. © 1982.",,"SOLAR RADIATION; ENERGY CONVERSION; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019901985

Chief among these is its intermittent or diurnal nature, which presents differing considerations and challenges for use in conjunction with gas and electric utilities. Gas utilities provide for a winter peaking by producing year-round and storing natural gas in large underground formations, principally aquifers. Electric utilities produce on demand and rely on reserve capacity to meet summer peaks. The gas production-pipeline-storage-distribution system is chemical in nature and relatively tolerant to addition of gas of varying composition and nature. Electric systems are dynamic in nature and relatively intolerant ot the introduction of off-specification energy forms, and thus require elaborate interface protection. The storability of natural gas complements the noncontinuous aspect of solar energy and makes gas-augmented solar systems attractive. These systems can, and in many cases must, be located near the end-use site. Dispersed solar systems are attractive for electrical energy production and consumption at remote locations, for example, for irrigation water pumping. Solar electric systems that are grid connected must be of sufficient magnitude to justify the interface costs with the national grid. Solar-gas systems are preferable for space and water conditioning for homes and institutional buildings. Solar-electric systems can be either dispersed or grid connected, but the scale of technology required is considerably different in these two applications. © 1982.",,"ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Interconnection; GAS INDUSTRY - Energy Storage; HEATING - Solar; WATER HEATERS - Solar; GAS UTILITIES; SOLAR ENERGY/UTILITY INTERFACE; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019898298

All investment, fuel, and operating costs are accounted for. Hot water systems and combined heating and hot water systems are analyzed separately. It is found that the marginal cost for solar backup is no more than the marginal cost of electricity used for purely electric heating and hot water devices and also no more than the incremental cost of normal load growth. For the three utilities studied, there appears to be little basis for rate distinctions between solar devices using electric backup and electric-only heating and hot water devices.

Compared with average cost pricing, marginal cost pricing offers benefits to customers using solar and electric heat and hot water, especially if a separate lower rate is adopted for off-peak storage devices; these benefits can amount to several hundred dollars a year.

Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic) reveals that under a large area of the Negev an aquiferous section 1000 m to 1500 m thick is saturated with brackish water. Data derived from oil and water wells enabled the mapping of the distribution of the various water groups, which in turn made it possible to map the chemical composition of the water in the different regions. Thus, southeast of the line running from Masada on the Dead Sea to Ayun Musa on the Suez Gulf, water of approximately 5 g/l TDS can be found in the Judean (Cenomanian) and Kurnuk (Lower Cretaceous) Groups and of about 10 g/l TDS in the Arad Group (Jurassic). The potential quantities of water, from the point of view of storage, are in the order of magnitude of hundreds of billions of cubic meters. Annual pumping amounts, however, are a function of management policy. According to recent research, the annual pumping potential for the next thirty years from the Kurnub Group (Lower Cretaceous) is about 60 to 100 million cubic meters, with an allowance of 20-100 meters for the reduction of head. The Judea Group (Cenomanian Turonian) and Arad Group (Jurassic) can be reached in the northern Negev and still another potential Paleozoic aquifer (with water of about 12 g/l TDS) is available in the southern Arava. Quantitative pumping potential figures are not yet available for these aquifers. However, a very rough estimate suggests that the potential may amount to several tens of millions of cubic meters over the next fifty years. In addition to the direct use of this water for agriculture and industry (Arava farms, Phosphate and Dead Sea Works), as well as desalination by the RO method, it is suggested that the possibility of using this water for solar energy desalination be investigated on a regional scale. The cost of desalination may be reduced if one takes water whose salinity is a little above the threshhold of direct application for agricultural use and mixes it with the distilled water supplied by the solar distiller. The chances of achieving even lower costs for distilled water are promising as the water pumped has an average temperature of 40°C. Thus, the efficiency of the solar still may be greater, and may even enable night distillation to take place. The application of solar distillation thus appears promising in the Arava, where the special climatic conditions give a marginal benefit value of $1.00 per cubic meter of water for winter for winter vegetables. Along the dead Sea coast, this looks even better. © 1982.",,"HYDROLOGY - Israel; SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; WATER RESOURCES - Israel; SOLAR DESALINATIN PLANTS; DESALINATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018912139

However, at higher excitation levels, evidence has been reported that a portion of the absorbed energy is trapped near the excitation region, creating a ""hot spot."" Thin-film bolometers on the opposite crystal face have been used to detect phonons emitted from the excitation region. Unfortunately, a subset of the phonons that strike the detector has been scattered in flight so the usual heat-pulse signals are not a reliable measure of the local dynamics of the excitation region. To remedy this, we have developed a technique for investigating both the time and spatial dependence of a laser-induced heat pulse. The method uses the phonon-focusing effect to discriminate between phonons that propagate directly from the excitation region to the detector and those that are scattered in the bulk of the sample. Prior studies of heat pulses following pulsed laser excitation of Ge and Si revealed, at high powers, a long-lived (∼10-μs) flux of phonons following the sharp ballistic pulse. Our spatial filtering technique shows that a major portion of this delayed flux in Ge is spatially very diffusive, but a short-lived component of the delayed flux emanates directly from the excitation region. We conclude that in Ge at 1.8 K, a 0.1-μs laser pulse produces a local storage of energy decaying with a time constant ∼0.1 to 1.5 μs, depending on the excitation level. This local energy storage also appears in metal-coated Ge, heavily-doped Ge, and metal-coated GaAs and LiF, indicating that the observed energy storage is not electronic. A simple scattering model that uses local melting as a temperature calibration explains the data in terms of a localized heat-storage effect. © 1982 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005928257

Consumed energy is partitioned into growth, energy storage, and gonads according to temporal prey availability, metabolic demands, and reproductive needs. Throughout minimum-feeding periods in the winter and early spring, largemouth bass utilize energy from visceral fat and body protein for standard metabolic demands and gonad development. Catabolism of energy from body tissue during the winter was less than 33% of standard metabolic demands, indicating that some con sumption had to occur during the winter. The calculated activity metabolism of largemouth bass ranged from 18 to 144% of standard metabolism depending on time of year and sex. Parallel trends of activity metabolism and consumption over the year suggest that foraging costs may constitute a large fraction of activity metabolism. To maintain condition in a system where their primary prey undergoes large fluctuations in seasonal abundance, largemouth bass maximize caloric growth in the fall, store visceral fat, minimize standard and active metabolic demands, and undertake some winter feeding in warm thermal areas. © 1982 by the American Fisheries Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000950277

Our technique is based on an SCF treatment of the first-order density matrix, R. It is applicable within the Hartree-Fock, strongly orthogonal valence-bond, and density functional models. Primary corrections to R, which occur in the vicinity of the bond(s) between the fragments, are calculated exactly; secondary delocalization effects are determined approximately. The approximations result in a substantial saving of computer time and storage requirements. Initial tests with INDO and the unrestricted Hartree-Fock model show small errors for conformational energy differences and the total density matrix. The computation time increases quadratically with the size of the molecule rather than as the third power which is the case for a conventional INDO calculation and for the related PCILO method. Unlike PCILO, however, our procedure is not inextricably bound to the zero differential overlap approximation. It can be used to substantially improve the efficiency of existing SCF treatments of large molecules and to increase their applicability as well. © 1982 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000431660

The heat pump is specifically designed for use in a tropical climate where the normal daytime ambient of above 25°C permits the evaporator to be operated at a high temperature (15-50°C depending on solar input). The use of Freon 11 permits conventional reciprocating refrigeration compressors to be used at elevated temperatures without exceeding design pressure limits. A single unit acts as the evaporator and solar collector. When solar insolation is low the evaporator pressure automatically drops so that energy is received from the atomsphere. However the C.O.P. and output are so low in this mode that the system cannot correctly be termed dual source. The water cooled condenser operates in the temperature range of 35-90°C, the heated water representing the useful output of the system. Operation in the air conditioning mode is not possible due to the large specific volume of Freon 11 at low temperatures. A theoretical analysis is presented to describe the system operation, and the experimental results are shown to agree well with the computer simulation.
