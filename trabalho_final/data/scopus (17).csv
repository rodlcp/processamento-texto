Five types of tapes were analyzed including three polyethylene terephthalate (PET) tapes with metal particulate, barium ferrite particulate, and metal-evaporated coatings. A polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) tape with a barium ferrite particulate coating was also analyzed along with an aromatic polyamide (ARAMID) tape with a metal-evaporated coating. From the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), the storage (or elastic) modulus, E′, was obtained as a function of temperature and frequency along with the loss tangent, tan δ, which is a measurement of viscous energy dissipation. Frequency-temperature superposition was used to predict the dynamic mechanical behavior of the tapes and substrates over a 10-12 decade frequency range. Results show that the advanced PEN and ARAMID tapes tend to have higher storage moduli than the PET tapes, and the PET tapes are more susceptible to non-recoverable deformation at higher frequencies due to their higher loss tangents. Also, storage moduli for the tapes are typically higher than those for the substrates, due to the role that the particulate or metal-evaporated coatings play in increasing the overall modulus of the tapes. Tapes with particulate coatings have somewhat higher loss tangents than their constitutive substrates, whereas ultra-thin metal-evaporated coatings contribute little to the loss tangent behavior of a tape. The DMA data is used in a model to predict the resistance of a tape to transverse curvature when tension is applied. Transverse curvature of a magnetic tape is related to higher edge wear of a head. To facilitate the prediction of edge wear and enable the design of better magnetic tapes, a technique is presented which can be used to predict transverse curvature from the elastic moduli, substrate orthotropy ratios, and thicknesses of the substrates and coatings.","Composite; DMA; Modulus; Polymer; Tribology; Viscoelasticity","Bending (deformation); Coatings; Elastic moduli; Frequencies; Mathematical models; Polyethylene terephthalates; Polymers; Substrates; Temperature; Tribology; Viscoelasticity; Wear of materials; Aromatic polyamides; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Frequency temperature superposition; Orthotropy; Polyethylene naphthalate; Storage moduli; Transverse curvature; Magnetic tape; magnetic tapes; wear",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030430256

Under field conditions the heart rate was monitored continuously, and body mass, body composition, thickness of the shell tissues, and blood parameters were measured at (T1), after 72 h (T2), after 120 h (T3) and in the recovery period after 48 h (T4) and 72 h (T5). The estimated energy expenditure was approximately 24,000 kJ·day-1. The mean decrease of body mass was 6.77 kg (9.5%) at T3 (p &lt; 0.001), 0.95 kg (1.3%) at T4 (p &lt; 0.05) and 0.68 kg (0.9%) at T5 (n.s.). A reduction of total body water of 3.8l was estimated at T3. Serum creatinine ([Cr]) was raised at T3 by 18.5% (p &lt; 0.0001). No relationship was found between [Cr] and other parameters. The PV decreased by 3.7% (p &lt; 0.0001) at T2, increased by 1.6% (p &lt; 0.0001) at T3 and was not different to baseline at T4 (+0.2%; n.s.). Total protein concentration ([TP]) increased at T2 (11.7%; p &lt; 0.0001) and T3 (2.6%; p &lt; 0.01), and decreased (p &lt; 0.0001) at T4 (8.2%) and T5 (5.7%). Plasma proteins shifted into the intravascular space at T2 and T3 and moved out of the intravascular space at T4 and T5. This gives support to the hypothesis that one of the counterregulatory mechanisms maintaining PV during prolonged exercise is provided by protein shifts from the extravascular into the intravascular space. Our data provide evidence that this mechanism assists PV homeostasis efficiently over a period of 120 h with multifactorial strain, even under conditions with a fluid loss of almost 8% of the total body water.","dehydration; fasting; fluid regulation; physical strain; plasma proteins","plasma protein; adult; article; body composition; body mass; creatinine blood level; dehydration; fluid intake; food deprivation; food intake; heart rate; human; male; physical activity; protein blood level; training; water deprivation; Adult; Austria; Blood Proteins; Blood Volume; Creatinine; Exertion; Extracellular Space; Food Deprivation; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Military Personnel; Physical Fitness; Sleep Deprivation; Water Deprivation; Water-Electrolyte Balance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030450757

Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7090, United States","The critical injury causing graft failure after prolonged liver storage involves reperfusion-induced killing of sinusoidal endothelial cells and activation of Kupffer cells. Treatment of stored livers with Carolina rinse solution (CRS) prevents endothelial cell killing, reduces Kupffer cell activation, and improves graft survival. Accordingly, our aim was to evaluate the components of CRS and other agents for protection against reperfusion injury to rat livers stored 24 hr in University of Wisconsin solution. CHS virtually abolished endothelial cell killing, prevented denudation of the sinusoidal lining, and decreased structural changes in Kupffer cells indicative of activation. The only component of CRS preventing endothelial cell killing was acidic pH of 6.5. However, when pH was subsequently increased to 7.4, antioxldants (allopurinol, deferoxamine mesylate, and glutathione), vasodilators (adenosine and nicardipine), and possibly energy substrates (fructose, glucose, and insulin) partially blocked pH-dependent cell killing (pH paradox). Na+/H+ exchange inhibition, protease inhibition, and Ca2+-free buffer did not decrease reperfusion injury, but the amino acid glycine protected strongly. Strychnine, which binds to glycine receptors in the central nervous system, protected equally well. Protection by glycine and CRS was synergistic, virtually eliminating cell killing after 48 hr of storage. Unlike CRS and some of its components (adenosine and Ca2+ channel blocker), glycine did not block tumor necrosis factor-α release by cultured rat Kupffer cells, although gabexate mesylate, a protease inhibitor, strongly blocked tumor necrosis factor-α release. In conclusion, the combination of CRS and glycine enhanced protection against reperfusion injury to stored livers and may prove beneficial in improving graft function and survival after liver transplantation.",,"adenosine; allopurinol; antioxidant; calcium channel blocking agent; carolina rinse solution; deferoxamine mesylate; fructose; gabexate mesilate; glucose; glutathione; glycine; insulin; nicardipine; proteinase inhibitor; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell culture; endothelium cell; graft failure; kupffer cell; liver protection; liver transplantation; male; nonhuman; ph measurement; priority journal; rat; reperfusion injury; tissue preservation; Animals; Cell Death; Cells, Cultured; Endothelium; Glycine; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kupffer Cells; Liver; Liver Transplantation; Male; Protease Inhibitors; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reperfusion Injury; Sodium-Hydrogen Antiporter; Solutions; Tissue Preservation; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030480464

The resulting strong autoadhesion forces are reversible by subsequently storing the autoadhesion samples at. low humidity environment. The strength of the capillary forces depends on the storage time, and to reach an equilibrium level requires more than 72 h. For the less polar salmeterol xinafoate the performance of capillary forces could not be proved with certainty, It appears that a very small increase in autoadhesion force at higher relative humidity levels is more likely caused by adsorbed water acting as a plasticizer. Model calculations of capillary forces did not prove successful in predicting the autoadhesion force of the materials if stored at a high relative humidity of the air. The knowledge of the surface free energy and its polar component gave a better basis for a prediction.","Autoadhesion; Capillary forces; Lactose monohydrate; Powder particles; Press-on force; Relative humidity; Salmeterol xinafoate; Surface free energy","lactose; salmeterol xinafoate; article; humidity; particle size; physics; powder; priority journal; storage; theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030573065

As part of the program to assure that the DSTs maintain their structural integrity, an inspection plan is being developed and implemented. This paper describes the technical bases for acceptance criteria for flaw indications detected during ultrasonic inspection of inner liners of the DSTs. The types of indications addressed arc crack-like flaws, wall thinning, and pitting. In establishing acceptable flaw sizes, the evaluations have taken into consideration the potential for crack growth by the mechanism of stress corrosion cracking. Critical flaw sizes have been based on elastic-plastic fracture mechanics with calculations being performed using the approach of the failure assessment diagram. In developing flaw acceptance criteria consideration was given to technical approaches used in ASME Codes, for reactor tanks at the Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River facilities, and in recommendations by the DOE Tank Structural Integrity Panel The goal was to ensure that indications discovered during inspections are not large enough to ever cause a leak or rupture of the tank inner liner. The acceptance criteria were intended to be simple to apply using a set of tables giving acceptable flaw sizes. These tables are sufficiently conservative to be appicable to an double-shell tanks. In those cases that a flaw exceeds the size permitted by the tables, it is proposed that additional criteria permit more detailed and less conservative evaluations to address specific conditions of stress levels, operating temperature, flaw location, and material properties.",,"Crack propagation; Failure analysis; Fracture mechanics; Linings; Pitting; Radioactive waste storage; Standards; Stress corrosion cracking; Tanks (containers); Ultrasonic applications; Acceptance criteria; Crack like flaws; Double shell tanks; Ultrasonic inspection; Wall thinning; Inspection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8644278153

(figure 1) Fabricated from a alkali doped, reduced lead silicate glass, microchannel plates are known as excellent high gain , low noise, two dimensional detectors of charged particles and electromagnetic radiation. The microchannel plate manufacturing process begins with a series ofglass fiber draws in which an acid soluble core glass (figure 2) is combined with an alkali soluble clad tube and drawn to form a mono fiber. Mono fibers (typically 2,000 to 4,000) are then assembled into a hexagonal preform called a multi wrap. The preform is again drawn to form a multifiber producing an overall feature size reduction of typically 2000: 1. The multi fibers then become the basic building blocks. Hundreds ofmulti fibers are next arranged to form the active area ofthe MCP. High temperature vacuum fusion is then used to fuse the multi fibers together with the solid glass border (ifused) to form a billet or boule. Standard semiconductor slicing, lapping and polishing techniques are used to prepare the wafers for chemical processing. Chemical processing consists of etching open the microchannels, adjusting the open area ratio (OAR) and preparing the silica rich emissive layer. A hydrogen firing produces is used to reduce the lead glass making it electrically conductive. Finally a thin (typically 2,000 - to 3,000 Angstroms) film ofmetaiization is vacuum deposited on both sides ofthe microchannel plate to electrically connect each of the channels in parallel, therefore ensuring the same potential is applied to each channel. Microchannel plates operate on the principle of secondary electron emission. In operation primary events enter the input side of the MCP and collide with the channel wall.

We prepared x-ray mask blank with 2 μm in thick silicon nitride film as a membrane as shown in Fig. 1. The additive process"" was utilized for x-ray mask fabrication as indicated in Fig. 2. We deposited 10 nm thick chromium layer and 200 nm thick gold layer over the membrane for the effective absorber electroplating. 400 nm thick gold film was electroplated as an absorber after the patterning by electron-beam lithography using resist FMMA. For the XRL process, Alladin storage ring of 800 MeV energy in Wisconsin University in U.S.A. and Karl Suss XRS 200 stepper were utilized. We used SAL 603 negative resist(from Shipley Co.) and AZ-PF positive resist(from Hoechst Co.) of 0.75 μm thickness for the patterning of gate poly-Si and contact hole, respectively. The gap distance between mask and wafer on the stepper was set at 40 μm in automatic mode and the irradiation dose was 200 mJ/cm2 The alignment accuracy, die by die, was better than 150 nm. Figure 3 shows the vernier patterns which indicate the good alignment and XRL patterning results for poly-Si layer of 0.15 μin line and space. SOI p-channel MOSFHTs were fabricated by a conventional CMOS process except two XRL steps for the gate and contact layers on SIMOX SOI substrates. 6.5 nm gate oxide was thermally grown in dry O2, ambient at 900 °C. The final surface silicon thickness was about 0.1 μm, while the thickness of the source/drain region was 0.03 m thinner than that of the channel region. Figure 4(a) shows the TFM photograph of the fabricated SOI p-MOSFRT and figure 4(b) shows the I V characteristics of the device. As shown in the l-V characteristics, the saturation drain current ld.M was about J (K) jjA/fjm and the threshold voltage V1, was about 0.4 V. The breakdown voltage BV, s between the source and drain measured at Va. = 0 V and I4 = 10 nA was larger than 4 V. The lower I, i( was caused mainly due to the high source/drain resistance resulted from the non-silicided thin Si layers.

The system is based on a combination of two components: 1) water sleeves, which function as a passive element for the day-time collection of solar energy that is then used for warming, mainly during the night; and 2) a movable thermal screen, which is spread over the plants at night to reduce heat loss to the surroundings. The solar greenhouse is designed to operate as a closed system most of the winter to enable maximal solar energy storage in the sleeves. This concept was applied to melon production, as a test crop to assess whether high-quality fruit could be obtained during the winter for export to Europe. The experiment was carried out in six identical tunnels, 4 m wide, 11 m long, and 2 m high. Average increase of the water temperature in the sleeves was about 7.5°C on a clear day compared with about 4°C on a cloudy day. On a typical clear night following a sunny day air temperatures in the greenhouse at a height of 0.5 m above the ground were 6-7°C higher than outdoor temperatures, and comparable soil temperatures (at a depth of 20 cm) were 8.5-9°C higher indoors. After a cloudy day this difference in air temperature was reduced to about 5°C.

This section examined small muscle preparations stimulated electrically or skinned muscle fibers maintained in superfused baths with different substance concentrations. The electrical stimulation was either continuous or intermittent for relatively short durations. High frequency fatigue or fatigue during continuous high frequency stimulation seems to be mainly due to impaired propagation of the stimulating impulse in the T-tubular system. Fatigue during intermittent tetanic stimulation is caused by three mechanisms: (a) decreased maximum Ca2+ activated tension, (b) decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile proteins, and (c) decreased Ca2+ release from the SR. The first two mechanisms are probably due to the combined effects of myoplasmic accumulation of Pi and H+ formed when PCr and glycogen are degraded in muscle when the rate of oxidative ATP formation is insufficient. Crossbridge movements are impaired due to the Pi increase and crossbridge formation is decreased when Ca2+ binding sites on troponin are occupied by H+. The third fatigue factor, reduced Ca2+ release from the SR, is related to metabolism and the decrease in MgATP following the depletion of the PCr store. The MgATP decrease may inhibit Ca2+ release from the SR due to the increased free [Mg2+] and the decrease in ATP. A decreased [ATP] could affect action potential propagation, IP3 turnover rate and the activity of the SR Ca2+ pump. A fall in SR Ca2+ pump activity together with increased Ca2+ binding in the myoplasm of fatiguing muscle would decrease the SR Ca2+ availability. During intense contractions Pi and H+ accumulation begins early, resulting in a decrease in maximum Ca2+ activated tension and an increase in the Ca2+ concentration necessary to produce tension. Both phenomena are potentiated when the Ca2+ release from the SR falls during continued stimulation, resulting in nearly complete loss of tension development. Fatigue in Intact Skeletal Muscle of Human Subjects During High Intensity Exercise. High intensity exercise requires skeletal muscles to contract with forces that represent 40-100% of the maximal voluntary contraction force. Fatigue factors in human subjects during high intensity exercise include the accumulation of H+ and Pi, with effects on Ca2+ sensitivity and maximum Ca2+ induced tension, and the availability of PCr and total creatine. The size of the PCr store is directly related to the MgATP/ADP ratio in the myoplasm of exercising muscle, while free creatine may have an impact on the rate of mitochondrial ATP and PCr formation, thereby adding to the regulation of the ratio during exercise. The MgATP/ADP ratio is involved in several processes regulating SR Ca2+ release. Fatigue in Intact Skeletal Muscle of Human Subjects During Submaximal Exercise. Submaximal exercise in human subjects requires skeletal muscles to contract with forces that are below 40% of the maximal voluntary contraction force. Submaximal exercise intensities are expressed as a percentage of the power output required to elicit maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). During exercise at 85-100% VO2 max, anaerobic energy is required to supplement oxidative energy at the onset of exercise and in some muscles that cannot meet the energy demand aerobically. This produces accumulations of Pi and H+ and produces fatigue as described in the high intensity exercise sections. At 100% VO2 max, muscle fatigue will occur in 5-7 min or less, and at 85% VO2 max in ∼30 min. Muscle fatigue during exercise at 60-85% VO2 max may occur following 30 min at 85% VO2 or after several hours at 60% VO2 max. Fatigue is related to the ability to provide adequate amounts of oxidizable fuel to the muscles. Carbohydrate in the form of muscle glycogen is the required substrate and muscle fatigue coincides with glycogen depletion. Diet and exercise manipulations increase the storage of muscle glycogen thereby delaying muscle fatigue. Hypoglycemia can also occur during exercise when liver glycogen stores are depleted, leading to fatigue caused by central nervous system dysfunction. Ingestion of CHO during exercise can delay fatigue either by preventing hypoglycemia or slowing the rate of muscle glycogen use. During exercise below 60% VO2 max, there is greater reliance on fuel sources from outside the muscle (plasma glucose and FFAs). Since exercise can be sustained for 3-5 hours at 50% VO2 max and over eight hours at or below 40% VO2 max, there is a strong possibility that dehydration and/or hypoglycemia will occur. Routine ingestion of meals and liquid feedings rich in CHO throughout exercise prevent these problems from occurring. Muscle injury and soreness will occur when exercise is performed by an individual unaccustomed to exercise or during exercise requiring a large number of eccentric contractions (e.g., downhill running). The affected muscles will be unable to generate normal forces while injured. Prevention of muscle injury through gradual increases in the amount of activity performed is recommended, but antiinflammatory agents decrease the soreness and improve force generation when muscle injury has occurred. © 1996 Elsevier B.V.

For psychological decision-taking reasons, the mission time - defined as the time from decision to incoming results - should not exceed a human lifespan. This tough criterion demands a coasting speed of 0.3 times the speed of light, or 0.3c. The kinetic energy of the 1,000kg coasting probe is then no less than 1,180 billion kWh. The cheapest investment to achieve this appears to be the laser-propelled lightsail, LPL. The LPL has an efficiency of electric energy to laser beam energy of 30% and an efficiency of laser beam energy to kinetic probe energy of 6-7%, so the total efficiency becomes 2% (D. Andrews). Therefore, 59,000 billion kWh of electric energy have to be supplied during a typical acceleration time of 900 hours, for technical reasons. This means in turn that 65,000 GWe of installed electric power capacity has to be available, plus the corresponding laser equipment. In this paper the electricity requirements of two other methods will also be treated: the particle beam propelled magsail, PBPM, and the antimatter propelled rocket, AMP. As to storage of electric energy, it would increase the capital cost of LPL and decrease it for PBPM, which nevertheless remains much costlier than LPL. The huge electric power levels needed during acceleration stresses the importance of the lowest possible capital cost of electricity generation plant or of storage plant. D.R. Criswell and D. Waldron have suggested and studied the concept of a very large photovoltaic electric power plant on the Moon, mainly manufactured there, producing 20,000 GWe intended for transmission to Earth by microwaves. The stated total cost is ̃ 900 USD/kW, but most of this is the rectenna receivers on Earth. The capital cost of the Moon power station alone is between 25 and 65 USD/kW. In comparison, the current capital cost of nuclear power is 2,000 USD/kW. The cost of the Moon power station plus the microwave transmitters is 2,000 BUSD for 20,000 GWe excluding development cost. This would become 6,000 BUSD for 60,000 GWe It is hard to estimate the cost of the lasers and their development - they do not yet exist at that strength. For simplicity let us assume extremely roughly that their cost would be comparable to that given by Criswell-Waldron for the microwave transmission plant. The total cost for the 60,000 GWe power plant plus the laser plant on the Moon would then amount to 6,500 - 7,500 BUSD, including the development cost of the lasers. (The development of the power plant is assumed to have been repaid by the terrestrial power business.) Even if a 20-year period is taken to accumulate this kind of money, the yearly cost of 350 BUSD represents almost 2% the current Gross World Product of 20,000 BUSD. The NASA budget, 14 BUSD per year is only 0.25% of the GNP of the USA, the richest and most science-minded nation in the world today. 0.25% of current GWP, or 50 BUSD per year during say 20 years, would obviously be totally insufficient for a 1-tonne probe. For such a project the GWP would have to be 15 times larger, i.e. 300,000 BUSD, and the world population would have to be willing both to spend 0.25% thereof on space activities and to earmark half of that expenditure for the space probe. Demographers predict that Earth's population will grow by a factor of 2 during the next 60 years. That future population of 12 billion will have to have an extremely optimistic per capita GWP of 25,000 USD (that of rich industrialised nations today) in order for the GWP to reach 300,000 BUSD. In view of continuing miniaturisation and compactisation, the question arises as to whether a much lighter probe at a considerably lower cost could give sufficiently interesting information from a flyby. (Note: 1 BUSD = 109 USD; 1Bkwh = 109 kwh; 1 GW= 109W).",,"Acceleration time; Development costs; Electric energies; Electric power level; Interesting information; Interstellar flight; Microwave transmission; Microwave transmitters; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power plants; Electricity; Investments; Kinetics; Laser beams; Microwave devices; Moon; NASA; Probes; Rockets; Stars; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450104638

The seismicity essentially consists of rather superficial (z < 10 km for more than 90% of cases), low-magnitude (usually M < 3) earthquakes. Foci of earthquakes are clustered on the main fault systems crossing the region, such as the Santa Tecla fault and the San Leonardello fault system, that have in recent times produced earthquakes of unusually high intensity covering the whole of the Etnean area. The broad picture of seismicity may be partially attributed to the accumulation of stress related to the seaward displacement of moving blocks in the vicinity of the Valle del Bove and adjacent regions in response to the storage and release of elastic energy associated with frequent episodes of magma intrusion. We propose that eastward sliding probably involves a complicated ensemble of moving blocks, resting on shallow independent décollements rather than on a single, widespread decoupling surface.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6244257944

The near-surface water balance of a homogeneous area of wildland vegetation in west-central Florida was described quantitatively for June 1991 to October 1992. The study area was in the dry prairie vegetation type common to central Florida. The water balance was defined on a unit area basis for a depth of 5.5 meters. The period of field measurements encompassed two summer wet seasons; one was drier than normal and one was wetter than normal. Water-balance components were measured, estimated, or computed as the residual in massbalance computations. The water-balance components precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the rate of soil-water storage were measured or estimated using independent techniques. A layer of clay starting at a depth of 5.5 meters was assumed to limit vertical flow at that depth to negligible amounts. The equation for the water balance was arranged to compute water yield as the residual. Water yield was interpreted as being the sum of (1) the difference between surface-water inflow and outflow, (2) the difference between ground-water inflow and outflow, and (3) errors in the other water-balance components. Alternative techniques were used to measure precipitation and evapotranspiration in order to assess the reliability of results. Precipitation was measured using tipping-bucket and accumulating rain gages. Precipitation recorded using the two gages agreed to within 1 percent. Evapotranspiration was estimated using the micrometeorological techniques energy-balance Bowen ratio (EBBR), energy-balance wind and scalar profile (EBWSP), and eddy correlation. Because reliable measurements of vapor-pressure gradients could not be routinely made at night and during early morning periods, and because numerical results from the EBBR technique are inherently unstable during early morning and evening periods, results from that technique were augmented using the EBWSP technique to produce continuous 24-hour records of evapotranspiration. Eddy-correlation measurements were made intermittently for 24-hour periods during the study. Daily evapotranspiration, computed using the combined EBBR-EBWSP approach, was significantly correlated with daily evapotranspiration estimated using eddy correlation (r2 = 0.89). The slope of the relation between the two estimates was not significantly different from 1 and the intercept was not significantly different from 0. Rate of soil-water storage was computed using a time series of replicated measurements of soil-water content. Volumetric soil-water content in the uppermost 0.15 meter of soil was measured using core samples. Volumetric soil-water content between depths of 0.15 and 1.7 meters was measured using a neutron moisture gage. Depth to the water table was never more than 1.7 meters during the study, and changes in water content between that depth and a depth of 5.5 meters were assumed to be negligible. Precipitation during the 498 days of field measurements was 2,245 millimeters, which made it the largest component in the water balance. Evapotranspiration, the second largest component, was 1,419 millimeters. Water yield was 808 millimeters and the change in soil-water storage was 19 millimeters. When the water-balance was integrated annually to include the drier of the two wet seasons, precipitation was 1,019 millimeters, evapotranspiration was 1,000 millimeters, water yield was 215 millimeters, and the change in soil-water storage was -197 millimeters. When the water balance was integrated annually to include the wetter of the two wet seasons, precipitation was 1,561 millimeters, evapotranspiration was 981 millimeters, water yield was 540 millimeters, and the change in soil-water storage was 41 millimeters.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6044267543

However, for those instances when in vivo studies are impractical, too expensive or inappropriate, and when blood flow is not an issue, the ability to perform in vitro studies then becomes invaluable. Optical absorption spectroscopy shows that it may be possible to obtain meaningful information about the optical properties of human breast tissue from in vitro samples if strict preparation and measuring protocols are used. That a strict protocol for storing and handling tissue is critical can be seen from our observations of changes in the optical absorption spectra that occur in response to formalin fixation, the passage of time, application of stains and dyes, and storage in growth medium of the excised tissue. In vivo optical absorption spectroscopy measurements have been made on human breast cancer xenografts and compared with in vitro measurements on breast biopsies prepared according to precise collection and treatment protocols. There is a 'window of opportunity' before time dependent changes in the UV optical absorption spectra of the excised tissue specimens occur.

The corresponding magnetospheric region is not larger than a few Earthradii in both directions. Nevertheless, it is the global nature of the energy input and subsequent energy transport and release, which determines when and where exactly the initial localised substorm onset takes place. The global magnetospheric state also determines the details of the later substorm development. One obvious problem of substorm observations is therefore that one must keep an eye on the global magnetospheric development, and at the same time observe detailed processes of substorm onset and expansion at an a-priori unknown location, somewhere near magnetic midnight at auroral latitudes. Thus one needs both a global network of stations and several denser networks, enhanced with advanced equipment, at key geographic locations.

In rats SNS plays a role in TRF, but for humans, the literature is contradictory. Aim of the study: The aim of our study was to explore the role of the SNS on the two components of TRF in healthy subjects. Methodology: Ten healthy lean subjects participated in this study which consisted of four sessions of seven hours each, during which resting metabolic rate (RMR) and TRF were measured by indirect calorimetry either after the ingestion of an oral meal (OTRF) or after intragastric administration of the same blenderized meal (IGTRF). A 0.9% NaCI solution or propranolol (Bolus: 80pg/kg/1 Omin; continuous: 1//g/kg/min) was perfused during each session. TRF was calculated as energy expenditure above RMR as measured the same day, and was expressed as percentage of energy intake. Facultative TRF was calculated by subtracting IGTRF from OTRF.

From a sensitivity analysis of the global carbon cycle, we find that the rate of transport of carbon to the deepest oceanic layers is rather insensitive to the atmospheric-ocean surface gas exchange coefficient, but to a larger extent on the upwelling velocity. Tne location of the carbon emissions, whether they are released in the atmosphere or in the middle of the oceanic thermocline, has a significant impact on the maximum pCO2 subsequently reached, suggesting that oceanic burial of a significant fraction of carbon emissions (e.g. via clathrate hydrides) may be an important management option for limiting pCO2 buildup. The effectiveness of ocean burial decreases asymptotically below about 1000 m depth, considering a one-dimensional ocean model, i.e. perfect mixing at the various ocean levels where the carbon is injected. With a constant emissions scenario (at 1990 levels), pCO2 rises to 501 ppmv by the year 2100 if all the emissions go to the atmosphere. With ocean burial of 50% of the fossil fuel emissions at a depth of 1000 m, pCO2 rises only to 422 ppmv. An alternative scenario looks at stabilizing pCO2 at 450 ppmv; with no ocean burial of fossil fuel emissions, the rate of emissions has to be cut drastically after the year 2010, whereas oceanic burial of 2 GtC/yr allows for a smoother transition to alternative energy sources.","Fossil fuel emissions; Global carbon cycle; Ocean disposal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142607281

Its basin is spread over China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The flow of the Ganges is highly seasonal. Floods during the monsoon seasons and scarcity of water during the dry seasons are the two extreme flow characteristics of the Ganges. India and Bangladesh had been locked in a dispute over the sharing of dry season flows of the Ganges for more than 20 years. Discussions and negotiations between the Governments of Bangladesh and India, have not provided a lasting solution to the problem till 1995. It is a tragedy that the people living in the Ganges basin area are still one of the poorest despite the basin's rich endowments. While so much could have been done, management and sharing of the water resources of the Ganges through positive riparian cooperation had been practically nil. A significant amount of the monsoon floods of the Ganges which cause widespread damages to lives and properties in the co-basin countries could be conserved in the upstream storage sites to mitigate the flood intensities downstream. The storage reservoirs would have augmented the dry season flows of the Ganges and significantly satisfied the reasonable water needs of all concerned. In addition, generation of large amounts of hydropower from the storage dams could have eased the energy crisis in the basin area and created more job opportunities through facilitating rapid industrialization in different parts of the basin. Instead of following the path of cooperation towards realization of the bounties of the Ganges for the benefit of the millions, the governments in the past became locked in controversies. Progress towards mutual cooperation had been impeded by mistrust, fears, misperceptions and myths. In 1996, new governments came to power through democratic process in both India and Bangladesh. Sincere and intense efforts by both the new governments ultimately resulted in the signing of a thirty year treaty between Bangladesh and India on sharing of the Ganges waters at Farakka in December, 1996. The signing of this treaty removed the major irritant and create a climate of trust and confidence congenial for further cooperation. In the interest of all, the political and conceptual problems need to be more purposefully addressed by all concerned, specially as the underlying commonality of interests in the Ganges is overwhelming.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044522718

The absolute QE of ffight-like HRC-I MCPs manufactured by Phillips Components (measured at the University of Leicester) is ∼0.40 at both C K and Si Kα (E1739 eV).

The absolute measurements of the ffight instrument at the 22 discrete energies will be combined with the relative synchrotron measurements of ffight-like detectors to produce the absolute QE of the HRC over the entire AXAF bandpass (0.1 to 10 keV).","AXAF High Resolution Camera; microchannel plates; X-ray detectors; X-ray spectroscopy; X-rays","Absolute measurements; Efficiency calibration; High resolution camera; Micro channel plate; Synchrotron measurements; Synchrotron radiation source; University of Leicester; X-ray detector; Astrophysics; Calibration; Cameras; Cesium; Cesium iodide; Detectors; Gamma rays; Measurements; Quantum efficiency; X ray spectroscopy; X rays; Image storage tubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18544385244

The use of in-situ cure monitors will permit adaptive control of the cure process, thereby lowering energy costs, reducing scrap rate, and optimizing mechanical properties. We describe here the design and demonstration of an embeddable fiber optic sensor to measure the degree of cure of thermoset resins through characterization of the changing viscoelasticity of a curing resin. By coupling a miniature actuator to a fiber optic strain sensor, the assembly can be made to vibrate while immersed in a curing resin. Comparison of the phase of the electrical actuation to the phase of the resulting strain in the sensor permits a measure of the loss tangent of the resin, where the loss tangent is the ratio of the loss modulus to the storage modulus. As the crosslinking of the resin proceeds, the loss tangent also changes, reflecting the changing rheology of the resin. The loss tangent is found to attain a maximum at the gel point of the resin, when a polymer network is formed. Further crosslinking may be tracked as the loss tangent decreases following gelation. After complete cure of the epoxy, the fiber optic sensor functions as a conventional optical strain sensor, permitting in-service strains in the composite part to be measured. Preliminary experimental results are presented here, which demonstrate that by combining a magnetostrictive actuator with a fiber optic strain sensor, the rheology of a curing thermoset resin may be monitored by measuring the changing loss tangent of the resin. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.",,"Actuators; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Coagulation; Colloids; Composite bridges; Cost accounting; Curing; Elasticity; Fiber optic sensors; Fiber optics; Fibers; Gelation; Magnetostrictive devices; Manufacture; Mechanical properties; Metallic matrix composites; Optical materials; Plasticity; Polymer matrix composites; Process control; Quality control; Resins; Rheology; Sensors; Strain; Thermosets; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Adaptive controls; Composite parts; Critical steps; Cure monitoring; Cure monitors; Cure processes; Degree of cures; Electrical actuations; Energy costs; Gel points; In-situ; Loss modulus; Loss tangents; Magnetostrictive actuators; Optic sensors; Optic strains; Optical strain sensors; Polymer networks; Scrap rates; Storage modulus; Epoxy resins",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343842152

The room-temperature BR photocycle is initiated by the 3 ps, 570 nm excitation of the ground-state species, BR-570, prepared in both H2O and D2O suspensions of BR. PTR/CARS data, recorded 50 ps after BR-570 excitation, at which time only BR-570 and K-590 are present, have an excellent S/N which provides a significantly more detailed view of the K-590 vibrational degrees of freedom than previously available. Two picosecond (6 ps FWHM) laser pulses, ω1 (633.4 nm) and ωs (675-700 nm), are used to record PTR/CARS data via electronic resonance enhancement in both BR-570 and K-590, each of which contains a distinct retinal structure (assigned as 13-trans, 15-anti and 13-cis, 15-anti, respectively). To obtain the vibrational spectrum of K-590 separately, the PTR/CARS spectra from the mixture of isomeric retinals is quantitatively analyzed in terms of third-order susceptibility (X(3)) relationships. PTR/CARS spectra of K-590 recorded from both H2O and D2O suspensions of BR are compared with the analogous vibrational data obtained via spontaneous resonance Raman (RR) scattering at both low (77 K) and room temperature.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has recently shown renewed interest in MSO because of its potential advantages over existing processes in treating mixed wastes. MSO technology can be characterized as a submerged oxidation process; the basic concept is to introduce air and wastes into a bed of molten salt, oxidize the organic wastes in the molten salt, use the heat of oxidation to keep the salt molten and remove the salt for disposal or processing and recycling. The molten salt (usually sodium carbonate at 900-1000°C) provides four waste management functions: providing a heat transfer medium, catalyzing the oxidation reaction, preventing the formation of acid gases by forming stable salts, and efficiently capturing ash particles and radioactive materials by the combined effects of wetting, encapsulation and dissolution. The MSO process requires no wet scrubbing system for off-gas treatment. The process has been developed through bench-scale and pilot-scale testing, with successful destruction demonstration of a wide variety of hazardous and mixed (radioactive and hazardous) wastes including chemical warfare agents, combustible solids, halogenated solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, plutonium-contaminated solids and uranium--contaminated solvents. This presentation will review the principles and capabilities of MSO and previous work using it to treat mixed wastes as well as describe recent results to demonstrate the process for the treatment of mixed wastes.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039270709

The models describe a combination of oxidative and fermentative processes. In both cases the ATP production rate, representing ATP concentration, functions as an inhibitor of fermentative CO2 production. The difference between the models is that ATP production is calculated by using oxidative processes only or by a combination of oxidative and fermentative processes. The models are compared with two published ones which use the O2 concentration as an inhibitor of fermentative CO2 production. The comparison is made using gas exchange data of apples, asparagus, broccoli, mungbean sprouts and cut chicory. All four models allow for increased CO2 production at low O2 concentrations. However, high percentages of accountable variance were found only for one published model and the new one which uses oxidative ATP. The performance of the other two models is considerably poorer. The results do not clarify whether increased fermentation rates can be attributed to decreased O2 levels or energy fluxes.

Obese mice displayed three distinct periods of growth with each phase characterized by a different pattern of glucoregulation. Until 4 weeks of age, ob/ob mice had slightly higher rates of weight gain and fat accretion than littermate lean mice. Glycemia was in the normal range and insulin levels were elevated. Shortly after the transition to solid food, ob/ob mice displayed several weeks of increased body growth and very high rates of fat deposition. During this period of rapid weight gain, hyperglycemia arose despite progressively increasing IRI concentrations. Examination of individual obese mice at this time revealed that glycemia was highly correlated with the rate of body fat deposition. The final phase of the ob/ob syndrome began at 3 months of age, as rates of fat deposition abruptly slowed to values slightly less than those of lean mice and glucose values declined to normal although hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance persisted. The present results show that ob/ob mice, although characterized throughout life by many metabolic and growth disturbances, only display diabetes mellitus and exaggerated fat deposition during a 6 to 8 week period just after weaning.","Aging; Body composition; Diabetes; Genetic obesity; Ob/ob mice; Weaning","glucose; insulin; animal experiment; animal model; article; body composition; body growth; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; growth curve; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; insulin blood level; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; weight gain; Adipocytes; Animals; Body Composition; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Energy Metabolism; Female; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Obesity; Weaning; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030447492

Triacylglycerols in adipocytes are hydrolyzed during lipolysis, which results in the delivery of free fatty acids to the bloodstream. Some fatty acids derived by lipolysis are re-utilized by fat cells through a futile cycle termed reesterification. The blood flow in adipose tissue can also modulate the mobilization of free fatty acids. Both fat cell lipolysis and adipose tissue blood flow are regulated by hormonal and physiological factors such as sex, diets, exercise, and aging. Catecholamines and insulin are the major hormonal regulators of lipolysis. This control is subjected to regional variations. Lipolysis is more rapid in subcutaneous than visceral fat cells owing to multiple site variation in the signal transduction pathways of hormonal receptors. Adipocyte lipolysis is altered in a number of common disorders such as obesity and diabetes. In upper-body obesity there is an alteration in catecholanline-induced lipolysis. Lipolysis resistance is observed in subcutaneous fat cells owing to a change in β2 and α2-adrenoceptors in combination with impaired function of hormone-sensitive lipase. In contrast, lipolysis is enhanced in visceral fat cells, mainly due to increased adipocyte β3- adrenoceptor function. This may lead to a relative redistribution of free fatty acids favoring the visceral fat depot; this fatty region is directly drained into the liver. The latter could be an important factor behind several metabolic and endocrine abnormalities in upper-body obesity. Circulating free fatty acid levels are increased in NIDDM. It is unclear if this is due to abnormal lipolysis or just reflects the glucose intolerance or obesity that usually accompanies diabetes. On the other hand, catecholamine-induced lipolysis is accelerated in people with IDDM, which is independent of metabolic control. Recently, a number of polymorphisms have been found in the genes encoding for proteins involved in the cellular signal transduction pathways for catecholamines and insulin. It is unknown at present if these genetic variations are of importance for lipolysis regulation.",,"alpha 2 adrenergic receptor; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; catecholamine derivative; fatty acid; insulin; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; adipocyte; adipose tissue blood flow; adipose tissue cell; aging; diabetes mellitus; diet; energy balance; esterification; exercise; gender; genetic variability; glucose intolerance; hormonal regulation; human; hydrolysis; lipid storage; lipolysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; review; signal transduction; subcutaneous fat; white adipose tissue",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030446429

Preservation of N-rich diamond with a type Ib component requires a young age of crystallization, or unusually cool conditions of mantle storage, or both. Quantitative constraints on the origin of Ib diamonds are possible if the kinetics of nitrogen aggregation are accurately known. However, previous experimental studies have produced significantly different values for the activation energy of Ib → IaA conversion (Ea) which is at least partly due to sector dependence of the aggregation rate in the starting materials. We report a series of high-pressure (P), temperature (T) experiments on synthetic and natural type Ib diamond in which we have used infrared (IR) microspectrometry techniques to unravel the sector dependency. The results show that cube sectors have an Ea of 6.0 ± 0.2 eV, which is significantly greater than the Ea of 4.4 ± 0.3 eV determined for the octahedral sectors. Both values are in excellent agreement with a recent theoretical study in which the sector dependency is ascribed to different mechanisms of nitrogen migration. The higher Ea is most relevant to natural Ib diamond which are invariably of cube or cuboid habit. Application to the Kokchetav microdiamonds of metamorphic origin indicate that their aggregation state is consistent with peak temperatures of 950°C and a burial to exhumation history of ∼17 Myr. Application to yellow cubes and ""coat"" from Yakutia having ∼20% Ib component, indicate this diamond generation grew ≤7 Myr before kimberlite eruption for mantle T ≥950°C but did not grow directly from the transporting kimberlite magma.",,"aggregation; diamond; nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030428669

DYNASTORE commits energy storage units along with generating units and calculates operating costs with and without energy storage, so that savings can be estimated. Typical weeks of hourly load data are used to make up a yearly load profile. For this study, the BESS power ranged from `small' to 300 MW (greater than the spinning reserve requirement). BESS storage time ranged from 1 to 8 hours duration (to cover the time-width of most peaks). Savings in operating costs were calculated for each of many sizes of MW capacity and duration.

Classical laminate theory and known relationships between expansion coefficients and elastic constants are used in evaluating the efficiency of the system as it depends on fibril angle. The mechanism described above seems to exist in the entire subfamily Acanthoideae, whether the seed capsules are hygrochastic or xerochastic. The specific example considered quantitatively is Ruellia brittoniana Leonard, a cultivated shrub native to Mexico.",,"Bimetals; Elasticity; Mechanics; Plants (botany); Residual stresses; Velocity; Acanthaceae; Classic laminate theory; Seed capsules; Seed expulsion mechanism; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030416361

Test voltages as high as 3 V (30% above rated) have been used without any short term effect on measured capacitance. At 3 V the total energy storage capacity of one capacitor is 2100 Joules. With a total volume of 245 cm3, the specific energy of this capacitor is 8.5 J/cm3. To tap this entire energy store would require running the capacitor to zero voltage. Of course, few loads to which a capacitor bank might be connected can tolerate any drop in input voltage. To remedy this problem a DC/DC converter between the capacitor bank and load is proposed.

Each PVM consists of solar array wings (SAW) for converting solar flux to electric power, nickel-hydrogen batteries for electric energy storage, electronic boxes for electric voltage control and power switching, and a thermal control system (TCS) for maintaining selected PVM components within their normal operating temperature ranges. Each PVM is launched into space in the National Space Transportation System (NSTS) cargo bay. To fit in the cargo bay, the PVM is packaged in a compact form. The NSTS docks with the ISS, the PVM is removed from the cargo bay and installed on the ISS. At this stage the PVM is in stowed configuration and its batteries are in a fully discharged state. Each PVM consists of two independent power channels, which are started sequentially. The start-up consists of deploying the SAW and photovoltaic radiator (PVR), initialization and check out of all hardware, thermally conditioning batteries, and charging batteries. After start-up, each PVM power channel is able to generate, store, and distribute electric power to ISS loads. Electric power to support start-up of the first PVM is provided by the NSTS via two auxiliary power converter units (APCUs), one per channel. During sunlit periods, the SAW provides power for the battery heaters (for thermal conditioning, as needed) and battery charging. During eclipse periods, the APCU maintains the channel in a standby mode. After start-up is complete, the APCU is disconnected and the PVM operates independently. The process used to start-up the first PVM on the ISS is described in this paper. Procedures used to bring dormant batteries to their normal operating temperature range and then to charge them to 100% state of charge (SOC) are also described.

The inverter type circuits used by some utilities to interface photovoltaic energy with the AC power grid are prohibitively expensive for residential use. Thus, in residential applications, the energy conversion potential and cost savings potential of the PV are never fully realized. The storage of PV energy in batteries is a step toward enhanced utilization of the PV but is still an isolated mode operation. The basic power transfer circuit described in this paper will provide a simple, cost effective means of interfacing PV panels with the electric utility in relatively low power residential applications. The residential PV panel will therefore operate in a non-isolated mode and function as a generator on the electric grid which will result in a decrease in net power consumption and a corresponding reduction in electric utility costs.

For those customers who normally have a 1 or 2 MVA service, a conventional uninterruptable power supply (UPS) can be an inappropriate solution. As an alternative, AC Battery Corporation has developed a 2 MVA/10 Second Power Quality System designed to eliminate power disturbances. The PQ2000 provides immediate response capacity appropriate for short duration, high-energy discharges. The PQ2000 Power Quality System dynamically disconnects critical loads from the utility and seamlessly transfers the load to battery power within approximately 1/4 cycle. The PQ2000 Power Quality System shown in Figure 1 draws from existing technologies and products that are commercially available today. The system combines mature battery energy storage technology with advanced power switching and sophisticated power conversion techniques to produce a new category of power quality protection devices for large industrial and commercial power consumers.

The combined propulsive and power systems allow the solar bimodal system to effectively compete for a variety of missions. Once on station, thermionic converters are used to supply continuous electrical power to the satellite, even during periods when the spacecraft is in the Earth's shadow. The key to continuous power supply is thermal energy storage. The ISUS propulsion system also benefits through the use of thermal storage. By utilizing a graphite receiver, large amounts of sensible heat can be stored for later power generation. Waste heat is radiated to space through the use of heat pipes.

Most of the volume (97%) and weight (64%) are taken up by the reactants and their storage tanks. The large volume is difficult to accommodate, and therefore, the working group explored ways of reducing the volume. An alternative approach to providing separate high pressure storage tanks is to use two of the descent stage propellant storage tanks, which would have to be wrapped with graphite fibers to increase their pressure capability. This saves 90% of the volume required for storage of fuel cell reactants. Another approach is to use the descent storage propellant tanks for storage of the fuel cell reactants as cryogenic liquids, but this requires a gas liquefaction system, increases the solar array by 40%, and increases the heat rejection rate by 170% compared with storage of reactants as high pressure gases.

Their performance is adversely affected by high ambient temperatures. Several means of reducing the turbine inlet temperature (off peak water chiller and ice storage and absorption refrigeration systems) are being proposed as a means of increasing turbine output. In the present investigation the feasibility of increasing turbine output power by using its exhaust gases to power an ejector refrigeration system is demonstrated. The advantages of the ejector refrigeration are: it operates on a non-CFC fluid, its small number of moving parts and its small size. The analysis focuses on United Technologies FT4 turbine with a base load output of 21.6 MW. It is demonstrated that the proposed system can decrease the turbine inlet temperature from 296.2 K to 277.6 K which increases the turbine output by 12.8% during periods of high ambient temperature and improves yearly averaged power output by 5.5% in a temperate climate. It is shown that the energy in the turbine exhaust has the potential of producing additional cooling beyond that required to reduce the inlet temperature.",,"Air; Calculations; Power generation; Refrigerators; Steam turbines; Waste heat; Cooling inlet air; Ejector refrigerator; Waste heat utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030399964

This feature could allow system designers to eliminate some expensive devices such as battery powered UPSs to maintain power on motors driving critical loads. It can also improve industrial production by eliminating costly shutdowns of critical processes. The ride-through is accomplished by use of a very high inertia rotor in the written-pole motor, and by use of a unique control technology for the magnetic field in the rotor. The rotor inertia acts as a flywheel energy storage system. The written-pole machine can easily start and run inertia which is 50 or 100 times greater than conventional motors.

Three different types of thermal diodes are constructed and tested following the numerical simulation to verify their actual performance and adaptability (feasibility). Of these, the first model is a simple thermal diode consisting of a number of rectangular loops whose direction of heat transfer can be easily manipulated either manually or automatically. The second model consists of a rectangular fluid reservoir, a vertical cavity and an inclined channel connecting the reservoir and cavity. This design is easy to construct and very effective in transporting and storing heat for space heating in winter. The concept employed in the second model could be further extended to build a solar water heating system with a tubeless flat plate collector. An antifreeze solution is circulated through the system by natural convection extracting heat from the solar energy to heat the water contained in a separate storage tank.",,"Computer simulation; Diodes; Heat storage; Natural convection; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar water heaters; Thermal diodes; Tubeless flat plate collector; Solar heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030393589

Electric vehicles (EVs) generate little waste heat, and using battery energy for heating may consume a substantial fraction of the energy storage capacity, reducing the vehicle range, which is one of the most important parameters in determining EV acceptability. This paper analyzes the applicability of a desiccant dehumidifier for providing comfort heating in an EV with reduced energy consumption. A dehumidifier can reduce the heating load in a vehicle because it adsorbs the water vapor generated by the passengers, thereby avoiding water condensation on the windows without requiring a high external air ventilation rate or a high window temperature. The results indicate that the desiccant dehumidifier can reduce the steady-state heating load by 60% or more under typical conditions. The reduction in heating load is such that waste heat may be enough to provide the required heating under most ambient conditions.

The resulting bit allocation yields a higher signal to noise ratio, and a better correlation between the quantization step size and the block energies, with respect to the linear rate control scheme for the same number of bits assigned for a particular frame.",,"Algorithms; Bit error rate; Constraint theory; Image compression; Mathematical models; Optical correlation; Optimization; Signal to noise ratio; Storage allocation (computer); Trellis codes; Bit rate control; Video coders; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030383309

This simple system facilitates rigorous analysis of the field and is used to derive directly the dielectric chemical potential of dielectric materials which are subject to different constraints. The constraints are imposed on field and geometrical variables and on physical parameters of the contents of the capacitor. Different constraints yield different forms of the dielectric chemical potential depending on the energy exchange between the field and coupled current and mechanical sources. If the constraints impose an increase in the energy that is stored in the field as mass is added to it, then the dielectric chemical potential turns out to be positive. The reverse is also true. In an ideal lossless system, the stored energy can be retrieved electrically and mechanically. It is shown that the dielectric chemical potential of a dielectric which exists in one region of the capacitor can be a function of the properties of this region, as well as those of the rest of the capacitor. In this sense, isolation of regions in the capacitor, with respect to changes of energy due to addition of mass, may not be physically meaningful. Finally, the effect of the polarization energy stored in a dielectric ionized solution in the context of the electrochemical potential is considered. It is shown that the electrochemical potential consists of terms due to chemical, and primary and secondary field-charge interactions. The well-known electric potential energy density of single charges gives rise to the primary effect, whereas the dielectric energy density stored in a polarized ionic solution is the reason for the secondary effect.","Electrochemical potential; Electroquasistatic systems; Energy; Helmholtz potential; Parallel plate capacitor; Thermodynamics","Capacitors; Constraint theory; Dielectric materials; Electric charge; Electric energy storage; Polarization; Thermodynamic properties; Electric potential energy; Electroquasistatic systems; Parallel plate capacitors; Electrostatics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030382853

Our measurements show that arc damage is reduced by placing resistance in series with FEAs, but appears to remain the dominant failure mechanism. Once ignited, an arc can potentially dissipate most of the energy stored in the charged capacitance of the FEA, regardless of how well protected the FEA is. Simple calculations show that the energy stored in a state-of-the-art low capacitance FEA is more than enough to melt sufficient material to ruin a tip or form a short between a tip and the gate. In order to produce more uniform emission for display applications, resistances are typically incorporated into the array in series with each tip. Arc damage has been suppressed in these FEAs, allowing them to be used in poor vacuums. The resistance produces a significant RC time constant, limiting the frequency at which the gate-tip voltage can be modulated. However, the value of the resistance appropriate for display applications may be much larger than required to reduce arc damage. Similarly, the capacitance in series with the resistor can be made very small.

By breaking up the course into twenty or so segments, the problem can be made tractable enough to solve on a (vintage 1995) portable computer in a few minutes. The parameters varied are the average speeds on each of the segments. A model of the car, information about the course, and weather forecasts all contribute to the calculation of the net drain on the car's storage batteries over each segment. The main constraints are the minimum and maximum battery charge. This article discusses the algorithms used, some of our strategic insights and expectations prior to the race, and how our plans fared in the competition.",,"Algorithms; Computer simulation; Electric power measurement; Optimization; Personal computers; Solar cells; Solar energy; Speed control; Weather forecasting; Race strategies; Solar car simulation; Racing automobiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030372103

Improvements are demanded primarily by three areas of advancing PET state of the art. First, larger detector arrays such as the Hammersmith ECAT EXACT HR++ exceed the addressing capacity of 32 bit coincidence event words. Second, better scintillators (LSO) make depth-of-interaction (DOI) and time-of-flight (TOF) operation more practical. Third, fully optimized single photon attenuation correction requires higher rates of data collection. New technologies which enable the proposed third generation Real Time Sorter (RTS III) include: 1) 80 M byte/sec Fibre Channel RAID disk systems, 2) PowerPC on both VMEbus and PCI Local bus, and 3) quadruple interleaved DRAM controller designs. Data acquisition flexibility is enhanced through a wider 64 bit coincidence event word. PET methodology support includes DOI (6 bits), TOF (6 bits), multiple energy windows (6 bits), 512×512 sinogram indexes (18 bits), and 256 crystal rings (16 bits). Throughput of 10 M events/sec is expected for list-mode data collection as well as both on-line and replay histogramming.

Physical aging is a thermo-reversible process which has a significant effect on the physical and mechanical properties of engineering resins. These properties include volume, enthalpy, yield strength, tensile modulus and fracture energy. The effect of physical aging on the mechanical properties of a high performance engineering resin, poly(arylene-etherimide) (PEI, was characterized as a function of annealing time and temperature below Tg. Annealing process was done for 1,000 and 10,000 minutes at temperatures ranging from Tg-20°C to Tg-140°C. Dynamic mechanical measurements exhibited increases in dynamic storage modulus and decreases in dynamic loss modulus as annealing time or temperature increases. The room temperature stress-elongation behavior exhibited a pronounced ductile to brittle transition i.e., increases in yield strength and decreases in elongation after annealing. Fracture toughness (KIC) of PEI was determined base on the size of different regions on fractured surface of unnotched samples failed under tension and fracture stress. Fracture toughness decreases after annealing as well. Both electron and optical micrographs of fractured surfaces confirmed that upon annealing below Tg PEI exhibits a ductile to brittle transition.",,"Aging of materials; Amorphous materials; Annealing; Brittleness; Elastic moduli; Enthalpy; Fracture toughness; Glass transition; Yield stress; Fracture energy; Glass transition temperature; Physical aging; Polyetherimides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030370216

Films with (240) preferred orientations were prepared on Pt-coated Si substrates by a reactive magnetron co-sputtering method followed by rapid thermal annealing. Crystallization temperatures between 600 and 700 °C resulted in square double hysteresis loops with large values of the maximum polarization (up to 70 μC/cm2). These very large values of induced polarization make such films attractive for energy storage applications. The phase transformations between the orthorhombic antiferroelectric phase and a rhombohedral ferroelectric phase, as well as ferroelectric-ferroelectric transitions were observed by studying the dielectric properties and the polarization-electric field hysteresis as a function of temperature.

Somewhat similar to a semiconductor transistor, the physical principles of operation are quite different. It is an active device driven by a thermodynamic force associated with the effective Zeeman energy of the spin polarized electrons in the base. 'Bipolar' has a double meaning: there are two polarities of carriers, upspin and downspin electrons; and the output can be a positive or negative voltage (or current). The three-terminal device does not have power gain, but because it shows a memory effect it is natural to use it as a storage element in a nonvolatile memory array. Power gain can be achieved in a five-terminal embodiment, allowing fanout and the linking of devices in logic operations. Switching times faster than 1 ns can be expected. Because all the layers are metals and charge carrier densities are high, fabrication of the device at submicron scales is quite possible and operation at the nanometer scale is conceivable. Thus, the possibility of achieving high packing densities is very plausible, and is not obviated by problems common to semiconductors such as heat dissipation and low carrier density.",,"Carrier concentration; Charge carriers; Electron transport properties; Electrons; Heat losses; Metals; Nanotechnology; Bipolar spin transistor; Spin polarized transport; Zeeman energy; Bipolar transistors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030349580

Process factors such as oxide thickness, implantation dose/energy, and substrate doping are critical to meet the product Vt targets and tolerances. The peak carrier densities of threshold voltage adjust implants used in DRAMs are located very close to the Si-SiO2 interface. In this paper, we apply an implant dose monitoring technique using Hg-gate MOS pulsed CV for optimization of low doses for control Vt's for N- and buried channel PFETs in quarter micron technology. This monitoring technique called Partial Implant Dose (PID) essentially measures a portion of the total implanted dose obtained by integrating the carrier concentration profile between two defined limits. PID measurements have been successfully applied to identify ion implanter tool problems. Tool stability, dose offsets and uniformity of different implanters were controlled by mapping PIDs for 200 mm wafers in a semi-manufacturing fab. Implant energies of 10-60 keV with a dose range of 1E12 to 7E12/cm2 were used through 7.5 to 15 nm screen oxides. Furnace and RTA activations were examined. Al-gate MOS capacitors fabricated by evaporation of Al-dots through a shadow mask were used for comparison with Hg-gate PID measurements. The Hg-gate measurements predict that a 5% variation in nominal implanted dose correlates with a 5% variation in PIDs. Day to day dose repeatability for B+ 10 keV 5.5E12/cm2 is about 1%.

That is why all personal computers from the desktop to the notebook are provided with at least one FDD. In 1995, the number of devices shipped worldwide amounted ato about 70 million. FDDs were first introduced into the market in 1970 as 8-inch, one-sided FDDs. After that, progress was made in the densification of data recording and the miniaturization of the device. As a result, 5.25-inch FDDs are produced mainly with 2 MB capacity. So far, the password of FDDS to the market has been their interchangeability. But in recent years the performance of personal computers has grown signficantly, creating the need to store large amounts of data, for example, image data. As a result, the need for high-capacity interchangeable media has grown even higher. In the case of portable personal computer such as the bootbook, small-size, low-energy consumption storage devices are highly necessary. In this connection, high-capacity FDDs of more than 100 MB [3,4] and the ultra small-type FDD of IC card size, 5 mm in thickness with the capacity of existing FDDs [5], appeared recently. Now, the FDD has entered an epoch of increasingly higher capacity and higher data recording densification.

The detector consists of a reverse biased Schottky diode whose area coincides with that of the membrane, and which is placed immediately (∼10-100 μm) behind the membrane/-absorber/resist multilayer. An accurately patterned absorber overlayer covers the detector surface. The overlayer absorbs a fraction of the incident electrons, modulating the detector signal as the beam passes over the membrane. We have studied and modeled the performance of prototype detectors covered with 16 μm period gratings over an incident energy range of 5-50 keV. The combination of Schottky diode and patterned overlayer has been used to improve electron scattering models. We have observed excellent SNR with a 40 nC/cm2 dose at 50 kV, and spatial resolution better than 0.1 μm of a beam transmitted through a membrane. More accurate position information can be obtained by taking a Fourier transform of the diode current waveform created as the incident beam traverses several grating periods. In a poor operating environment, we have observed phase accuracy in 100 μm fields of ± 4°. We have developed an algorithm capable of processing pattern-based data sets at high speeds and low information storage requirements. This technique can be easily implemented with little overhead and little modification of existing systems.","Electron-beam lithography; Fourier transform; Membrane; Pattern placement; Position detector; X-ray masks","Algorithms; Diffraction gratings; Electron scattering; Fourier transforms; Light modulation; Masks; Membranes; Optical multilayers; Pattern recognition; Position measurement; Schottky barrier diodes; X ray lithography; Position detector; Electron beam lithography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030316313

To achieve the objective, data were obtained on the temperature distributions produced by charging a rectangular scale-model tank with chilled water using several different diffusers. Both vertical temperature distributions in the water and flow visualization were used to assess diffuser performance. The measure of diffuser performance employed was the temperature difference between water near the bottom of the tank and incoming water, divided by the initial temperature difference between water in the tank and incoming water. For the range of parameters investigated, diffuser performance usually improved with decreased diffuser height above the floor and with significantly decreased inlet Reynolds numbers.

Tasmania's hydro generation system consists of 40 reservoirs in six river catchments. The daily water release for each plant is scheduled using the HEC's mid-term operation policy. The Hydro Scheduling and Commitment (HSC) function schedules the hydro units on a half hourly basis so that the allocated water release maximizes the energy production. This maximization of energy production is achieved by maximizing the head and this ensures that operation is always as close as possible to maximum efficiency. Mixed Integer Linear Programming is used with a detailed model of the interconnected hydro system to determine the half-hourly operation schedule. The Hydro Economic Dispatch (HED) function is used to implement the schedules produced by HSC in the real-time operation. The HED also uses a detailed model of the hydro system with a Linear Programming algorithm to ensure that each unit operates as close as possible to its head-dependent theoretical maximum efficiency point while meeting the desired storage levels specified by the HSC solution. HSC and HED have been tested against a number of operational scenarios and when it is fully integrated within the new EMS it is expected to yield annual stored energy savings up to 0.5% through more efficient hydro-electric system operation. It is expected to also provide additional savings by fostering improvements to the mid-term operating plan. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Hydro economic dispatch (HED) functions; Hydro scheduling and commitment (HSC) functions; Algorithms; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Energy management; Hydroelectric generators; Linear programming; Mathematical models; Operations research; Real time systems; Scheduling; Hydroelectric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030286795

The presence of mobile nodes in the system places constraints on the permissible energy consumption and available communication bandwidth. To minimize the lost computation during recovery from node failures, periodic collection of a consistent snapshot of the system (checkpoint) is required. Locating mobile nodes contributes to the checkpointing and recovery costs. Synchronous snapshot collection algorithms, designed for static networks, either force every node in the system to take a new local snapshot, or block the underlying computation during snapshot collection. Hence, they are not suitable for mobile computing systems. If nodes take their local checkpoints independently in an uncoordinated manner, each node may have to store multiple local checkpoints in stable storage. This is not suitable for mobile nodes as they have small memory. This paper presents a synchronous snapshot collection algorithm for mobile systems that neither forces every node to take a local snapshot, nor blocks the underlying computation during snapshot collection. If a node initiates snapshot collection, local snapshots of only those nodes that have directly or transitively affected the initiator since their last snapshots need to be taken. We prove that the global snapshot collection terminates within a finite time of its invocation and the collected global snapshot is consistent.

Although originally envisioned as a large-scale load-leveling device, today's utility industry realities point to other applications of SMES. These applications: transmission line stabilization, spinning reserve, and voltage control, are likely to open the door to SMES commercialization in the utility sector. In the industrial sector, power quality concerns are already driving the development of a market for micro-SMES devices, and load-leveling at an industrial scale is fast becoming a potential application. Work recently completed as part of the U.S. SMES program, as well as ongoing design activities, point to self- (or cold-) supported SMES as the design option in the near-future. This is a major departure from the earth-supported SMES systems first envisioned 25 years ago for utility load-leveling. The path to commercialize SMES is not likely to include a large 'demonstration' unit, or model, but rather follow an evolutionary process in which bigger and better units will be fielded in response to specific applications. This paper reviews the developments in the U.S. SMES program that have taken us to where we are today, briefly reviews SMES-related activities around the world, and points out trends in applications and development of SMES. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Energy conversion; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Marketing; Technology transfer; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030193244

This family of magnets is required to contain a low energy beam of positrons (3.1 GeV) and a high energy electron beam (9.0 GeV) in adjacent beam pipes housed within a common magnet. One beam will be focused while the other passes through an almost field free region. To do this, an asymmetric magnet must be designed having a pure, high quality quadrupole field in the magnet aperture and an adjacent low field bypass channel. A current sheet or ""septum"" coil must be placed between these two regions to produce the desired magnetic results. Design of this high current density septum coil presents many challenges since space between the two vacuum beam pipes where the coil must reside is very limited. This paper will describe the overall design of the septum quadrupoles and the solutions employed to achieve the required magnetic performance. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Electric coils; Linear accelerators; Magnetic fields; Storage rings; Septum quadrupole magnets; Accelerator magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030189123

The methods are based on the hardware characteristics of 20-kW/100-kWh and 1-MW/4-HWh prototype BESSs, which are already developed and are being developed, respectively. The candidate site of BESS installation is the secondary side of a distribution substation's main transformer (MTr). These tasks are performed by first classifying the load pattern of an MTr and comparing it to the load pattern of a total power system. If the load factor improves, then the location is determined to be a BESS installation site. Subsequently, the optimal BESS capacity for an MTr is determined using the given operation pattern, the charging/discharging characteristics, and efficiency. Computational experimentation was performed on an actual distribution system in Korea. After determining the optimal capacity, we verified that installing the BESS on the selected MTr improved both daily and nightly load factors. © 1995 IEEE.",,"Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Electric power distribution; Optimization; Battery energy storage system; Load leveling; Optimal battery capacity; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030109463

The magnetic diffusion equation for a current exponential fall in an infinite slab, as a model problem, was solved analytically. The dependence of the energy loss on the slab characteristics and time constant of the current decay was determined. More complicated cases of cylindrical coils were treated numerically. Both electromagnetic and stress analyses were performed. A jellyroll coil was found to be superior to a pancake coil in terms of discharge efficiency. A jellyroll coil of the Brooks type is able to supply to the load approximately 25% more energy than a pancake coil of identical size, providing both carry the same current. However, the energy density of a pancake coil is approximately 20% higher than that of a jellyroll coil, if the coils are charged up to the limit of their mechanical strength. To calculate the discharge efficiency of a pancake coil, a time-consuming transient analysis could be replaced by a dc or low-frequency ac analysis. Discharge efficiency increases for a faster charge, whereas the total transferred energy decreases, owing to a slight field diffusion into conductors. The experiments with a pancake coil yielded results in close agreement with the theoretical analysis. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Eddy currents; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Electromagnetism; Energy transfer; Integral equations; Magnetic permeability; Mathematical models; Strength of materials; Stress analysis; Cylindrical storage coils; Discharge efficiency; Jellyroll coil; Magnetic diffusion equation; Pancake coil; Electric coils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030108435

It can be arranged to charge the battery bank or to share daily peak load. In any case, the current supplied by the utility can be maintained sinusoidal and almost in phase with voltage. When the utility power failure happens, the BESS functions as an inverter to supply uninterruptible power to the load. With the good current sharing feature possessed by this BESS, a central power distribution control scheme with smooth current transfer characteristic is proposed to control the parallel operation of the multi-module BESS. The current sharing of each BESS module can be programmed according to its rating and the load condition.

PAM's offer a new mixture of hardware performance and software versatility. We review the important architectural features of PAM's, through the example of DECPeRLe-1, an experimental device built in 1992. PAM programming is presented, in contrast to classical gate-array and full custom circuit design. Our emphasis is on large, code-generated synchronous systems descriptions; no compromise is made with regard to the performance of the target circuits. We exhibit a dozen applications where PAM technology proves superior, both in performance and cost, to every other existing technology, including supercomputers, massively parallel machines, and conventional custom hardware. The fields covered include computer arithmetic, cryptography, error correction, image analysis, stereo vision, video compression, sound synthesis, neural networks, high-energy physics, thermodynamics, biology and astronomy. At comparable cost, the computing power virtually available in a PAM exceeds that of conventional processors by a factor 10 to 1000, depending on the specific application, in 1992. A technology shrink increases the performance gap between conventional processors and PAM's.

Transfer relations for individual layers with specified magnetic permeabilities and electrical conductivities are spliced together in a manner that is analogous to splicing impedances for cascaded sections of transmission line. Specific transfer relations for four layer geometries (planar, cylindrical with transverse fields, cylindrical with axial fields, and spherical) and constraints at source and shielded surfaces for six source-shield configurations involving both externally applied fields and enclosed sources are developed. Limiting cases are extracted for magnetically permeable, nonconducting layers, and for thin, magnetically nonpermeable, conducting layers. Reciprocity conditions are identified for interchanged source and shielded regions in planar, transverse field cylindrical, and spherical geometries. Variations of magnetic field and flux density with position are shown for a specific planar example involving alternating layers of aluminum and steel, with the same total shield thickness occupied by either one or five layer pairs. Simulations with alternating layers of aluminum and steel for the four layer geometries are used to answer questions regarding the effects of material composition, number of layer pairs, and air gaps. An optimal number of layer pairs for a given total shield thickness is identified. Results from simulations where induced currents in the steel layers are neglected are compared with those for simulations with a realistic conductivity value for steel to assess the relative effects of flux shunting and induced current shielding. The effects of introducing air gaps between material layers upon overall shielding factor magnitude are shown. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Aluminum; Calculations; Composition; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Electric conductivity; Electric currents; Magnetic fields; Magnetic permeability; Steel; Transmission line theory; Magnetic energy storage density; Magnetoquasistatic systems; Quasistatic multilayered magnetic shielding; Magnetic shielding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030081431

First, the in-vivo state was approximated by short-term (10 min) incubation of whole cotyledons in [14C]sucrose solutions. Under these conditions, a minimum of 67% of the 14C label entered the dermal transfer cell complex. Of this, at least 40% crossed the plasma membranes of the epidermal transfer cells. Second, a protocol was developed to enzymatically isolate and purify dermal transfer cell protoplasts. The yields of the transfer cell protoplasts were relatively low and their preparation incurred a significant loss of plasma membrane. However, the protoplasts remained viable up to 24 h following purification and proved to be a suitable system to verify transport properties observed with whole cotyledons. Using these two experimental systems, it was established that [14C]sucrose uptake by the dermal transfer cells exhibited features consistent with mediated energy-dependent transport. This included saturation kinetics, competition for uptake between structurally similar molecules, and inhibition of uptake by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid and several other metabolic inhibitors. For comparative purposes, sugar uptake by the storage parenchyma of the Vicia cotyledons was also examined. In contrast to the dermal transfer cell complex, sucrose uptake by the storage parenchyma displayed characteristics consistent with simple diffusion.","Cotyledon (developing); Protoplast (dermal transfer cells); Sugar transport; Transfer cell (dermal); Vicia (sugar transport)","Vicia faba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030039799

Afterwards, these memories are employed on-line for fault location using the protection system equipment status. The associative memories work correctly even in case of malfunction of the protection system and different pre-fault configurations.

Box 11-115, Hamilton, New Zealand","Sand volumes and morphologies of 17 ebb tidal deltas off natural inlets on the New Zealand North Island coast, in both open-sea and pocket-bay settings, were investigated. Four basic ebb-delta forms were identified. 'Free form' deltas, typically 'bat-winged' in shape, occur on open shorelines. 'Constricted' deltas are similarly shaped but occur in shoreline angles lacking space for the free form to fully develop. 'High-angle half-deltas' are typically shore-normal or 'L-shaped' and occur in embayment corners where the ebb jet flows against the rocky headland, resulting in a significant shoal forming only on the beach side of the inlet. 'Low-angle half-deltas' are almost shore-parallel sand 'wedges' that form between the ebb jet and the beach where the ebb jet is forced by rock controls to flow at a low angle to the beach. Sand storage volumes ranged from 3.8 × 104 m3 to 1.2 × 1010 m3. The main controls on ebb delta sand volume (V) are the tidal prism volume (P), the angle between the outflow jet and the shoreline (θ), and the wave climate. The empirical equation V = 1.37 × 10-3P1.32(sin θ)1.33 accounts for 83% of the variance in sand volume in the dataset. Deltas on the high-energy west coast tended to be smaller than east coast deltas with similar tidal prisms. The supply of littoral drift also appears to influence delta volume in some cases. These results may be used to help assess permissible rates of sand mining from ebb deltas, to estimate ebb-delta sand entrapment associated with changes in the tidal prism, and to re-design the alignment of inlet channels in order to control ebb-delta sand volumes.","Sand mining; Sea-level rise; Sediment processes; Tidal inlet; Tidal prism","coastal morphology; delta; deltas; ebb delta; ebb tidal deltas; morphology; sand volume; sediment transport; tidal delta; New Zealand, North Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029769086

They must also allow lithographers to expose the resist at the iso-focal point of the exposure system. A reactive ion etching (RIE) process of chromium films, previously reported, met some of these demands. However, it was reported that system loading effects significantly reduced the etch rate, etch rate uniformity, and CD uniformity. An alternative plasma etch system technology, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), has been investigated, which makes it possible to achieve much higher plasma densities, operate at lower pressures, and control ion energies independently. The combination of these features minimizes loading effects, makes it easier to control selectivity, accelerates etch rates, decreases undercutting,a nd improves etch uniformity. This allows the maskmaker to transfer the resist image into the chrome with minimal nominal CD shift and degradation of CD uniformity. Furthermore, with little or no undercutting, resolution and CD linearity are greatly improved. Results using the ICP configuration will be presented and compared with the RIE process. Preliminary studies of defects will be presented. Defect densities will be quantified using a plasma etch process and compared to a wet etch process.

BAT dysfunction in rodents is associated with severe defects in energy homeostasis, resulting in obesity and hyperglycemia. Here, we report that the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a prostaglandin-activated transcription factor recently implicated as a central regulator of white adipose tissue differentiation, also regulates brown adipocyte function. PPARγ is abundantly expressed in both embryonic and adult BAT. Treatment of CD-1 rats with the PPARγ-selective ligand BRL49653, an anti-diabetic drug of the thiazolidinedione class, results in marked increases in the mass of interscapular BAT. In vitro, BRL49653 induces the terminal differentiation of the brown preadipocyte cell line HIB-1B as judged by both changes in cell morphology and expression of uncoupling protein and other adipocyte-specific mRNAs. These data demonstrate that PPARγ is a key regulatory factor in brown adipocytes and suggest that PPARγ functions not only in the storage of excess energy in white adipose tissue but also in its dissipation in BAT.",,"cell nucleus receptor; rosiglitazone; thiazolidine derivative; transcription factor; uncoupling protein; article; brown adipose tissue; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; homeostasis; human; human cell; hyperglycemia; mitochondrial respiration; obesity; peroxisome; priority journal; thermogenesis; transcription regulation; white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Carrier Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Gene Expression Regulation; Hyperplasia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Ion Channels; Membrane Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; RNA, Messenger; Thiazoles; Thiazolidinediones; Transcription Factors; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10544229796

The materials also possess improved properties for mass and heat transfer. All these make a serious advantage of these materials in comparison with those using a latent melting-solidification heat as well as with zeolites capable of reversible hydration/dehydration.

Long-duration ballooning provides a relatively inexpensive means to observe the Sun under near-space conditions and to develop instrumentation and techniques that will be used on future solar space missions. The purpose of the flight was to improve understanding of the mechanisms involved in many different types of solar activity, particularly flares and solar filament eruptions. Achieving this goal demanded the development of a platform for an 80-cm F/1.S optical telescope that would be stable to 10 arcseconds. In addition, we developed an image motion compensation system capable of holding the Sun's image to better than the system's 0.2 arcsecond diffraction limit Other key elements on board included a lithium-niobate Fabry-Perot etalon filter to provide a tuneable 0.016-nm bandpass over a wide wavelength range, a fast 1534 x 1024-pixel Kodak CCD camera, and 180 GBytes of on-board storage. There was also a system for sending commands and receiving telemetry and a high-speed downlink for sending images during periods when the payload was in line of sight of the ground station. On-board computers provided a command and control system capable of near-autonomous operation. During most of the flight, contact with the payload was sporadic, so operation was primarily under autonomous control. © 1996 SPIE.

This paper recognizes that vegetation canopies are wetted through both the primary impact of raindrops to the top layer of the canopy and secondary impacts, from drops falling from the vegetation, to lower layers of the canopy. It shows how drop volumes of primary raindrops can be calculated from the Marshall-Palmer distribution and drop volumes of secondary drops can be calculated from the 'characteristic' volume appropriate to the particular vegetation species. A two-layer stochastic model is described which calculates the rate at which canopies are wetted in relation to both primary and secondary drops. The paper also shows that, in addition to the volume- dependent stochastic wetting effect, there is also another drop-size- dependent wetting effect, related to the kinetic energy of the raindrops, which influences the maximum storage that can be achieved on the canopy. The wetting functions predicted for canopies of different density are described and the application of the model for assessing interception loss from forests, in relation to vegetation, climate and possible climatic change, is discussed.",,"Climate change; Mathematical models; Probability; Random processes; Statistical methods; Marshall Palmer distribution; Rainfall interception; Stochastic wetting effects; Water storage capacity; Rain; canopy; drop size; interception; stochastic model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030274086

Today, the challenge is focused on isolating plutonium from the environment and preparing it for permanent disposition. In parallel, the requirements for managing plutonium are rapidly changing. For example, there is a significant increase in public awareness on how facilities operate, increased attention to environmental safety and health (ES&H) concerns, greater interest in minimizing waste, more emphasis on protecting material from theft, providing materials for international inspection, and a resurgence of interest in using plutonium as an energy source. Of highest concern, in the immediate future, is protecting plutonium from theft or diversion, while the national policy on disposition is debated. These expanded requirements are causing a broadening of responsibilities within the Department of Energy (DOE) to include at least seven organizations. An unavoidable consequence is the divergence in approach and short-term goals for managing similar materials within each organization. The technology base does exist, properly, safely, and cost effectively to extract plutonium from excess weapons, residues, waste, and contaminated equipment and facilities, and to properly stabilize it. Extracting the plutonium enables it to be easily inventoried, packaged, and managed to minimize the risk of theft and diversion. Discarding excess plutonium does not sufficiently reduce the risk of diversion, and as a result, long-term containment of plutonium from the environment may not be able to be proven to the satisfaction of the public.",,"Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Plutonium; Public policy; Public risks; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste storage; Risk assessment; Accident prevention; International cooperation; Management; Radioactive wastes; Risks; Societies and institutions; Nuclear weapons; Military control; Plutonium management; Transuranic; Nuclear materials safeguards",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030274051

Bark in pulp is undesirable because it increases the need to use chemicals for cooking and bleaching. Dry pulpwood increases energy consumption and wood loss when debarking, chipping, and refining. The bark/wood shear strength of 40 spruce and 40 pine pulpwood piles at 4 pulpmills in Sweden was studied. The piles measured 10 m3 and were evaluated over a 14- or 15-week storage period. The bark/wood shear strength did not change appreciably during the first 6 weeks of storage. After 6 weeks, an obvious increase in the shear strength was observed. Both bark/wood shear strength and green density were correlated (r2=0.75) with the moisture content of the sapwood. The variation within and between logs was high.

With increasing content of PP-g-MA, α relaxation of both blends gradually shift to a lower temperature and the apparent activation energy ΔEα increases. In PPVC/ PP-g-MA blends, β relaxation shifts to a higher temperature as the content of PP-g-MA increases from 0 to 20 wt % and then change unobviously for further varying content of PP-g-MA from 20 to 35 wt %. On the contrary, in the PPSC/PP-g-MA blends β1 relaxation, the apparent activation energy ΔEβ1 and β2 relaxation are almost unchanged with blend composition, while ΔEβ2 increases with an increase of PP-g-MA content. In the composition range studied, storage modulus E′ of both blends increases before α relaxation as content of PP-g-MA increases; however, the increment of E′ value for PPSC/PP-g-MA blends decreases progressively between β2 and α relaxation with increasing temperature, but in the region the increment for PPVC/PP-g-MA blends is independent of temperature. The flexural properties of PPVC/PP-g-MA blend show more obvious improvement on PP than one of PPSC/PP-g-MA blends. Scanning electron micrographs of fracture surfaces of the blends clearly demonstrate two-phase morphology, viz. the discrete particles homogeneously disperse in the continuous phase, the main difference in the morphology between both blends is that the interaction between the particles and the continuous phase is stronger for PPVC/PP-g-MA than for PPSC/PP-g-MA blend. By the correlation of the morphology with dynamic and mechanical properties of the blends, the variation of the relaxation behavior and mechanical properties with the component structure, blend composition, vibration frequency, and as well as the features observed in these variation are reasonably interpreted. © 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,"Activation energy; Block copolymers; Composition; Mechanical properties; Morphology; Polypropylenes; Relaxation processes; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Homopolypropylene; Maleated polypropylene; Scanning electron micrographs; Temperature range; Polymer blends",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242405284

Storage can be increased with basin or implanted reservoir tillage; however, persistence of storage throughout the irrigation season may be limiting. We developed a method to measure the cross-sectional profiles and the volume of storage in implanted reservoirs. We used these methods to measure the change of storage during the irrigation season on a silt loam soil (0.2% slope). We evaluated three configurations of the implement used to create the reservoirs and five water discharge rates with the LEPA devices. Surface storage can be divided into depression and detention storage. The average depression storage, water stored completely within a reservoir, varies from 5 to 8 L. For the spacing of reservoirs and LEPA devices we used, this would provide enough water for the evapotranspiration of mature corn for one day in the summer. The six-spoke configuration of the reservoir tillage implement produced the largest amount of depression storage. Depression storage increased during the irrigation season for most conditions indicating that subsidence within the reservoir is prominent. Detention storage, water that flows along the furrow above the reservoirs, was larger (18 to 22 L). The total dynamic storage (depression plus detention) was about the same for all implement configurations. Dynamic storage increased slightly during the season, but changes were only significant for the five-spoke configuration. The reservoir profiles changed shape during the season. The rate of water application affected the change of shape of the reservoirs. High discharge rates produced deeper zones of sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir while intermediate application rates produced more erosion or subsidence within the reservoir.","Center pivot; Implanted reservoirs; Runoff; Surface storage; Uniformity","irrigation; reservoirs; soils; irrigation; LEPA; low energy precision application; soil water; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030435882

Application of simple mass balance principles for non-steady state systems indicated that oscillations were basically characterized by changes in biomass production rate. Cell component analysis showed that the changes in cellular fractions during oscillations were due to changes in production rates of proteins and carbohydrates. The growth process of the cell components was divided into two phenomena: the formation of new cells during mitosis with a low yield and the size increase of new born cells with high yield.Synchronized populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS 426 are characterized by autonomous oscillations of process variables. CO2 evolution rate, O2 uptake rate and heat production rate varied by a factor of 2 for a continuous culture grown at a dilution rate of 0.10 h-1. Elemental analysis showed that the carbon mass fraction of biomass did not change. Since the reactor is not at steady state, the elemental and energy balances were calculated on cumulated quantities, i.e. the integral of the reaction rates. It was possible to show that carbon, degree of reduction and energy balances matched. Application of simple mass balance principles for non-steady state systems indicated that oscillations were basically characterized by changes in biomass production rate. In addition, the amount of intermediates, e.g. ethanol or acetate, produced or consumed was negligible. Growth rate was low during the S-phase (0.075 h-1) and high during the G2, M and G1 phases (0.125 h-1) for a constant dilution rate of 0.10 h-1. However, nitrogen, ash, sulfur and potassium content showed systematic increases during the S-phase (bud initiation). Cell component analyses showed that changes in cellular fractions during oscillations (storage carbohydrate content decreased during the S-phase) were due to changes in production rates, particularly for protein and carbohydrates. Nevertheless, using the data evaluation techniques for dynamic systems presented here, it was shown that storage carbohydrates are not consumed during the S-phase. Only the synthesis rate of the different cell components changed depending on position in cell cycle. The growth process may be divided into two phenomena: the formation of new cells during mitosis with a low yield, and size increase of new born cells with high yield. Both kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients varied with the position in the oscillation: the results showed that biomass structure changed and that specific growth rate, as well as biomass yield, varied by ± 25% during the oscillation.","Autonomous oscillation; Cell component; Cell cycle; Dynamic system; Growth rate; Mass balance","Bacteria; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Growth kinetics; Oscillations; Oxygen; Physiology; Proteins; Autonomous oscillation; Cell components; Cell cycles; Elemental analysis; Growth rate; Mass balance; Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells; Continuous cell culture; article; biomass; cell cycle; controlled study; fungus culture; fungus growth; growth rate; nonhuman; oscillation; physiology; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Fungi; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030592434

Two types of sources will be addressed here: (i) quasi-sinusoidal oscillators connected to a resonant circuit, and (ii) relaxation oscillators connected to a high-frequency energy-storage element, such as a length of transmission line. To date, the highest-frequency sinusoidal oscillator was a waveguide-mounted InAs-AlSb RTD that performed up to 712 GHz. Transmission-line relaxation oscillators have been demonstrated only at microwave frequencies but show promise as submillimetre-wave sources. Their output waveform consists of a sequence of pulses having a repetition rate determined by the electrical delay of the transmission line and a pulse width determined by the switching time of the diode.

The lake inflows peak in spring and summer, and use of the available controlled storage must be scheduled carefully to meet power demands that peak in winter.

However, studies of the hydrology of wetlands largely ignore evaporation, or calculate it by difference or some very simple measure. As part of an integrated study of the hydrology and ecology of wetlands in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, evaporation was measured directly as its energy equivalent, the latent heat flux, using eddy correlation techniques for a 10 day period in June 1994. In addition, data were collected on the other surface energy balance fluxes (net all-wave radiation and sensible heat flux), and ancillary meteorological variables (wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, relative humidity, solar radiation and water depth). Overall, latent heat flux dissipated 48% of the available radiant energy, storage heat flux 35%, and sensible heat flux 17%. A simple hysteresis model for the storage heat flux was developed which performed extremely well. Proximity to Lake Michigan resulted in evaporation rates close to the equilibrium rate (average Priestley-Taylor α = 1.035), which were affected strongly by net all-wave radiation. Three commonly used models of evaporation, Penman, Priestley-Taylor (α = 1.26) and equilibrium (α = 1.0) are evaluated.

Methods: Male inbred Lewis rats were used. The homologous blood deoxygenated by fresh rat lung was perfused to the postpreserved lung with a constant perfusion rate. Animals were allocated into four groups according to the solution and ischemic interval (4°C). Control group (n=6); saline and no ischemic time. Other 3 groups were preserved for 14 hours in extracellular type trehalose-containing solution (ET-Kyoto solution) (ET-K group, n=6) or in the modified ET-Kyoto solution in which trehalose was replaced by glucose (EG-K group, n=6), or sucrose (ES-K group, n=6). After ischemia, preserved lung was reperfused for 60 minutes. Airway pressure (Paw), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) were continuously monitored and blood gas analysis was performed every ten minutes. Wet to dry lung weight (W/D) ratios after the experiment were calculated. ATP, ADP, and AMP levels in the lung after flush and storage were measured. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In ET-K group, all lungs showed excellent physiological data. EGK group had significantly increased Paw, PAP, and pulmonary vascular shunt fraction compared to Control or ET-K group. W/D ratios of EG-K and ES-K group were significantly higher than those of Control or ET-K group. ATP levels and energy charge in the lungs after storage did not decrease compared to those after flush in all groups. Conclusion: Trehalose provides superior lung preservation compared to glucose or sucrose, and it probably is not due to energy state in the lung.

We then discuss recent advances in our understanding of the metabolic links whereby genotype affects whole-animal physiology and growth efficiency through differences in protein metabolism. Most evidently, these differences are in protein turnover, defined as the continuous breakdown and replacement of cellular proteins and which provides the flux that is necessary for metabolic regulation and adaptation. Whether comparing individuals, including associations with genetic heterozygosity, or considering the response to breeding, selection or genetic manipulation, reduced whole-body protein turnover consistently underlies lower energy expenditure and higher growth efficiencies. The present paper describes results from our recent studies that have explored the metabolic basis and functional consequences of these differences in whole-body protein turnover by comparing the component activities of specific proteolytic pathways in the mussel Mytilus edulis. Traditionally, it has been thought that requirements for biosynthesis dominate energy expenditure. Nevertheless, a large component of about 30% of the empirical costs of protein deposition cannot be attributed to known synthetic processes and it has been suggested that costs of protein turnover may contribute to the discrepancy. Findings are presented showing that separate whole-body activities of the four main lysosomal proteases were collectively associated with as much as 73% of the variation in maintenance energy expenditure observed between individual mussels. These associations were positive for cathepsin B, cathepsin D and leucine aminopeptidase (Lap-2). Alternatively, higher whole body activity of cathepsin L was associated with lower maintenance energy expenditure, possibly because cathepsin L was most active in the main tissue of nutrient storage, thereby mobilising energy reserves and reducing the need for protein turnover in remaining tissues. Results therefore indicate profound physiological consequences of lysosomal proteolysis under conditions of partial starvation, but which vary according to functional differences between separate proteolytic pathways. These findings establish that the relative balance between proteolytic pathways is central to our understanding of different efficiencie 12989 as in energy requirements and conversion efficiency.","Energy expenditure; Genotype; Growth efficiency; Net energy balance; Protein",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030273799

This cross heat transfer results in a penalty in system performance, and this paper is about evaluating this penalty. We show that the standard Hottel-Whillier-Bliss (HWB) equation can be modified to simultaneously take into account both the pipe heat losses to the ambient environment and the cross heat transfer between the hot and cold streams. Parameters in these equations are the thermal resistances between the fluids and between each fluid and the ambient. Methods are presented for both calculating and measuring these thermal resistances. We carry out sample calculations of the parameters in the modified HWB equation for a representative solar DHW system equipped with either of two different life-lines of commercial design. System simulations using these parameters reveal that the thermal effects of these life-lines are to reduce the net delivered solar energy by 6-14%, and that heat loss to the ambient is more detrimental to the system performance than heat transfer from the hot to the cold conduit.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030268469

Research Institute, PO Box 2072, Balboa, Panama","Hovering hummingbirds offer a model locomotor system for which analyses of both metabolism and flight mechanics are experimentally tractable. Because hummingbirds exhibit the highest mass-specific metabolic rates among vertebrates, maximum performance of hovering flight represents the upper limit of aerobic locomotion in vertebrates. This study evaluates the potential constraints of flight mechanics and oxygen availability on maximum flight performance. Hummingbird flight performance was manipulated non- invasively using air and gas mixtures which influenced metabolism via variable oxygen partial pressure and/or altered flight mechanics via variable air densities. Limits to the locomotor capacity of hovering ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) were unequivocally indicated by aerodynamic failure in either air/helium or air/heliox mixtures. Air/helium mixtures are hypodense and hypoxic; failure to sustain hovering flight occurred at 63% of the density of sea-level air and at an oxygen concentration of 12%. Air/heliox mixtures are hypodense but normoxic; failure in hovering occurred at 47% of sea-level air density. Thus, hummingbirds demonstrated considerable power reserves in hovering flight as well as hypoxic tolerance. In air/helium mixtures, hovering was limited by oxygen supply and not by flight mechanics. Birds hovering in air/helium mixtures increased their mechanical power output but not their rate of oxygen consumption. By contrast, birds hovering in air/heliox mixtures increased both mechanical performance and metabolic expenditure. Under hypoxia, hovering hummingbirds demonstrated non-negligible, but still limited, capacities for anaerobic metabolism and/or oxygen storage. Depending on the physical context, hummingbird flight performance can therefore be limited by oxygen availability or by flight aerodynamics.","air density; Archilochus colubris; heliox; helium; hovering flight; hummingbird; hypoxia; muscle power; oxygen consumption","helium; oxygen; air; animal; bird; energy metabolism; flying; muscle; oxygen consumption; physiology; review; Air; Animals; Birds; Energy Metabolism; Flight, Animal; Helium; Muscles; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Animalia; Archilochus colubris; Aves; Trochilidae; Vertebrata",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030267801

MEASUREMENTS: Sleeping metabolic rate, total energy expenditure, anthropometry and behaviour at 12 weeks; anthropometry, body composition and behaviour in follow-up. RESULTS: Energy expenditure an 12 weeks (minimal metabolism, total energy expenditure, energy expended on physical activity, behaviour) showed no relationship with later fatness. Infant fatness (skinfold thicknesses and percentage fat) showed in contrast a strong relationship with childhood fatness. Infant fatness also predicted childhood behaviour.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SUBJECTS: Non-diabetic second- (Nisei, n = 290) and third-generation (Sansei, n = 229) Japanese Americans. MEASUREMENTS: Intra-abdominal (IAF) and subcutaneous abdominal fat (SAF) area were measured using computed tomography. Fasting plasma insulin, lipid, and lipoprotein levels were measured using standard methods. RESULTS: Higher fasting insulin was significantly related to greater mean IAF and SAF area, plasma triglycerides, total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol in men and women of both generations. In a multiple linear regression analysis model among Nisei adjusted for gender, age, SAF, antihypertensive medication use, smoking, alcohol use, and exercise energy expenditure, IAF area and fasting insulin level were independently correlated with plasma triglycerides (IAF r = 0.22, fasting insulin r = 0.23), total HDL (IAF r = -0.29, fasting insulin r = -0.28), HDL2 (IAF r = -0.30, fasting insulin r= -0.27), and HDL3 cholesterol (IAF r = -0.19, fasting insulin r = -0.19). Among Sansei, similar associations were seen, except that fasting insulin was unrelated to total HDL or HDL2 cholesterol. These effects differed by gender in several instances. CONCLUSIONS: Both visceral adiposity and fasting insulin level are significantly and independently related to adverse levels of lipids and lipoproteins in both generations of nondiabetic Japanese Americans. The association between adverse lipid profile and visceral obesity is not mediated solely through detrimental effects of intra-abdominal fat deposition on fasting insulin level.","Cholesterol; HDL-cholesterol; Insulin; Intra-abdominal fat; Japanese Americans; LDL-cholesterol","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; lipoprotein; adult; alcohol consumption; article; cholesterol blood level; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diet restriction; energy expenditure; ethnic group; exercise; female; gender; human; immigrant; insulin blood level; lipid storage; lipoprotein blood level; male; normal human; obesity; priority journal; regression analysis; smoking; subcutaneous fat; triacylglycerol blood level; united states; viscera; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Asian Americans; Body Composition; Cholesterol, LDL; Fasting; Female; Humans; Insulin; Japan; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, HDL; Male; Middle Aged; Regression Analysis; Smoking; Triglycerides; Viscera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029745647

This study has used a pig model that allowed human donor liver retrieval techniques and methods of storage to be utilized. In vitro phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) spectroscopy was used to evaluate the changes associated with phosphorus containing metabolites such as NTP, phosphomonoesters (PME), phosphodiesters (PDE), and inorganic phosphate (Pi). During 4 hr storage NTP levels were reduced to undetectable levels but its regeneration was possible over a period of 2 hr of oxygenated hypothermic reperfusion. Resynthesized NTP reached values that were only 30% reduced from preharvest values. There was a corresponding reduction in Pi over the same period. Glycolytic intermediates, 3- phosphoglycerate and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate, both increased significantly during the period of storage and subsequently declined following hypothermic reperfusion. Cellular damage, indicated by the concentrations of glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) and glycerophosphorylethanolamine (GPE) was minimal during cold storage. However upon hypothermic reperfusion, concentrations of GPC and GPE reduced, indicating a degree of cellular damage caused by reperfusion. This study has shown for the first time that it is possible to regenerate high energy phosphate nucleotides following a period of hypothermic reperfusion in a large, clinically related animal model. This technique warrants investigation clinically to improve the outcome of orthotopic liver transplantation. It also provides a method to study the effects of different preservation fluids and methods of storage and organ reperfusion.",,"glycerophosphoethanolamine; glycerophosphorylcholine; nucleotide; phosphate; phosphorus 31; animal model; animal tissue; article; chronic liver disease; hypothermia; liver biopsy; liver preservation; liver transplantation; nonhuman; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; reperfusion; swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029764080

Methods We studied and treated an infant with extrapyramidal signs who was shown-by assay for urinary creatinine and by analysis of brain metabolites with use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra-to have depletion of body and brain creatine, due to inborn deficiency of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT). Findings Long-term oral administration of creatine-monohydrate (4-8 g per day) to this index patient resulted in substantial clinical improvement, disappearance of magnetic resonance (MRI) signal abnormalities in the globus pallidus, and normalisation of slow background activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG). During the 25-month treatment period, both brain and total body creatine concentrations became normal. Interpretation Oral creatine replacement has proved to be effective in one child with an inborn error of GAMT.

The intracellular level of free Mg2+ ([Mg2+](i)) regulates intermediary metabolism, DNA and RNA synthesis and structure, cell growth, reproduction, and membrane structure. Mg2+ has numerous physiological roles among which are control of neuronal activity, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular transmission, muscular contraction, vasomotor tone, blood pressure and peripheral blood flow. Mg2+ modulates and controls cell Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticular membranes. Since the turn of this century, there has been a steady and progressive decline of dietary Mg intake to where much of the Western World population is ingesting less than an optimum RDA. Geographic regions low in soil and water Mg demonstrate increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Dietary deficiency of Mg2+ results in loss of cellular K+ and gain of cellular Na+ and calcium ions (Ca2+). Blood normally contains Mg2+ bound to proteins, Mg2+ complexed to small anion ligands and free ionized Mg2+ (IMg2+). Most clinical laboratories only now assess the total Mg, which consists of all three Mg fractions. Estimation of the IMg2+ level in serum or plasma by analysis of ultrafiltrates (complexed Mg + IMg2+) is somewhat unsatisfactory, as the methods employed do not distinguish the truly ionized form from Mg2+ bound to organic and inorganic anions. Because the levels of these ligands can vary significantly in numerous pathological states, it is desirable to directly measure the levels of IMg2+ in complex matrices such as whole blood, plasma and serum. Using novel ion selective electrodes (ISE's), we have found that there is virtually no difference in IMg2+, irrespective of whether one samples whole blood, plasma or serum. These data demonstrate that the mean concentration of IMg2+ in blood is about 600 μmoles/litre (0.54-0.65 mmol/L, 95% CI); 65-72% of total Mg being free or biologically-active Mg2+. Use of the NOVA and KONE ISE's for IMg2+ plasma and sera from patients with a variety of pathophysiologic and disease syndromes (e.g., long-term renal transplants, liver transplants, during and before cardiac surgery, ischemic heart disease [IHD], headaches, pregnancy, neonatal period, non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), end-stage renal disease [ESRD], hemodialyse [HEM], and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), hypertension, myocardial infarction [AMI] and after excessive dietary intake of Mg), has revealed interesting data. The results indicate that long-term renal transplant patients, headache, pregnant, NIDDM, ESRD, HEM, CAPD, AMI, hypertensive, and IHD subjects exhibit, on the average significant depression in IMg2+ but not TMg. Use of 31P-NMR spectroscopy on red blood cells, from several of these disease states, to assess free intracellular Mg ([IMg2+](i)) demonstrates a high correlation (r = 0.5-0.8) between IMg2+ and [Mg2+](i). Increased dietary load of Mg, for only 6 days, in human volunteers, resulted in significant elevations in serum IMg2+ but not TMg. Correlations between the clinical course of several of the above disease syndromes and the fall in IMg2+ and [Mg2+](i) were found. The ICa2+/IMg2+ ratio appears, from our data, to be an important guide for signs of peripheral vasoconstriction, ischemia or spasm and possibly atherogenesis. Overall, our data point to important uses for ISE's for IMg2+ in the diagnosis and treatment of disease states.","Atherosclerosis; Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio; Cardiovascular disease; Cholesterol; Diabetes mellitus; End-stage renal disease; Extracellular ionized magnesium; Headaches; Hyperlipidemia; Ion-selective electrodes; Ionized magnesium; Ischemic heart disease; Magnesium fractions; Neonatal life; Pregnancy; Renal transplantation; Ultrafiltration","adult; age; conference paper; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diet; headache; human; human tissue; ion selective electrode; magnesium blood level; magnesium deficiency; newborn; pregnancy; priority journal; sudden death; blood; ion selective electrode; metabolic disorder; pathophysiology; physiology; review; Mammalia; magnesium; Humans; Ion-Selective Electrodes; Magnesium; Metabolic Diseases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030346302

Organized monolayers formed at the air-water interface by co-spreading the dyad with appropriate lipids provide excellent possibilities for well-defined deposition of such elaborate molecules on a solid surface. We studied the behavior of a Ru-Rh dyad with four COOH groups at the Rh ligands and having a net charge of +1 (if all COOH groups are dissociated) by measuring π-A and Δ V-A isotherms and reflection spectra. The water-soluble dyad remains at the interface when co-spread with negatively charged dimyristoylphosphatidic acid. Surprisingly, the dyad is also present at the interface after co-spreading with eicosylamine.

Both ηa and η′E follow the power law relationship with shear rate (γ̇wa) and frequency (ω), respectively. Both storage (E′) and loss (E″) modulii increases with frequency.

The goals of the projectarise from an esoteric question-why is there apparently so littleantimatter in the universe?-and the computational problems thatarise in trying to answer this question are quite challenging.To answer this question, the CESR storage ring at Cornell isused to generate a beam of electrons directed at an equally strongbeam of positrons. These two beams meet inside a detector that isembedded in a magnetic field and is equipped with sensors. Thecollisions of electrons and positrons generate several secondarysubatomic particles. Each collision is called an event andis sensed by detecting charged particles (via the ionization theyproduce in a drift chamber) and neutral particles (in the case ofphotons, via their deposition of energy in a crystal calorimeter),as well as by other specialized detector elements. Most events areignored, but some are recorded in what is called raw data(typically 8Kbytes per event). Offline, a second program calledpass2 computes, for each event, the physical properties ofthe particles, such as their momenta, masses, and charges. Thiscompute-bound program produces a new set of records describing theevents (now typically 20Kbytes per event). Finally, a third programreads these events, and produces a lossily-compressed version ofonly certain frequently-accessed fields, written in what is calledroar format (typically 2Kbytes per event).The physicists analyze this data with programs that are, for themost part, embarrassingly parallel and I/O limited. Such programstypically compute a result based on a projection of a selection ofa large number of events, where the result is insensitive to theorder in which the events are processed. For example, a program mayconstruct histograms, or compute statistics, or cull the rawdata for physical inspection. The projection is either the completepass2 record or (much more often) the smaller roarrecord, and the selection is done in an ad-hoc manner by theprogram itself.Other programs are run as well. For example, a Monte Carlosimulation of the experiment is also run (called montecarlo) in order to correct the data for detector acceptance andinefficiencies, as well as testing aspects of the model used tointerpret the data. This program is compute bound. Anotherimportant example is called recompress. Roughly every twoyears, improvements in detector calibration and reconstructionalgorithms make it worthwhile to recompute more accuratepass2 data (and hence, more accurate roar data) fromall of the raw data. This program is compute-bound (itcurrently requires 24 200-MIP workstations running flat out forthree months) and so must be carefully worked into the schedule sothat it does not seriously impact the ongoing operations.Making this more concrete, the current experiment generatesapproximately 1 terabyte of event data a year. Only recentroar data can be kept on disk; all other data must reside ontape. The data processing demands consume approximately 12,000SPECint92 cycles a year. Improvements in the performance of CESRand the sensitivity of the detector will cause both of these valuesto go up by a factor of ten in the next few years, which willcorrespondingly increase the storage and computational needs by afactor of ten.The CLEO project prides itself on being able to do big scienceon a tight budget, and so the programming environment that the CLEOproject provides for researchers is innovative but somewhatprimitive. Jobs that access the entire data set can take days tocomplete. To circumvent limited access to tape, the network, orcompute resources close to the central disk, physicists often dopreliminary selections and projections (called skims) tocreate private disk data sets of events for further local analysis.Limited resources usually exact a high human price for resource andjob management and ironically, can sometimes lead toinefficiencies. Given the increase in data storage, data retrieval,and computational needs, it has become clear that the CLEOphysicists require a better distributed environment in which to dotheir work.Hence, an NSF-funded National Challenge project was started withparticipants from both high energy physics, distributed computing,and data storage, in order to provide a better environment for theCLEO experiment. The goals of this project, called NILE [7], are:to build a scalable environment for storing and processing HighEnergy Physics data from the CLEO experiment. The environment mustscale to allow 100 terabytes or more of data to be addressable, andto be able to use several hundreds of geographically dispersedprocessors.to radically decrease the processing time of computationsthrough parallelism.to be practicable. N ILE, albeit in a limited form,should be deployed very soon, and evolve to its full form by theend of the project in June 1999. Finally, the CLEO necessity of building on a budget carries overto NILE. There aresome more expensive resources, such as ATM switches and tape silos,that it will be necessary to use. However, as far as possible weare using commodity equipment, and free or inexpensive softwarewhenever possible. For example, one of our principal developmentplatforms is Pentium-based PCs, interconnected with 100 MbpsEthernet, running Linux and the GNU suite of tools.",,"Acceptance tests; Budget control; Charged particles; Computer operating systems; Data handling; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; High energy physics; Human resource management; Multitasking; Open source software; Positrons; Computational problem; Cornell University; Crystal calorimeters; Detector calibration; Distributed environments; Neutral particles; Physical inspection; Programming environment; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646168335

In high-energy electron and positron storage rings (E &gt; 6GeV) it is possible to generate intense synchrotron radiation with 1-3 MeV photons by installing a high-field superconducting wiggler. The strength of the wiggler should be ∼8-12T. High-energy photons are emitted from the wiggler and converted to low-energy positrons by using a suitable target-moderator system. For an 8 GeV electron storage ring at a beam current of 100 mA, final yields are estimated to be ∼1010-1012 (slow-e+ s-1) with the size of positron source ∼102-103 cm2. The possibility of increasing the brightness of the low-energy positron beam is discussed. Advantages of using synchrotron radiation for producing positrons are pointed out.

Although triacylglycerols are the prevailing structure of the food lipids in most cases, there are exceptions, too. Analytes called ether extract, crude fat, total fat and total lipids have been interpreted to food fat in nutritional labelling and food databases. However, the techniques traditionally used for fat determination in foods may vary considerably in their ability to recover the various lipid components. Diversity in the lipid composition of various foods and the effects of processing and storage on the diversity and availability of the fat make the correct nutritional labelling of fat problematic. The traditional methods, where the total fat content is determined by extracting the fat with an appropriate fat solvent or a solvent mixture, give good technical measures. The use of this extracted fat-soluble material as the nutritional concept of fat may be misleading. We have suggested the use of the concept of net fat in nutritional food labelling. This definition of fat includes all the unchanged fatty acids from the various food lipids converted to triacylglycerols. In energy calculations 1 g of net fat corresponds to 9 kcal or 38 kJ. This concept reduces the energy values of foods because it eliminates the lipid components, which are not real fats, from the calculation.",,"triacylglycerol; conference paper; fat intake; food analysis; food packaging; food processing; food storage; lipid analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030250280

The efficiency of the storage and release of series elastic energy (SEE efficiency) and the overall mechanical efficiency of the rat gastrocnemius muscle (N=5) were determined for a range of stretch-shorten contractions. SEE efficiency was defined as elastic energy released to the environment divided by external work done upon the muscle-tendon complex plus internal work exchange from the CE to the SEE. Mechanical efficiency is external work done by the muscle-tendon complex divided by the external work done upon the muscle-tendon complex plus work done by the CE. All stretch-shorten cycles were performed with a movement amplitude of 3mm (6.7% strain). Cycle frequency, duty factor and the onset of stimulation were altered for the different cycles. SEE efficiency varied from 0.02 to 0.85, mechanical efficiency from 0.43 to 0.92. SEE efficiency depended on the timing of stimulation and net muscle power in different ways. Mechanical efficiency was much more closely correlated with net power. The timing of muscle relaxation was crucial for the effective release of elastic energy. Simulated in vivo contractions indicated that during rat locomotion the gastrocnemius may have a role other than that of effectively storing elastic energy and generating work. Computer simulations showed that the amount of series elastic compliance can affect the internal energetics of a muscle contraction strongly without changing the muscle force generation dramatically.","elasticity; energetics; locomotion; rat; Rattus norvegicus; skeletal muscle; work loop","animal; article; biological model; biomechanics; computer simulation; elasticity; energy metabolism; male; mathematics; muscle contraction; physiology; rat; skeletal muscle; Wistar rat; Animals; Biomechanics; Computer Simulation; Elasticity; Energy Metabolism; Male; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Animalia; Rattus norvegicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030249418

To improve the energy-delay product we explore methods of reducing energy consumption that do not lead to performance loss (i.e., wasted energy), and explore methods to reduce delay by exploiting instruction level parallelism. We found that careful design reduced the energy dissipation by almost 25%. Pipelining can give approximately a 2× improvement in energy-delay product. Superscalar issue, however, does not improve the energy-delay product any further since the overhead required offsets the gains in performance.

Both methods have achieved practical levels of prediction, but the neural network prediction results are somewhat better. It was possible to select 70% of the high-performing cells, without any false selections from the low-performing cells; it was possible to identify nearly 96% of the poor-performance cells, with none of the high-performance cells mis-selected.

In conventional magnetic actuators of both types, it is assumed that most of the magnetic energy is stored in the gap due to the large reluctance of the gap compared with the negligibly small reluctance of the magnetic core. However, in magnetic microactuators, the fabrication limitations on the achievable cross-sectional area of the magnetic core as well as the finite core permeability increase the core reluctance to the point that this assumption may no longer be valid. In this case, the magnetic energy is distributed in both the gap and the magnetic core, in which the energy distribution is in proportion to the reluctance of the gap (Rgap) and the reluctance of the core (Rcore) respectively. Using an elementary structure of a magnetic actuator, it is shown that for type I microactuators, when the initial gap of the actuator is fixed (e.g., determining the stroke of the actuator), the generated magnetic force has maximum value when the gap overlap area is designed such that the reluctance of the gap is equal to the reluctance of the magnetic core (i.e., Rgap = Rcore). For type II actuators, the initial overlap area of the actuator is fixed (determining the stroke); therefore the generated magnetic force has a maximum value when the gap separation is designed such that the above equality holds. This paper details both analytical and finite element method (FEM) analysis confirmation for type I actuators. Extension to type II actuators is straightforward.",,"Electron device manufacture; Energy storage; Finite element method; Magnetic cores; Microelectromechanical devices; Magnetic energy storage; Magnetic microactuators; Actuators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030231116

The energy of these photons is dependent on the laser and electron energy in the range from kilo-electron-volts to tens of mega-electron-volts. In a sufficiently narrow backscattering angle the photons are nearly monochromatic. Over the past 30 years there have been several attempts to produce photon beams by laser backscattering from relativistic electrons stored in magnetic ring structures. One aim is to produce photons in the high mega-electron-volt energy range with fluxes useful for nuclear physics research; another is to produce photons in the high kilo-electron-volt energy range, which would be useful for medical applications, such as coronary angiography or treatment of tumour. Our present interest is to investigate the possibility of using 34 keV to 10 MeV photon beams far applications in stereotactic functional radiosurgery. We foresee the possibility of neurosurgical operations through the intact skull with precise and effective destruction of deeply lying millimetre-sized targets with minimal effects on intervening structures, high reproducibility and good prediction of the results. Our paper presents: a Monte Carlo study of radiosurgery based on cross firing with 34 keV to 100 MeV photon beams and 200 and 580 MeV proton beams, a theoretical description of the kinematics of Compton backscattering and estimates of the backscattered photon flux from several combinations of laser cavities at Nd:YAG (1.17 eV) and CO2 (0.117 eV) laser energies and electron storage rings energies in the range 0.1-1.3 GeV. As examples, existing magnetic structures, such as the DAΦNE Accumulator in the lower energy range and the Trieste Synchrotron Light Source ELETTRA in the higher energy range have been utilized in the calculations. The Monte Carlo study has shown that radiosurgery with photon beams of energies in mega-electron-volt energy range enables precise destruction of deeply lying millimetre-sized targets with minimal effects on intervening structures. Its precision is comparable to that of radiosurgery with 200-580 MeV proton beam, but our hope is that radiosurgery with lower energy photon beams could be more precise and less expensive. An average dose of 200 Gy can be delivered to a target of diameter 2 mm at the centre of an 18 cm diameter phantom in 1 h using photon beams of fluences 7.3 x 1010, 1.8 x 1010, 6.5 x 108, 2.2 x 108, 8.6 x 107 and 7.8 x 106 photons per second at 34 keV, 100 keV, 1 MeV, 3 MeV, 10 MeV and 100 MeV per cross section of beam of 2 mm diameter, respectively. 34-100 keV photon beams were studied in the hope of finding a strong enhancement of their efficiency if a stable high-Z element were to be introduced into the target's DNA. It is shown that, with a low-energy ring running at about 0.4 GeV and a Nd:YAG laser, it would be possible to obtain the required 3 MeV photon beam Bur to deliver the average dose within 1 h, assuming an average distance between the source and the target of about 5 m. With a similar machine used at about 1.3 GeV and a CO2 laser, a 3 MeV photon beam is obtained and the exposure time can be reduced to less than 1 min, assuming a roughly 10 m distance between source and target (here a beam angle of 0.1 mrad only had to be considered due to the larger angular energy and yield spread). With a lower electron energy of 138 MeV and a CO2 laser, a 34 keV photon beam can be produced. More than 45 h would be needed to deliver the same dose. We hope that this time could be shortened considerably if stable iodine were introduced into the target with the help of a DNA-seeking molecular carrier. In this case the geometrical precision would be further improved.",,"angiocardiography; article; cancer; laser surgery; priority journal; radiosurgery; Electrons; Humans; Lasers; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Neurosurgery; Phantoms, Imaging; Photons; Radiosurgery; Reproducibility of Results; Scattering, Radiation; Skull",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029831802

For the purpose of this paper, gravel is defined as crushed or washed gravel, rock, or stone, ranging in size from 3/4 ''-2 1/4 '' (1.8- 6.4 cm). Many engineering and regulatory drawbacks exist which give substantial reason to either ban or very carefully regulate the use of gravel in leaching systems. These include physical damage to the infiltrative surface, compaction, negative effects of entrained fines, poor storage volume, native soil intrusion into systems, and the promotion of an unusually thick biomat in the stone voids with resultant lower effective leaching rates. The cumulative negative impacts of gravel significantly reduce the long term acceptance rate (LTAR) of natural soil. These negative impacts have been demonstrated by direct experimentation, field studies and failure studies, and can also be inferred from experience with similar engineering structures. This problem will likely get worse as increased environmental and energy concerns impinge on gravel crushing, washing, and transport operations.",,"engineering; leaching; pollution transport; problem solving; review; septic tank; sewage disposal; sewage treatment; sewage treatment plant; water content",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029792402

This curve distinguishes between small, elastic deformation and large, viscous deformation. Small deformations can be quantified by the dynamic Young's modulus. The results demonstrated an effect of both rate of strain and initial particle size on the Young's modulus. The yield strength of compacts is a quantification of large deformations. There appeared to be an effect of strain rate on yield strength, but no clear relation betwveen initial particle size and yield strength. The study relates elastic deformation with storage of elastic energy. The amount of stored energy was found to increase with, compaction speed, and is postulated to be the driving force for changes of tablet porosities after compression. The attraction between particles causes resistance against porosity expansion, and is defined as expansion capacity. The expansion capacity showed no relation to compaction speed. It is therefore concluded that the effect of compaction speed on tablet properties is purely an effect of the amount of stored energy. The reciprocal value of expansion capacity demonstrated a direct relation with the constant that fits the relation between tablet strength and porosity. The expansion capacity is hence a quantification of bonding.","Porosity; Relaxation; Sorbitol; Tablets; Yield strength; Young's modulus","sorbitol; article; chemical modification; compression; particle size; physical phenomena; priority journal; surface property; tablet manufacture; tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030606849

Total variance in all parameters was independent of zygosity and genetic analyses of regional adiposity were performed before and after adjusting for age and percentage total body fat. Results: A genetic influence was observed on the population variance in total fat, C-abd fat (C-abd fat rMZ = 0.66 vs rDZ = 0.20, p = 0.03) and non abdominal fat. After adjusting C-abd fat for age and total body fat there was a independent genetic influence on C-abd fat accounting for approximately 70% of the population variance (rMZ = 0.61 vs rDZ = 0.40, p = 0.001). Conclusion: The majority of inter-subject variance in central abdominal fat in non-obese individuals is due to genetic factors. The inheritance of abdominal obesity, with its associated metabolic consequences, may contribute to the familial aggregation of insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.","Abdominal fat; Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; Genetics; Insulin; Obesity; Twins","adult; article; body fat; body mass; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; dizygotic twins; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dyslipidemia; female; genetic analysis; human; inheritance; insulin resistance; lipid storage; major clinical study; metabolic parameters; monozygotic twins; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; subcutaneous fat; Abdomen; Adult; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Cardiovascular Diseases; Densitometry, X-Ray; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Middle Aged; Models, Genetic; Obesity; Phenotype; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029766871

In the present study we investigated the effect of acute exercise and long-term exercise training on ob mRNA levels in rat adipose tissue. Northern blot analysis showed that a single bout of exercise significantly decreased oh mRNA levels approximately 30% immediately and 3 hr after exercise. After 4 weeks of exercise training the oh mRNA level was significantly decreased approximately 48% at 2 hr after the last training session compared to the control group. These data demonstrated that exercise has a transient effect on oh gene expression and suggest that regulation of ob gene expression may help control energy balance following exercise.",,"messenger RNA; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; dynamic exercise; energy balance; female; gene expression regulation; hormonal regulation; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; Northern blotting; nutritional status; priority journal; training; treadmill exercise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030598910

The effects on levels of glycogen phosphorylase, the resultant effects on flux through the glycolytic pathway, and the consequences of these changes on adenylate (ATP, ADP, and AMP) levels in rat liver during a 24-hr period of cold hypoxia were studied. The rapid transition to anaerobic metabolism was reflected in the increases in lactate levels for all groups. Total lactate accumulation in control livers (flushed and stored with a histidine-lactobionate-raffinose solution) was 9.8 μmol/g. The one notable difference between the control and experimental groups was the total lactate increase in one of the groups treated with db.cAMP; lactate accumulation was 16.0 μmol/g. There was a preferential maintenance of ATP that correlated with the increased flux through glycolysis observed with db-cAMP treatment; levels were 0.4-0.6 μmol/g higher than control group values between 2 and 10 hr of storage. In the control group, levels of glycogen phosphorylase in the active 'a' form began to decrease within 1 hr of exposure to cold hypoxic storage. Values dropped from 86% to 78% within the first 1 hr and by 10 hr, % 'a' was 57%. The separate addition of db-cAMP and okadaic acid resulted in a sustained maintenance of phosphorylase % 'a' throughout the entire cold hypoxic storage period; % 'a' values at 10 hr ranged from 75% to 81%. The major finding of this study was the clear and distinct correlation between phosphorylase % 'a' and total lactate accumulation (index of flux through glycolysis). This relationship was statistically significant after only 1 hr of storage, with a correlation coefficient of r=0.52 (P<0.025); however, the correlation became stronger as the time of storage progressed (by 10 hr, r=0.72; P<0.001). According to the relationship established, the maximum theoretical limit for lactate accumulation with 100% phosphorylase 'a' is approximately 30 μmol/g lactate. This finding suggests that glycogen phosphorylase and not necessarily glycogen content is one major determinant in maintaining anaerobic metabolism and energy production during cold liver storage. Hence, previous experiments that investigated the effects of nutritional status and glycogen content on tissue viability after experimental transplantation need to be reassessed.",,"adenosine triphosphate; bucladesine; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; lactic acid; anaerobic metabolism; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cryopreservation; glycogen metabolism; glycolysis; liver preservation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029799168

This High-Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HIGS) will utilize the facilities of the new Duke Free Electron Laser Laboratory. This system includes the LINAC injector, the 1.3 GeV electron storage ring, and the OK-4 undulator. It will be shown that it is possible to tune the electron beam in a manner which allows the FEL photons to backscatter from an electron bunch, all within the ring. This leads to an intense beam of almost 100% linearly polarized γ-rays whose energy can be readily tuned from about 5 to greater than 200 MeV. Furthermore, beam energy spreads of less than 1% can be obtained by pure geometrical collimation. Details of the beam properties and background sources will be presented. It will be shown that this is an ideal beam for nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics studies. One example of this which takes advantage of the flux, energy resolution and polarization of the beam, is the study of Δ33 excitations in finite nuclei. These intense polarized beams will also make it possible to perform precision measurements of the nucleon polarizabilities. And we will see that studies in the vicinity of the photo-pion production threshold can provide crucial tests of many of the recent predictions (Low Energy Theorems) of Chiral Perturbation Theory.

Nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress in the form of H2O2 also signal to IRPs and thereby influence cellular iron metabolism. The recent discovery of two IRE-regulated mRNAs encoding enzymes of the mitochondrial citric acid cycle may represent the beginnings of elucidating regulatory coupling between iron and energy metabolism.

The model is based on the Farm Accountancy Data Network of LEI-DLO, which gives information on the present energy situation of the Dutch greenhouse industry. In addition, the model uses as input technical conditions and performances of the options and economic data. The output is the present, technical maximum, and potential penetration rates of the options in the greenhouse industry. The potential penetration rates, in turn, result in potential energy savings and investments. The economic potential for improving penetration rates is much lower than the technical ones. Condenser, heat storage and heat delivery are options with economic possibilities. The potential energy savings are 14% of the energy use of the sector and the investments are 182 million Guilders. Better technical performance of the energy saving options can improve the economic potentials. A higher gas price as well as subsidies on investments have a small effect on the results. A higher price of electricity delivered to the public grid decreases the potential for heat delivery but increases the potential for cogeneration installations by growers. This requires substantial investments from the growers. © ISHS 1996.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349112131

With this source of monochromatic radiation a cryogenic electrically substituted radiometer (ESR) is operated as a primary detector standard in the photon energy range from 3 to 1500 eV. The ESR is optimized for synchrotron radiation, capable of measuring radiant power in the order of some μW with an uncertainty below 0.2%.

The hydrogenation behaviour of these alloy has been extensively investigated. The as-synthesized composite materials have been activated at 550 ± 10°C under a hydrogen pressure of approximately 34 kg cm-2 and their hydrogen storage capacities and desorption kinetics have been evaluated. The new composite hydrogen storage materials, in contrast to the native ingredient CFMmNi5 (cerium-free misch-metal pentanickellide), have been found to possess much higher storage capacity and to exhibit favourable absorption-desorption kinetics. It has been found that the composite material Mg-30 wt.% CFMmNi5 has an optimum storage capacity of approximately 5.6 wt.% at the optimum temperature of around 500°C. This is one of the highest reported storage capacities for any known hydrogen storage material. The composite materials Mg-x wt.% CFMmNi5 also exhibit fast kinetics, represented by the rate of desorption of about 140 cm3 min-1 which is about three to four times that of CFMmNi5 alone. Another important hydrogenation behaviour, hysteresis, has been explored through the evaluation of (1/2RT) In(Pf/Pd). The free energy loss due to the hysteresis effect has been found to vary between 1566 J mol-1 at T = 673 K and 3299 J mol-1 at T = 773°K. The thermodynamic parameters ΔH and ΔS for the present optimum composite storage material have been evaluated and found to be -29.00 kJ mol-1H2 and -112.14 J mol-1H2 K-1 respectively. The hydriding rate and the improved hydrogen storage capacity of these composite alloys have been found to be strongly correlated with the structural and microstructural characteristics as brought out through XRD, SEM and EDAX techniques. Based on the observed structural and microstructural characteristics, details of the hydrogenation behaviour have been outlined in terms of multiphasic nature and availability of free nickel on the surface. The present composite materials correspond to a new hydrogen storage material with one of the highest storage capacities (around 5.6 wt.%), suitable desorption kinetics and other amenable hydrogenation features, e.g. hysteresis and thermodynamic (ΔH and ΔS) parameters.","Hydrogen in metals; Hydrogen storage alloy; Magnesium rare earth nickel composite; Storage capacity","Absorption; Desorption; Energy dissipation; Hydrogen; Hydrogenation; Hysteresis; Magnesium alloys; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Thermodynamics; X ray diffraction analysis; Absorption desorption kinetics; Free energy loss; Hydrogen in metals; Hydrogen storage alloy; Magnesium rare earth nickel composite; Storage capacity; Metallic matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030213173

Bt2cAMP-stimulated ovarian granulosa cells were used as the experimental model, and both morphological and biochemical fluorescence data were obtained. The data show that cholesteryl ester provided through the selective pathway is a process which begins with a temperature-independent transfer of cholesteryl ester to the cell's plasma membrane. Thereafter transfer of the lipid proceeds rapidly and accumulates prominently in a perinuclear region (presumed to be the Golgi/membrane sorting compartment) and in lipid storage droplets of the cells. The data suggest that lipid transfer proteins (or other small soluble proteins) are not required for the intracellular transport of the cholesteryl esters, nor is an intact Golgi complex or an intact cell cytoskeleton (although the transfer is less efficient in the presence of certain microtubule-disrupting agents). The intracellular transfer of the cholesteryl esters is also somewhat dependent on an energy source in that a glucose-deficient culture medium or a combination of metabolic inhibitors reduces the efficiency of the transfer. A protein- mediated event may be required for cholesteryl ester internalization from the plasma membrane, in that N-ethylmaleimide dramatically blocks the internalization phase of the selective uptake process. Taken together these data suggest that the selective pathway is a factor-dependent, energy- requiring cholesteryl ester transport system, in which lipoprotein-donated cholesteryl esters probably flow through vesicles or intracellular membrane sheets and their connections, rather than through the cell cytosol.",,"acrylamide; adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor; azide; bafilomycin; brefeldin a; carbonyl cyanide 4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; cholesterol ester; colchicine; cytochalasin d; deoxyglucose; high density lipoprotein; iodoacetic acid; molybdic acid; n ethylmaleimide; nocodazole; okadaic acid; potassium nitrate; vanadate sodium; wortmannin; animal cell; article; cell membrane permeability; cell membrane transport; cholesterol transport; controlled study; cytoskeleton; female; golgi complex; granulosa cell; intracellular transport; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; temperature sensitivity; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Animals; Apolipoproteins E; Azides; Biological Transport; Boron Compounds; Brefeldin A; Bucladesine; Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone; Cells, Cultured; Cholesterol Esters; Colchicine; Cyclopentanes; Cytoskeleton; Deoxyglucose; Enzyme Inhibitors; Estradiol; Female; Fluorescent Dyes; Granulosa Cells; Humans; Iodoacetates; Iodoacetic Acid; Kinetics; Lipoproteins, HDL; Microscopy, Confocal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030057435

It is shown that the glass transition temperature Tg can be readily obtained from stress relaxation and creep data by locating the intersecting point of the Arrhenius and WLF curves on the logarithm of the shift factor aT vs. temperature plots. The Tg thus obtained from stress relaxation data is correlated well with literature values obtained by isochronal dilatometry. The processes of creep and stress relaxation show two regions of distinct molecular motion patterns with different activation energies determined. Rubbery plateaus for stress relaxation moduli due to chain entanglements are observed for polystyrene, poly (p-methyl styrene) and poly (p-t-butyl styrene). The flexural storage moduli E′ for the three polymers show a density dependency, which is correlated by the Rao function. The peak width of loss modulus E″ is affected by the molecular weight distribution of each polymer. Two weak sub-glass transition temperature transitions, β and γ, are also observed from dynamic mechanical analysis. The variations in the glass transition temperature and activation energy from dielectric analysis are analyzed with regard to steric hindrance resulting from different alkyl groups.","Creep; Polystyrene; Stress relaxation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002752453

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether use of ROP during cold storage (CS) with Universita of Wisconsin (UW) solution could ameliorate energy metabolism and functional recovery of ischemically injured rat kidneys and, moreover, to study the particular role of adenosine (ADO) in CS with ROP. Kidneys subjected to 30 min of warm ischemia (WI) were preserved for 24 h in 4°C UW solution with or without ROP and with or without ADO. Measurements of tissue high-energy phosphate levels showed that reduced total adenine nucleotides (TAN) after 30 min of WI further declined during the subsequent CS. In ROP kidneys, however, TAN were less reduced, suggesting that even during CS, TAN can still be regenerated in the injured kidneys when ROP is combined with UW solution. When UW did not contain ADO, regeneration of TAN by ROP was slightly less than in the case of UW with ADO. This indicates that the supply of molecular oxygen is a significant factor in TAN resynthesis during CS. There was no statistically significant difference in survival rate between the ROP and CS groups, indicating that an improved energy status is not the sole determinant of functional recovery. We conclude that the gaseous oxygen supply provided by ROP during CS in UW solution ameliorates the energy state of ischemically injured rat kidneys and that exogenous ADO from the UW solution contributes to the improvement of energy metabolism to a limited extent.","Adenosine, kidney, preservation; Kidney preservation, retrograde oxygen; Preservation, kidney, retrograde oxygen; Retrograde oxygen, preservation, kidney","adenine nucleotide; adenosine; oxygen; university of wisconsin solution; animal experiment; article; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy metabolism; graft survival; high energy phosphate; ischemia; kidney ischemia; kidney preservation; male; measurement; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione; Graft Survival; Hypothermia, Induced; Insulin; Ischemia; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Oxygen; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030002313

These predictions, along with those for ethane adsorption on Pt(110)-(1×2), comprise a unified model for the molecular adsorption of alkanes on platinum surfaces. The simulations show the initial trapping probabilities of methane and propane on Pt(111) are determined to within approximately 10% by the fate of the first bounce. They also indicate that at normal incidence on Pt(111) energy conversions from perpendicular translational motion to both cartwheeling rotation and lattice phonons play increasingly important roles in increasing the trapping probability as the alkane increases in size and molecular weight. For methane itself excitation of parallel translational momentum after the first bounce serves as the most effective energy storage mechanism which facilitates trapping, whereas for propane cartwheel rotational motion plays the dominant role. Excessive excitation of these modes of motion, however, can cause scattering on subsequent bounces by reconversion of the energy into perpendicular translational energy. Collisions of methane with the hollow and bridge sites on the Pt(111) surface appear less effective in trapping than do atop sites. The simulations also suggest excitation of the C-C-C bending mode of propane has little effect on the trapping of propane on platinum surfaces for beam energies below 55 kJ/mol. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000296324

The recent advent of high resolution and sohd state optical sensors such as amorphous silicon arrays and CCD optical imaging detectors makes it feasible to build large, cost effective imaging arrays. This technology, however, shifts the sensor cost burden to the segmented scintillators needed for imaging. The required labor intensive fabrication of high resolution, large area hard X-ray converters results in high cost and questionable manufacturability on a large scale. We report on recent research of a new segmented X-ray imaging converter. This converter is fabricated using vacuum injection and crystal growth methods to induce defect free, high density scintillating fibers into a collimator matrix. This method has the potential to fabricate large area (&gt;400 cm2), thick (10 cm) segmented scintillators. Spatial resolution calculations of these scintillator injected collimators show that the optical light spreading is significantly reduced compared to single crystalline scintillators and sub - millimeter resolution can be achieved for 10 MeV photons. We have produced 2.5 cm thick converters and sub-millimeter resolution X - ray images acquired with the segmented converter coupled to a cooled CCD camera provided the resolution to characterize the converter efficiency and noise. The proposed concept overcomes the above mentioned limitations by producing a cost-effective technique of fabricating large area X-ray scintillator converters with high stopping power and high spatial resolution. This technology will readily benefit diverse fields such as particle physics, astronomy, medicine, as well as industrial nuclear and non-destructive testing. © 1996 SPIE.

In the analytical model of MCP channel, we assume that every electron in a channel is characterized by the vector coordinate ofbirth with the set of components: space, time, energy, etc. If generating functional of the electrons, emitted by the incident radiation, and generating functional of the secondary electrons, emitted by a primary electron, interacting with the channel surface, are known, generating functional of the output signal can be obtained.

Although time-resolved resonance Raman data have been published previously for intermediates in the room-temperature BR photocycle, these PTR/ CARS data are the first time-resolved vibrational spectra from a picosecond BR intermediate at RT containing an isotopically-labeled (13C) retinal. The C14 and C15 positions are selected for isotopic labeling because motions around the C13=C14 and C14-C15 bonds are thought to underlie the structural transformation from BR-570 to K-590 and, therefore, the energy storage and transduction mechanism in the RT/BR photocycle. These PTR/CARS data are recorded 50 ps after the BR photocycle is initiated with 570-nm (5 ps, fwhm) excitation and are fit to within &lt; 1 cm-1 via third-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(3)) relationships. Comparisons of these PTR/CARS data at RT with the results from earlier resonance Raman (RR) studies of K-590 at low temperature (LT) reveal new temperature effects. Specifically, three CARS bands (1197, 1184, and 1167 cm-1) are observed from 13C14,15 K-590 in H2O samples via PTR/CARS at RT, while only two bands (1189 and 1170 cm-1) are found in LT/RR measurements from 13C14,15 K-625. Analogous temperature-dependent differences are found in data measured from 13C14,15 K-590 in D2O samples. Independently, PTR/CARS data at RT demonstrate that deuteration of the Schiff-base nitrogen causes major changes in the fingerprint region: the 1197-cm-1 band decreases to 1193 cm-1 while diminishing in intensity by half and a new band appears at 1206 cm-1. No such deuterium effect is observed in the LT/RR data from 13C14,15 K-590. The previously unrecognized sensitivity of fingerprint bands to deuteration of the Schiff-base nitrogen suggests that the C-C stretching modes are highly mixed with each other and coupled to the N-H(D) retinal rocking mode. Although the temperature and Schiff-base deuteration effects reported here had not been previously identified in LT vibrational data from K-625, an analysis of the RT/CARS data continues to support the 13-cis, 14-trans retinal structure in K-590 proposed from LT results. © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,"Photochemical reactions; Photosynthesis; Raman spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Anti Stokes Raman spectroscopy; Bacteriorhodopsin photocycles; Retinals; Vibrational spectrum; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030197689

However, their practical use is limited by poor hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics. This problem can be resolved by mixing Mg alloys with other materials to form composites. We present an investigation of the initial hydriding characteristics, as well as the compositional transformation of composites made of La2Mg17 + LaNi5 mechanically milled in a 2:1 weight ratio. Composites produced with varying durations and intensities of milling were tested. Those milled to the greatest extent proved to have the best initial hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics. The kinetics of the most heavily milled composite were superior to those of La2Mg17. This composite absorbed 90% of its full hydrogen capacity (3.5 wt.% H2) in less than 1 min at 250°C and desorbed the same quantity of hydrogen in 6 min. Under the same conditions pure La2Mg17 took 2.5 h to absorb and 3 h to desorb 90% of its full hydrogen capacity (4.9 wt.% H2). Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the mechanically milled powders before and after hydriding. The unhydrided powders consisted of LaNi5 grains surrounded by a fractured La2Mg17 matrix. Hydrogen cycling, at temperatures up to 350°C, induced phase changes, segregation, and disintegration of the composites. The resulting fine powder (less than 1 μm) consisted primarily of Mg, Mg2Ni, and La phases.","Ball milling; Composites; Hydrogen absorption; Kinetics; Metal hydrides","Absorption; Ball milling; Chemical reactions; Composition; Desorption; Hydrogen; Metallic matrix composites; Phase transitions; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Storage (materials); X ray spectroscopy; Desorption kinetics; Gaseous hydrogen storage; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen capacity; Initial hydriding characteristics; Magnesium composites; Steady state composition; Weight ratio; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030192166

Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed that very fine Ti2Ni particles were inlaid onto the surface of Mg2Ni particles by mechanical treatment and sintering. XRD showed the composite alloys were composed of primary alloys Mg2Ni, Ti2Ni and new phases TiNi, Ti-Mg formed in the composite procedure. The electrode characteristics of Mg2Ni-xwt.%Ti2Ni alloys in an alkaline solution have been investigated and compared with those of Mg2Ni. The discharge capacity of the alloy electrode was effectively improved from 8 mA h g-1 of Mg2Ni to 165 mA h g-1 of Mg2Ni-40wt.%Ti2Ni at ambient temperature, which is almost comparable with that of Ti2Ni electrode (170 mA h g-1). It is believed that the fine Ti2Ni particles inlaid on the surface of Mg2Ni particles play a two-fold role: firstly, they hydride-dehydride as hydrogen storage materials themselves; secondly, they provide active sites and pathways for Mg2Ni hydriding-dehydriding. This is supported by analysis of discharge behaviour and electrochemical impedance spectra studies.","Composite; Hydrogen storage alloy; Mg-Ni; Negative electrode; Secondary battery; Ti-Ni","Alkaline solution; Composite alloys; Discharge capacity; Electrochemical impedance spectra; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hydride dehydride; Magnesium nickel; Particle inlaying method; Titanium nickel; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Hydrogen; Magnesium alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Sintering; Storage (materials); Surface treatment; Synthesis (chemical); Temperature; Titanium alloys; X ray diffraction; Metallic matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030191010

Mechanical dryers can provide high quality products with minimum losses but they require sources of electrical or chemical energy, which, in the case of Ghana, are costly or scarce. This makes the development of an effective natural convection solar dryer an attractive alternative. A mixed-mode natural convection solar crop-dryer (a dryer in which the crop is dried by a combination of the direct absorption of solar radiation and by natural convection where air, heated by solar energy, is passed over the crop) has been designed. Two commercial dryers, based on this design and capable of handling between 1,000 and 1,500 kg of various agricultural products (such as cassava, pepper, maize, okra, etc.) have been constructed and partially tested at Agona-Asafo in the central region of Ghana.

Design: Six men each spent 24h in a whole-body indirect calorimeter on three separate occasions during which they received breakfasts designed to match 75% of BMR and that comprised, on average 3.1 MJ of protein (HP), carbohydrate (HC) or fat (HF), respectively, the remainder being split between the other two macronutrients. Every item of the ad libitum diet comprised 13% protein, 40% fat and 47% carbohydrate by energy, with an energy density of 550 kJ/100 g. Results: Subjectively-rated pleasantness did not differ between the breakfasts, or any of the subsequent ad libitum meals. Subjective hunger was significantly greater during the hours between breakfast and lunch after the HF (26) treatment relative to the HP (18) or HC (18mm) meals (P < 0.001), although the HP treatment suppressed hunger to a greater extent than the other two treatments over 24h. However, mean ad libitum lunch intakes were similar at 5.38, 5.30 and 5.18 MJ (NS) on the HP, HC and HF treatments, respectively. After-lunch intakes were also very similar at 6.14, 6.18 and 5.83 MJ (NS). Mean 24-h energy expenditure amounted to 11.12, 11.14 and 10.93 MJ, respectively, producing energy balances of 5.71, 5.83 and 5.04 MJ (NS), respectively. The HP, HF and HC breakfasts led to enhanced P, F and C oxidation, respectively (P < 0.003). Conclusions: Large HP, HC or HF breakfasts led to detectable changes in hunger that were not of sufficient magnitude to influence lunch-time intake 5 h later, or EI for the rest of the day. A single positive balance of each macronutrient can be buffered by oxidation and storage capacity, without leading to changes in meal-to-meal EI, when subjects feed ad libitum on unfamiliar diets of fixed composition.","Appetite; Carbohydrate; Energy; Fat; Food intake; Humans; Macronutrients; Protein","adult; appetite; article; caloric intake; calorimeter; carbohydrate intake; controlled study; energy balance; fat intake; food intake; human; human experiment; hunger; male; normal human; nutrient; oxidation; protein intake; rating scale; test meal; Adult; Appetite; Calorimetry, Indirect; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Hunger; Male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030016894

However, little is known about how iron level is controlled in the nucleus. Nuclei of rat liver take up iron from ferric citrate by a process that is dependent on ATP. This system shares several properties with known P-type ATPases, suggesting that a P-type ATPase in the nuclear membrane is responsible for iron transport. (i) Adenosine 5'-(β,γ-iminodiphosphate), a non- hydrolyzable ATP analogue, does not support iron uptake; (ii) the uptake is strongly inhibited by vanadate; (iii) there is an absolute requirement for Mg2+; and (iv) reagents that oxidize SH groups inhibit uptake, and this inhibition can be prevented by dithiothreitol. The energy of activation for the uptake (11.5 kcal/mol) and the K(m) for ATP (0.4 mM) are similar to values for other known cation transport ATPases. Inhibitors of Na+,K+- ATPase, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, proton V-ATPase, and nuclear Ca2+-ATPase have no effect on uptake. Ferric citrate can be replaced by Fe- ATP as a source of iron for the transport system; however, two other stronger iron chelators, Tiron and desferrioxamine, completely inhibit the uptake. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that an Fe-ATPase, distinct from other known P-type ATPases, is responsible for iron transport in the nucleus.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; animal tissue; article; enzyme activity; intracellular transport; iron kinetics; iron storage; iron transport; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cell Nucleus; Ferric Compounds; Ion Transport; Iron; Kinetics; Liver; Magnesium; Male; Metals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Thermodynamics; Animalia; Tiron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029884298

The vacuum chambers (the targets for beam losses) of the LER (Low Energy Ring) and the HER were 1-cm-thick aluminum and 0.5-cm-thick copper, respectively.

The response of the system is described in terms of ""wave components"", each associated with a unique trace wavenumber along the coupling. An ensemble of plate systems is defined, and analytical expressions are found for the ensemble average input and coupling powers which result from ""rain-on-the-roof"" excitation of one of the plates. Two parameters which quantify the strength of coupling between plates are found, and four distinct regimes of wave component energy flow and storage are observed, involving weak and various forms of strong coupling. For the system considered, the plates may be wholly weakly coupled (all wave components are weakly coupled), or the response may involve some mixture of weakly and strongly coupled components. In the case of the latter, the response is normally dominated by the strongly coupled components. The coupling is found to be strong in most systems of practical interest. The traditional SEA hypothesis of proportionality between the coupling power and the difference in subsystem mean modal energies is found to hold for the ensemble average response, for all coupling strengths, but not generally for the responses of individual ensemble member systems. A coupling loss factor is found, defined in terms of the ensemble averaged response. The traditional estimate of coupling loss factor, found by a wave approach in which semi-infinite subsystems and diffuse fields are assumed, is seen generally to be an over-estimate of the true value for the present system, except when the coupling is weak. It is also found that modal overlap, which has been proposed as an indicator of coupling strength and of the accuracy of the traditional coupling loss factor estimate, is inappropriate in this role for the rectangular plate systems considered. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.",,"Acoustic waves; Equations of motion; Mathematical models; Plates (structural components); Statistical methods; Coupling loss factor; Edge coupled rectangular plates; Statistical energy analysis; Trace wavenumber; Vibrations (mechanical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030168603

Stabilization at room temperature is of paticular interest for potential light energy storage systems. Paramagnetic Ru(bpy)33+ is characterized by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The Ru(bpy)33+ yield formed by chlorine gas oxidation can be controlled by the silica gel pore size and decreases with increasing pore size. The Ru(bpy)33+ yield is 1 order of magnitude smaller in 14.0 nm pore silica gel compared to 2.5 nm pore silica gel. The Ru(bpy)33+ yield gradually decreases by preheating the silica gel to higher temperatures before impregnation with Ru(bpy)32+.

Therefore, we also investigated the efficacy of using HTK solution with NCR following 12-hr preservation. Hearts isolated from male Wistar rats were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus to estimate baseline aortic flow (AF), coronary flow (CF), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), systolic pressure (SP), aortic mean pressure, and the rate-pressure product (RPP). The hearts were divided into four groups: group 1, 8-hr storage in UW solution; groups 2 and 3, 8- or 12-hr storage in HTK solution, respectively; and group 4, 12-hr storage in HTK solution with NCR. They were arrested and stored at 4°C in each preservation solution. Following storage, they were reperfused and postpreservative function was measured to assess cardiac functional recovery. Concentrations of creatine phosphokinase, troponin. T, and lactate in the coronary perfusate were measured. Frozen tissue samples from groups 3 and 4 were analyzed for adenylate content and cGMP. The myocardial water content was also measured. The recovery of AF, CF, CO, SP, and RPP in group 2 was significantly improved compared with that in group 1 (P<0.05).

Of all methods and basis sets tested, the three-parameter hybrid Hartree-Fock/density-functional B3LYP method combined with the 6-311G(3d,p) basis set is most accurate for p-benzoquinone and yields an electron affinity of 1.85 eV compared to the experimental value of 1.91 ± 0.06 eV. The same method also gives calculated adiabatic electron affinities within 0.11 eV of experiment for 11 other methyl-, chloro-, and fluoro-p-benzoquinones, predicts an electron affinity of 1.74 eV for 2,3-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, and verifies electron affinities for chloro- and 2,3-dichloro-p-benzoquinone previously estimated from charge transfer spectra. Thus, the B3LYP method shows promise as an accurate, economical alternative to highly sophisticated MO methods for calculating electron affinities of large, polyatomic molecules. © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748566013

We have identified and characterized IREs in the mRNAs for two different mitochondrial citric acid cycle enzymes. Drosophila melanogaster IRP binds to an IRE in the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the iron-sulfur protein (Ip) subunit of saccinate dehydrogenase (SDH). This interaction is developmentally regulated during Drosophila embryogenesis. In a cell-free translation system, recombinant IRP-1 imposes highly specific translational repression on a reporter mRNA bearing the SDH IRE, and the translation of SDH-Ip mRNA is iron regulated in D. melanogaster Schneider cells. In mammals, an IRE was identified in the 5' untranslated regions of mitochondrial aconitase mRNAs from two species. Recombinant IRP-1 represses aconitase synthesis with similar efficiency as ferritin IRE-controlled translation. The interaction between mammalian IRPs and the aconitase IRE is regulated by iron, nitric oxide, and oxidative stress (H2O2), indicating that these three signals can control the expression of mitochondrial aconitase mRNA. Our results identify a regulatory link between energy and iron metabolism in vertebrates and invertebrates, and suggest biological functions for the IRE/IRP regulatory system in addition to the maintenance of iron homeostasis.","aconitase; energy metabolism; iron regulatory protein; oxidative stress; succinate dehydrogenase","aconitate hydratase; ferritin; hydrogen peroxide; iron; iron regulatory factor; iron sulfur protein; nitric oxide; succinate dehydrogenase; animal cell; article; cell free system; citric acid cycle; drosophila melanogaster; gene control; gene repression; iron responsive element; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; rna translation; Aconitate Hydratase; Animals; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Cattle; Citric Acid Cycle; Conserved Sequence; DNA, Complementary; Drosophila melanogaster; Humans; Iron; Iron Regulatory Protein 1; Iron-Regulatory Proteins; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029899154

T6G 2P5, Canada","Respiration of 18-month-old Solanum tuberosum L. tubers was about 53% greater than that of 6-month old tubers during sprouting at 23°C; yet, a significant loss of sprout vigor in the older tubers was apparent. Involvement of alternative oxidase (AO) in the age-induced difference in tuber respiration was assessed. AO was only detected in immunoblots if tissue disks from tubers were pre-incubated for 24 h prior to isolation of submitochondrial membrane particles (SMPs). No AO was detected in SMPs from nonincubated tuber tissue of either age, indicating that it was not contributing to tuber respiration during sprouting as previously thought. Respiratory control and ADP/O ratios indicated that oxidative phosphorylation was fully coupled to electron transport in mitochondria isolated from 6- and 18-month-old tubers. Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) activities of intact mitochondria were also not affected by tuber age. The difference in respiration during sprouting was unique to whole tubers, as oxygen consumption by mitochondria from young and old tubers was equal on a milligram protein basis. Sprouting 18-month-old tubers had 15% more mitochondrial protein per gram fresh weight than did 6-month-old tubers. Older tubers also produced more ATP than younger tubers prior to and during sprouting, through a fully coupled, Cyt-mediated respiratory pathway, reduced sprout vigor notwithstanding. From 5 to 10 days of sprouting, coinciding with development of the age-induced difference in whole-tuber respiration, ATP concentration in 18-month-old tubers increased to become 52% higher than that in 6-month-old tubers. ATP synthase (EC 3.6.1.34), assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots of β- and oligomycin-sensitivity conferring protein-subunits, also increased as a proportion of SMP protein in older tubers during this period. Relative to 6-month-old tubers, the increased respiration and associated oxidative phosphorylation of 18-month-old tubers during sprouting were probably in response to a lower adenylate energy charge (AEC) prior to sprouting (from 0 to 5 days). From 5 to 10 days of sprouting, AEC of 18-month-old tubers increased to equal that of 6-month-old tubers and the two tuber ages maintained the same AEC for the remainder of the 20-day sprouting interval. Higher respiration and lower AEC of older tubers in storage at 4°C, along with the fact that older tubers respired at a higher rate to achieve the same AEC as younger tubers during sprouting, indicate greater utilization of ATP by older tubers.","Adenylate energy charge; aging; potato respiration; Solanum tuberosum; sprouting vigor","Solanum tuberosum; Tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030479732

The gastrocnemius muscle of the hopping mouse (body mass 30.2±2.4 g, mean ± S.D.) and the rat (313±10.7g) were compared with data from the literature for the wallaby and the kangaroo rat to distinguish scaling effects and locomotion-related effects on muscle properties. Contractile length-force properties and series elastic stiffness were measured in situ during maximal tetanic contractions. The rat had a larger muscle-fibre-to-tendon- length ratio. The rat and hopping mouse showed similar normalised length- force characteristics of the gastrocnemius. Normalised stiffness in the hopping mouse was higher. The hopping mouse showed a higher capacity to store elastic energy per unit of contractile work capacity, as well as per unit of body mass. Accounting for body size differences, the rat had a smaller relative muscle mass and thus smaller work capacity than the three hopping animals considered. This is in agreement with a quadrupedal versus bipedal locomotion style. The differences in contractile and elastic properties of the gastrocnemius of the rat and hopping mouse seem to be closely related to locomotion patterns. Small animals seem to be able to utilise the storage and release of elastic energy to a far lesser extent than larger animals. However, even in animals as small as hopping mice, the storage and utilisation of elastic energy during locomotion is of functional significance and probably depends on locomotor behaviour.","elasticity; hopping mouse; Notomys alexis; rat; Rattus norvegicus; skeletal muscle","animal; article; body constitution; comparative study; Dipodomys; elasticity; gait; histology; locomotion; male; marsupial; muscle contraction; physiology; rat; rodent; skeletal muscle; species difference; Animals; Body Constitution; Dipodomys; Elasticity; Gait; Locomotion; Macropodidae; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Rats; Rodentia; Species Specificity; Animalia; Dipodomys; Macropus sp.; Mammalia; Notomys alexis; Rattus norvegicus; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030174902

Within a week prior to running economy assessment, and after 10 min of jogging at 3.13 m·s-1, 19 well-trained male sub-elite distance runners underwent two complete sets of lower limb and trunk flexibility assessments. Runners then completed two 10-min running economy assessment sessions on consecutive days at 4.13 m·s-1 following two 30-min sessions of treadmill accommodation at 4.13 m·s-1. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated that the repeated flexibility measurements were highly reliable (X̄ R = 0.92 ± 0.09), as were the two running economy appraisals (R = 0.99). Correlational analyses revealed that dorsiflexion (r = 0.65) and standing hip rotation (r = 0.53) were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) associated with the mean aerobic demand of running, such that runners who were less flexible on these measures were more economical. Although speculative, these results suggest that inflexibility in certain areas of the musculoskeletal system may enhance running economy in sub-elite male runners by increasing storage and return of elastic energy and minimizing the need for muscle-stabilizing activity.","DORSIFLEXION; STANDING EXTERNAL HIP ROTATION; SUBMAXIMAL AEROBIC DEMAND","adult; article; body movement; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; joint mobility; joint stability; male; muscle function; musculoskeletal system; normal human; reliability; running; treadmill exercise; Adult; Back; Hip Joint; Humans; Leg; Male; Movement; Musculoskeletal Physiology; Oxygen Consumption; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029975171

During one such inspection at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, a human sternum containing a dull metal projectile was uncovered. The projectile was easy to characterize as a bullet that had been deeply embedded in the bone. Less clear, however, were the circumstances detailing how the bullet had become lodged in the sternum, or how long the sternum might have been in storage at the University of Louisville. Radiographs of the sternum revealed a halo of surrounding density that dissipated in intensity from the margins of the bullet. Our initial hypothesis was that lead had been leached from the bullet into the bone matrix. To better assess what in fact contributed to this density, the sternum and the bullet were analyzed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to determine their elemental composition. That the bullet was composed of lead and aluminum was not surprising, but the extent to which the presence and dissolution of the bullet had affected the composition of the bony sternum was not entirely expected. The contribution of metal ions from the bullet to the inorganic matrix of bone was most notable for aluminum but nearly negligible for lead. This finding confirmed that bone affinity for metals is dependent upon the metal and supports previous reports that have suggested that lead is released from bone as soluble blood product during bony remodeling, whereas aluminum results in a significant elevation of bone density.","Aluminum; Bone; Bullet; Lead","aluminum; lead; aged; article; ballistics; case report; female; gunshot injury; human; human tissue; spectroscopy; sternum; thorax radiography; war; Aluminum; Humans; Lead; Solubility; Spectrum Analysis; Sternum; United States; War; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029923214

Methods: Individual data on body weight, body fat, fat-free-mass (FFM), and basal metabolic rate (BMR), assessed during the control baseline period (i.e. prior to weight loss), at the end of 24 weeks of semi-starvation, and at the end of a 12 week period of restricted refeeding, were used to calculate the following parameters: (i) a quantitative index of energy-partitioning, the P-ratio, defined as the proportion of body energy mobilised as protein during weight loss, or as the proportion of body energy deposited as protein during weight recovery, (ii) a quantitative index of changes in thermogenesis, defined as the change in BMR adjusted for FFM (or for both FFM and fat mass) and (iii) the degree of replenishment of fat and FFM compartments, defined as the recovery of body fat and FFM (during refeeding) as a percentage of that lost during semi-starvation. Results: This re-analysis indicates the following: (i) a large inter-individual variability in P-ratio during both weight loss and weight recovery, but for a given individual, the P-ratio during refeeding is strongly correlated with the P-ratio during semi-starvation, (ii) body composition during the control period is the most important predictor of variability in P-ratio, such that the higher the initial % body fat, the lower the proportion of energy mobilised as protein, and hence the greater the propensity to mobilise fat during semi-starvation and to subsequently deposit fat during refeeding and (iii) at week 12 of refeeding, the change in adjusted BMR is found to be reduced by a magnitude which is inversely proportional to the degree of fat recovery, but is unrelated to the degree of FFM recovery. A quantitative relationship is derived between the P-ratio during refeeding, the % fat recovery, and the P-ratio during semi-starvation. Conclusions: Evidence is presented here suggesting that (i) human variability in the pattern of lean and fat tissue deposition during weight recovery is to a large extent determined by individual variations in the control of energy-partitioning, for which the initial % body fat is the most important predictor and (ii) the disproportionate gain in fat relative to lean tissue during weight recovery is contributed by a reduction in thermogenesis (i.e. increased efficiency of food utilization) for accelerating specifically the replenishment of the fat stores. These control systems, operating via energy-partitioning and thermogenesis, have been integrated into a compartmental model for the regulation of body composition during underfeeding/refeeding, and can be used to explain the individual pattern of lean and fat tissue deposition during weight recovery in situations ranging from the rehabilitation after malnutrition to the relapse of obesity.","Body composition; Energy balance; Energy-partitioning; Malnutrition; Obesity; Protein metabolism; Thermogenesis","protein; adipose tissue; adult; article; autoregulation; basal metabolic rate; body composition; body fat; body weight; controlled study; energy balance; human; human experiment; lipid storage; male; malnutrition; normal human; obesity; priority journal; protein metabolism; refeeding; starvation; thermogenesis; weight gain; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Basal Metabolism; Body Composition; Body Temperature Regulation; Energy Metabolism; Food; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Mathematics; Minnesota; Starvation; Weight Gain; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030005010

A large endothermic peak is observed before the melting peak of β-Sn during the first heating. This peak is characterized by an enthalpy almost double the melting enthalpy of β-Sn. It is demonstrated that the existence of this maximum is to be attributed to a monotropic solid-solid transition of the initial metastable structure of tin in β-Sn. It is found that the temperature of transition depends strongly on the heating rate whereas the position of the melting peak of β-Sn is unchanged. The determined activation energy of the solid-solid transition is E = 200 kJ mol-1. The first grown metastable modification remains practically unchanged even after three years of storage.

The rise in VLDL levels may be caused by increased hepatic secretion of this lipoprotein fraction and reduced conversion of VLDL to LDL caused by cachexia-inducing proteins. The hypocholesterolemia is probably related to lowered LDL and HDL cholesterol levels that depend on a greater utilization of cholesterol for the biogenesis of new membranes and the accumulation of cholesteryl ester in tumoral tissue. The involvement of neutral lipids in cancer development is further evidenced by the occurrence of certain tumors following the intake of high-fat diets. Furthermore, epidemiological and experimental studies showed that hypercaloric diets rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6, PUFA) stimulated tumorigenesis, while diets rich in marine fats (n-3, PUFA) inhibited it.

They may contain extremely high concentrations of both adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (each &gt; 10 μmol/ml of cell vol.), whereas the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content is comparatively low (0.8 μmol/ml cell vol.). 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of living eleocytes suggest the compartmentalization of both AMP and ADP in the large acidic vacuole characteristic for this cell type. Eleocytes are thus capable of storing high concentrations of ADP and AMP without inhibiting energy metabolism, by sequestering these compounds in a separate compartment. The high concentrations of both AMP and ADP in the eleocytes decrease in both males and females during the course of maturation. In eleocytes of male animals, the decline of the high nucleotide concentrations was accompanied by a transient increase of two intracellular nucleosides, inosine and guanosine. This suggests the degradation and further metabolism of nucleotides to the corresponding nucleosides. In culture, eleocytes release both inosine and guanosine into the medium. Both nucleosides are also present in the coelomic fluid, the common compartment for both eleocytes and germ cells. Both male and female germ cells incorporate 14C-labelled inosine and guanosine in culture. For oocytes, the further incorporation of [14C]inosine into the RNA fraction could be demonstrated. The large adenylate pools in the eleocytes may be regarded as a store for purine compounds for later use by the growing germ cells to supplement nucleic acid synthesis. The supply of nucleic acid precursors seems to be another specific function of eleocytes related to gametogenesis, in addition to their known synthesis of vitellogenin.","Adenylates; ADP; AMP; Coelomic cells; Eleocytes; Inosine; Polychaete","adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; carbon 14; guanosine; inosine; nucleoside; nucleotide; animal cell; annelid worm; cell vacuole; controlled study; development; energy metabolism; female; germ cell; male; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; polychaeta; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030012422

Spermatozoa of four species with different reproductive modes are introduced and the first results are presented: Spermatozoa of the marine worm Arenicola marina are well adapted to external fertilization in sea water with fluctuating oxygen tension: they are motile for several hours in oxygen-free sea water, even when the ATP level is dramatically reduced. Anaerobic ATP production occurs by alanine, acetate and propionate fermentation probably by the same pathways known from somatic cells of this species. Under aerobic conditions the phosphagen system might function like a shuttle for energy-rich phosphate from mitochondria to the dynein-ATPases. Storage of turkey and carp spermatozoa for several hours without exogenous substrates and oxygen results in the degradation of phosphocreatine and ATP to inorganic phosphate and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), respectively. Despite low energy charges, stored spermatozoa of both species are capable of progressive movements. In carp spermatozoa fatigue of motility is not accompanied by the dramatic acidosis one discusses as an important effect in muscle fatigue. Energy metabolism of boar spermatozoa is typically based on glycolysis consuming extracellular carbohydrates and producing lactate and protons. The sperm seem to tolerate low intracellular pH (< 6.5). The lack of a phosphagen system (no energy shuttle from mitochondria to the distal dynein-ATPases) is probably compensated by a high glycolytic ATP-production in the mitochondria-free piece of the flagellum.","ATP-homeostasis; NMR-spectroscopy; Phosphagen function; Sperm motility; Spermatozoa","adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; carbohydrate; glycolytic enzyme; sea water; acidosis; animal cell; carp; cell function; cell ph; cytoplasm; energy metabolism; fatigue; fermentation; fertilization; glycolysis; male; metabolic inhibition; metabolic regulation; mitochondrion; nonhuman; review; spermatozoon; spermatozoon tail; swine; turkey (bird); worm; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Annelida; Carps; Energy Metabolism; Glycolysis; Homeostasis; Male; Mammals; Microscopy, Electron; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Models, Biological; Species Specificity; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Swine; Turkeys",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029892713

The methanol yield of the synthesis is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the temperatures required by state-of-the-art catalysts.

A perfluorinated cation exchange material (Nafion®, DuPont) is evaluated for use as a vapour permeation membrane at temperatures up to 200°C. The permselectivities for methanol and water with respect to hydrogen depend on the counter ion in the polymer, and drop as a function of temperature. With respect to long term stability and performance, lithium is best suited as a counter ion, with permselectivities of 32 for water, and 5.6 for methanol, respectively. Permeability and permselectivity are found to increase with increasing partial pressures of both methanol and water vapours. The capability of the Li-Nafion membrane to separate products from a commercially available catalyst bed operating on CO2 and H2 at 200°C is demonstrated using a simple tubular membrane reactor module.","Membrane reactor; Methanol synthesis; Perfluorinated cation exchange membrane; Permselectivity; Sorption; Vapour permeation","carbon dioxide; hydrogen; lithium; methanol; water; article; cation exchange; membrane permeability; membrane reactor; pressure; priority journal; synthesis; water vapor; Cation Exchange; Membranes; Methanol; Reactors; Synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029657128

A wafer with [111]Si orientation and a wafer with [110]Si orientation are studied. The high degree of preferred orientation of the TaSi2 rods relative to the Si matrix is examined using synchrotron Laue patterns, and the 100TaSi2, 003TaSi2, 101TaSi2, and 102TaSi2 reflections are used to establish the orientation relationship and to determine that the spread of rod orientations is at least 5° and probably no greater than 6°. Double-axis diffractometry with Cu Kα radiation reveals matrix reflections with rocking curve widths that are about 20 times broader than those from perfect Si and with peak reflectivities approaching 20%. The rocking curves widths are found to be relatively insensitive to irradiated area, thus indicating that most of the observed width is not due to long-range bending. Triple-axis diffractometry with Cu Kα radiation reveals that considerable compressive strain exists in the matrix and that much of the width of the diffraction peak is due to mosaicity. The performance of the [111]Si TaSi2-Si wafer and a perfect [111] Si wafer as monochromators for microradiography are compared, and a gain of an order of magnitude in x-ray intensity delivered to the sample is demonstrated with the composite crystal. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005918551

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra contain two closely spaced luminescence bands. The energy difference between them ∼0.15-0.2 eV depends very slightly on their spectral position. The ratio of the intensities of the two PL bands is monotonously changing with the changes in sample porosity. Thus, in very porous samples only the short-wavelength band is usually observed, while in slightly porous samples only the long-wavelength band is observed. Interaction of PS samples with water at first produces a small decrease of PL band intensities, and then a new band in the range of 0.7 μm appears, which is presumably related to an oxide layer at the surface of PS nanocrystallites. After treating PS in alcohols, the initial band intensity drops and the long-wavelength band disappears completely in less than 1 min. It is discovered that the presence of water contained in the ethanol (even at a content of ∼1%), leads to emergence of a new intensive PL band in the range of 0.7 μm. In very porous samples or after washing or storage of as-anodized PS in water or alcohols, the long-wavelength band is rarely observed experimentally because its intensity is very small. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000695159

This study reports on the seasonal lipid dynamics of E. superba (25 to 56 mm) collected in the Weddell Sea in late winter/spring, summer, autumn and mid-winter. Total lipid data provide evidence of large seasonal accumulation of reserve lipids in austral summer with a mean lipid content of 28.2% of dry mass and particularly in autumn, when mean lipid levels peak with 39.2% of dry mass. After the overwintering period mean lipid contents decrease to a minimum of 10.5% of dry mass, indicating extensive utilisation of lipid reserves during winter. These data suggest that lipids contribute significantly to the overwintering success of this extremely versatile species. Lipid class analyses of spring and summer specimens (10 to 56 mm) from the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea revealed that not only triacylglycerol, but also phosphatidylcholine may serve as important storage lipids of E. superba In the other dominant Antarctic krill species, E. crystallorophias (10 to 40 mm) and Thysanoessa macrura (10 to 27 mm), wax esters are the primary depot lipid, but phosphatidylcholine also functions as a storage lipid in these species.

Methods: In situ initial flush for cooling and coronary vascular washout was performed with a University of Wisconsin solution. The heart was then removed and immersed into a cold (4° C) University of Wisconsin solution. After 12-hour cold storage, 1-hour preservation was added by coronary perfusion using a 4° C oxygenated University of Wisconsin solution. High-energy phosphate (phosphocreatine, β-adenosine triphosphate) and inorganic phosphate were measured by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 0-hour cold storage, 12-hour cold storage, and immediately after coronary perfusion. Results: Phosphocreatine and β-adenosine triphosphate decreased to 12.1% ± 24.2% (mean ± standard deviation), 37.4% ± 25.0%, respectively, after 12- hour cold storage, and significantly increased to 94.0% ± 48.7% (p &lt; 0.001), 48.8% ± 25.8% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively after 1-hour coronary perfusion. Disorder of nuclear arrangement and edema of muscular cells, which were observed after cold storage, were histologically restored after 1-hour coronary perfusion. After transplantation of preserved grafts, left ventricular pressure and left ventricular rate of pressure rise were evaluated in the graft with 12-hour cold storage only (group A) and in the graft with 12-hour cold storage and 1-hour coronary perfusion (group B). Left ventricular pressure 2 hours after transplantation in group B recovered to 76.1% significantly (p &lt; 0.01), compared with 51.9% in group A. Significantly higher values of left ventricular rate of pressure rise 2 hours after transplantation was observed in group B (83.0% ± 12.7%) compared with group A (68.2% ± 12.5%). Conclusions: These results indicate that the combined method of cold storage and coronary perfusion may be effective for myocardial protection during long-term preservation.",,"adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; phosphate; university of wisconsin solution; animal experiment; article; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; cryopreservation; dog; edema; heart preservation; heart protection; heart transplantation; nonhuman; organ donor; priority journal; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animals; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cryopreservation; Dogs; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione; Heart Transplantation; Insulin; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Phosphates; Raffinose; Time Factors; Tissue and Organ Procurement; Tissue Survival",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029990039

DESIGN: Clinical dietary intervention study (1.67 MJ (400 kcal)/day) until weight loss of &gt;10%, SUBJECTS : 11 (seven male, four female) non-diabetic, obese subjects (age: 27-62 y; BMI: 40.5 ± 1.4 kg/m2). MEASUREMENTS: Whole body glucose disposal (by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), respiratory quotient (RQ), resting energy expenditure (REE), glucose and lipid oxidation (by indirect: calorimetry), insulin-stimulated PDHC and GS activity (in muscle biopsies) both before and immediately after VLCD (i.e. while still in a hypocaloric state), serum hormone and metabolite levels throughout the dietary period. RESULTS: Weight loss was accompanied by reduced insulin and elevated NEFA levels, improved insulin sensitivity due to increased nonoxidative glycolysis with no increase in PDHC or GS activities. The rate of weight loss was inversely related to the initial RQ, PDHCa was strongly age-related. CONCLUSION: A low RQ may be used as a predictor of the efficacy of VLCD treatment and that while VLCD improves nonoxidative glycolytic flux, changes in oxidative glucose disposal and muscle glucose storage are prevented by high NEFA availability during this catabolic phase of dietary intervention.","Glycogen synthase; Insulin resistance; Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; Respiratory quotient; Very low calorie diet","fatty acid; glucose; glycogen synthase; insulin; pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; adult; article; clinical article; energy expenditure; female; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; human; human tissue; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; low calory diet; male; muscle biopsy; obesity; priority journal; respiratory quotient; weight reduction; Adult; Anthropometry; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; C-Peptide; Diet, Reducing; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glycogen Synthase; Humans; Insulin; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Muscles; Obesity; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029873010

Salmonella typhimurium nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase, EC 2.4.2.11) couples net ATP hydrolysis to formation of NAMN and PP(i) from α- PRPP and nicotinic acid [Vinitsky, A., and Grubmeyer, C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26004-26010]. In the current work, we have determined that the enzyme reacts with ATP to produce a covalently phosphorylated form of the enzyme (E-P), which is common to both the ATPase and NAMN synthesis functions of NAPRTase. We have isolated E-P and verified its catalytic competence. E-P showed acid lability and base stability, diagnostic of a phosphoramidate linkage. Pyridine and hydroxylamine-catalyzed hydrolysis of E-P gave second- order rate constants consistent with published values for phosphohistidine. Two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography of alkaline-hydrolyzed E-32P showed that the phosphorylated residue co-migrated with authentic 1- phosphohistidine. Chymotrypsin and trypsin proteolysis followed by HPLC and peptide sequencing localized the phosphopeptide to Ala-210 to Phe-222 of the 399-residue protein. This peptide contains a single histidine residue, His- 219. NAPRTase phosphorylated at His-219 is an intermediate in the energy transduction mechanism of NAPRTase.",,"nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase; amino acid sequence; article; energy transfer; enzyme activity; enzyme isolation; enzyme phosphorylation; nonhuman; priority journal; salmonella typhimurium; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Adenosine Triphosphate; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Binding Sites; Cattle; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Enzyme Stability; Histidine; Humans; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Pentosyltransferases; Peptide Fragments; Phosphates; Phosphorus Radioisotopes; Phosphorylation; Salmonella typhimurium; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029975136

The juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mouse, an animal model of systemic carnitine deficiency, inherits the JVS phenotype in autosomal recessive fashion, through a mutant allele mapped to mouse chromosome 11. As a step toward identifying the gene responsible for JVS by positional cloning, we attempted to refine the jvs locus in the mouse by detailed linkage analysis with 13 microsatellite markers, using 190 backcross progeny. Among the 13 loci tested, 5 (defined by markers D11Mit24, D11Mit111, D11Nds9, D11Mit86, and D11Mit23) showed no recombination, with a maximum lod score of 52.38.

The write operation of a submicron memory cell element has been studied by a micromagnetic computation based on an energy minimization scheme, which aids in the chip design. The magnetization of the binary bit states in the element was found to take a single domain structure having the opposite direction of the long-axis component. The mean long-axis component of magnetization of each binary state was ±0.97 without external fields. The selective switching of the bit state in the element was performed by the write currents applied into the two level conductors overlying the element for various conditions. The influence of the write currents to the neighboring element on a two-dimensional memory array with a 1×1 μm pitch was also simulated, in order to confirm the selective switching of the memory element. It was found that the selective write current amplitude decreased with an increasing assist current amplitude and the range was extended by the large difference of the transverse magnetic field between the selected and neighboring element.

Net fat utilisation was not significantly depressed (4009 ± 366 to 3613 ± 191 kJ/d, NS), and the proportion of energy derived from fat was unchanged at 48.0% before weight loss and 49.0% after weight loss. CONCLUSION: The well-recognised phenomenon of reduced energy expenditure is unlikely to be a major cause of weight regain. The results do not support the theory that altered fuel selection in post-obese subjects may be the cause of difficulty in maintaining weight loss.","13C-labelled glucose; Energy expenditure; Fat utilisation; Obesity; Weight loss; Weight regain; Whole-body calorimetry","carbon 13; glucose; adaptation; adipose tissue; adult; article; calorimetry; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; human; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; obesity; priority journal; rebound; weight reduction; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Calorimetry, Indirect; Diet, Reducing; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030008033

The thermally-induced conversion of a water-soluble chitosonium acetate in film form into a water-insoluble chitin film was examined by thermal analysis (DMTA, TGA, DSC, and TMA) and by solid state 12C-NMR spectroscopy. Results indicate that tan δ-transitions occur at increasingly high temperatures, and over progressively wider temperature ranges, as the transformation progress. Likewise, the storage modulus, log E′, increases as the chitosonium acetate film undergoes ""cute"" and converts to chitin. Cute kinetic parameters are obtained using the model proposed by Provder et al. modified for glass transition temperature (Tg).

For a large number of big storehouses, the bulk of potatoes is air-conditioned simply by ventilation with outdoor air, without any additional equipment for cooling or heating (figure 1). Thus, the inside climate is dependent on the mid-European climatic conditions, i.e. on the condition whether the inlet air temperature and humidity are suitable for ventilation. The mathematical modelling allows us to describe the heat and mass transfer processes and to investigate the behaviour of the potato bulk under varying conditions, with the aim of developing a control algorithm to optimize the climate inside the storehouse. To simulate ventilation control algorithms, the mathematical model is included in the closed control loop. The rules, reflecting the appropiate conditions and environmental constraints, are implemented in the control algorithm by using fuzzy-logic methods. The simulation results show that the use of fuzzy logic control algorithms can simplify the implementation of complex storage condition rules and leads forward optimal control to secure high potato quality, to save ventilation energy and costs for storing.",,"Solanum tuberosum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344941723

To evaluate the adequacy of protein intakes now recommended as safe for infants and toddlers. Methods. Subjects were recovering malnourished infants, age 5.3 to 17.9 months, length age (LA) 2.5 to 6.4 months, weight age (WA) 1.5 to 5.2 months, weight/length (W/L) 78% to 100% of National Center for Health Statistics data; and toddlers age 11.4 to 31.6 months, LA 6.1 to 17.9 months, WA 3.9 to 12.0 months, W/L 79% to 99%. Infants were assigned at random to formulas with 5.5%, 6.7%, or 8.0% energy as 60:40 whey:casein protein. The 5.5% was based on FAO-WHO-UNU safe protein and average energy for ages 2.5 to 6.0 months. Toddlers received 4.7% (recommended for 6 to 18 months), 6.4%, or 8.0%. Identical concentrations (weight/kcal) of other nutrients were maintained; intakes were adjusted weekly to reach, in 90 days, the 50th percentile of weight for a LA 3 months greater than the initial one.

Σ FF grew 9.2 ± 4.0, 7.4 ± 4.3, and 6.0 ± 3.8 to 28.9 ± 5.2, 30.5 ± 3.7, and 27.0 ± 2.7 mm; AMA 31%, 33%, and 34% to 1121 ± 115, 1124 ± 110, and 1117 ± 120 mm2; AFA 53%, 44%, and 45% to higher-than-normal 578 ± 106, 636 ± 99, and 569 ± 68 mm2. Cost of maintenance + activity was 70.8 ± 3.8 (SEM) kcal · kg-1 · d-1, that of weight gain 9.7 ± 1.35 kcal/g, with no effect of % protein. Conclusions. Within age groups, there were no significant protein-related differences in growth. In both infants and toddlers, high-energy intakes resulted in mild obesity, with lean body mass still deficient. Protein intakes two SD below the means in the lowest protein/energy cells, 1.5 g · kg-1 · d-1 for infants and 1.1 g · kg-1 · d-1 for toddlers, should still be safe for nearly all children of comparable biological ages.","body composition; energy cost of growth; energy metabolism; infants; protein requirements; toddlers","article; child nutrition; clinical article; female; human; infant; lean body weight; male; nutritional requirement; preschool child; priority journal; protein intake; protein malnutrition; treatment outcome; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Arm; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Caseins; Child Nutrition Physiology; Child, Preschool; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Growth; Humans; Infant; Infant Food; Infant Nutrition Physiology; Male; Milk Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Nutrition Disorders; Nutritional Requirements; Obesity; Regression Analysis; Skinfold Thickness; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030005239

Our hypothesis was that repeated fasting-refeeding or weight-cycling would increase the β-oxidation of Linoleate and α-linolenate thereby depleting their whole-body levels. In rats consuming 3% energy as linoleate and 0.15% energy as α-linolenate during a 16 d balance period, 19% of the linoleate consumed accumulated in weight-cycled rats compared with 34% in the free-fed controls (P &lt; 0.01). Similarly, 11% of the α-linolenate consumed accumulated in the weight-cycled rats compared with 22% in the controls (P &lt; 0.01). Arachidonate and docosahexaenoate also accumulated to lower extents in the weight-cycled rats than in the controls. In contrast, whole-body accumulation of palmitate, stearate and oleate was not different between the weight-cycled group and the controls when measured as a proportion of intake or relative to weight gain. Thus whole-body depletion of linoleate and α-linolenate did not occur per se but the partitioning of linoleate and α-linolenate was significantly altered by weight-cycling resulting in lower whole-body accumulation and higher apparent oxidation of all polyunsaturates especially linoleate and α-linolenate.","α-linolenate; β-oxidation; Linoleate; Refeeding","arachidonic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; linoleic acid; oleic acid; palmitic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; stearic acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body weight; diet restriction; fatty acid oxidation; lipid composition; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; rat; refeeding; alpha-Linolenic Acid; Animals; Body Composition; Fasting; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Food; Linoleic Acid; Linoleic Acids; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029897828

Thus, MCT are currently used in clinical nutrition as energy-yielding substrates, and have been advocated for three decades as a useful mean for body weight reduction. This review encompasses most aspects of MCT metabolism arguing this slimming hypothesis pro and con. Findings in support of the opinion (lower energy density, control of satiety, rapid intrahepatic delivery and oxidation rates, poor adipose tissue incorporation) may be invalidated by counteracting data (stimulation of insulin secretion and of anabolic-related processes, increased de novo fatty acid synthesis, induced hypertriglyceridemia). The balance between these two opposing influences depends on the composition (energy intake, nature of ingredients, MCT/LCT ratio, octanoate/decanoate ratio) and duration of the regimen. Due to the high energy level (around 50%) of MCT necessary to achieve body weight loss, long-term compliance to such slimming regimens is unlikely in human nutrition.","absorption; dietary fats; digestion; long chain triglycerides; obesity prevention/treatment; oxidation; storage; transport","long chain triacylglycerol; medium chain fatty acid; medium chain triacylglycerol; bioavailability; body fat; body weight; caloric intake; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; energy balance; fat intake; human; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; review; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Weight; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Liver; Obesity; Tissue Distribution; Triglycerides; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029875339

The effectiveness of a new system for regeneration of the working mixture of gases was demonstrated: this mixture did not require cryogenic apparatus and was capable of maintaining the required concentration of HCl molecules. The system also prevented the appearance of fine particles and of a number of undesirable molecular impurities.

In response to extracellular stimuli cytosolic calcium concentration increases. The increase is composed of two distinct phases. Firstly, calcium is released from intracellular stores via IP3. In the second phase calcium influx across the cell membrane is mostly responsible for the sustained rise in intracellular calcium concentration. This phase of the peak increase in cytosolic calcium is a prerequisite for sustained activation of the cell and the processes of vascular smooth muscle contraction and the activation of nuclear transcription factors for protein biosynthesis. Under ischemic conditions the regulatory systems which control the intracellular free calcium concentration consume a major portion of the cell's physiological energy supply (90%) and a decreased oxygen supply under ischemic conditions rapidly reduces the cell's capacity for intracellular calcium storage or outward transport across its membrane. Calcium antagonist drugs principally act on L-type calcium channels to reduce the influx of calcium into the the cells of the body. Since calcium antagonist drugs are able to influence a wide range of cellular processes which have been implicated in atherosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy and insulin resistance there are strong grounds for their use in a range of clinical disease states.","Calcium; Cardiovascular disease","calcium; calcium antagonist; calcium channel; calcium ion; transcription factor; cardiovascular disease; human; physiology; review; atherosclerosis; calcium cell level; calcium transport; cardiovascular system; cell membrane transport; endothelium cell; energy resource; glomerulosclerosis; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; insulin resistance; ischemia; macrophage; monocyte; oxygen supply; pathogenesis; protein synthesis; smooth muscle contraction; smooth muscle fiber; thrombocyte; vascular endothelium; vascular smooth muscle; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030091975

All cultivations were carried out using a chemically defined medium with glucose as the growth limiting component. Biomass was harvested at steady state and analyzed for proteins, lipids, RNA, DNA, and carbohydrates, Carbohydrates present in the cell wall, i.e., glucans and chitin, and carbohydrates serving as storage materials, i.e., glycogen, were measured. It was observed that the levels of DNA and lipids are relative constant, whereas the proteins and stable RNA levels increase with the specific growth rate and the total amount of carbohydrates decreases with the specific growth rate. Glycogen is only present in small amounts, decreasing with the specific growth rate. As an average the measured macromolecules account for 77 ± 2% (w/w) of the biomass. On the basis of estimations of the metabolic costs for biosynthesis and polymerization of the different macromolecules the total ATP and NADPH requirements for cell biosynthesis from glucose and inorganic salts, i.e., Y(xATP,growth) and Y(xNADPH), have been quantified. The biosynthesis of 1 g biomass was calculated to require 39.9 mmol of ATP and 7.5 mmol of NADPH when cytosolic acetyl-CoA is formed from citrate by citrate lyase and oxaloacetate is recycled back into the TCA cycle. Other pathways of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis have been considered. The calculations show that the different biosynthetic routes for generating cytosolic acetyl-CoA have a significant influence on the theoretical value of ATP and NADPH requirements for cell biosynthesis. Combining a detailed stoichiometric model for growth and product formation of P. chrysogenum with experimental data on the macromolecular composition of P. chrysogenum and precise measurements of substrate uptake and product formation the intracellular flux distribution was calculated for different cultivation conditions.Continuous cultures of the penicillin producing fungus, Penicillium chrysogenum, are studied with respect to the macromolecular composition of the mycellium.

Carbohydrates present in the cell wall, i.e. glucans and chitin, and carbohydrates serving as storage materials, i.e. glycogen, are measured. It is observed that the level of DNA and lipids are relative constant, whereas the proteins and stable RNA levels increase with the specific growth rate and the total amount of carbohydrates decreases with the specific growth rate. Glycogen is only present in small amounts, decreasing with the specific growth rate. As an average, the measured macromolecules account for 77 ± 2% (w/w) of the biomass.","Continuous cultivation; Energetic requirement; Macromolecular composition; Metabolic flux distribution; Penicillium chrysogenum","Adenosinetriphosphate; Biomass; Biosynthesis; Carbohydrates; DNA; Fungi; Glucose; Growth kinetics; Lipids; Metabolism; Proteins; RNA; Acetyl CoA; Cell wall; Citrate; Citrate igase; Glucans; Glycogen; Oxaloacetate; Penicillium chrysogenum; Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Plant cell culture; adenosine triphosphate; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; article; biosynthesis; controlled study; energy metabolism; fungus culture; fungus growth; nonhuman; Penicillium chrysogenum; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342576227

The Crohn's disease activity index was below 120 in all patients studied, who were treated with a low dose of corticosteroids (0.2-0.3 mg/kg body wt of prednisone). The average weight of Crohn's patients was significantly lower than that of controls (55.70 vs 70.50 kg, P < 0.001) due to both lower fat mass (9.97 vs 18.30 kg, P < 0.001) and lower lean body mass (45.72 vs 52.20 kg, P < 0.02). The average REE was significantly higher in the control group (1785.42 ± 7.503 vs 1559.1 ± 48.39 kcal/day, P < 0.001). However, these differences disappeared when REE was normalized by lean body mass (LBM) (34.49 ± 2.56 vs 34.704 ± 3.75 kcal/kg LBM P = NS). The nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in the patient group (0.823 ± 0.031 vs 0.882 ± 0.012, P < 0.025), indicating an increased lipid oxidation. This increased lipid oxidation might explain the reduced fat stores found in the group of Crohn's patients, suggesting also that a sufficiently lipid-rich diet could be useful in their nutritional management.","Body composition; Crohn's disease; Respiratory quotient; Resting energy expenditure","adult; article; body composition; calorimetry; clinical article; controlled study; crohn disease; energy expenditure; female; human; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; male; priority journal; respiratory quotient; Adult; Body Composition; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Calorimetry, Indirect; Crohn Disease; Electric Impedance; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030019974

We study the role of the binding energy and the end block size (NA) on the fraction of bridging chains. The bridging fraction and the fraction of adsorbing segments both depend explicitly on ∈AS and NA, and not on the product 2∈ASNA (which is the maximum available adsorption energy per chain). The dynamic response of the system to step and sinusoidal shear is examined. For NA = 1, the system essentially behaves as a single Maxwell element. As NA increases, the stress relaxation becomes increasingly nonexponential with a pronounced tail (due to a spectrum of relaxation times associated with the transient bridging).

The Li electrodes were all prepared in situ by shearing the surfaces in the same solutions in which the experiments were performed. The electrolyte systems included propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2Me-THF, and 1,3-dioxolane (DN) as the solvents, LiAsF6, LiClO4, LiBF4, and LiPF6 as the salts, and trace water up to a concentration of 200 ppm. The electrochemical behavior of these systems is controlled by films formed spontaneously on the Li surfaces in solutions through which Li ions migrate under an electrical field, and therefore, Li+ migration in fact determines the interfacial resistance measured. It is assumed that these surface films have a multilayer structure to which a ""Voigt"" type analog of RC circuits in series can be fitted. All the spectra could be modeled by five RC circuits in series (one of which also contains a ""Warburg"" type element). From the R and C values, the thickness and resistivity of the various layers comprising the Li-solution interphase formed in all the above electrolyte systems could be calculated. The above model was examined using four different experimental routes: (1) studying the influence of the solution composition (solvent, salt, and the presence of H2O) and of storage time; (2) studying the effect of temperature; (3) experiments in which the solutions were changed during storage; (4) current passage. The significance of the model was explored by following the changes in parameters such as the layers' resistivity, thickness, and activation energy for Li+ migration as a function of the experimental conditions (e.g. solution composition, storage time, temperature, and current passage). © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0542403426

This enhancement originates mainly from the decrease in beam size in the low-energy region. This effect must indeed be the main reason why the recently developed compact rings can store a large current even though they have a low injection energy. In the typical energy region of compact rings, more positive utilization of this effect could make the damping rate of a lower-energy beam far larger than that of a higher-energy one. Therefore, if we could control the effect of the trapped ions, we might prefer to adopt lower energy in order to inject a large current in a compact ring.",,"Damping; Electromagnetic field effects; Electrons; Ions; Numerical analysis; Particle beam injection; Compact electron storage ring; Landau damping effect; Trapped ions; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030079207

By making the external quality factor of these lines vary as a function of time, the intrinsic efficiency of the system can reach 100%. However, we demonstrate a considerable increase in efficiency even if the change of the quality factor is limited to a single event in time. During this event, the quality factor of the lines changes from one value to another. The difference between these two values is minimized to simplify the realization of the quality factor switch. We present the system optimum parameters for this case. We also show the extension of this system to two events in time, during which the quality factor of the line changes between three predetermined states.

SUBJECTS: Six healthy subjects (three men, three women; age: 24.3 ± 2.3 years; BMI: 21.6 ± 0.8 kg/m2). DESIGN: Each subject absorbed 0.5 g/kg of 13C-enriched fructose and randomly received either a triglyceride-heparin infusion or saline. MEASUREMENTS: Total hepatic glucose output was traced with 6,6-2H2-glucose. Appearance in plasma of glucose synthesized from fructose was calculated from the isotopic enrichment in 13C of plasma glucose. Substrates oxidation was assessed with indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: The triglycerides-heparin infusion increased FFA concentration before fructose as compared to saline (1086 ± 40 vs 451 ± 67 μM; p &lt; 0.001) and lipid oxidation was 15% and 70% increased before and during fructose, respectively as compared to saline. Total hepatic glucose output, plasma appearance of glucose synthesized from fructose and glycaemic response were not affected. Glycogen storage over the first 3 h following fructose was increased (6.2 ± 2.1 g vs 0.3 ± 2.1 g; p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Triglycerides-heparin infusion did not stimulate plasma glucose appearance from fructose.

Previous studies demonstrated that corneas stored in hypertonic media with NaHCO3 remained thin and clear although endothelial degeneration occurred. It is speculated that the degeneration may be due, at least in part, to the instability of NaHCO3 buffer. We investigated whether preservation of the endothelium could be improved if NaHCO3 buffer is replaced by an internal HCO3--generating system. Methods. The study was carried out using 13 donor corneas stored in two different media: Chen Medium (isotonic, without NaHCO3 buffer, with HCO3- generated from oxidation of β-hydroxybutyrate) and Optisol (hypertonic, with NaHCO3 buffer). The study with corneas procured by Venice Eye Bank were paired, and those from Lions Eye Bank of Delaware Valley were not. The corneas had these characteristics: donor age: 47.3 ± 17.7 yr; postmortem time: 6.1±3.5 hr; and storage time: 3.1 ± 0.4 days. The study was monitored in terms of graft clarity and post-operative changes in corneal thickness and endothelial cell density estimated from specular micrographs. Results. Using the corneas stored in the NaHCO3 buffer-free media, the grafts became clear and thin in 1-2 weeks after surgery, with evidence of a well preserved endothelium at the first specular microscopic examination 2-4 months after surgery. Two years after surgery (paired study), endothelial cell density was 57.3 ± 53.8% higher than that grafted with the corneas stored in the media containing NaHCO3 buffer. All the grafts studied remained clear. Conclusions. The study showed that using β-hydroxybutyrate as substrate, the media without NaHCO3 buffer is at least as effective as Optisol for preservation of the endothelium. The findings suggest that HCO3- generated from oxidation of high energy substrate is adequate for corneal storage. More studies are needed to determine whether a NaHCO3-free media may provide a better storage environment for the cornea.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750155314

To investigate optimal conditions for corneal storage, with special reference to cation compositions of media. Methods. 14C-3-O-Methyl glucose uptake, metabolic (MA), and lactate transport (LTA) activities were studied with rabbit corneas in four bathing solutions, pH 7.4: Ca2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered balanced salt solution (PBS), and Tris buffer (10 mM) containing 150 mM NaCl, 150 mM KCl or 250 mM Sucrose. Effects of ionophore-mediated translocation of K+ (valinomycin), K+/H+ (nigericin), Na+ (or a lesser extent, K+) (gramicidin), and H+ (FCCP) were studied. Results. Levels of MA and LTA in sucrose and NaCl media were similar. The levels elevated about 13% in PBS, and were decreased markedly, about 53%, in KCl media. In the presence of valinomycin, glycolysis was enhanced markedly, especially in PBS and in sucrose, accompanying with reduced respiration and increased lactate accumulation (LA) in cells. Similar effects were observed with nigericin in all media except sucrose, and with gramicidin only in PBS. FCCP exhibited similar effects, except causing no LA. In PBS, glucose was taken up by the cornea at a rate of about 2.2 μmol/cm2, leveling off in about 30 min. Addition of ionophores and inhibition of respiration and lactate transport exerted no apparent effects on glucose uptake rates. The presence of ATPase inhibitors blocked only 36% LTA. Conclusions. Previous study showed that LA in the cornea during storage leads to intra-cellular acidity, and results in decreases in MA, and thereby corneal viability. The present study shows that MA and LTA are enhanced when the ratio of Na+/K+ in the media is about 10:1 to 20:1, and Na+/K+ transport is stimulated. The process appears to be independent of ATPase. Stimulated-cation translocation enhances glycolysis and renders energy production inefficient, and therefore is not favorable for corneal storage.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750154801

To test the theory that in the isotonic, energy-rich media capable of internal HCO3- generation, corneal viability can be preserved without NaHCO3 buffer. The theory was tested using donor corneas with extended postmortem and preservation times. Methods. Chen Medium (CM) (isotonic with a built-in HCO3--generation, no NaHCO3 buffer) and Optisol (hypertonic with NaHCO3 buffer) were used to store rabbit and human corneas (24 and 13.9±2.2 hr postmortem, and 5 and 4.36±1.03 days storage times, respectively). Human corneas (donor age: 34.9±15.3 yr) were procured in the US, stored in CM, and grafted in Taiwan (recipient age: 57.6±18.4 yr). The study was monitored in terms of graft clarity, endothelial integrity, and deturgescence function post-operatively. In the in vitro study, human corneas were stored in CM and Optisol for 11 days, and endothelial integrity was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results. The study with rabbits showed that using CM-stored corneas, the graft deturgesced and became clear in about 1 week after surgery, and about 2 weeks for grafts with Optisol-stored corneas. In humans, despite donor corneas had these defects: (in a 0-4 scale) 0.60±0.30 endothelial cell loss, 0.74±0.53 stromal edema, and 1.54±0.76 drying and 0.72±0.70 defect in the epithelium, the grafts of all of 34 patients studied were clear on their first follow-up visits (16.0±14.8 days), and remained clear and thin for the entire study period (15.1±8.1 months). In SEM study, storage of human corneas in CM and Optisol for 11 days resulted in endothelial disruption, indicative of cell degeneration, of about 9% and 42%, respectively. Conclusions. Findings of this study indicate that NaHCO3 buffer-free and isotonicity, with capability to generate HCO3- internally, are an effective condition for corneal storage.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750150568

Such measurements became possible recently by X-ray spectroscopy using highly charged ions stored and cooled in heavy ion storage rings. A better energy resolution of the X-ray detector is most essential in order to improve the experimental accuracy, which is presently about one order of magnitude worse than the theoretical uncertainty. An energy resolution of ΔE = 30-50 eV for Eγ = 50-100 keV, and a photopeak efficiency above 30% may be provided by a low temperature calorimeter. It will be constructed on the basis of already existing arrays of silicon microcalorimeters, but with larger volume and high Z absorbers. Such a detector will allow a more precise determination of the 1s-Lamb shift and for the first time the direct investigation of the 2s-Lamb shift in hydrogen-like heavy ions.

The temperature readout was done with an aluminum transition edge thermometer operated at T ≈ 1.5 K. For 20Ne-ions with an energy of E = 100 MeV/u from the SIS accelerator at GSI Darmstadt the best energy resolution obtained was ΔE/E = 1.9 X 10-3. This value corresponds to the energy spread of the ion beam of the SIS. In a first application of such detectors the excitation of the giant resonance in lead nuclei via the reaction natPb(20Ne, 20Ne′)natPb* was investigated by separating inelastically from elastically scattered 20Ne-ions in the energy spectrum. At a scattering angle ΘLab = 3° the excitation energy and the strength of the giant resonance were found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions.

The present study considers a strategy in which the power dissipation of a device is periodically reduced and increased in order to decrease its peak temperature. A two-dimensional, axisymmetric, chip-on-substrate geometry is assumed with convective cooling on the bottom side. Exact solutions for the steady-periodic and complete transient responses are presented. Peak temperature rise is shown to depend on several geometric, thermal, and electrical parameters. The results indicate that thermal resistance can be minimized with an appropriate choice of substrate thickness.

Photographic permanence is affected by the (1) stability of the material, (2) the photographic processing and (3) the storage conditions. American National Standards on the material and the processing have been published for different types of film and standard test methods have been established for color film. The third feature of photographic permanence is the storage requirements and these have been established for photographic film, prints and plates. Standardization on the permanence of electronic recording materials is more complicated. As with photographic materials, stability is dependent upon (1) the material itself and (2) the storage environment. In addition, retention of the necessary (3) hardware and (4) software is also a prerequisite. American National Standards activity in these areas has been underway for the past six years. A test method for the material which determines the life expectancy of CD-ROMs has been standardized. The problems of determining the expected life of magnetic tape have been more formidable but the critical physical properties have been determined. A specification for the storage environment of magnetic tape has been finalized and one on the storage of optical disks is being worked on.

This study investigates the influence of trees on local-scale surface energy balance fluxes. Simultaneous energy balance observations were conducted using eddy correlation methods for 2 suburban neighborhoods with higher (30 %) and lower (10%) tree and shrub cover, in the San Gabriel Valley of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, California, USA. Data were collected on the materials and morphology of the urban surface through a combination of aerial photo analysis and field surveys and analyzed using a geographic information system. Information on external water use was obtained from questionnaires and the analysis of water use data from bi-monthly bills. In terms of the relative partitioning of energy, the effects of the trees are as expected: at the higher tree coverage neighborhood (HTN) the latent heat flux is increased as a fraction of net all-wave radiation, so too is the storage heat flux, whereas the sensible heat flux is decreased. However, in absolute terms, all fluxes, including the sensible heat flux, are enhanced at the HTN. A combination of lower albedos and lower surface temperatures in the HTN result in reduced loss of solar and longwave radiation respectively. Thus at the HTN there is greater net all-wave radiation, hence a greater amount of energy to be dissipated. Above the canopy, temperatures are slightly greater in the neighborhood with higher tree cover.","Energy balance; GIS; Urban climate; Vegetation; Water use","GIS; sensible heat flux; surface energy balance; urban climate; vegetation; water usage; California; Los Angeles; San Gabriel Valley; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667146

The latter, the so-called metallocene-catalyzed HDPEs, are characterized by their low polydispersity and the total absence of branching. The metallocene-catalyzed materials show a different rheological behavior than commercial polyethylenes, which can be summarized as follows: (a) Higher viscosities than conventional HDPEs of the same molecular weight. The dependence of the viscosity on the molecular weight follows a power law equation with an exponent of 4.2 for metallocene catalyzed and 3.6 for conventionals. (b) For high molecular weight materials, the storage modulus overcomes the loss modulus (G′ &gt; G″) at 190 °C in all frequency ranges. However, for conventional HDPEs, G″ &gt; G′ at the same temperature and frequency range, (c) At long relaxation times, the values of H(τ) spectra of metallocene-catalyzed samples are significantly higher than those which correspond to a conventional sample of practically the same molecular weight, (d) Metallocene-catalyzed HDPEs are difficult to process, as sharkskin and slip-stick effects take place at very low shear rates. The onset of sharskin takes place at σc1 = 0.18 MPa, and the slip-stick regime occurs at σc2 = 0.25 MPa, independently of temperature. The values of the plateau modulus, GN° = 1.6 × 106 Pa, and the corresponding molecular weight between entanglements, Me = 1830, found for the metallocene-catalyzed materials, are very similar to those found for conventional polyethylenes. However, the activation energies of flow of the new polymers (7-9 kcal/ mol) are slightly higher than those of conventional HDPEs.",,"Activation energy; Characterization; Molecular weight; Polyolefins; Relaxation processes; Rheology; Viscosity; Viscosity measurement; Branching; Capillary die; Dynamic measurements; Metallocene; Polydispersity; High density polyethylenes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029734603

Measured dielectronic recombination resonances at low relative energy and spectra of laser-stimulated recombination indicate that transverse electron temperatures of about 17 meV have been obtained at cathode temperatures of about 110 meV. The temperature dependence of the spontaneous electron-ion recombination rate during electron cooling was investigated and found to follow the inverse square-root law expected from the theory of radiative recombination, although the measured absolute rates are higher than predicted. A new method based on analyzing the intensity of the fluorescence light emitted during simultaneous laser and electron cooling is used to measure the longitudinal electron cooling force in a range of relative velocities extending over two orders of magnitude (105-107 cm/s). The results confirm the occurrence of 'magnetized electron cooling' also at the reduced transverse temperature and show that, compared to earlier measurements at the high transverse temperature, the cooling force increases by about a factor of 2; a considerably larger increase by a factor of ≈ 5 would be expected if 'magnetized electron cooling' would not exist.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039015093

After cessation of blood flow and, thus, lack of metabolic substrates and oxygen supply, a swift decrease of energy-rich phosphates can be observed in the tissue, since endergonic metabolic processes continue, but no further oxidative regeneration of biochemical energy stores will take place. We investigated the effect of a continuous gaseous oxygen supply via the venous vessels during extended ischemic preservation of rat livers in University of Wisconsin preservation solution for 48 hr. Results showed that aerobic ischemic storage not only prevented the depletion of biochemical energy stores, but promoted a de novo synthesis of high energy phosphates, and significantly enhanced the functional recovery of the organs after postischemic reperfusion.

To determine the influence of the F-actin crosslinking proteins α-actinin and actin-binding protein (ABP)120 gelation factor from Dictyostelium discoideum on the properties of actin gels we used a torsion pendulum to measure directly viscoelastic changes of the filamentous networks. Using the capping proteins severin and DS151 to control actin filament length, both crosslinkers were found to increase the elasticity and the viscosity of F-actin solutions. In the case of α-actinin, this activity was completely blocked by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+. The inhibitory functions of the two EF hands of α-actinin were further investigated by introducing point mutations into either one or both of the Ca2+-binding regions. Mutations in the Ca2+-coordinating amino acid residues in the first or in both EF hands left the dynamic storage and loss moduli of the F-actin solution unaltered, independent of the Ca2+ concentration. However, α-actinin mutated in the second EF hand increased the viscoelasticity of actin gels like the wild-type protein in the absence of Ca2+. The ABP120 gelation factor exhibited only negligible differences to α-actinin in viscometry measurements, whereas its impact on the ratio G'/G' (the ratio of energy lost compared to elastically stored during a deformation) of F-actin solutions was clearly smaller than that of α- actinin. We conclude from these data that: (i) a torsion pendulum is an excellent tool to determine small changes of activity in normal and mutated actin-binding proteins, (ii) the first EF hand of α-actinin is crucial for its crosslinking function, and (iii) the viscoelastic properties of F-actin gels crosslinked by either α-actinin or the ABP120 gelation factor are different.",,"actin binding protein; F actin; actin filament; amino acid sequence; article; calcium cell level; calcium transport; cell motility; Dictyostelium discoideum; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; protein cross linking; viscoelasticity; Dictyostelium discoideum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030045116

The purpose of this study was to examine whether increasing preservation temperature to 20°C makes it possible to shorten a preservation period for recovery of ischemically damaged pancreas grafts. After 90 min of warm ischemia, canine pancreas grafts were preserved using the two-layer (UW/PFC) method for 1 to 8 hr at 20°C, and then autotransplanted. A K-value of intravenous glucose tolerance test more than 1.0 at 2 weeks after transplantation was considered graft survival. ATP tissue levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography at the end of preservation. Pancreatic tissue perfusions were measured using an H2 clearance technique after 30 min to 4 hr of reperfusion. Pancreas grafts subjected to 90 min of warm ischemia were not viable (0/5, control group). However, 3- and 5-hr preservations made it possible to recover the ischemically damaged pancreas (3/5 and 5/5, respectively), although 1- and 8-hr preservations were not successful (0/3 and 0/3, respectively). ATP tissue levels in 1-hr-preserved grafts were 2.55±0.38 μmol/g dry weight and were significantly lower compared with the levels in 5- and 8-hr-preserved grafts, 9.40±2.09 (P&lt;0.01) and 7.37±1.06 (P&lt;0.01), respectively. On the other hand, pancreatic tissue perfusions in 8-hr-preserved grafts after 2 hr of reperfusion were 28.50±7.52 ml/100 g/min and were significantly lower than the values in 1- and 5-hr-preserved grafts, 66.0±11.22 (P&lt;0.01) and 57.10±4.40 (P&lt;0.01), respectively. It was suggested that 1-hr-preservation was not enough to synthesize ATP, which was essential to repair damaged cells, although vascular microcirculation at reperfusion was maintained and 8-hr preservation incurred microcirculatory disturbances, although ATP for repairing damaged cells was synthesized. We conclude that 3- to 5-hr preservation at 20°C by the two-layer (UW/PFC) method accelerates ATP synthesis, which is essential for repairing damaged cells and protects vascular microcirculation. This makes it possible to resuscitate ischemically damaged pancreases faster. This method holds promise for pancreas-kidney transplantation from cardiac arrest donors.",,"adenosine triphosphate; perfluoro compound; university of wisconsin solution; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; dog; energy metabolism; female; ischemia; male; nonhuman; organ preservation; pancreas perfusion; pancreas transplantation; priority journal; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animals; Dogs; Female; Glutathione; Insulin; Male; Organ Preservation Solutions; Pancreas; Pancreas Transplantation; Raffinose; Time Factors; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030043510

The most common PHA, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), can be produced in high yield by fermentation of a variety of bacterial strains. PHB is a isotactic semi-crystalline polyester with great potential as a biodegradable commodity; it has useful physico-mechanical properties and appears to be biocompatible. Hydrolytic degradation occurs by surface erosion which makes it an attractive material for controlled release applications. The homopolymer PHB has a relatively high melting point and crystallizes rapidly, making entrapment of drug technically difficult. The related copolymers with 3-hydroxyvalerate, P(HB-HV)s, have similar semi-crystalline properties though their slower rates of crystallization result in matrices with different: properties; this merits further investigation. Release of low molecular weight drugs from PHB and P(HB-HV) matrices tends to proceed by penetration of water and pore formation, at least above loadings of approximately 5% drug. Release from such matrices is predominantly independent of polymer erosion; though at lower loadings it is possible to trap drug more effectively. PHB and P(HB-HV) matrices lose mass very slowly when compared to bulk-degrading poly(lactide-glycolide) systems. Therefore the applications of these materials in drug delivery are likely to depend on the formulation of suitable blends with other biocompatible polymers. Porosity, erosion rate and hence drug release rate can be controlled by blending techniques. At a more fundamental level there is considerable potential for design and bioengineering of other PHAs for applications in drug delivery. For example, medium chain PHAs are rubbery materials with low melting points which may be much more suitable as matrices for applications in drug delivery.Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are naturally occurring hindegradable polyesters produced as energy storage materials by many bacteria.

Environmental change was produced by reciprocal transplant experiments among sites of varying productivity. In addition, clams were caged at high density to reduce the availability of resources. Transplanting females before fertilization (from May to June), or during the early development of the brood (from July to August) had no detectable effect on reproductive output. Early-season environment, however, affected body mass and percent fat content of females from two populations. This suggests that maintaining the level of reproductive allocation when resources are reduced early in the season leads to lower allocation to somatic growth and biochemical storage. Transplanting females late in the season (from September to November) had a substantial effect on reproductive output and body mass, but not on fat content, suggesting that late in the season allocation to biochemical energy storage is important. Hence, late in the season reproductive allocation may be adjusted to prevailing conditions in preparation for winter. Indeed, over-wintering site had a significant effect on percent fat content, body mass and shell growth when females were kept in a new environment from September to March. Variation among transplant sites in female body mass matched the estimated productivity of the sites, suggesting that it occurred in response to differences in the productivity of the habitats. The results emphasize the importance of taking seasonal changes in the priorities of energy allocation and the seasonally of reproductive processes into account when developing or testing models of optimal energy allocation.","Anodonta; Phenotypic plasticity; Reproduction; Resource allocation; Seasonal environment","Anodonta piscinalis; bivalve; clam; energy allocation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666827

From the stationary applications of power quality, load leveling, rate management, and uninterruptable power supplies to the transportation applications in hybrid-electric and all electric vehicles, flywheels offer significant advantages in reliability, maintenance, lifetime, and cost over existing energy storage technologies. presses used for shearing metals; in automobiles these flywheels are used to smooth the power pulses of piston engines. These early flywheels were extremely simple and stored a relatively small amount of energy for short periods of time, but were capable of transmitting extremely high power for short periods of time. New technologies have recently been developed which allow the construction of a new generation of flywheels systems. Relatively light weight flywheels that can store large amounts of energy are now possible while retaining the high power and simplicity associated with traditional flywheel systems. These advanced flywheel systems, which produce an electrical output and are functionally equivalent to very high performance batteries, will have a tremendous economic impact on the telecommunications, industrial, automotive and utility markets. In combination with the declining cost and size of electronics, the three technologies which have enabled the development of these advanced flywheels are high strength fiber composites, high efficiency electric drives, and frictionless magnetic bearings. Much of the underlying technology for flywheel energy storage systems was initially developed for space applications. Flywheels have been used for spacecraft attitude control for over thirty years. Over time these systems developed the technology base in brushless permanent magnet motors, power and control electronics, magnetic bearings, structural and rotor dynamics, and thermal management; all key ingredients in making the flywheel an effective technological competitor with batteries. The remaining challenge is to make these systems economically competitive with batteries.

Today interest in electric vehicles (EV's) is growing, due to the technological advances in recent years, but also in part due to recent legislation which mandates the introduction of 'zero emission vehicles' in California before the end of the century. The definition of 'zero emission vehicle' is: a vehicle which does not emit any pollutants during operation. Technologically, the only near term vehicle which meets this definition is an EV. One of the most difficult problems of electric racing is that the usable energy in a given set of batteries is not as easily determined as the amount of fuel in a tank. Also, the motor controllers may limit power output as battery voltage drops, further decreasing the amount of usable energy in a battery set. Batteries have energy capacity which is a function of battery state of charge, time and battery life. This complex relationship makes the state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack a very difficult quantity to measure. In a vehicle, as the energy in the batteries is depleted, the battery bus voltage decreases to the controller minimum voltage. Determining the usable amount of energy in a given battery set is contingent upon knowing the history of the batteries, current draw, and a reasonable model of the batteries' charge and discharge characteristics. The energy storage problem is one of many which were overcome during the development of this vehicle. Many existing mature technologies, such as a manual transmission, were investigated as potential solutions to the new problems of electric vehicle development. A systems approach was taken to develop the vehicle as a set of coexisting subsystems. The success of the vehicle is a testament to the integration of these separate battery, motor, and mechanical systems. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air pollution; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric discharges; Electric machine control; Fuel tanks; Integration testing; Racing automobiles; Traction motors; Vehicle transmissions; Battery state of charge; Charge and discharge; Complex relationships; Manual transmissions; Ohio State University; Technological advances; Vehicle development; Zero emission vehicles; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072500759

These types of engines will operate at lean A/F ratios during cruising at partial load and return to stoichiometric or even rich conditions when more power is required. The challenge for the engine and catalyst manufacturer is to develop a system which will combine the high activity rates of a state-of-the-art three way catalyst (TWC) with the ability to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) under excess of oxygen. The target is to achieve the future legislation limits (EURO III/IV) in the European Union. Recent developments in automotive pollution control catalysis have shown that the utilization of NOx adsorption materials is a suitable way for reduction of NOx emissions of gasoline fueled lean burn engines. However, the primary task for the implementation of this technology in the European market will be to improve the high temperature stability and to decrease the susceptibility to sulfur poisoning. The present paper outlines results of a recent research and development program to achieve nitrogen oxide reduction under lean burn gasoline engine conditions. Model gas test results as well as engine bench data are used for discussion of the parameters which control NOx adsorption efficiency under various conditions. It is shown that the NOx adsorption technology enables an efficient removal of NOx up to 85% over a wide temperature range even at high NO x inlet concentrations. The major part of the paper is dedicated to the problem of sulfur poisoning under laboratory and engine operation conditions. The relationship between the uptake of poisons such as sulfur and phosphorus and the activity results is reported. It is demonstrated that relatively small amounts of adsorbed sulfur might cause a severe overproportional suppression of NOx storage activity. Regarding this, fundamental studies using various physicochemical and spectroscopic methods such as BET-surface area measurements, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), inductive coupled plasma (ICP) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were performed to elucidate the nature of sulfur deposition on the NOx storage catalyst. Some evidence exists that at short time-on-stream the SO3 reacts preferably with the NOx adsorbents by forming surface sulfate species which block off the active sites of the adsorbents for further NO x adsorption. However, by treating the, sulfur poisoned NO x storage catalysts with hydrogen the equivalent activity of the fresh catalyst can be restored. The results obtained by thermogravimetrical analyses coupled to a mass spectrometer (TG-MS) show that high concentrations of hydrogen bring about high levels of H2S and little SO2 whereas low concentrations of hydrogen preferably lead to increased SO 2 emissions at expense of H2S. Another subject reported in detail is the progress made recently concerning improved sulfur tolerance of the technology by applying a sulfur trap mounted upstream to the NOx storage catalyst. The concept of the sulfur trap provides the periodical adsorption of SO3 whenever the exhaust is adjusted lean and the decomposition and emission of the sulfur as SO2 when the engine management provides the rich spikes. One target was to avoid the generation of H2S during the rich periods. Aided by the utilization of ion molecular reaction mass spectroscopy (IMR-MS) the general ability of the sulfur trap to function could be confirmed at different engine operating points and temperature levels. It is demonstrated that in the presence of sulfur a significant improvement in NOx activity retention by additionally applying the sulfur trap is feasible. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Adsorption; Automobile manufacture; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Digital storage; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Exhaust gases; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Hydrogen storage; Ion engines; Mass spectrometry; Pollution control; Spectrometers; Spectroscopic analysis; Sulfur compounds; X rays; BET surface area measurement; Catalyst manufacturers; Energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX); High temperature stability; Inductive coupled plasma; Lean burn gasoline engine; Nitrogen oxide reduction; Wide temperature ranges; Nitrogen oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072474648

Unlike conventional vehicles, HEVs are generally energy and power limited by the battery bank and auxiliary power unit. As a result, the overall system efficiency in the conversion of chemical or stored energy into kinetic energy of the vehicle is the key parameter that drives the overall system design. We have undertaken a sensitivity analysis of HEVs to understand in detail the various factors and their respective weights that affect the overall system efficiency. Our goal is to identify the parameters that most significantly influence vehicle efficiency. The results of this study may be used as a guide to focus work on the areas of most benefit for HEVs as well as aiding in sizing vehicle components for maximum efficiency. The simulation tool used is SIMPLEV 3.1 developed by the DOE Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, which runs a time-based simulation on a set of parameter files for an (hybrid) electric vehicle. To accomplish this sensitivity analysis we have written a set of programs that conduct a parametric analysis of the vehicle parameters by creating the necessary sets of SlMPLEV input files. It then runs these SIMPLEV files on a standard test cycle and extracts out the results of the simulation. Using the data this generated, we were able to establish the relative importance of each system parameter. This paper discusses the assumptions within the SIMPLEV model, the development of input files and the parametric programs, and the test cycle chosen. The results of this sensitivity analysis are also presented and analyzed. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers Inc.",,"Chemical analysis; Digital storage; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Laboratories; Sensitivity analysis; Auxiliary power units; Design and operations; Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); Idaho National Engineering Laboratory; Maximum Efficiency; Parametric -analysis; Vehicle components; Vehicle parameters; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072458333

The laboratory testing HESTS was powered by a DC. motor which was controlled by a Silicon-Controlled Rectifier(SCR). Loads adding to the HESTS were regulated by a proportional valve control system. The HESTS is more complex because there are not only continuous variables-the shaft speed of the hydraulic axial piston variable displacement pump/motor unit and the position of the displacement-varying cylinder, but also discrete variables-the on/off states of clutch, 2/2 solenoid valve and 2/4 solenoid valve in the HESTS to be controlled. So a fuzzy logic controller with a mode selector is designed to perform the role of control to the HESTS.

When hydrogen is used as the fuel, the only products of the electrochemical reactions are water and electric power. Other conventional and advanced powerplants for transportation, such as the internal combustion (IC) engine, the Diesel engine and others, are thermal combustion engines. The theoretical or thermodynamic efficiency of a fuel cell or electrochemical engine is much higher than the thermodynamic efficiency of a heat engine. The practical efficiency of a fuel cell is highest at partial load, whereas the practical efficiency of a heat engine is highest at maximum power. A survey is presented of the different fuel cell types and their characteristics. The proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cell is shown to be the best available fuel cell for transportation applications. Using hydrogen for its fuel, the PEM fuel cell powerplant is a true zero emission vehicle (ZEV) engine.

As GM's impact electric vehicle was designed exclusively for battery power, priority consideration of efficiency was given to the design of every function in the vehicle. This paper addresses such considerations in one of the major functions of the chassis system: ride, handling, and steering. The ride, handling, and steering function is a major player in the efficiency of Impact. It includes such energy dissipaters as tire rolling resistance, component deformations or accelerations due to road surface irregularities, suspension viscous damping, and energy requirements of power assisted controls. Also factors in design efficiency are limited packaging envelopes associated with a highly aerodynamic body, and last but not least, mass efficiency of the chassis components. These factors were all considered in an effort to develop innovative chassis systems contributing to vehicle efficiency while providing pleasible ride, handling, and steering to the customer. The results of this effort are chassis systems which contribute significantly to unprecedented total vehicle efficiency, while providing remarkably contemporary ride, handling, and steering pleasibility. This has been achieved through innovations in system electro-mechanical design and mechanization, component materials selection, and simultaneous engineering practices used by the GM Electric Vehicles team and its key suppliers. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobile steering equipment; Chassis; Electric vehicles; Machinery; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Secondary batteries; Chassis components; Component materials; Electro mechanical design; Energy requirements; On-board energy storage; Road surface irregularities; Steering functions; Vehicle efficiency; Steering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072431701

In the analysis, the reprocessed plutonium (Pu) is charged into the reactor in such a way that the reprocessed Pu is not stored outside the reactor, i.e., there is no excess Pu outside the reactor. The analysis characterized the fuel cycle systems, and showed the usefulness of the present method to determine future directions for the FBR introduction and nuclear fuel cycle systems deployment. Concerning an intermediate-term strategy, the time of introduction and required capacities of a second commercial LWR reprocessing plant, Pu-thermal, and the first FBR reprocessing plant deployment are evaluated. A long term strategy analysis shows that the two or three large plants are run in parallel for each fuel cycle facility and that FBR related facilities deal with a markedly large amount of Pu. It is concluded that the early stage introduction of FBRs of significant capacities seems necessary to materialize a consistent total FBR/fuel cycle system where Pu balance becomes feasible through its flexible operation of, for instance, adjusting breeding ratio, in order to keep the transparency of the Pu utilization. © 1996, Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

Hanley Road, St. Louis, MO 63144, United States; Varnek, A., Department of Chemistry, University of Strasbourg, 4 Rue Blaise Pascal, Strasbourg, France","At present, there are two widely used approaches for computing molecular hydration and electrostatic effects within the continuum approximation: the finite difference method, in which the electric potential is directly computed on a cubic grid, and the induced polarization charge or boundary element method, in which an induced charge distribution is first computed on the molecular surface and in which solvation effects are then calculated by reference to the reaction field arising from this induced surface charge. While the induced surface charge approach has a number of advantages over finite differences, especially in the computation of hydration forces and solvent stabilization, the applications of this technique have been largely restricted to small molecules. This is primarily due to the very large system of equations that results when the surface of a macromolecule is discretized into elements small enough to ensure an acceptable level of numerical accuracy within the continuum model. This article describes a new algorithm for implementing boundary element calculations within the continuum model. The essence of our approach is only to compute explicitly those interactions between surface elements that are relatively close together and to approximate long-range interactions by grid-based multipole expansion. The resulting system of equations has a relatively sparse coefficient matrix and requires disk storage that increases linearly with molecular surface area. The technique has numerous applications in the analysis of solvation effects in large molecules, especially in the area of conformational analysis, where it is critical to accurately estimate the global hydration energy for the entire structure. © 1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962420696

Guanidinium Azo-Tetrazolate (GAT) is the compound which is the focus of our research. GAT is an organic salt consisting of a high percentage of nitrogen. It has two conjugated nitrogen rings which are negatively charged, and a positively charge component consisting of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen. In addition to the high energy content of this compound, as a salt, it has a lower heat of degradation due to the ease of breaking its ionic bonds. GAT was found to react with N100, a common curative for HTPB. An alternative isocyanate curative was found. PAPI. with which it did not react. This polymer matrix was found to be suitable for GAT. The resulting fuel grains were difficult to cast due to the rapid polymerization of the HTPB'PAPI. Once grains were cast, they required no special care in storage or firing. Initial data indicates that GAT is indeed a highly regressing fuel. This data was obtained at only a 15% by mass concentration of GAT in the fuel grains, with the exception of one 20% GAT grain which regressed fast enough that a pressure spike cause a safety shutdown of our labscale rocket. © 1996, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Automotive fuels; Carbon; Digital storage; Nitrogen; Propulsion; Rockets; Energy content; Hybrid motors; Mass concentration; Negatively charged; Organic salt; Pressure spike; Rapid polymerization; Regression rate; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961932814

The ISUS can nearly double the GEO payload of expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) compared to chemical (O2/H2) transfer stages. This allows downsizing of ELVs for a given payload (e.g., launching Titan IV payloads on a Delta III/ISUS) at significant cost savings of up to $150 million per launch. In addition, ISUS enables GEO payloads to be launched by single-stage-to- orbit (SSTO) vehicles, which currently have no GEO- transfer-orbit (GTO) capability. The ISUS uses large concentrators to focus sunlight on a high temperature receiver. The receiver heats hydrogen to 2500K and expels it from a nozzle for thrust (1-10 lb) at high Isp (800-1000 sec). The fuel is stored as subcritical liquid hydrogen (LH2). The ISUS is autonomously guided through approximately 240 bums (orbits) on its 30 day transfer mission from LEO to GEO. After insertion in the final orbit, the ISUS switches to a power production mode with thermal energy transported to thermionic elements that convert heat to electrical power for the satellite payload. The ISUS concept requires that a number of technologies be matured prior to undertaking full development. These technologies include the concentrator, the receiver and thermionic elements, and the LH2 storage/feed system. The USAF Phillips Lab will develop these technologies concurrently during the engine ground demonstration (EGD) test to be conducted in a large vacuum chamber at the NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC). This paper describes the design and expected performance of the ISUS Cryogen Storage and Propellant Feed System (CSPFS) to be used in the EGD. The CSPFS must provide efficient storage of the LH2 over the 30 day mission duration, while providing propellant as required by the receiver/absorber/ concentrator (RAC) in low-gravity and at the proper conditions. The LH2 tank is multilayer-insulated to restrict tank pressure excursions during coast. It uses a zero-g thermodynamic vent system (TVS) integrated with a screen liquid acquisition device (LAD). The TVS subcools the LAD flow thus eliminating a pressurization system for the tank. Additionally, an active TVS consisting of a pump and compact heat exchanger will be used to remove additional heat from the tank and thereby maintain better tank pressure control. All of the vent flow from the TVS is used in the engine, none is vented overboard. © 1996 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Aerospace vehicles; Chromium compounds; Concentration (process); Engines; Geostationary satellites; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Liquefied gases; NASA; Propellants; Propulsion; Tanks (containers); Compact heat exchanger; Expendable launch vehicles; Ground demonstrations; Liquid acquisition devices (LAD); Low earth orbit(LEO); Pressurization system; Single stage to orbit vehicles; Thermodynamic vent systems; Orbits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961895928

The selection of graphite has dictated the need for development and testing of high temperature coatings to determine which can maintain structural integrity at elevated temperatures, be compatible with graphite, and mitigate carbon loss from the graphite known to occur from exposure to high temperature vacuum and hydrogen environments. This paper presents the methodology which led to selection of CVD rhenium as the coating material.

A new energy conversion index is developed which arranges system design parameters in a dimensionless form and also exhibits running cost. It is suggested that the inlet air cooling system is equivalent to simple cycle or pumped storage in view of the dimensionless running cost. Next, a cost diagram relating capital cost to power generation cost is presented also in non-dimensional form, which could provide a measure to examine investment worth for a power producer. Moreover, cooling effectiveness as function of cooled inlet air temperature is investigated using specific thermal energy.

The advent of high energy synchrotron storage rings has provided a new significant impetus emphasizing high energy applications and especially when flux, rather than resolution, is desired. In this paper we present the reflection properties of the most promising multilayer material combinations for the energy range from 0.1 keV up to 200 keV. Previous calculations by Rosenbluth were limited to a maximum of 2 keV and to multilayers composed of pure elements and operating under normal incidence. As alloys might be essential for a smooth growth and/or for stability under high heat load, our screening consisted of a list of up to 300 solids having a melting point above 100°C and that could be deposited in a sputtering process. A full computer search calculates 45000 multilayer combinations for each angle (or multilayer d‐spacing) and energy of operation, the only necessary input variables. Other manufacture‐related parameters can be specified to give a more realistic picture of the performance.

Experiments employed 303e-type stainless steel and copper test sections having identical dimensions (75 mm in diameter and 20 mm thick). Pool boiling curves were constructed on the basis of two-dimensional numerical solution of transient heat conduction in spherical coordinates(r, 9) in test sections during quenching. The measured temperature histories at nine interior locations near the boiling surface (∼0.5 mm) provided a time-dependent boundary condition for the numerical solution. To ensure stability and reduce both computer storage and execution time, the numerical solution used the alternating direction implicit (ADD method with control volume representations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of grid size on computation time as well as the accuracy of calculated temperatures and pool boiling heat flux values. Best results were obtained using a 20 × 20 network of control volumes and a noniterative approach, whereas the computation time on a Pentium 90-MHz PC for the entire pool boiling curve was about 7% of real time.

Animals can lower the metabolic cost of swimming by using appropriately tuned, elastic springs. Jet-powered invertebrates use springs that lie in functional parallel to their swimming muscles to power half the locomotor cycle. The parallel geometry constrains the spring to be non-linearly elastic; muscle power is diverted to load the spring only when swimming muscles are not capable of producing maximal hydrodynamic thrust. The springs of jellyfish and scallops are forced at or near their resonant frequency, producing large energy savings. Measuring the contribution of elastic energy storage to jet-powered locomotion has been facilitated by the relatively simple geometries of invertebrate locomotor systems. In contrast, complex musculoskeletal systems and kinematics have complicated the study of springs in swimming vertebrates. Skins, tendons and axial skeletons of some vertebrate swimmers have appropriate mechanical properties to act as springs. To date, though, there exist just a handful of studies that have investigated the mechanical behaviors of these locomotor structures in swimming vertebrates, and these data have yet to be integrated with measures of swimming power. Integrating mechanical, kinematic, hydrodynamic and metabolic data are required to understand more fully the role of elastic springs in vertebrate swimming energetics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243484031

The transfer from 3D to 2D solution of the kinetic equation in case of pre-failure crack formation was used for forecasting of rock failure event of different energy and scale level. The rockburst data which have been obtained for several mining areas were reprocessed to demonstrate the possibilities of the kinetic method.

Such flow situations are frequently encountered in thermal energy storage, in electronic systems, and in room fires. However, not much work has been done to understand the basic mechanisms governing such flows, particularly the flow near the corner. In this study, a two-dimensional jet of heated air is discharged adjacent to the lower surface of an isothermal horizontal plate. An isothermal vertical plate is attached at the other end of the horizontal surface, making a right angle corner. The vertical penetration distance of the resulting downward flow is measured and is related to the inflow conditions, particularly to the temperature and velocity at the jet discharge. This penetration distance is found to increase as the distance between the discharge location and the corner is reduced and also as the relative buoyancy level in the inlet flow is decreased. Velocity and temperature measurements are also carried out over the flow region. These indicate that the ceiling flow separates from the horizontal surface just before reaching the corner and then reattaches itself to the vertical wall at a finite distance vertically below the corner. The local surface heat flux measurements show a minimum in the heat transfer rate before the turn, along with a recovery in the heat transfer rate after the turn and the existence of a small recirculation zone near the corner. The net entrainment into the flow and heat transfer rate to the solid boundaries are also measured and correlated with the jet discharge conditions. © 1996 by ASME.","Fire/Flames; Jets; Mixed convection","Cornering; Flow; Heat Transfer; Jets; Flow of fluids; Heat flux; Jets; Buoyant jets; Ceiling jet flow; Thermal energy storage; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3743112618

We propose to study quantitatively the exchange of computational resources like time and space for irreversibility in computations. Reversible simulations of irreversible computations are memory intensive. Such (polynomial time) simulations are analysed here in terms of 'reversible' pebble games. We show that Bennett's pebbling strategy uses least additional space for the greatest number of simulated steps. We derive a trade-off for storage space versus irreversible erasure. Next we consider reversible computation itself. An alternative proof is provided for the precise expression of the ultimate irreversibility cost of an otherwise reversible computation without restrictions on time and space use. A timeirreversibility trade-off hierarchy in the exponential time region is exhibited. Finally, extreme time-irreversibility trade-offs for reversible computations in the thoroughly unrealistic range of computable versus non-computable time-bounds are given. © 1996 The Royal Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746738268

The device will consist of a fully depleted diode array bump bonded to a CMOS electronic storage capacitor array with eight frames per pixel. The two devices may be separated by a x‐ray blocking layer that protects the radiation‐sensitive electronics layer from damage. The signal is integrated in the electronics layer and stored in one of eight CMOS capacitors. After eight frames are taken, the data are then read out, using clocking electronics external to the detector, and stored in a RAM disk. Results will be presented on the development of a prototype 4×4 pixel electronics layer that is capable of storing at least 10,000 12‐keV x‐ray photons for a capacity of over 50 million electrons with a noise corresponding to 2 x‐ray photons per pixel.

However, the thinner 'Newton-black' films which can be formed from these same solutions burst in an anomalous, retarded fashion. Moreover, the rim of the expanding holes in these films is not toroidal; it has a scalloped appearance, small droplets issuing from the loci where the rim trails behind. Free vertical films drawn from a viscoelastic film also show retardation of the bursting rate. However, whereas, in SDS films, the transition to this type of bursting is abrupt between the common-black film and the Newton-black film, it is gradual from the thicker films to the thinnest Newton-black film for these solutions. We assume, therefore, that, although it is formed from a Newtonian liquid, a Newton-black film from an SDS solution has a storage modulus like a thicker viscoelastic film. The anomalous bursting behaviour of such films reflects a molecular structure which is more like a liquid-crystalline bilayer. The deviations from the classical (Culick) model for the rim velocity of an expanding hole in a liquid film can be described in terms of film elements being deformed at the transition from the film to the rim. Elastic energy is then (temporarily) stored in a molecular network structure, which is characterized by a correlation length §. When the film thickness becomes smaller than §, the elastic modulus becomes dependent on the film thickness. On this basis we have found a qualitative explanation for the observations on decelerating film bursts with viscoelastic solutions and Newton-black films.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2742609171

It was shown that the effectiveness of modification is determined by the method of treating the fibres with the copolymer modifiers, the molecular composition of these copolymers, and the colloid chemical properties of the latexes based on them. Treatment of the fibres with copolymers with functionally active groups capable of reacting with the macromolecule of the fibre-forming polymer and cross-linking on the surface of the fibre is the most effective method of modification. Substitution of incomplete fluorinated alcohols or unfluorinated monomers for the acrylates in the PFHA copolymer reduces their effectiveness in modification. Copolymers of PFHA with hydrophilic monomers capable of being orientedly sorbed by the fibre due to its amphiphilic nature and forming surfaces with low energy are an exception. For effective use of the copolymer modifier, the latexes of these copolymers should have certain colloid chemical properties: the particle charge, adsorption saturation, and aggregate stability should be optimum, which will ensure their stability during preparation, storage, and use. © 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27144551076

Bearings with such advantages are useful for kinetic energy storage designs. We have designed and constructed a flywheel prototype using a concept of a hybrid superconducting magnetic bearing (HSMB). The HSMB design uses magnetic forces from permanent magnets for levitation and high temperature superconductors (HTS) in between the magnets for stabilization. The bearings levitate a rotor of 19 kg and the flywheel can currently rotate up to 6,000 RPM. The result from the recent spin-down tests indicates an average frictional energy loss < 2% per hour. Most of the friction is due to the condition of an imperfect system assembly alignment and an unbalanced rotor. Improvement of the system is ongoing.

A main difficulty in physics is in interrelating these two levels, i.e. in modelling. Relatively little research has been done on this problem, most work in AI, psychology and physics education having concentrated on how students use representations in problem solving, rather than on the complex process of how they construct them. We present a study that aims to explore how students construct models for energy storage, transformation and transfers in simple experimental situations involving electricity and mechanics. The study involved detailed analysis of problem solving dialogues produced by pairs of students, and AI modelling of these processes. We present successively more refined models that are capable of generating ideal solutions, solutions for individual students for a single task, then models for individuals across different tasks. The students' construction of energy models can be modelled in terms of the simplest process of modelling-establishing term to term relations between elements of the object/event 'world' and the theory/model world, with underlying linear causal reasoning. Nevertheless, our model is unable to take into account more sophisticated modelling processes in students. In conclusion we therefore describe future work on the development of a new model that could take such processes into account. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344453994

The results show that the resistive tearing instability is a possible pre-heating mechanism in the preflare phase, and both the rotation of the spiral sunspots and the highly sheared background field are necessary for the energy storage of this flare.

This facility was constructed as part of the second stage of the GOL-3 programme for studying the interaction of microsecond electron beams with a plasma and its fast heating. The plasma column of the GOL-3-II facility is 12 m in length instead of 7 m for the first stage of GOL-3. The energy content of the capacitive storage for magnetic field supply has been increased from 10 MJ to 15 MJ. This allows us to have a magnetic field of up to 5 T in the homogeneous part of the solenoid and up to 10 T in its end mirrors. The expected key feature of the upgrading is an essential increase in the energy content of the electron beam injected into the plasma. The high-power electron beam generator U-2 is now used for the new beam-plasma interaction experiments with possible beam energy content of up to 0.3 MJ. It is shown experimentally that transportation of a 0.2 MJ electron beam through the 12 m plasma column is possible under conditions of almost full current neutralization. The collective beam-plasma interaction results in a plasma heating of up to 1-2 keV electron temperature at ≈ 1015 cm-3 density. © 1996 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344990225

In contrast to white fat, brown fat is highly vascular, densely innervated by sympathetic nerves, and (unlike all other tissues) possesses uncoupling protein. Uncoupling protein is an inner-membrane mitochondrial protein that uncouples respiration in a highly regulated fashion. Because of this capacity, energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue can range over many orders of magnitude and, when maximally stimulated, can contribute importantly to total-body energy expenditure. Prevailing evidence, obtained mostly through studies in rodents, indicates that brown adipose tissue plays an important role in regulating total body fat stores.

The design of PV plant was based on the specification of the site, the depth and quality of water, the daily water quantity produced and the autonomy period of the plant during cloudy conditions as well as other local climatic conditions. The plant has two main PV separate systems, first, PV water pumping system which is characterized by storing the water in two storage tanks and without electric energy storage, second, PV system for the operation of the reverse osmosis unit (water desalination), this system is characterized by the storage of electric energy (batteries). The storage batteries are used to supply the required electric power to the equipment in the plant, during night and cloudy weather. The batteries capacity is designed to be sufficient for 5 days autonomy. In order to make the operation and maintenance of the PV plant highly reliable, the design is based on the selection of equipment which are commonly available in the local market. The head of the submersible pump is 50 m from surface level, and the amount of water production from Reverse Osmosis Unit is about 600 liters per hour. The total installed PV capacity for pumping system is 980 Wp, and for desalination system is 10.89 kWp. In this paper the performance analysis and the development in the plant are discussed.","Desalination; Photovotaics; Pumping; Remote area; Reverse osmosis; Saudi Arabia; Solar","Desalination; Electric batteries; Maintenance; Performance; Photovoltaic cells; Plant layout; Pumps; Reverse osmosis; Site selection; Water quality; Water supply systems; Photovoltaic plants; Remote area; Saudi Arabia; Water pumping; Solar power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042036837

The kinetic energy in the magnetosphere also increased as convection increased, The near-Earth neutral line started on closed plasma sheet field lines and then progressed to lobe field lines. This resulted in a conversion of magnetic energy in the tail lobes into kinetic and thermal energy in the plasma sheet. Then the system relaxed into a steadily convecting state characterized by a balance between the dayside reconnection and the reconnection in the near-Earth tail.

The desuperheater system was tested over a range of outdoor conditions to determine parameters such as desuperheater rate and DHW temperatures. The desuperheater rate decreased with entering water temperature, since the heat transfer between the water and refrigerant decreased as the entering water temperature increased. In addition, the desuperheater coefficients of performance decreased with entering water temperature. The DHW tank first-hour rating, F, was 52.9 gal/h.

Peroxide values and volatile contents of the crisps stored in normal storage conditions (room temperature) were measured during storage. From the peroxide values it could be seen that crisps fried in normal sunflower oil were the most unstable during storage. Crisps fried in high oleic sunflower oil proved to be almost as stable towards oxidation as crisps fried in reference oil palm olein. Volatile contents, measured by a static headspace - gas Chromatograph - mass spectrometry system, confirmed the conclusions of peroxide analysis. Neither of the methods could find any difference between the samples which had been fried with and without DMPS.","Crisps; Headspace analysis; High oleic sunflower oil; Industrial frying; Peroxide value; Storage; Sunflower oil","Energy storage; Mass spectrometry; Oxidation; Palm oil; Peroxides; Silicones; Crisps; Headspace analysis; High-oleic sunflower oil; Industrial frying; Peroxide value; Sunflower oil; Elaeis; Helianthus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040240064

A storage ring lattice adopting a seven-bend achromat (SBA) [2] structure is presented. High brightness and coherence of SR light are emphasized. The natural electron beam emittance reaches as low as 0.25 nm.rad at 2 GeV. The ring circumference is 473.68 m. Eight 7-m long and four 18-m long dispersion-free straights are available for installation of insertion devices (IDs) and other kinds of equipment. Sources based on long undulators placed in long straights would be able to provide SR spectra with a photon beam brightness up to 1021 photons/s/mrad2/mm2/0.1%BW. The Touschek lifetime, which is reputed as one of the most crucial issues for design of such low energy (2-4 GeV), low emittance (in the 10-10 m.rad range) light sources, has been studied by taking into account the bunch lengthening and intra-beam scattering effects. We find that at lower energies (around 2 GeV) both the bunch length and momentum spread increase by a factor of 2.7 due to the longitudinal microwave instability, and the emittance blows up by factors of 2.7-4.4, corresponding to coupling ratios of 10%-1%, caused by the intra-beam scattering; however, at the higher energies (around 4 GeV), there are no remarkable changes for these parameters (an average bunch current of 1 mA is assumed throughout the calculation). Thus, the energy dependence of the Touschek lifetime is modified correspondingly, and the Touschek lifetime issue becomes less serious at the cost of the bunch lengthening and widening and the emittance blowup at the low energy range.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040157450

We show that starting with an initially 'cool' muon beam, e.g. coming from a 25 GeV photo-production source, with the normalized emittance of εN = 10-5 mrad, one can decrease the transverse emittance to less than εN = 10-7 mrad by passing muons through total of 280 m of the crystal absorber. For a practical implementation, we suggest a storage ring configuration, where sections of crystal absorber are alternated with a conventional high gradient re-acceleration (20 MeV/m) inserts. The necessary circular confinement (bending) would be provided by additional sections of bent crystals -employing powerful steering features of bent silicon crystal demonstrated by recent experiments. Required cooling length of 280 m constitutes only about 2 × 10-3 of the muon lifetime in the laboratory frame (about 120 turns in our model 'cooling ring'). Dominant heating process (due to multiple scattering on electron gas inside a crystal channel) limits the minimum achievable emittance to about εN = 10-9, while the characteristic ionization cooling damping length is about 62.5 m.

Although there is documented evidence on poultry performance that hulless oats are a suitable feedstuff for poultry, there is little documentation on the effect of hulless oats as a poultry feedstuff on the sensory qualities of the meat. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of increasing dietary levels of hulless oats on the sensory quality of the broiler chicken meat and to ascertain if rancidity had developed during 3 mo of cold storage. Hulless oat dietary levels were assigned to a factorial arrangement of two sexes of broilers, three broiler starter diets (S0, S250, S500 g kg-1) and four grower diets (G0, G250, G500 and G750 g kg-1). Hulless oats of each diet replaced portions of the corn and soybeans of the control diet (S0/G0). Tenderness, juiciness, flavour intensity and muscle fibre integrity of the light meat; and tenderness, rubberiness, stringiness, juiciness and flavour intensity of the dark meat were evaluated by six selected assessors. Cooking data indicated a significant sex effect for oven-ready weight and grower oats level effect for weight loss during cooking. There were significant grower effects for tenderness and juiciness (P ≤ 0.05) of light meat. In the dark meat there was a significant sex effect (P ≤ 0.05) for stringiness; starter effect (P ≤ 0.05) for flavour; and grower effect for tenderness and juiciness (P ≤ 0.05). From a sensory perspective it appears that replacement of corn and soybeans in broiler grower diets by 500 g kg-1 of hulless oats decreases some sensory quality parameters. This was not found at 250 g kg-1 hulless oats.","Broiler chicken; Oat (hulless, naked); Sensory analysis; Thiobarbituric acid","Avena; Avena nuda; Gallus gallus; Glycine max; Nuda; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030493592

The congealed sludge in these tanks traps the gases beneath it and causes the level of the waste within the tanks to rise. The waste level continues to rise until the sludge loses its buoyancy and rolls over, changing places with fluid on top. During a rollover, the trapped gases are released, resulting in a sudden drop in the waste level. This is known as a gas release event (GRE). After a GRE, the waste re-congeals and gas again accumulates, leading to another GRE. We are interested in the time between consecutive GREs. Understanding the probabilistic behaviour of the time between consecutive GREs is important because the hydrogen and nitrous oxide gases released during a GRE are flammable and the ammonia that is released is a health risk. From a safety perspective, activity around such waste tanks should be halted when a GRE is imminent. With a credible probability model for the time between consecutive GREs, we can establish time windows in which waste tank research and maintenance activities can be safely performed. We discuss the application of non-linear time series models to this problem. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.","Hanford; Nuclear waste; Safety; Time-series","gas flows; radioactive wastes; tanks; waste reception facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030483666

Inst. for Plant Protection, PO Box 9060, NL-6700 GW Wageningen, Netherlands","Five phases can be distinguished in the post-application persistence of entomopathogenic nematodes and each phase is associated with a specific set of mortality factors. Pre-application factors associated with production, storage and transport conditions determine the survival rate and quality of nematodes at the time of application. The phase of tank mixing and application with a sprayer, hose or other equipment does not usually cause mortality as nematode dauer juveniles are quite tolerant of shear forces. The most critical periods for survival are the first few minutes and hours directly after application. High loses, in the order of 40-80%, often occur during this phase. Ultraviolet radiation and dehydration are probably the most important mortality factors. The remaining nematodes settle in the soil and their numbers gradually decrease at levels of 5-10% per day. Predation, infection by antagonists, depletion of energy and desiccation are probably the main mortality factors during this period. In most cases, after 2-6 weeks less than 1% of the applied population is still alive. Through recycling in host insects, nematodes may then persist for years at these levels. Thus, the pattern is a rapid decline in the first few days followed by a moderate decline over the next 2-6 weeks and then a long period of recycling at a low level. Some nematode species that normally occur in warmer climatic zones can also persist in colder climates. Major side-effects of applications of entomopathogenic nematodes are not likely to occur as the population density decreases to background levels within days or weeks after application. Furthermore, there is little or no migration of the nematodes to neighbouring fields. The relatively short period of persistence of entomopathogenic nematodes and the necessity of their populations to recycle frequently in hosts in order to survive make it unlikely that they could have major effects on non-target organisms. Their selectivity and beneficial traits as biological control agents outweigh the small risks of causing unwanted environmental disturbance in non-target populations.","biological control; entomopathogenic nematodes; Heterorhabditis; persistence; risk assessment; Steinernema","Heterorhabditis; Hexapoda; Insecta; Nematoda; Steinernema",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030482742

Such strategies can affect the net flux of carbon to the atmosphere through 4 mechanisms: storage of C in the biosphere; storage of C in forest products; use of biofuels to displace fossil-fuel use: use of wood products which often displaces other products that require more fossil fuel for their production. We use the mathematical model GORCAM (Graz/Oak Ridge Carbon Accounting Model) to examine these mechanisms for 16 land-use scenarios. Over long time intervals the amount of C stored in the biosphere and in forest products reaches a steady state and continuing mitigation of C emissions depends on the extent to which fossil fuel use is displaced by the use of bioenergy and wood products. The relative effectiveness of alternative forest and bioenergy strategies and their impact on net C emissions strongly depend, for example, on the productivity of the site, its current usage, and the efficiency with which the harvest is used. When growth rates are high and harvest is used efficiently, the dominant opportunity for net reduction in C emissions is seen to be fossil-fuel displacement. At the growth rates and efficiencies of harvest utilization adopted in many of our base scenarios, the net C balance at the end of 100 years is very similar whether trees are harvested and used for energy and traditional forest products, or reforestation and forest protection strategies are implemented. The C balance on a plantation system that provides a constant output of biomass products can look different than the balance of a single parcel of land.Forest and bioenergy strategies offer the prospect of reduced CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Such strategies can affect the net flux of carbon to the atmosphere through 4 mechanisms: storage of C in the biosphere; storage of C in forest products; use of biofuels to displace fossil-fuel use; use of wood products which often displaces other products that require more fossil fuel for their production.

Whether food intake is determined by the maximum rate at which animals can collect food, or by the rate at which this food can be processed, will strongly affect the organization of their behaviour. We investigated whether the digestive system imposes a constraint on (1) instantaneous rate of food acquisition, (2) total daily food consumption and (3) sustainable maximum energy expenditure in the Oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus. We measured the rate of food processing in captive birds from the cumulative loss of body mass after the consumption of various amounts of mussels, Mytilus edulis. 2. Mass loss associated with the digestion of food can be conveniently described by a three-parameter model. These parameters are: (1) latency time, the time interval that elapses between the ingestion of the first food item and the production of the first faeces (28.3 min), (2) evacuation rate, the rate with which digested food is defecated (0.233 g min-1) and (3) absorption coefficient, the proportion of the food (fresh mass) which is not defecated (11.3%). The value of all three parameters was independent of the amount of food consumed. 3. Since the birds absorbed 11.3% of the food, the rate of food processing is slightly higher than the evacuation rate and amounts to 0.263 g min-1. 4. Given the energy content of the food (3.58 kJ g-1 fresh mass) and an assimilation efficiency of 85.4%, the instantaneous rate of energy assimilation is 13.4 W. 5. An 80-g food storage capacity in the oesophagus enables the bird to continue digestion during most of the high-water roosting period. Consequently, the maximum amount of energy that can be assimilated during a 24-h day with two low-water feeding periods amounts to 1067 kJ, which equals 4.25 times the basal metabolic rate. This figure probably reflects the maximum sustained working level. 6. Free-living Oystercatchers collect food much faster than they are able to process it. A digestive bottleneck forces them to interrupt their feeding at regular intervals, even when they attempt to collect the maximum amount of food that can be dealt with by the digestive tract. The main implication of such a digestive bottleneck is that a considerable amount of time becomes available for activities other than feeding. In practice, most of this spare time is spent inactive and we will point out how some evolutionary oddities, such as laziness and individual differences in prey preferences, may have evolved as by-products of a digestive bottleneck.","absorption; energy assimilation; food consumption; laziness; maximum sustained working level Functional Ecology","Animalia; Aves; Haematopodidae; Haematopus ostralegus; Mytilus edulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030476986

Although the limited energy deposition from collisional activation in our experiments does not allow efficient fragmentation of large singly charged polypeptides with m/z higher than 1000, the problem may be partially solved by taking advantage of fragmenting the multiply charged ions produced from the electrospray ionization source as demonstrated for a synthetic polypeptide of molecular weight 2782. Compared to the singly charged form, the reduced m/z of multiply charged forms experience a greater trapping force as described by the pseudopotential well- depth model. Increased pseudopotential well-depths for multiply charged species permit the use of greater fragmentation energy at lower RF potentials. These conditions facilitate the fragmentation of large polypeptides, yet are suitable for trapping singly charged fragments. These experiments indicate that the high efficiency associated with ion dissociation and fragment-ion collection in the trap and the storage capability for detection of ions using the non-scanning mode of the IT/reTOF analyzer may provide an alternative means for acquiring sequence-specific information of polypeptides at low picomol levels of sensitivity.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030476375

This was accomplished using longitudinal mass gain records and the doubly labelled water technique on nursing pups in combination with cross-sectional data on changes in milk composition from bearded seal mothers. The pups (n = 3) were all less than a week old at the start of the experiments. Pups gained 3.3 ± 0.4 kg · day- 1 of which 50% was fat, 14% protein and 36%, water. Average daily water influx for the pups was 69.5 ± 9.0 ml · kg-1 · day-1. Average CO2 production during the study period was 0.99 ± 0.10 ml · g-1 · h-1 which corresponds to a field metabolic rate of 642 ± 67 kJ · kg-1 · day-1, or 6.0 ± 0.5 times the predicted basal metabolic rate according to Kleiber (1975). The pups drank an average of 7.6 ± 0.5 kg of milk daily. This corresponds to a daily energy intake of 154 ± 8 MJ, 47 ± 14% of which was stored as new body tissue. Despite this high energy intake bearded seal pups do not get as fat as do other nursing phocids. This is in part due to their larger body size but also due to their very active aquatic lifestyle and the lower and more consistent fat content of the milk compared to other phocid species. Bearded seal mothers forage during lactation and may also be involved in teaching their pups to feed independently. All these data suggest that the lactation strategy of bearded seals differs from the phocid norm.","Bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus; Behaviour; Energy consumption; Growth; Milk intake","Erignathus barbatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030476008

In both populations, fat deposition occurred shortly after the rainy season due to an increase in feeding activity. In contrast, the timing of reproduction varied between sites according to the availability of suitable water bodies. Nevertheless, females with mature oocytes were predominant during the dry season, even in populations that bred throughout the year in permanent ponds. This suggests that seasonal variations in the nutritional condition of adults may also result in a tendency towards cyclicity in the reproduction of B. marinus in tropical regions. Analyses of allometric relationships of reproductive and storage tissues with body weights indicated that the fractions of weights in reproductive tissues did not vary either with the size of females or between populations. On the contrary, not only did larger toads have proportionally larger fat bodies, but those from wet sites had greater fractions of weight allocated to fat bodies than those from dry sites. This suggests that reproductive output may be fixed in this species and, therefore, excess energy is allocated to fat bodies. Given that the initiation of ovarian cycles depends on the restoration of proper nutritional levels, energy stored in fat bodies during breeding may allow females to resume a new ovarian cycle shortly after spawning and thus maximize the number of reproductive events.","Bufo marinus; Fat deposition; Gonad development; Life-history traits; Tropical anurans","cane toad; reproduction; Venezuela; Bufo marinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030473432

The seasonal snow cover exerts a strong surface control on energy exchange, the high albedo suppressing solar radiation absorption and the cold surface temperatures limiting net longwave radiation losses. Turbulent energy fluxes during winter were very small and driven by the negative net radiation. The very thin snowpack that persisted throughout the winter meant that energy storage changes within the snow were negligible and the snowmelt period was very brief. When the tundra is snow-free, cloud cover is the most important determinant of the radiation budget through its influence on atmospheric transmissivity and longwave radiation fluxes. Local orographic cloud development provided an important negative feedback which countered the large solar irradiances that would otherwise be expected in high mountains during the summer. Both energy- and moisture-limiting evapotranspiration regimes occurred during both field seasons, governed largely by the frequency, rather than the magnitude, of precipitation events. In the absence of precipitation, the tundra desiccated rapidly due to the efficient drainage, limited soil moisture storage capacity, and the presence of quick-drying rock surfaces. Surface resistance measurements demonstrated the lack of efficiency in the transfer of subsurface moisture to the atmosphere during dry periods, and show that the change from a wet-surface evaporative regime to a dry-surface one is achieved very quickly.",,"alpine tundra; energy exchange; physical climatology; radiation budget measurement; snow cover; Canada, British Columbia, Scout Mountain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030471274

To better characterize molecular mechanisms that govern mechanical friction, we measured the rate of mechanical energy dissipation and the rate of actomyosin ATP utilization simultaneously in activated canine airway smooth muscle subjected to small periodic stretches as occur in breathing. The amplitude of the frictional stress is proportional to ηE, where E is the tissue stiffness defined by the slope of the resulting force vs. displacement loop and η is the hysteresivity defined by the fatness of that loop. From contractile stimulus onset, the time course of frictional stress amplitude followed a biphasic pattern that tracked that of the rate of actomyosin ATP consumption. The time course of hysteresivity, however, followed a different biphasic pattern that tracked that of shortening velocity. Taken together with an analysis of mechanical energy storage and dissipation in the cross-bridge cycle, these results indicate, first, that like shortening velocity and the rate of actomyosin ATP utilization, mechanical friction in airway smooth muscle is also governed by the rate of cross-bridge cycling; second, that changes in cycling rate associated with conversion of rapidly cycling cross bridges to slowly cycling latch bridges can be assessed from changes of hysteresivity of the force vs. displacement loop; and third, that steady-state force maintenance (latch) is a low- friction contractile state. This last finding may account for the unique inability of asthmatic patients to reverse spontaneous air ways obstruction with a deep inspiration.","cross bridge; hysteresis; resistance; shortening velocity","adenosine triphosphate; myosin adenosine triphosphatase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; animal tissue; article; asthma; controlled study; dog; energy expenditure; friction; muscle force; muscle stiffness; nonhuman; priority journal; trachea muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030470498

(Nature, 227, 304-305, 1970) and McCree, K.J. (Crop Sci., 14, 509-514, 1974), respiratory substances are used only for maintenance respiration when plants are exposed to the dark conditions for a long period of time (more than 2 d). The maintenance respiration is also affected by the nitrogen status in plant, because protein turnover is one of the major energy consumption sources under maintenance process. Therefore, to determine whether respiratory substances are used only for maintenance, 14C- [U] -sucrose or a mixture of 14C- [U] -amino acids was introduced to rice and soybean plants from the tip of leaf. Plants were grown under natural light conditions and under dark conditions for 4 d with 2 nitrogen levels (0.2 and 0.02 g N L-1 soil). After the introduction of the 14C-compounds, the 14CO2 respiratory rate was monitored during 24 h, then the 14C distribution to organic acids, free amino acids, proteins, sugars, and polysaccharides was analyzed. Following results were obtained. When 14C-[U]-sucrose or a mixture of 14C-[U]-amino acids was introduced to the leaf of rice and soybean plants, the 14C release rate by respiration was not affected by the nitrogen and light treatments except when 14C-sucrose was introduced to soybean in the low N plot. The 14C release rate from the 14C-compounds introduced into leaf in the low N plot of soybean was higher in the dark treatment than in the natural light treatment. 2. 14C-distribution ratio after introduction of 14C-sucrose and a mixture of 14C-amino acids to the leaf was not significantly affected by the nitrogen treatment. When 14C-sucrose was introduced to rice leaf, the 14C-distribution ratio to sugars and proteins was higher and that to polysaccharides was lower in the natural light treatment than in the dark treatment. The 14C-distribution ratio was less aifected by the light or nitrogen treatment in case of soybean leaf. 3. Although it was assumed that maintenance metabolism was dominant in the lower leaf (counted from the bottom), the 14C-distribution ratio was similar to that of upper leaf. 4. Nitrogen content of leaf was not different between rice and soybean in the high N treatment, unlike the 14C-distribution ratio. In rice, the nitrogen content of leaf was about twice as high in the high N treatment compared with the low N treatment, while the 14C-distribution ratio in leaf was stable regardless of nitrogen treatment. Based on the above results, it is suggested that since the 14C-distribution ratio into each chemical component did not change regardless of light treatment, nitrogen treatment, or leaf age, It was impossible to separate respiration into two components, such as growth and maintenance respiration. The results also indicated that current photosynthates and storage substances were not used only for growth and maintenance, respectively. © 1996 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon-nitrogen interaction; Current photosynthate respiration; Growth respiration; Maintenance respiration; Storage substance respiration","Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030469855

It was found that the trehalose levels of vegetative amoebae of D. discoideum and Polysphondylium pallidum increased to levels, comparable to those seen during multicellular development, during heat shock (30 C) or cold shock (4 C) and decreased during recovery (23 C) from thermal stress.

Data were collected as 30-min means. Energy available to the forest was measured with net radiometers and soil heat flux discs; sensible heat exchange between the canopy and atmosphere was measured with two ""One-Propeller Eddy Correlation"" (OPEC) systems, and latent energy (evapotranspiration or ET) was determined as a residual in the surface energy balance equation. Net rediation, change in thermal storage, and sensible heat flux were verified by independent measurements during the Hartheim Experiment (HartX, May 11-12), and again during the ""HartX2"" experiment over 20 days late in the summer (Sep. 10-29). Specifically, sensible heat estimates from the two adjacent OPEC sensor sets were in close agreement throughout the summer, and in excellent agreement with measurements of sonic eddy correlation systems in May and September. The eddy correlation/energy balance technique was observed to overestimate occurrence of dew, leading to an underestimate of daily ET of about 5%. After taking dew into account, estimates of OPEC ET totaled 358 mm over the 5.1-month period, which is in quite good agreement with an ET estimate of 328 mm from a hydrologic water balance. An observed decrease in forest ET in July and August was clearly associated with low rainfall and increased soil water deficit. The OPEC system required only modest technical supervision, and generated a data yield of 99.5% over the period DOY 144-288. The documented verification and precision of this energy budget appears to be unmatched by any other long-term forest study reported to date.",,"evapotranspiration; forest energy budget; heat flux; pine plantation; radiation; Scots pine; Germany, Baden-Wurttemberg, Freiburg, Hartheim",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030463490

By comparison, energy flow was much lower over the same period of time in diapausing gemmules, clearly demonstrating metabolic depression during diapause. The calorimetric:respirometric (CR) ratio increased significantly from -354 kJ/mol O2 to -541 kJ/mol O2 between hours 3.5 and 56.5 of germination, with an average value across this period of about -495 kJ/mol O2. The low CR ratio at hour 12.5 (-374 ± 21; ± 1 SE, n = 3) was statistically below the oxycaloric equivalent, which suggests that gemmules may have experienced hypoxia during the more than 3 months of storage at 5°C prior to experiments. The increase in metabolism during germination could be blocked by perfusing the gemmules with nitrogen- saturated medium (nominally oxygen free). Developing gemmules were able to survive oxygen limitation for several hours at least; during that time energy flow was depressed to 6% of normoxic values. During germination, the range of values was 3.5 to 4.0 nmol/mg protein for ATP, 0.2 to 0.4 nmol/mg protein for ADP, and 0.5 to 0.8 nmol/mg protein for AMP. Because ATP was high even before gemmules were warmed to room temperature, it is unlikely that levels were severely compromised during the diapause condition.",,"Eunapius fragilis; Eunapius fragilis; Spongillidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030462264

We have tested this hypothesis by examining five populations of Drosophila melanogaster that show increased longevity following laboratory selection for postponed reproduction. These were compared to five control populations. We measured body mass, lipid and carbohydrate content, metabolic rate, and fecundity over the adult life span of the flies. Energy content brought forward into the adult stage from the pupae and adult metabolic rate were identical for short- and long-lived flies. Long-lived flies showed decreased fecundity and increased storage of lipid and carbohydrate compared to short-lived flies. Our study is the first to measure simultaneously allocations of metabolic energy resources between various forms of metabolic storage and reproduction in lines of Drosophila melanogaster and to measure their equivalence using a common energy unit (J). Energy equivalence analysis demonstrated that the trade-off in energy allocation between fecundity and metabolic storage was not quantitatively perfect with regard to energy values. Long-lived flies accumulated additional lipid and carbohydrate by forgoing early reproduction, but these accumulated metabolic resources were far lower in energy content than were the additional eggs produced by short-lived flies.",,"Drosophila melanogaster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030456717

Soils were judged to contain ample water. Shortwave and total radiation flux densities were measured at both sites with pyranometers and total pyrradiometers. Soil heat flux densities were measured with heat flux plates at both sites, and additional storage changes were estimated for air and canopy at the forest site. The forest gained more shortwave energy than the grassland during daytime because of its lower albedo, but it lost more longwave radiation at night. The turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent energy were evaluated with the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method at both sites. Temperature and humidity gradients were measured with fixed psychrometers at the grassland site, and with interchanging psychrometers at the forest site. Mean daily evapotranspiration (ET) averaged 2.26 mm over the five days for the Scots pine, or only 57 percent of the 3.94 mm measured at the grassland site. The mean Bowen ratios were 2.6 and 0.8, respectively. An error analysis was carried out for the BREB estimates of latent heat flux at the two sites. For a given error in latent heat flux and at a specified Bowen ratio the demands on accuracy of dry- and wet-bulb temperature gradients above the rough forest canopy was found to be 10 times higher than above the smoother grassland. If additionally the observed differences in transpiration rates between the two sites were taken into account, the precision for temperature gradient measurements above the slowly transpiring forest becomes fortyfold greater than required above the rapidly transpiring grass. At present, BREB precision requirements for gradients above rougher, drier canopies appear achievable only through use of specialized instrumentation, such as measurement systems that incorporate interchangeable psychrometers into their design.",,"energy balance; evapotranspiration; forest; grassland; HartX experiment; longwave radiation; pine plantation; Scots pine; shortwave energy; Germany, Baden-Wurttemberg, Freiburg, Rhine Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030452564

This is especially true for enzymes involved in the storage of energy such as the lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes in the liver and adipose tissue. We review in the present paper the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of glycolytic and lipogenic enzyme gene expression by glucose. In vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that FAS and ACC gene expression is upregulated by glucose in adipose tissue, FAS, ACC and L-PK expression in the liver and ACC and L-PK expression in a pancreatic β-cell line. This regulation involves the stimulation of their transcription. In order for glucose to act as a gene inducer, it must be metabolized. In adipose tissue, insulin increases indirectly the expression of FAS and ACC by stimulating glucose metabolism through its well-known effect on glucose transport, In the liver, the action of insulin is also indirect by allowing the expression of glucokinase and hence by increasing glucose metabolism. In the liver, fructose has a potentiating effect on the stimulation of gene expression by glucose through its stimulatory effect on glucokinase activity. Several evidences suggest that glucose-6-phosphate is the signal metabolite: (i) the effect of glucose is mimicked by 2-deoxyglucose (a glucose analogue whose metabolism stops after its phosphorylation by hexokinase) in adipose tissue and β-cell line but not in the liver in which 2-deoxyglucose-6- phosphate does not accumulate, (ii) intracellular glucose-6-phosphate concentration varies in parallel with ACC, FAS and L-PK mRNA concentrations in liver, adipose tissue and β-cell line, (iii) in vivo, the kinetics of hexose-phosphate fits with the time-related pattern of gent induction. Glucose response elements have been characterized on three genes, L-PK, S14 (a gene which codes for a protein of unknown function but which is directly related to lipogenesis) and FAS. These glucose response elements have all in common the presence of a sequence 5'-CACGTG-3' which binds a transcription factor of the basic domain, helix-loop-helix, leucine zipper family called USF/MLTF, although the organization of the overall glucose response element probably differs from one gene to another. The mechanisms linking glucose-6- phosphate to the glucose responsive transcription complex are presently largely unknown.",,"fatty acid synthase; fructose; glucokinase; glucose; glucose 6 phosphate; hormone; insulin; lipid; adipose tissue; animal; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; conference paper; enzyme activity; enzymology; gene expression regulation; gene induction; genetics; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; glycolysis; lipogenesis; liver; metabolism; nonhuman; nutrition; pancreas islet beta cell; rat; signal transduction; transcription initiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030446644

The estimated reproductive success of territorial males was a thousand times greater than that of non-territorial males, suggesting that males should fight hard to become, and remain, territorial. Our results show that the ability to win fights, and therefore be territorial, is dependent on energy reserves (fat). Energy reserves were correlated with the age of the individual. Young, pre-territorial, males had excess fat; territorial males that had gained their territory by fighting had intermediate fat reserves; older males that had been displaced from a territory had very low levels of fat.

Moreover, the aim was to see when small spat (15 mm) could be seeded, and thus reduce the costs of intermediate culture. Three monitoring approaches were used together: (1) continual observations by remote video camera, of a defined area (less than 1 m2) containing 10 scallops from each size group; (2) daily monitoring of behaviour with divers along three bottom lines, with 20 × 1 m2 plots each and nine marked scallops per plot; and (3) the biochemical content of the muscle: adenylic energetic charge and storage of energy reserves (glucides, proteins, lipids). The video monitoring identified but did not quantify predator behaviour, particularly at night. The role and behaviour of spiny crab, Maia squinado, and of small predators has clearly been shown, such as: (a) small crustaceans, Inachus sp., breaking the edges of scallop valves; and (b) small gobies, Pomatoschistus pictus, pecking the tentacles of the scallop mantle. For the monitoring by divers, filtering appeared much too difficult to look at for it was very disturbed by divers, and anyway the resumption of filtering came immediately after seeding. On the other hand, diver monitoring of dispersal and recessing was quite easy to do with a minimum of practice. On the basis of dispersal, the best seasons for seeding appear to be spring or summer. In autumn, two-thirds of 'small' and 'medium' juveniles are missing 3 days after seeding, but we could not observe whether they had been eaten by predators or had just moved and recessed farther. There was no experiment in winter owing to adverse conditions for scallop seedings. Biochemical analyses confirmed the unsuitability of autumn for scallop seeding, because of very low glucide content in this season. The adenylic energetic charge in the smooth part of the muscle showed that stress before seeding (aerial exposure, handling), and post-seeding behaviour (swimming, recessing) have a high energetic cost for scallops. In summer and autumn, 3 days after seeding, none of the three size batches recovered their initial vitality. © 1996 Chapman &amp; Hall.","Behaviour; Great scallop (Pecten maximus); Season; Seeding; Size; Vitality of spat","behaviour; great scallop; juveniles; mortality; predation; reseeding; scallop culture; seed (aquaculture); seeding; vitality; Bivalvia; Decapoda; Inachus; Maia squinado; Pecten maximus; Pomatoschistus pictus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030439322

Individuals that vary in body size and swallowing capacity will therefore differ not only in energy requirements but also in rates of food intake. Here I show that size-frequency distribution of available prey may be an important determinant of life-history evolution in snakes and other gape-limited predators. A simple model is presented for the rate of net energy gain of gape-limited predators during food scarcity as a function of body size and swallowing capacity of the predator. Net energy gain is defined as the difference between rates of energy intake and expenditure while searching for prey, and thus represents the energetic scope available for growth, storage, reproduction, and survival. The model suggests that rate of energy intake will increase asymptotically with predator body size until it reaches an asymptote that differs depending on the size-frequency distribution of available prey. Rate of net energy gain will reach a maximum at intermediate or large predator size, but shift towards smaller predator body size if energy demands increase, maximum ingestible prey size increases more rapidly with predator size, or if mean body size of available prey decreases. Variation in swallowing capacity among equal-sized predators results in a difference in net energy gains that is at a maximum in intermediate-sized individuals. The model generates seven testable predictions. (1) Smaller body size does not confer an energetic advantage during periods of prey scarcity. (2) Mortality due to energy shortage sets lower and upper limits to body size. (3) Temporal shifts in size-frequency distribution of prey will result in oscillating survival selection on body size. (4) The proportion of resources allocated to energy storage and reproduction should increase with increasing body size at the expense of energy allocated to growth. (5) The reproductive advantage of large body size in females will increase with prey availability. (6) The intensity of selection on characters determining swallowing capacity will vary with body size and be lowest in larger individuals. (7) Discrimination against small prey is more likely among larger than among smaller individuals.

In this model, the evaporation of intercepted water and transpiration are calculated on a leaf basis as solutions of the energy budget equation, under the calculated microclimate within the canopy. Profiles of radiation intensity, wind speed, air temperature, and specific humidity within and above the canopy are calculated from a combination of equations for radiative energy transfer, atmospheric diffusion for momentum, sensible heat, and water vapor, and an equation of atmospheric turbulent kinetic energy. Through comparisons with laboratory experiments and field observations, the model was found to yield a good estimation of the evaporation from intercepted water on the basis of both a single leaf and the entire canopy. During a calculation, a negative sensible heat flux was simulated, exhibiting general agreement with observations, and providing the energy for the evaporation of intercepted water under low-radiation conditions. In addition to the mechanical turbulence resulting from the large forest roughness, thermally induced turbulence beneath the canopy is also found to be responsible for the negative sensible heat flux.

The aim of this study was to quantify fatty replacement in patients with McArdle's disease. Calf and thigh axial spin echo T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images (repetition time 500 ms, echo time 25 ms) were obtained at 0.5 T in nine patients with McArdle's disease (age 51 ± 16 years, range 26-74) and nine sex- and age- matched healthy subjects (age 52 ± 16 years, range 29-78) to quantify intramuscular fat. Regions of interest were drawn manually, encompassing the largest cross section of muscle. A fatty replacement index (IF) was determined from histograms of signal in the regions of interest in calf and thigh muscles. In normal subjects, IF = 3.6 ± 2.8% in calf and 4.9 ± 2.3% in thigh. In patients, IF = 11 ± 9.3% in calf and 13.5 ± 10.4% in thigh, significantly different from IF values in normal subjects (p = .03). IF correlated well with age in patients (p = .03). In older patients, up to 25% of the muscle volume was replaced by fat. Patients with McArdle's disease, usually weakly disabled, exhibit significant muscle fatty replacement on MR images. These findings suggest a progressive muscle loss over time related to the disease process.","Magnetic resonance imaging; McArdle's disease; Muscle diseases; Muscular glygogenoses","adult; aged; article; body fat; clinical article; controlled study; disabled person; female; gastrocnemius muscle; glycogen storage disease type 5; glycogenolysis; human; male; muscle atrophy; muscle fatigue; myoglobinuria; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; thigh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030427145

The diameter of some bruise areas increased during storage for 2 months. Aroma was the more sensitive cultivar and Cox's Orange Pippin was the more resistive against bruising. In order to compare bruise quantifying methods, we studied number, diameter, weight and volume of bruise.

However, such complex models require super-computers and extensive hours of computational time for a single attempt at reproducing long term climate change. An alternative approach is to make simplifying assumptions that retain the essential physics for the desired simulation. Energy balance and Radiative-convective models are examples of such models. The model in this study follows the simplified approach using physics-based climate processes as well as interactions between atmospheric and hydrological processes. The vertically and latitudinally averaged mean temperature and mean water vapour content between 30°N-50°N latitudes are considered as atmospheric state variables while soil and sea temperatures and water storage amount are considered for describing the behaviour of the hydrological system. Temperatures in both the atmosphere and ground are calculated by a thermal energy equation that considers the physically-based processes of shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux. Precipitation and evaporation processes transport moisture between the atmosphere and ground. In this study, the radiation parameterization of the simplified climate model is tested in the investigation of the various effects of global warming due to doubling and quadrupling of CO2. Changes of temperature, soil water content, evaporation rate and precipitation rate are investigated by numerical experiments. The simplified climate model provides acceptable simulation of climate change and holds promise for practical investigations such as the interactions of physical processes in the evolution of drought phenomena. © 1996 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"Carbon dioxide; Drought; Earth atmosphere; Environmental impact; Evaporation; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Thermal effects; Weather modification; Radiation parameters; Climate change; atmospheric processes; carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; climate model; global warming; hydrological processes; radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030418732

The key to their success is simplicity (direct coupling, no dc-ac conversion, no storage batteries, etc.). Because of the relatively high cost of the PV array, the system designer is interested in maximizing its utilization efficiency. A PV powered dc motor can also be used to drive a three-phase self-excited induction generator (SEIG). This arrangement is useful as part of an integrated renewable energy system (IRES), which takes advantage of the inherent diversity of wind and solar energy in most developing countries to improve power quality. The SEIG is driven by a wind-turbine, dc motor, or both. Another advantage of this arrangement is its versatile control characteristics through the dc motor control.

The glycogen and lipid content of the reserve organs reaches maximum values between late summer and early autumn. The energy requirements related to gametogenesis, which begins in autumn, involve the consumption of accumulated reserves with the resulting reduction in the condition indices. There is a positive correlation between temperature and the condition indices of the digestive gland, the adductor muscle and their lipid and glycogen content, respectively.

The crude oil denoted as SEB (Soviet Export Blend) was used to obtain the B 65 sample. Ten PMB samples were produced by modifying the bitumen with the so called polyfunetional additives (PA) which were produced by mixing SBR- and SBS-elastomer and 25/75, 50/50 and 75/25 SBR/SBS mixtures with a fatty acid distillation residue. PA contents in PMB amounted to either 3 or 5 wt %. The PMB samples were obtained by a simple stirring operation (a usual stirrer with 300 r.p.m) and represented the stable homogeneous mixtures. Some standardized examinations and the determination of the dynamic mechanical properties were used for the characterization of the PMB samples. SBR-elastomer lowered the Fraass breaking point slightly more than SBS-elastomer. In PMB samples which contained more SBS- than SBR-elastomer, the softening point increase was the main cause for the broader interval of plasticity. If SBR-elastomer prevailed, Fraass point decrease contributed more to the greater broadness of the interval of plasticity. SBS-elastomer caused a higher increase of the softening point than SBR-elastomer. The elastic recovery measurements showed that even 5 wt % of SBR-elastomer in PMB was not enough to reach the 50% value. This important demand could be satisfied only if the elastomer part of PA contained 50% or more of SBS-elastomer. The master curves of the dynamic viscosity or the storage shear modulus versus reduced frequency were used to examine the influence of the SBR/SBS ratio in PMB samples on their viscoelastic parameters. The Zero shear storage modulus G′ 0 , value of G′ at 20 and 60 °C. the glass transition temperature as a loss modulus peak temperature (G″ peak) and the inflection point of turndown of the modulus G′ at the glass transition region, as well as the flow activation energies and viscosities were determined. Compared to SBR-elastomer, SBS-elastomer caused a greater increase of viscosity and flow activation energies. The presented results showed that a balanced improvement in both the low-and high-temperature thermomechanical properties of PMB was attainable by addition of mixtures of SBS- and SBR-elastomer.",,"Activation energy; Additives; Crude petroleum; Elastomers; Fatty acids; Glass transition; High temperature properties; Mixing; Mixtures; Rheology; Temperature; Viscosity; Bitumen; Polyfunctional additives; Polymer modified bitumen; Soviet export blend; Polymer blends",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030406906

Its effect on speed/power improvement was evaluated with a ring oscillator. A speed improvement of 15% and a 17% reduction in power dissipation was obtained as compared with conventional non-local wiring structures. This technique was applied to a practical device application, that is, a 0.35 [j.m embedded dual port SRAM used as a buffer memory in an asynchronous transfer mode switch (ATM-SW) LSI. In order to suppress the coupling noise between the write and read bitlines with the small cell realized by the local wiring scheme, a new divided layer 'bitline architecture was developed. As a result, reduction of SRAM macro size of 31% was attained by also applying the local wiring scheme to peripheral circuits, such as decoder, sense amplifier, and driver. A detailed analysis on this embedded dual port SRAM revealed a 15.2% reduction of write port power at 3.3 V. It is also shown that the local wiring technique is more effective with low power supply voltages to allow for further power reduction.","Coupling noise; Embedded sram; Junction capacitance; Local wiring","Amorphous silicon; Asynchronous transfer mode; Buffer storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy dissipation; LSI circuits; Oscillators (electronic); Random access storage; Semiconductor device structures; Titanium; Asynchronous transfer mode switch; Junction capacitance; Peripheral circuits; Ring oscillator; Source drain junction; Electric wiring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030402853

Unfortunately, the presence of THT in medium other than natural gas can be responsible for safety problems.

The ability of transplanted liver tissue to regenerate ATP at normal levels is desirable for early post- operative recovery of liver function.

Capture from advanced combustion systems offers a further opportunity to significantly reduce cost and energy requirements of CO2 capture compared to that from today's pulverized coal power plants. No viable disposal options exist today for large quantities of captured CO2. Ocean disposal of CO2 and geological storage, especially in depleted oil and gas wells, are leading candidates. Although some niche utilization may occur, utilization seems unlikely to become a major sequestration option.

The composite materials considered were made up of unidirectional glass, graphite fibers in an epoxy matrix, and hybrids of glass-graphite/epoxy produced by the pultrusion manufacturing process. The dynamic storage modulus and loss factor of the rectangular and circular cross-section samples were first evaluated using the nondestructive impulse-frequency response vibration technique. The long and slender flat specimens were analyzed in both extensional and flexural modes of vibration in a free-free test configuration, whereas the thicker round specimens were analyzed only in the axial mode of vibration. The properties of the monofiber type glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy composites were used as input to the finite element model for predicting and experimental validation of various pultruded (and hypothetical) glass-graphite/epoxy hybrid combinations. The modal strain energy method was used for computing the structural loss factors of the hybrid specimens based on the element stiffness matrices and estimated mode shapes in the fundamental mode of vibration. Results of this investigation showed excellent agreement between experimental data and numerical predictions for the dynamic extensional properties of both flat and round specimens. The numerical results for dynamic flexural properties of flat specimens were found to have a similar trend as that obtained from the experimental technique. Small variations in flexural properties could be attributed to the irregular shapes (which were not taken into account in the finite element model) of layers in the hybrid combinations formed during the pultrusion manufacturing process. Results also demonstrated that while the extensional properties were independent of the fiber location and fiber packing geometry, the flexural properties were highly dependent upon these two factors. Previously reported data (which was obtained by testing these flat hybrid specimens in the flexural mode of vibration in a clamped-free boundary condition) were re-analyzed using the free-free configuration and modal strain energy method, yielding more reasonable results.",,"Bending strength; Boundary conditions; Epoxy resins; Finite element method; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Graphite fiber reinforced plastics; Nondestructive examination; Stiffness matrix; Vibrations (mechanical); Fiber packing geometry; Modal strain energy method; Nondestructive impulse frequency response vibration technique; Pultruded glass graphite/epoxy hybrids; Structural loss factors; Fiber reinforced plastics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030385288

As a major constitutive mineral in natural geologic systems, quartz was selected for study. Dissolution experiments were carried out in a continuous-flow, titanium autoclave reactor system at 100-200°C in various chemical environments. Acidification to pH 1.1 using nitric acid showed very little effect on the quartz dissolution rate. The effect of hydroxide ion concentration and ionic strength were evaluated in NaOH, NaOH/NaCl and NaOH/Na2SO4 solutions. The fractional-order dependency of the quartz dissolution rate on hydroxide ion and sodium ion (or ionic strength) concentration was determined in NaOH/NaCl solutions. The results that extend the available range of kinetic data for quartz generally agree with previous work. The observed fractional-order kinetics were qualitatively described using classical adsorption isotherms. No significant variation in the apparent reaction order of the hydroxide ion with increasing temperature could be determined due to the scatter in the data. Quartz dissolution rates were slower by about 40% in NaOH/Na2SO4 solutions than in NaOH/NaCl solutions at sodium concentrations higher than 0.01 molal.

The main feature of the drive is that, rather than giving a continuous conversion of input speed and torque, this drive operates in a pulsed manner, storing packets of input energy in a spring and releasing the energy to the load. By controlling the storage and release of energy by means of clutches, it is possible to make the drive emulate a wide range of gear ratios in both forward and reverse directions. The effective ratio can be altered as each pulse is transferred, allowing rapid adjustment of the output speed and torque. Furthermore, by consideration of the internal dynamics of the system, it is shown that it is possible to devise controllers which avoid clutch engagement when there is movement between plates, thus avoiding slip and reducing wear. A practical realisation of the drive is presented which can transmit up to 100W of mechanical power with an effective ratio of between 1:3.2 and 1.3:1 at an efficiency greater than 70%.",,"Algorithms; Control systems; Energy storage; Gears; Mathematical models; Optimization; Oscillations; Performance; Position control; Speed control; Torque; Gear ratios; Internal dynamics; Position control system; Slip; Switched mode variable ratio drive; Variable speed drives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030380477

It is a liquid, which is advantageous in terms of storage, delivery, and infrastructural compatability. Ethanol burns relatively cleanly, especially as the amount of gasoline with which it is blended decreases. Evaporative and toxicity-weighted air toxics emissions are consistently lower for ethanol than for gasoline. It is likely that vehicles can be configured so that exhaust emissions of priority pollutants are very low for ethanol-burning engines, although the same can probably be said for most other fuels under consideration. Recent work suggests that ethanol may be more compatible with fuel cell - powered vehicles than has generally been assumed. Research and development - driven advances have clear potential to lower the price of cellulosic ethanol to a level competitive with bulk fuels. Process areas with particular potential for large cost reductions include biological processing (with consolidated bioprocessing particularly notable in this context), pretreatment, and incorporation of an advanced power cycle for cogeneration of electricity from process residues. The cellulosic ethanol fuel cycle has a high thermodynamic efficiency (useful energy/high heating value = from 50% to over 65% on a first law basis, depending on the configuration), and a decidedly positive net energy balance (ratio of useful energy output to energy input). Cellulosic ethanol is one of the most promising technogical options available to reduce transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. It may well be possible to develop biomass-based energy on a very large scale in the United States with acceptable and in some cases positive environmental impacts. To do so will however require responsible management and increased understanding of relevant technological and natural systems. The potential biomass resource is large, but so is demand for transportation fuels as well as other uses. The following hypotheses are offered as tentative hypotheses pertaining to biomass supply and demand in the United States: There will probably not be enough suitable land available to meet transportation demand if total vehicle miles traveled increase relative to current levels, and vehicle efficiency and animal protein utilization are unchanged. There probably is enough suitable land to meet transportation demand, even given some increase in vehicle miles traveled, given large but probably possible increases in vehicle efficiency, or large but probably possible decreases in reliance on animal protein, or a combination of less aggressive changes in both of these factors. The policy debate concerning fuel ethanol has tended to ignore cellulosic ethanol. It is suggested that an appropriate policy objective is to foster a transition to cellulosic feedstocks at a pace such that opportunities for ethanol producers and the farmers that supply them are expanded rather than contracted.","Biomass; Environment; Ethanol; Fuel","Biomass; Cellulose; Ecology; Economics; Evaluation; Cellulosic biomass; Cellulosic ethanol fuel cycle; Gas emissions; Ethanol fuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030378473

In normal incidence the sensitive areas have been identified with pulsed laser irradiation. The laser power thresholds have been determined for single to quadruple upsets in adjacent cells. Both experimental data and 3D simulations emphasize the role of delayed charge collection, by diffusion, and charge sharing between sensitive areas. Upset tracks have been recorded at grazing angle and used to determine the charge collection depth. These data revealed the existence of an LET threshold for MBU at grazing angle. As the ion LET increases different types of tracks are observed and correlated to the topological pattern in adjacent memory cells. This phenomenon is due to an unexpected charge collection mechanism, which couples adjacent sensitive areas and results in charge transfer between memory cells. The comparison with previous data on the same device indicates a strong influence of both ion energy and angle of incidence on the cross section, emphasizing the intrinsic limitation of standard characterizations with low energy ions.

The AMEn content of the grains was determined in 10 experiments in which the corn was incorporated in a diet designated for the evaluation of AMEn by the substitution method. These determinations were carried out with male broiler chicks at 15 to 17 d of age. The chemical composition of the grains did not change during storage, except for a significant (P &lt; 0.02) increase in lysine and a decrease in valine levels. Moreover, the AMEn content was not affected significantly (P &gt; 0.05) by storage duration.

These complexes of protein and lipid impart solubility to otherwise insoluble lipids. The apoprotein components of lipoprotein complexes serve to stabilize the lipid components and modulate particle metabolism and function as ligands for receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins. We have used an insect (Manduca sexta) model system for studies of lipid transport. In this system, flight activity elicits a dramatic increase in the demand for glycerolipid fuel molecules by flight muscle tissue. These lipids are mobilized from a storage organ and transported through the hemolymph (blood) to the flight muscle by the lipoprotein, lipophorin. This system possesses the unique property that lipids are loaded onto pre-existing high density lipophorin through the action of a lipid transfer particle (LTP). LTP is a high molecular weight hemolymph component that facilitates net vectorial lipid transfer from fat body tissue to lipophorin. The increase in lipid content of the lipoprotein induces association of a low molecular weight amphipathic exchangeable apolipoprotein, apolipophorin III (apoLp-III). ApoLp-III is a 18 kDa protein that normally exists as a water-soluble monomeric hemolymph protein. The structural properties of apoLp-III have been investigated by X-ray crystallography. ApoLp-III from Locusta migratoria adopts a five helix bundle conformation wherein each of the amphipathic helices orients with its hydrophobic face directed toward the interior of the bundle. It has been hypothesized that lipid association requires a dramatic conformational change wherein the helix bundle opens about putative hinge domains located in the loops between helices. The data accumulated support the concept that apoLp-III is a member of the broad class of exchangeable apolipoproteins and structural information learned from this system is directly applicable to analogous proteins in higher organisms.","Apoprotein; Diacylglycerol; Lipid transport; Lipoprotein; Manduca sexta","apolipophorin iii; apolipoprotein; carrier protein; GLTP protein, human; glycolipid; hybrid protein; ligand; lipid transfer protein; lipoprotein; animal; biochemistry; Canada; chemical structure; chemistry; endocytosis; energy metabolism; flying; genetics; grasshopper; hemolymph; history; human; Lepidoptera; macromolecule; metabolism; physiology; protein conformation; review; structure activity relation; X ray crystallography; Animals; Apolipoproteins; Biochemistry; Canada; Carrier Proteins; Crystallography, X-Ray; Endocytosis; Energy Metabolism; Flight, Animal; Glycolipids; Grasshoppers; Hemolymph; History, 20th Century; Humans; Ligands; Lipoproteins; Macromolecular Substances; Manduca; Models, Molecular; Protein Conformation; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Structure-Activity Relationship",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030344951

The model predicts that the result of the abrupt p-n junction depletion capacitance (linear medium model) is the limit of the ferroelectric p-n junction model (non-linear medium) when the polarization approaches zero. The results of the model are applied successfully to 60/40 PZT capacitors where the intrinsic heterogeneity (high, electron concentration in the near surface region) is always present due to high oxygen vacancy concentration. Both the linear and the nonlinear models are reasonable at high voltages but only the non-linear model is accurate at lower voltages.

The present work has been designed to describe the sensible heat partition between soil and the atmosphere, and to develop simple methods for calculating soil heat flux from soil properties and meteorological data. The relative influences of soil properties and meteorological conditions on the soil energy balance were determined in three fields during sugar beet establishment (April-May) in Northern France in 1991. The three soils differred in their texture (sandy loam, loamy and chalky soils), and consequently in albedo, thermal and hydraulic properties. Soil heat fluxes were estimated by the heat storage method using soil temperature, water content and bulk density measured between soil surface and 0.5 m. Soil heat capacity was estimated from the soil water content and bulk density. Soil thermal conductivity was determined from measurements of soil heat flux and temperature gradients. Atmospheric sensible heat flux was estimated by a two levels aerodynamic method. Solar and net radiations were measured continuously. Meteorological conditions and soil properties variations induced different magnitude of soil and atmospheric sensible heat fluxes. Diurnal soil heat fluxes varied with soil thermal conductivity, and atmospheric heat fluxes varied with albedo. The daily ratios of soil heat flux and atmospheric sensible heat flux to net radiation, like that of soil to atmospheric sensible heat flux, were not constant. They were a function of wind speed at daily time scale. To calculate hourly soil heat fluxes, a simple sinusoidal function was introduced to account for the phase shift between soil heat flux and net radiation or atmospheric sensible heat flux. The hourly soil heat flux was then calculated as the product of its diurnal ratio to net radiation, that can be estimated from wind speed measurements, by the sinusoidal function. This provided calculations of the soil heat flux with a satisfactory accuracy for soils where the surface is dry, and where there is little evaporation.",,"Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; atmosphere; bare soil; boundary layer; sensible heat flux; soil energy balance; soil properties; sugar beet; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030303417

I investigated factors influencing diet selection at two sites on the West Knoll of Niwot Ridge, Boulder County, Colorado during 1991 and 1992. The composition of summer and winter diets differed significantly from each other as well as from the relative abundance of food items in the environment. Thus, pikas were not foraging randomly for either diet. To explore winter and summer diet selection, I tested two existing hypotheses: (1) that plant morphology restricts the winter diet breadth to plants that are easily harvested and large, and thereby maximizes the amount collected per foraging effort, or (2) to compensate for nutrients lost during storage, pikas bias their winter diet with high-nutrient species. I also tested the hypothesis that plant secondary compounds may be higher in the winter diet either because they function as preservatives or because pikas delay consumption of these species until the toxins degrade. For individual dietary items, I measured energy, nitrogen, water, fiber, total phenolic, condensed tannin, and astringency contents. There was little evidence to suggest that morphology excluded plants from the winter diet. Plant size was not a good predictor of abundance in the winter diet. Even after harvesting costs had been experimentally removed, cushion plants were still not included in the winter diet. There was weak support for an effect of nutrients on winter diet selection; in three of four cases, the winter diet was significantly lower in water and higher in total energy content as predicted by the nutrient compensation hypothesis. However, other nutrients exhibited no consistent pattern. Nutrients were not reliable predictors of the winter diet in multiple regression analyses. There was strong support for the hypothesis of manipulation of secondary compounds. The winter diet was significantly higher in total phenolics and astringency. Total phenolics were consistent predictors of the winter diet in multiple regression analyses. The winter diets of six additional pika populations contained plant species high in secondary compounds. The results suggest that pikas preferentially select plants with high levels of secondary compounds for their winter diet, possibly because the presence of such compounds promotes preservation of the cache. This behavior may also enable the exploitation of an otherwise unusable food resource, i.e., toxic plants.","Diet selection; Herbivory; Nutrients; Ochotona princeps; Phenolics","Ochotona princeps; Ochotona princeps; cache; diet; herbivory; pika; secondary compound; winter; USA, Colorado, Front Range, Niwot Ridge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030300995

Only under certain and restricted conditions can these decay times be acceptably long. A significant increase in fixed ionic hologram lifetime is realized in lithium niobate with a low hydrogen-impurity content.

This study was conducted to investigate the curing characteristics of light-cured composites and their related mechanical properties. Methods. Single-edge notch specimens [25 mm × 2.5 mm × 5 mm with a 5 mm notch (a/W = 0.5)] were prepared for fracture toughness measurements. For flexural strength testing, a stainless steel mold (25 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm) was used. Light-cured composites were condensed into the mold, and the middle third of the specimen was first activated for 30 s with 400 mW/cm2, for 60 s with 200 mW/cm2, or for 120 s with 100 mW/cm2. Then the remaining thirds were activated at the same intensity and curing time as the middle third. After 24 h storage in 37°C water, three-point bending tests were performed with a span length of 20 mm at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. A one-way ANOVA, followed by a Newman-Keuls test (p &lt; 0.05), were used to compare the data obtained from each group to test the effect of the curing conditions. Results. Fracture toughness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus varied with resin composites. Among the three curing conditions for each material, there were no significant differences in fracture toughness, flexural strength, or flexural modulus. Significance. The fracture toughness and the flexural strength were the same when irradiations with the same amount of energy (light intensity multiplied by curing time) were used. It was found that, at lower light intensity, longer curing was required to provide comparable mechanical properties. An accumulated irradiation energy obtained through a product of the light intensity and curing time may serve as a guideline to produce samples exhibiting equivalent fracture toughness as well as flexural strenths.",,"Herculite XR; palfique estelite; Photo Clearfil A; polymer; resin; resin cement; silicon dioxide; Z100 composite resin; zirconium; analysis of variance; article; chemistry; comparative study; light; materials testing; particle size; pliability; radiation exposure; tensile strength; Analysis of Variance; Composite Resins; Light; Materials Testing; Particle Size; Pliability; Polymers; Resin Cements; Silicon Dioxide; Tensile Strength; Zirconium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030276403

The perikarya located primarily in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus constitute a common source of NPY. Projections from these neurons along two distinct pathways, namely, the reproductive axis of the ARC-median eminence-medial preoptic area and the orexigenic axis of the ARC-paraventricular nucleus and neighboring regions, participate in regulation of these two neuroendocrine functions. Additionally, the NPY neuronal system within the basal hypothalamus is morphologically and functionally linked with galanin and the opioid networks which also play roles in the control of reproduction and ingestive behavior. Recent experimental evidence indicates that genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that cause nutritional imbalance and metabolic disturbances, along with depressed pituitary gonadal function, produce alterations in the synthesis, storage, and release of NPY and in other connected peptidergic systems in the hypothalamus. The current findings summarized in this review support our concept that NPY may be one of the essential messenger molecules that serve as a communication bridge between the neural processes that regulate reproduction and those that maintain energy homeostasis. Modification in information flow within this peptidergic network due to nutritional imbalance may adversely impact hypothalamo- pituitary-gonadal function.","Galanin; hypothalamus; infertility; Neuropeptide Y; nutrition; opioid","galanin; insulin; neuropeptide Y; opiate; appetite; arcuate nucleus; article; diet restriction; energy balance; human; infertility; lactation; nerve cell network; nutritional status; perikaryon; priority journal; reproduction; risk factor; sexual behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030272305

Two thin diaphragms make up a segmented ring electrode; the end cap electrodes are planar wire mesh. The potential field produced by the rf voltage applied between the ring and end cap electrodes resembles that of the cylindrical ion trap. The trapped ion population for ions created by electron impact exhibits linear growth against a first-order loss that has a time constant of about 50 μs; no ion loss occurs when the electron beam is off. The observed value of q(z) at low-mass cutoff for rf ion storage is - 0.84. Pulsed extraction of all ions is accomplished by switching the trap electrodes from rf to voltages required to provide a linear dc extraction field. The TOF flight path includes a wide energy range reflectron. Better than unit mass resolution is achieved through m/z 500 without collisional ion cooling. With an extraction rate of 1 kHz and a recording rate of 4 spectra per second, a linear working curve is obtained between 36 pg and 18 ng of chlorobenzene delivered chromatographically.

The experiment was developed by Hughes Aircraft Company to validate in zero-g space a 65 K cryogenic system for focal planes, optics, instruments or other equipment (gamma-ray spectrometers and infrared and submillimetre imaging instruments) that requires continuous cryogenic cooling. The CSE is funded by the NASA Office of Advanced Concepts and Technology's IN-STEP and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The overall goal of the CSE was to validate and characterize the on-orbit performance of the two thermal management technologies that comprise a hybrid cryogenic system. These thermal management technologies consist of (1) a second-generation long-life, low-vibration, Stirling-cycle 65 K cryocooler that was used to cool a simulated thermal energy storage device (TRP) and (2) a diode oxygen heat pipe thermal switch that enables physical separation between a cryogenic refrigerator and a TRP. All CSE experiment objectives and 100% of the experiment success criteria were achieved.

The physical module consists of a tube which is surrounded by an external coaxial cylinder made up of several segments of different PCMs with different melting points. A heat transfer fluid flows through the tube to store-extract thermal energy from the PCMs. A finite element model has been developed to simulate the cyclic thermal process involved as a result of alternating melting and freezing processes. Computations have been carried out for the case of high-temperature thermal storage to investigate the advantages of using multiple PCMs over a single PCM in the module. Numerical results indicate that the heat transfer rates can be greatly enhanced using multiple PCMs as compared with a single PCM. The enhancement of the heat transfer rate is of practical significance to improve the performance of latent thermal storage exchangers.

The analysis is performed using the thermalhydraulic computer code, CATHENA, with a coupled primary and secondary circuit model. A two-loop representation of the primary and secondary circuits is modelled. The secondary circuit model includes the feedwater line from the deaerator storage tank, multi-node steam generators and the steam line up to the turbine. Two cases were carried out using different assumptions for the efficiency of the steam separators. Case 1 assumes the efficiency of the steam separators becomes zero when the water level in the steam drum increases to the elevation of primary cyclones, or the outlet flow from the steam generator becomes higher than 150 % of normal flow. Case 2 assumes the efficiency becomes zero only when the water level in the steam drum reaches the elevation of primary cyclones. The simulation results show that system responses are sensitive to the assumption for the efficiency of the steam separators and case 1 gives higher discharge energy. Fuel cooling is assured, since primary circuit is cooled down sufficiently by the steam generators for both cases.

The objectives of the tests were to demonstrate the use of vapor compression distillation to greatly reduce the storage volume of wastewater on US Navy ships during extended missions, examine the quality of the produced distilled water for reuse, and determine energy requirements for the process. Three 55 gal drums of gray wastewater, shipped from Annapolis, were used in the tests at The Water Reuse Technology (WRT) test facility, Alamo, California. The tests were made in a 3 gal/h vapor compression distillation unit using the energy efficient wiped film rotating disk (WFRD) evaporator. Data were collected to determine recovery, evaporator performance, and distilled water and blowdown qualities. The tests were run at an average temperature of 122°F in the evaporator.

The strategy is based upon simple heuristics that were developed from daily and monthly simulations of cooling systems with internal melt, area-constrained ice storage tanks. Dynamic programming was used to obtain the optimal control trajectories which minimized an integrated energy and demand cost function for both the daily and monthly simulations. In addition to leading to simple heuristics, the monthly optimal control results were used as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of both conventional and the new control strategy. For a range of partial-storage systems, load profiles, and utility rate structures, the monthly electrical costs for the rule-based control strategy were, on average, within about 3% of the optimal costs. In contrast, the monthly electrical costs associated with the most common conventional control strategy, chiller-priority control, were as much as 20% greater than optimal, whereas a simple storage-priority strategy yielded costs that were within about 6% of optimal. The rule-based strategy can be easily implemented within a small micro-processor controller and only requires measurements of the system cooling requirement, building electrical usage, and state-of-charge of storage. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Cold storage; Computer control systems; Computer simulation; Dynamic programming; Energy efficiency; Heuristic methods; Ice; Intelligent control; Knowledge based systems; Microcomputers; Optimal control systems; Chiller priority control; Control trajectories; Demand cost function; Electrical costs; Ice storage systems; Micro processor control; Partial storage systems; Rule based control; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030259320

Although most of the energy is usually compacted in the few coefficients that are transmitted, there are many instances where the discarded coefficients contain significant information. The absence of these coefficients at the decoder can lead to visible degradation of the reconstructed image especially around slow moving objects. We propose a simple but effective method which uses an indirect form of vector quantization to supplement scalar quantization in the transform domain. The distribution pattern of coefficients that fall below a fixed threshold is vector quantized and an index of the pattern chosen from a codebook is transmitted together with two averages; one for the positive coefficients and the other for negative coefficients. In the reconstruction, the average values are used instead of setting the corresponding coefficients to zero. This is tantamount to quantizing the mid range frequency coefficients with 1 bit but the resulting bit-rate is much less. We aim to propose an alternative to using traditional vector quantization which entails computational complexities and large time and memory requirements.","Distribution pattern vector quantization; Distribution vector; DPVQ region; SQ region","Computational complexity; Data storage equipment; Decoding; Image coding; Image communication systems; Image compression; Image reconstruction; Mathematical transformations; Discrete cosine transform; Distribution vector; Vector quantization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030259199

In this paper, we present a stochastic optimization model to solve this problem. Unlike other models, this model explicitly considers deliverability, the rate at which gas can be added to and withdrawn from a storage facility, as a variable, and considers its role in ensuring a secure supply of gas. Deliverability is often overlooked in gas supply planning, yet is a critical factor in achieving a secure gas supply. Using data from an LDC in Huntsville, Alabama, we show how this model can be used to minimize total cost while meeting constraints regarding the security of gas supply. We also demonstrate that security is dependent on the rate of deliverability, which in turn is affected by a number of factors including gas availability, storage and transportation considerations, and weather conditions.

The strands in the most recent CICC magnets are coated with chromium or another metal with high electrical resistance in order to induce current redistribution among the strands and to avoid a quench caused by a current imbalance. If, however, the cable currents were well balanced, insulating the strands would be the best way to reduce a.c. losses.

A pair of hydride reactors are designed to extend the contact surface between hydride materials and flowing hydrogen for fast kinetics. Dynamic correlations of pressure-temperature and temperature-concentration are investigated in a typical operational condition. The amount of hydrogen gas transferrable between the paired metal hydrides is measured and the optimum value of the charged hydrogen amount is found for the maximum hydrogen transfer.

However, while considering hydrogen for automotive applications two important factors must be carefully viewed. Firstly, the fuel metering system should be capable of supplying the desired quantity of fuel to the engine at the appropriate point in the engine cycle so as to ensure sustained engine operation without any symptoms of undesirable combustion. The other practical aspect which has delayed the regular implementation and commercialization of hydrogen fuel for vehicular application centres round the problem of onboard storage.

Such systems are often characterized by poor efficiency and high maintenance costs. The integration of wind turbine with a diesel/battery hybrid system is becoming cost-effective in windy locations. In previous works (Nfaoui et al, 1990, 1994a, 1994b), the wind characteristics in Tangier-area were studied on the basis of 12 years (1978-1989) of hourly average wind speed data. A wind/diesel energy system with battery storage has been modelled using the Tangiers wind regime over a one year period (1989), and synthesized consumer load data based on the characteristics of typical usage of domestic appliances, along with the estimated working patterns of a local isolated community. In this work, we use a more realistic hourly consumer load, which is the result of an experiment realized in a Maroccan village using a diesel engine to provide electricity for lighting and audio-visual. The 1989 wind data were reworked for a large series of measurements (12 years). The optimum wind turbine size and the benefits of a storage system on fuel saving are also reviewed. This work is concerned with diesel fuel consumption : an optimum design of the considered system is to be found which minimises the cost energy generation over the equipments' lifetime. Given the economic assumption made (the most important being a fuel price of 4.5 Dh/litre and an interest rate of 5% net of inflation), the wind/diesel energy system has been shown to be competitive with diesel-only generation in the wind regime of the Tangier location for the cost per unit wind turbine swept area less than 3000 Dh/m2 (8Dh = 1$).",,"Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Electric appliances; Electric batteries; Electric rates; Electricity; Energy conservation; Fuel economy; Wind turbines; Fuel saving; Morocco; Tangiers wind regime; Wind diesel electricity supply; Electric power utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030243671

The old practice of direct landfilling and storage is receiving greater public resistance and is attributing to the search for alternative disposal methods. The ever-growing problem of solid wastes requires environmentally benign and good public acceptance for the safe and ultimate disposal of the various kinds of solid wastes. Incineration and various kinds of mass burn-type systems have been used to reduce the volume and mass of the wastes, which can be characterized by their operational temperature. In all types of incineration systems, different kinds of gas clean-up devices are used to meet the local, state, and federal regulations for the ga.ies before being released into the environment. A major concern over these systems have been in the by-products produced from these systems during their normal design and off-design point of operation. Indeed, the by-products generated from some incineration systems, under certain operational conditions, can he a health hazard and the solid residue may be leachable. Recent trends in advanced thermal destruction systems are described which can destroy the solid waste to the molecular level. Advanced systems can be designed to meet almost any emission standards. The use of oxygen enriched air in place of air for the combustion of gases released from the solid waste reduces the amount of effluent gas, and, hence, the reduced size and cost of the gas clean-up system. The use of an excess enthalpy system offers attractive benefits in which the energy released from the waste is recycled back into the system under controlled conditions with the final desired objectives of reduced emissions, higher efficiency, and lower costs. Thermal destruction of solid wastes using advanced techniques makes good technical, environmental, economical, and human health and safety.

The fact is accepted that natural gas is the cheapest, most domestically abundant, and cleanest burning of fossil fuels. However, socio-economical and technical handicaps associated with the safety and efficiency of on-board fuel storage inhibit its practical use in vehicles as an alternative fuel. A concept is presented for safely storing fuel at low pressures in the form of hydrates in natural gas vehicles. Experimental results lead to gas storage capacities of 143 to 159 volumes/volume. Vehicle travel range could be up to 204 mi. Controlled decomposition rate of hydrates is possible for feeding an automotive vehicle. Upon sudden pressure decrease in the event of a vehicle accident, the rate of release of hydrocarbons from the hydrates at constant temperature is 2.63 to 12.50 percent per min, slow enough to prevent an explosion or a fireball. A model is given for predicting the rates of gas release from hydrates in a vehicle wreck. A storage tank design is proposed and a process is suggested for forming and decomposing hydrates on-board vehicles. A consistent fuel composition is obtained with hydrates. © 1996 by ASME.",,"Accident prevention; Decomposition; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Explosions; Gas fuel storage; Gas fuels; Ground vehicles; Hydrates; Hydrocarbons; Synthetic fuels; Controlled decomposition rate; Liquid hydrocarbons; Natural gas vehicles; Socio-economical and technical handicaps; Storage tank design; Vehicle travel range; Natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030242754

A new probabilistic model of a wind farm to be used in reliability studies is presented. This model considers the stochastic nature of wind, the failure and repair processes of the wind turbines under different wind regimes, and the output characteristics of the wind turbine in detail. Spatial wind speed correlation and waking effects can also be considered. The model can be used with one or several types of wind turbines. Analytical techniques are used.

It is recalled that five-fold symmetry is ubiquitous among these fibers and that their axial diffraction pattern is insensitive to their deformation or unequal development. 15- and 30-sectored fibers of polygonal serpentine are described by a fan-like arrangement of flat lizardite sectors, with radiating sector boundaries occupied by arrays of partial dislocations. In each case, the layer stacking sequence varies from one sector to the next. Crystal growth of chrysotile probably occurs by thick, curved sectors closing up as tubules, which subsequently develop to a critical size controlled by local storage of elastic energy. For a strict elastic control we may envision the use of chrysotile geometry as an indicator of departure from equilibrium. A solid-state transformation, chrysotile-to-polygonal serpentine, is likely to be driven by the release of elastic energy stored in chrysotile. Diameter growth of polygonal serpentine is no longer limited by elasticity constraints, so allowing ""giant"" size and tight intergrowth of those fibers.",,"Asbestos; Crystal lattices; Crystal microstructure; Optical properties; Serpentine; Topology; Transmission electron microscopy; Chrysotile; High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM); Polygonal serpentine; Crystal growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030230781

As dams get older, there is a need to ensure that their conditions of safety and integrity are also consistent with today's acceptable standards and criteria. This paper outlines the scope and major engineering tasks in the Dam Safety Assessment Program undertaken by Ontario Hydro in Toronto, Canada. Methodologies used to determine the probable maximum flood for a high-hazard dam are presented together with a flood routing model. The 2012 MW R. H. Saunders/Robert Moses Generating Station on the St. Lawrence River is used as an example to illustrate such methodologies adopted for dam safety assessment. It is demonstrated that under probable maximum flood conditions together with extreme wind effects, the main dam of this power station would still have a comfortable freeboard allowance, primarily because of the vast storage capacity of Lake Ontario. The spill capacity is also found to be adequate. The dam meets the requirements and pertinent standards of dam safety assessment. ©ASCE.",,"Accident prevention; Computer simulation; Floods; Hydraulics; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrology; Lakes; Standards; Watersheds; Wind effects; Flood routing; Safety assessment; Watershed modeling; Dams; generating station; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030224016

The aim of the study was to evaluate the maximum admissible amount of PUFA in the pig diet before problems - in terms of backfat consistency and storage stability - occur and to investigate the incorporation of dietary PUFA in intramuscular fat as well. A tendency towards reduced feed (energy) intake was obvious from the 7% rapeseed inclusion level, apparently resulting in a somewhat thinner backfat layer. None of the backfat samples showed a visible yellow discolouration instead thin backfat layers appeared as pink. Backfat consistency was lower for gilts and decreased with increasing dietary PUFA levels. PUFAs in the feed and in backfat were very well correlated (0.8-0.9) as expected; correction for de novo fat synthesis (by means of backfat thickness) did not alter the correlations within one sex group. Thresholds for PUFA in feed - 15 g PUFA/kg feed - and for PUFA in backfat - iodine value of 70 or 15% PUFA - were all surpassed in this experiment: 18 g PUFA/ kg feed resulted in maximally 22% PUFA in the outer backfat layer. The backfat PUFA limit was reached at relatively low feed PUFA levels. This might be explained by thin and hence more unsaturated backfat layers in lean or underweight pigs. Oxidative stability of the backfat after storage for 1 year in the freezer was satisfactory. The total intramuscular fat (IMF) content showed no obvious relationship with diet, in contrast with sex: barrows had more IMF than gilts. IMF consisted in 80% apolar phase and 20% polar fraction. The apolar fraction showed similar feed and sex tendencies as backfat, although correlations between feed and apolar fraction PUFAs were higher for gilts than for barrows. The amount of phospholipid was invariable throughout all treatments. Only linoleic acid - the major fatty acid - showed some feed and sex influence. In view of the results obtained the threshold for feed and backfat PUFA can be as high as, respectively, 18 g PUFA/kg feed and 22% PUFA in backfat, without deterioration of fresh and frozen backfat. However, for meat processing, demands could be more severe. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Sinapis arvensis; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030222591

Mice offered only ethanol (10%; v/v) for 10 days as drinking fluid had significant reductions in total energy and fluid intakes relative to mice given water, but net weight gains were similar. BAT thermogenic capacity was reduced in mice drinking ethanol, as shown by decreases in tissue protein and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity and in the uncoupling protein content of isolated mitochondria. Ethanol consumption differed greatly between mice offered a choice between ethanol and water for 25 days after a 10-day habituation period, with only ethanol as the drinking solution. Total energy intake of mice that continue to consume the most ethanol voluntarily (up to 25% of total fluid intake) was significantly reduced but carcass fat was increased, relative to mice consuming less or no ethanol. Brown fat thermogenic capacity was not significantly affected by the degree of ethanol consumption. Basal and norepinephrine-stimulated rates of oxygen uptake of isolated brown adipocytes were not affected by ethanol. Thus, changes in the animal capacity for energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue does not appear an important factor to explain the effects of ethanol consumption on fat deposition in mice.","Body weight; Diet-induced thermogenesis; Energy balance; Uncoupling protein","alcohol; succinate dehydrogenase; uncoupling protein; alcohol consumption; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; fluid intake; habituation; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; thermogenesis; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030220710

Box 67, H-1450 Budapest, Hungary","Adenosine 5-'triphosphate (ATP) is a ubiquitous substance in the central and peripheral nervous system. Nerve terminal ATP is generated from ADP during glycolysis, citric acid cycle and predominantly by oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. The adenine ring is synthesized via de-novo purine biosynthesis, and also by purine salvage pathways. The main regulator of ATP synthesis is ADP, the signal of the actual energy state of the neuron. It inhibits (negative feedback its own synthesis and also regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Storage of ATP has been shown in all types of synaptic vesicles and it can also be found in the cytoplasm in millimolar range. ATP can be co-packaged with other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline and may be stored in purinergic vesicles and perhaps, in purinergic nerve endings. Various treatments can alter vesicular composition, and hence, vesicular neurotransmitter/ATP ratio. There is now wide acceptance that ATP is released stimulation-dependently from nerve endings of a number of isolated tissues and preparations upon depolarizing stimuli. In addition to presynaptically derived ATP, ATP release from activated target cells in response to the action of primary transmitter on postsynaptic receptors also forms a significant contribution to neuronal outflow in several tissues. As for the possible role of intraterminal ATP pools in the release process, recent observations support the view that ATP is released as a genuine cotransmitter, or as a principal purinergic neurotransmitter in an exocytotic way, but also indicate the involvement of other neuronal pools of ATP in the release such as carrier-mediated release from the cytoplasm.","ATP; Neurotransmitter; Release; Storage; Synthesis","adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; purine receptor; biosynthesis; chemical structure; human; mitochondrion; negative feedback; nerve ending; neurotransmitter release; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; purine metabolism; purine synthesis; review; storage; synapse vesicle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030220030

The granular starches were plasticized by extrusion processing with glycerol and water. The low molecular mass starch was prepared by partial acid hydrolysis of potato starch. The extruded TPS materials were stored at 60% relative humidity for 12 months to level out differences in starch structure due to retrogradation. The water content was then varied by an additional storage period at various humidities. The average molecular masses of the TPS materials, composed of native starch or of hydrolysed starch, were 37 000 and 1900 kg mol-1, respectively. The apparent amylose contents of the high and low molecular mass materials were 25% and 11%, respectively. Differences were observed in thermal properties and crystallinity between the two types of materials, as a function of water content but not as a function of molecular mass. The stress-strain properties of the materials were dependent on the water content. The materials showed a viscoelastic behaviour characteristic of a semicrystalline polymer. Materials containing less than 9% water were glassy with an elastic modulus between 400 and 1000 MPa. For the materials a transition from brittle to ductile behaviour occurred at a water content in the range of 9-10%, which is in accordance with the observed glass transition temperature at this water content. The rubbery materials, with a water content of 9-15%, were tough and an optimum in ultimate elongation was observed. Above a water content of 15% the materials became weak and soft and the strain at break decreased. No significant differences in brittle-to-ductile transition as a function of water content were observed between the low and high molecular mass TPS materials. In the rubbery state with 14% water, the elongations at break of the high and low molecular mass materials were 100-125% and 30-50%, respectively. The tearing energy of the materials showed a maximum at a water content of 9-10%. The energies at this maximum of the high and low molecular mass materials were 0.15 and 0.1J mm-2, respectively. The lower strain and tearing energy of the low molecular mass materials in the rubbery state were attributed to the reduced amylose chain length as well as the molecular mass and the degree of branching of the amylopectin molecules. This resulted in a material with a less effective entangled starch matrix. The entanglements were described as a complex network of the linear amylose chains and the outer chains of the amylopectin molecules in which hydrogen bonding plays an important role.

The technology of the solar pond is based on storing solar energy in salt-gradient stratified zones. Many experimental and numerical investigations concerning the optimum operational conditions and economical feasibility of solar ponds have been published in the last few decades. In the present study, a novel two-dimensional mathematical model that uses derived variables is developed and presented. This model utilizes vorticity, dilatation, density, temperature and concentration as dependent variables. The resulting governing partial differential equations are solved numerically in order to predict the transient performance of a solar pond in the two-dimensional domain. The boundary conditions are based on measured ambient and ground temperatures at Kuwait city. Based on the present formulation, a computer code has been developed to solve the problem at different operating conditions.

Four solutions were tested using this isolated rat liver model: Marshall's hypertonic citrate (HC); modified University of Wisconsin solution (Mod UW); a histidine-based solution (HIS); and a histidine-lactobionate-raffinose-based solution (HLR). After storage, livers were perfused at 4°C for a period of 2 h and biopsy samples taken, at different time points, to investigate energy metabolism. Livers stored in HLR and HIS had higher 24-h storage levels of ATP (0.41 and 0.24 μmol/g respectively; P < 0.05) than those stored in Mod UW and HC. On reperfusion, all groups regenerated ATP by 1-2 h. However, significantly greater levels of ATP regeneration occurred in livers stored in the HLR (1.6 ± 0.08 μmol/g) and Mod UW (1.3 ± 0.18) than HC (0.58 ± 0.19) and HIS (0.96 ± 0.12); P < 0.05. Energy charge (1) (EC) recovered in all groups but was significantly higher in HLR and Mod UW (0.79 and 0.68, respectively; P < 0.05) than HC and HIS. These represent 95% (HLR) and 80% (Mod UW) of values observed in FIL. During the reperfusion period, total adenine nucleotide levels (TA) did not vary significantly within each storage group, except in the HIS solution. However, TAs were greater with livers stored for 24 h in HLR (2.5 ± 0.25) and Mod UW (2.7 ± 0.20) than those the other two storage groups (P < 0.05 in each case). This study has demonstrated that it was possible to resuscitate liver energetics after prolonged hypothermie ischemia by a period of cold reperfusion, and the method can differentiate between preservation solutions. The livers stored in each solution showed varying degrees of success in regeneration of ATP and EC, demonstrating that oxygen was not a limiting factor when using an air-equilibrated perfusate. The solutions providing the better preservation conditions gave the greater resuscitation of liver energetics (Mod UW and HLR). Overall, livers stored in HLR had the greatest resuscitation of energy metabolism, which correlates with survival data from other studies (29-31, 33). © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,"adenosine; adenosine triphosphate; allopurinol; disaccharide; glutathione; histidine; hypertonic solution; insulin; lactobionic acid; Marshall's citrate solution; preservation solution; raffinose; University of Wisconsin lactobionate solution; University of Wisconsin-lactobionate solution; animal; article; comparative study; energy metabolism; evaluation; in vitro study; liver; liver transplantation; male; metabolism; methodology; organ preservation; perfusion; rat; reperfusion injury; solution and solubility; Sprague Dawley rat; Adenosine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allopurinol; Animals; Disaccharides; Energy Metabolism; Evaluation Studies; Glutathione; Histidine; Hypertonic Solutions; Insulin; Liver; Liver Transplantation; Male; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Perfusion; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reperfusion Injury; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030209615

Protozoa digest bacteria and smaller protozoa, but bacterial protein can turn over even if protozoa are not present. Fibrobacter succinogenes cultures lyse even when they are growing, and the lysis rate is independent of growth rate. When extracellular sugar is depleted, F. succinogenes secretes an extracellular proteinase that inactivates the autolysins. This method of autolytic regulation decreases the turnover of stationary cells. Bacteriophage and anaeroplasma can cause lysogeny, but, as yet, there is little proof that these processes are important determinants of bacterial turnover in vivo. Dietary manipulations (e.g., salt feeding and particle size reduction) that increase liquid and solid dilution rates can increase bacterial flow by decreasing bacterial residence time and turnover. Some dead ruminal bacteria are able to maintain their cellular integrity, and the ratio of dead to live cells in ruminal fluid may be as great as 10:1. Bacterial survival appears to be at least partially explained by the method of sugar transport. When bacteria rely solely on mechanisms of ion-coupled sugar symport, an energized membrane is necessary for the reinitiation of growth. If group translocation (phosphotransferase system) is the mechanisms of transport, uptake can be driven by phosphoenolpyruvate, and an energized membrane and the storage of intracellular reserve materials are not an absolute criteria for survival. In some cases, N deprivation accelerates death. When Prevotelia ruminicola was limited for N under conditions of excess energy, methylglyoxal production caused a rapid decrease in viability. The impact of bacterial death in the rumen is not clear-cut. If the rate of fermentation is zero-order with respect to cell concentration (substrate-limited), cell death would have little impact on digestion.","Bacteria; Death; Lysis; Rumen","Anaeroplasma; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fibrobacter succinogenes; Protozoa; nitrogen; animal; bacterial count; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacteriolysis; microbiology; parasitology; physiology; protozoon; review; ruminant stomach; Animals; Bacterial Physiology; Bacteriolysis; Colony Count, Microbial; Nitrogen Isotopes; Protozoa; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030202660

It was shown that, in addition to the reactions that depend on the oxygen-evolving activity of the photosystem, those that implicate more intimately the reaction center itself are protected by high concentrations of osmolytes. However, the temperature required to inhibit oxygen evolution totally in the presence of osmolytes is lower than that required to eliminate reactions, such as P680 (primary electron donor in photosystem II) photo-oxidation and pheophytin photoreduction, which only involve charge separation and primary electron transport processes. The energy storage measured from the thermal dissipation yield during photoacoustic experiments and the yield of variable fluorescence are also protected to a significant degree (up to 30%) at temperatures at which oxygen evolution is totally inhibited. It is suggested that a cyclic electron transport reaction around photosystem II may be preserved under these conditions and may be responsible for the energy storage measured at relatively high temperatures. This interpretation is also supported by thermoluminescence data involving the recombination between reduced electron accepters and oxidized electron donors at -30 and -55°C. The data also imply that a high concentration of osmolyte allows the stabilization of the photosystem core complex together with the oxygen-evolving complex. The stabilization effect is understood in terms of the minimization of protein-water interactions as proposed by the theory of Arakawa and Timasheff.","Betaine; Fluorescence; Heat stress; Photoacoustic; Photosynthesis; Thermoluminescence","betaine; oxygen; pheophytin; sucrose; article; controlled study; electron transport; enzyme inactivation; enzyme stability; heat stress; nonhuman; photooxidation; photosynthesis; photosystem II; priority journal; thermoluminescence; thermostability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030200321

Brain death is associated with neuroendocrine changes that result in impaired metabolism,reduced myocardial energy stores, and deteriorating cardiac function. As a result of these changes, a substantial number of normal human hearts are not considered suitable for transplantation. In the hope of preventing these complications and stabilizing the condition of cardiac donors, we compared the function of transplanted hearts from brain-dead rats that received triiodothyronine (T3) (n = 6) with that of hearts from a group that received a placebo (n = 5). Methods. This experiment was designed to be both blinded and randomized. Brain death was achieved by bilateral carotid ligation and inflation of an intracranial balloon. Triiodothyronine or placebo was administered in a blinded, randomized fashion. The brain-dead donors were then supported with conventional techniques for 2 hours after which time heterotopic transplantation was performed using hypothermic preservation and a working heart model. Hemodynamics of the transplanted hearts were assessed 48 hours postoperatively. Results. The hearts from donors that had been pretreated with T3 were found to have a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.005) peak left ventricular pressure than the hearts from the placebo-treated group (137 ± 17 mm Hg versus 115 ± 15 mm Hg). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01) in the T3-treated group (5.2 ± 2.2 mm Hg) compared with the placebo-treated group (6.9 ± 0.5 mm Hg). There was also a significantly higher (p = 0.03) maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure in the T3-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group (4,876 ± 1,348 mm Hg/s versus 3,344 ± 1,016 mm Hg/s). Finally, the cardiac output in the group given T3 was 93 ± 16 mL/min compared with 61 ± 22 mL/min in the group given the placebo (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions. Hearts from brain-dead rats that had received T3 before transplantation showed improved postoperative function. The experimental design of pre-donation brain death, cold immersion storage, and transplantation in a working heart model should make these data more relevant clinically than those previously reported.",,"liothyronine; placebo; animal experiment; animal model; article; brain death; carotid artery ligation; controlled study; heart disease; heart transplantation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030199639

This power network is called an open electric energy network (OEEN) because the network is open to the many types of plants for the participation. For achieving such openness, electric power storage devices, load controller at each customer and data communication network are installed in OEEN; the flow of excess electric power generated by each plant is controlled autonomously and in a distributed way. That is, the control is done by transmitting the data on excess electric power such as generation and demand point, power quality, price, etc., from each dispersed generation plant to the power storage devices and the load controllers through the communication network. Since this datadriven power flow control is similar to the mail system for a packet with the addresses of sender and receiver, it is called packet electric power transportation. In OEEN the storage device plays a different role from load leveling. Therefore, the way to determine the storage capacity differs from the conventional approach. In this paper, the applicability of queuing theory for determining the capacity is also discussed.","Dispersed power generators; Electric power storage; Open electric energy network; Queuing","Dispersed power generators; Electric power storage devices; Excess electric power; Load controller; Open electric energy network; Packet electric power transportation; Data communication systems; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Flow control; Queueing theory; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030197272

Every single-module CRPWM 3φ converter possesses good current tracking control characteristics, so is easy to parallel connect. The proposed current command distributor receives current commands from the common controller and generates suitable current commands for each paralleled converter module according to the proposed current sharing control strategy. The sophisticated system arrangement of the common controller gives the BESS many power processing functions. When it is connected to the utility grid, it can be arranged to give peak load shaving, active power filtering, power factor correction and battery charging.

One of the main concerns in the design of an electric power system that utilizes renewable energy sources, is the accurate selection of system components that can economically satisfy the load demand. This depends on the load that ought to be met, the capacity of renewable resources, the available space for wind machines and solar panels, and the capital and running costs of system components. Once size optimization is achieved, the autonomous system must be controlled in order to correctly match load requirements with instantaneous variation of input energy. In this paper, a new formulation for optimizing the design of an autonomous wind-solar-diesel-battery energy system is developed. This formulation employs linear programming techniques to minimize the average production cost of electricity while meeting the load requirements in a realiable manner. The computer program developed reads the necessary input data, formulates the optimization problem by computing the coefficients of the objective function and the constraints and provides the optimum wind, solar, diesel, and battery ratings. In order to study the effect of parameters predefined by the designer on the optimum design, several sensitivity analysis studies are performed, and the effects of the expected energy not served, the load level, the maximum available wind area, the maximum available solar area, and the diesel engines' lifetime are investigated. A controller that monitors the operation of the autonomous system is designed. The operation of this controller is based on three major policies; in the first, batteries operate before diesel engines and hence the storage system acts as a fuel saver, while in the second diesel engines are operated first so that the unmet energy is lower but the fuel cost is high. According to the third policy, the supply is made through diesel engines only. This is done for the purpose of making a performance comparison between the isolated diesel system and the hybrid renewable energy system. The proposed optimization and control techniques are tested on Lebanese data. Although three different control policies have been adopted in this work, the software is able to accommodate other policies.","Autonomous power system; Control policies; Optimization technique; Renewable energy","Computer software; Control systems; Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Functions; Linear programming; Optimization; Solar energy; Wind power; Autonomous power system; Autonomous renewable energy systems; Average production cost; Control policy; Objective function; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030195003

All of these savings are confirmed by comparing prior billings to current billings.

Component costs appropriate to the year 2000-2010 time frame are assumed throughout. For low insolation conditions (160 W m mean annual solar radiation), photovoltaic electricity could cost 5-13 cents kWh-1 by year 2000-2010, while for high insolation conditions (260 W m-2) the cost could be 4-9 cents kWh-2. Advanced fossil fuel-based power generation should achieve efficiencies of 50% using coal and 55% using natural gas. Carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by a factor of two to three compared to conventional coal-based electricity production in industralized countries. In a solar-fossil fuel hybrid, some electricity would be supplied from solar energy whenever the sun is shining and remaining demand satisfied by fossil fuels. This increases total capital costs but saves on fuel costs. For low insolation conditions, the cost of electricity increases by 0-2 cents kWh-1, while the cost of electricity decreases in many cases for high insolation conditions. Solar energy would provide 20% or 30% of electricity demand for the low and high insolation cases, respectively. In the solar-hydrogen energy system, some photovoltaic arrays would provide current electricity demand while others would be used to produce hydrogen electrolytically for storage and later use in fuel cells to generate electricity. Electricity costs from the solar-hydrogen system are 0.2-5.4 cents kWh-1 greater than from a natural gas power plant, and 1.0-4.5 cents kWh-1 greater than from coal plant for the cost and performance assumptions adopted here. The carbon tax required to make the solar-hydrogen system competitive with fossil fuels ranges from $70-660 tonne-1, depending on the cost and performance of system components and the future price of fossil fuels. Leakage of hydrogen from storage into the atmosphere, and the eventual transport of a portion of the leaked hydrogen to the stratosphere, would result in the formation of stratospheric water vapor. This could perturb stratospheric ozone amounts and contribute to global warming. Order-of-magnitude calculations indicate that, for a leakage rate of 0.5% y-1 of total hydrogen production - which might be characteristic of underground hydrogen storage - the global warming effect of solar-hydrogen electricity generation is on the order of 1% the impact of the hybrid system. Impacts on stratospheric ozone are likely to be minuscule.

Analysis of the oxidation kinetics of the ZrN thin films reveals a thermally activated, diffusion-limited oxidation process with an activation energy of 2.5 eV in the temperature range of 500-650 °C. This implies that there is an advantage in using ZrN as a barrier layer instead of TiN since the activation energy for oxidation of TiN is 2.05 eV.

Space applications for a cryogenic thermal storage unit include the storage of energy for the cooling of temperature-sensitive sensor components such as focal planes, optics, mirrors, and telescopes. The Brilliant Eyes thermal storage unit was the coldest recyclable thermal storage device (by over 40°C) in space-flight history and successfully demonstrated the capability to reduce the weight of cooling systems for future spaceborne infrared sensors. Based on ground and flight test results on energy storage capacity and temperature stability, trade studies were performed, which show the significant weight and cost benefits of the Brilliant Eyes thermal storage unit technology.",,"Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Cryogenic equipment; Heat storage; Performance; Sensors; Space applications; Space flight; Thermodynamic stability; Brilliant eyes thermal storage unit; Coldest recyclable device; Development; Phase change material; Verification; Zero gravity performance; Space shuttles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030190081

However, this recent food trend towards fresh image on one side and convenience on the other side often conflict. In most cases the fresh quality is negatively affected by the processing procedure. Therefore nowadays efforts are focussed on extending the shelf life of fresh products. However, sophisticated energy demanding facilities are required for storage and transporation, whereas the use of ecologically unsound cooling agents is a major drawback. The development of a dehydration process on the basis of electromagnetic energy (EME) may bring about a major breakthrough with respect to the retention of product quality and improved rehydration characteristics. Due to the tenfold weight reduction established in the dehydration process transport and storage costs are minimised thus reducing energy consumption. In comparison with fresh and frozen products minimal storage facilities are required. The strategy of a consortium of five EC-research centres and two dutch drying companies is to combine and fine tune hot air drying (low processing costs) and EME-drying (quality retention) into a hybrid process, to compare the performance with conventional methods and to include packaging and storage effects. Optimisation of the rewettability is one of the major concerns since food materials with near fresh properties can only be obtained from dry material if rehydration characteristics are excellent. To establish such dried fruits and vegetables will be considered as blends of polymeric materials. Many quality deterioration mechanisms can be attributed to the mobility of the polymeric matrix and the diffusion of water. Properties thus depend on the composition, the physical properties of the polymers (mobility) and the overall structure of the dried material. This approach in which process conditions in the dehydration of food materials are linked to a broad range of relevant macroscopic as well as microscopic data is highly innovative and will provide important scientific information. The process-quality relationships are a solid basis to optimize both existing and novel dehydration methods.",,"Costs; Dehydration; Deterioration; Energy utilization; Fruits; Optimization; Packaging; Physical properties; Polymer blends; Quality assurance; Research and development management; Storage (materials); Consumer demand; Dry conservation; Electromagnetic energy; Fresh quality; Rewettability; Shell life; Vegetables; Weight reduction; Drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030189716

During cloudy periods and nights, it is supplied from a thermal storage system where the necessary high temperature heat is stored during sunshine hours. The solar UT-3 process has been evaluated using the ASPEN-PLUS code. It is found that the overall thermal efficiency is 49.5%, the exergetic efficiency is 52.9% and the process can be realized using conventional materials.

Fuel cells have been identified as one of three primary propulsion system candidates to meet this triple fuel efficiency goal, since they can dramatically increase automotive propulsion efficiency combined with very low to zero emissions. The US Government is working closely with industry and research institutions in pursuing a strategy of aggressive research and development (R&D) to accelerate the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. The US Department of Energy has a major role in this fuel cell technology development effort. R&D activities are focused on overcoming the major technical, economic, and infrastructure-related hurdles. The high efficiency, very low emissions, and other favorable characteristics of fuel cells (such as fuel flexibility, low noise, and vibration) create significant market opportunities for fuel cells over the entire spectrum of transportation applications. While the focus of near-term markets for fuel cell vehicles will be urban areas having severe air-quality problems, long-term market prospects are encouraging since fuel cell vehicles can compete on an even ground with conventional vehicles in all key aspects, including vehicle range and refueling. This paper will discuss near-and long-term market opportunities for fuel cells in transportation and provide an update on driving regulatory developments in the USA at the federal and state level. The paper also provides an introduction to the PNGV (focusing on the role and prospects for fuel cells) and discusses the status of fuel cell vehicle development projects.","Fuel cells; USA; Vehicles","Air pollution control; Economic and social effects; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Fuel economy; Fuel systems; Marketing; Standards; Storage battery vehicles; Partnership for a new generation of vehicles (PNGV); Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030182677

This paper considers the embodied energy in photovoltaic modules applied to U.K. buildings, and determines a payback period in terms of the embodied energy rather than cost. The embodied energy payback is important for renewable technologies as their use makes no sense if the energy used in their manufacture is more than they can save in their life-time. The embodied energy payback period should always be one of the criteria used for comparing the viability of one renewable technology against another. The results show that, for the U.K. buildings studied and for an optimistic scenario with an ideal location with no overshadowing and without the use of storage batteries, the embodied energy payback period for photovoltaic modules is in the region of 8-12 years. At present therefore other renewable technologies would appear to be more suitable for the U.K. Photovoltaics applied to buildings may be a realistic option in climates with higher levels of solar radiation. They may also prove to be successful in the future in the U.K. if photoelectric generation efficiencies improve substantially, or economies are made in the manufacturing process.

The PEC solar cells score over their solid state counterparts on several points. Some of these are ease of fabrication and inbuilt storage capability. In order to make PEC solar cells viable, their conversion efficiencies need to be enhanced so as to reach optimum values. Several feasible efficiency enhancement processes for PEC cells such as electrode surface modification, photoetching, electrolyte modification etc. have been described and discussed in this article. The case of efficiency enhancement of n-GaAs based PEC solar cell through the modification of GaAs by Os3+ or Ru3+ ions leading to efficiency enhancement from 9 to 15% has been described and discussed. In regard to efficiency enhancement through electrolyte modification, the example of n-CdSe based PEC cell where the electrolyte (K3 Fe(CN)6 / K4 Fe(CN)6) is modified through KCN has been dealt with. The efficiency obtained in this cell is upto ∼ 16%. For the PEC solar cells embodying the d-d phototransition, MX2 type layered materials, the most dramatic conversion efficiency enhancements come through photoetching of electrode surfaces. We have described and discussed in detail the efficiency enhancements in n-WSe2 / I- 3, I-/Pt solar cells through photoetching of n-WSe2 photoelectrodes in 0.1 M aquaregia. High efficiencies upto ∼ 17% have been obtained for those solar cells. Yet another route of fabricating viable PEC solar cells giving high power output corresponds to the development of newer PEC cell designs. One example of the newer cell designs which has been described and discussed in this article corresponds to semiconductor-septum (SC-SEP) PEC solar cell. The SC-SEP, PEC solar cells have been found to yield higher power outputs (Voc and Isc) than the conventional single compartment PEC cells. For example, n-CdSe/Ti septum based PEC solar cell with configuration - Pt, 1 M-3S//n-CdSe/ Ti//0.1M AgNO3, Pt has been found to give higher power output (1.42 V and 20 mA/cm2), as compared to n-CdSe based conventional PEC cell (0.64 V and 6 mA/cm2). Similarly, n-TiO2/Ti septum electrode based SC-SEP, cell - Pt, 1 M NaOH/n-TiO2/Ti/0.1M AgNO3, Pt also gives higher power output (1.2 V and 15 mA/cm2). The case of another new PEC cell design incorporating nanostructured TiO2 photoelectrode overlaid with special dye (Ruthenium trinuclear cyanide complex) and exhibiting efficiencies of 7% (under usual solar illumination) and 12% (in diffuse solar light) has also been outlined.",,"Dyes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Etching; Nanostructured materials; Photoelectrochemical cells; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Semiconductor device manufacture; Solar energy; Titanium oxides; Diffuse solar light; Photoelectrochemical solar cells; Photoetching; Solar cells",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030182096

Fat adaptation has been used to increase energy density, decrease bowel bulk and faecal output and reduce health risks associated with hydrolysable carbohydrate overload. It may also reduce spontaneous activity and reactivity (excitability), increase fatty acid oxidation, reduce CO2 production and associated acidosis, enhance metabolic regulation of glycolysis, improve both aerobic and anaerobic performance and substantially reduce heat production. A thermochemical analysis of ATP generation showed the least heat release during the direct oxidation of long chain fatty acids, which have a 3% advantage over glucose and 20 to 30% over short chain fatty acids and amino acids. Indirect oxidation via storage as triglyceride increased heat loss during ATP generation by 3% for stearic acid, 65% for glucose and 174% for acetic acid. Meal feeding and nutrient storage, therefore, accentuates the advantage of dietary fat. A calorimetric model was based on initial estimates of net energy for competitive work (10.76 MJ for the Endurance Test of an Olympic level 3-day-event), other work (14.4 MJ/day) and maintenance (36 MJ), then applied estimates of efficiencies to derive associated heat productions for the utilisation of 3 diets, Diet A: hay (100), Diet B: hay and oats (50:50) and Diet C: hay, oats and vegetable oil (45:45:10), the difference between the last 2 diets representing fat adaptation. During a 90.5 min speed and stamina test, heat production was estimated as 37, 35.4 and 34.6 MJ for the 3 diets, respectively, an advantage 0.8 MJ less heat load for the fat adapted horse, which would reduce water needed for evaporation by 0.33 kg and reduce body temperature increase by about 0.07 degree C. Total estimated daily heat production was 105, 93 and 88 MJ for the 3 diets, respectively, suggesting a 5 MJ advantage for the fat adapted horse (Diet C vs. Diet B). Estimated intake energy was 348, 269 and 239 MJ for the 3 diets, respectively, and corresponding daily intakes as fed were 22.2, 16.6 and 12.9 kg, an advantage of 3.7 kg for the fat adapted horse.

Care should be taken when using data from high temperature experiments to predict corrosion rates under ambient repository conditions as there are many factors (such as the precipitation of secondary compounds, the chemistry of the water in contact with the glass, or circulation of this water through the repository) that can influence the temperature dependence of aqueous reactions. In this study, some standard leach tests using pure water, in continuous flow and direct sampling autoclaves, were performed on a synthetic medieval glass. Archaeological glass samples of a similar composition and which had suffered several centuries of corrosion in damp soil had been the subject of previous studies. The corrosion of the archaeological samples in damp soil was well understood and the aim was to determine how well standard leach tests would predict the observed corrosion. The experimentally measured long-term corrosion rates were not simply dependent on temperature, therefore they could not be used to predict either the corrosion rates or products found on the archaeological samples. In continuous flow experiments this was largely because the release of some cations (e.g. Mg2+) was proportional to the flow rates used, and so the long-term corrosion was dependent on both flow rate and temperature. In the autoclave experiments, concentrations of dissolved ions climbed rapidly in the small water volume, leading to the precipitation of complex mineral phase assemblages. The experiments did not reach silica saturation, therefore the long-term rates measured were a function of both the temperature and the extent of reaction. The initial release rates of silica and of the network modifying cations showed an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation energy of about 78.5 kJmol-1. These results would have predicted the soil corrosion of the archaeological samples to within about 30%, i.e. the initial corrosion rate in pure water was similar to the long-term rate in damp soil. As an explanation of the experimental observations it is suggested that clay minerals in the soil consumed silica as the glass dissolved, maintaining under-saturated conditions and allowing corrosion at a rate similar to the initial rate in pure water.",,"corrosion; glass; radioactive waste storage; repository conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030176845

For lubricated disks, the interaction between adsorbed water and lubricant molecules seems to be responsible for the effect of humidity on the frictional behavior of lubricated disks.

As a general rule, fibre oxidation gives rise to materials with improved mechanical properties-greater tensile and tear strengths. The improvements accomplished depend on the degree of fibre oxidation. The effects of long exposure times to oxidizing agents were tested on the experimental samples, i.e. increase in the number of functional surface groups and loss in mechanical strength due to a decrease in the L/d ratio, properties which act in opposite directions in the composite. Storage modulus retention with increasing strain amplitude is directly proportional to the number of functional groups incorporated into the fibre surface, whereas at low strain amplitude it is proportional to fibre strength, measured in terms of the L/d ratio after processing. It is suggested that improved adhesion at the matrix-fibre interface is obtained through the functional groups of the oxidized fibre. As a consequence of fibre-matrix interface and at any frequency, the damping peak temperature is shifted towards higher ranges and at the same time the apparent activation energy of the relaxation process is observed to increase. © 1996 SCI.","Dynamic properties; Mechanical properties; Oxidized carbon fibre; Thermoplastic elastomer (SBS) composites","Activation energy; Adhesion; Composition effects; Interfaces (materials); Oxidation; Polybutadienes; Polystyrenes; Relaxation processes; Strength of materials; Thermoplastic elastomers; Viscoelasticity; Butadiene styrene thermoplastics; Oxidized carbon fiber composites; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; carbon fibres; carbon-fibre-reinforced; composites; mechanical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030176557

Further improvements to increase the cell capacity are expected by modifying the structure of the carbonaceous materials. In the present paper, various kinds of carbon fibers are studied in order to cover a wide range of crystallinity and poly-p-phenylene (PPP)-based carbon is also chosen as one of the highly disordered carbons because of its Li discharge capacity as a negative electrode in the battery. The discharge capacity of a carbon electrode depends on the crystallite thickness Lc002, in which the minimum of the discharge capacity occurs at an intermediate size. This dependency implies a different Li storage mechanism, as also suggested by their voltammograms. A Li intercalation reaction to form stage compounds takes place in graphite fibers with large crystallite thickness, while the doping of Li ions occurs in carbon fibers with small Lc002 crystallites. In carbon fibers with intermediate crystallite thickness (around 100 Å), both intercalation and doping processes occur incompletely, thereby reducing the discharge capacity. Moreover, it is indicated from the voltammogram that the Li doping process in extremely disordered PPP-based carbon, exhibiting a discharge capacity of 680 mAh g-1 which is two times greater than that of graphite and consisting of very small crystallites in the c-dimension, is very different even from that in carbon fibers with small crystallite thickness.","A. non-crystalline materials; D. electrochemical properties; D. microstructure","Anodes; Capacitance; Carbon fibers; Cyclic voltammetry; Doping (additives); Electrochemistry; Energy storage; Intercalation compounds; Ions; Lithium; Microstructure; Secondary batteries; Crystallite thickness; Lithium secondary battery; Negative electrodes; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030172551

The machine will be housed in the existing LEP tunnel with a circumference of 26.7 km and requires a bending magnetic field of 8.4 T with 14 m long superconducting magnets. The beam vacuum chambers comprise the inner ""cold bore"" walls of the magnets. These magnets operate at 1.9 K, and thus serve as very good cryo-pumps. In view of reducing the cryogenic power consumption, both the heat load from synchrotron radiation emitted by the proton beams and the resistive power dissipation by the beam image currents have to be absorbed on a ""beam screen"", which operates between 5 and 20 K and is inserted inside the vacuum chamber. The design of this beam screen represents a technological challenge in view of the numerous and often conflicting requirements and because of the very tight mechanical tolerances imposed. The synchrotron radiation produces strong outgassing from the walls. The design pressure necessary for operation must provide a beam lifetime of several days. An additional stringent requirement comes from the power deposition in the superconducting magnet coils due to protons scattered on the residual gas which could lead to a magnet quench and, therefore, interrupt the machine operation. Cryo-pumping of gas on the cold surfaces provides the necessary low gas densities but it must be ensured that the vapour pressures of cryo-sorbed molecules, of which H2 and He will be the most critical species, remain within acceptable limits. In the warm straight sections of the LHC the pumping speed requirement is determined by ion induced desorption and the resulting vacuum stability criterion.

Several classes of storage may be required for a single installation, depending on the type and scale of the solar power plant itself, and the nature of its integration with conventional utility systems. For heating and hot water applications, water and phase change materials (PCMs) constitute the principle storage media. Soil, rock and other solids are used as well. Water has the advantage of approximately 80% less volume than that of water for a temperature variation of 10°C, which is the difference between temperatures of a fully charged and a fully discharged storage tank. Some PCMs are viscous and corrosive, and must be segregated within the container in order to be used as a heat transfer medium. For heat storage, two PCMs must be available, unless heat pumping is employed. A variety of solids is also used; rock particles of 20 to 50 mm in size are most prevalent. Well-designed packed rock beds have several desirable characteristics for energy storage. The heat transfer coefficient between the air and the solid is high, the cost of the storage material is low, the conductivity of the bed is low when air flow is not present and a large heat transfer area can be achieved at low cost by reducing the size of particles. TES systems have also been suggested for storing thermal energy at medium (38-304°C) and high temperatures (120-566°C). For instance, systems in an oil-rock system for hot water and heat-recovery applications are examples of medium-temperature applications, while those in molten nitrate salt systems (an excellent storage medium) for steam production for process applications are for high temperatures. Oil-rock TES, in which the energy is stored in a mixture of oil and rock in a tank, is less expensive than molten nitrate salt TES, but is limited to low-temperature applications. However, this oil-rock TES has been proven successful for solar thermal applications. The selection of the type of TES depends on various factors such as the storage period (diurnal or seasonal), economic viability, operating conditions, etc. In this article, a study of TES systems (including materials) is presented particularly with solar thermal applications in mind. The evaluation of their performances, cost and economic viability, ease of installation, cleanliness, environmental impact, safety factors, technological usability and applicability are discussed.","Solar thermal applications; Storage media; Thermal energy storage","Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Performance; Safety factor; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Technological forecasting; Phase change materials; Solar energy applications; Solar power systems; Storage media; Technological usability; Thermal energy storage systems; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030166630

The reaction is performed catalytically in a fixed bed reactor, and the efficiency of this step significantly determines overall system economics. The fresh catalyst kinetics and the deactivation of the catalyst play an important role in the process analysis. To predict the catalyst performance at various coke content levels, laboratory experiments at different scales were carried out in three stages: 1) isothermal experiments at low mch conversions in a differential microreactor; 2) non-isothermal experiments in PC-controlled integral reactors; 3) increasing temperature experiments in two integral reactors in series to deposit significant coke levels. A wide range of operating conditions were used: 200-400 hours continuous operation, high liquid hourly space velocities (LHSV) of 3-20 1/hr., 0-10 hyd/mch feed ratio, 6-16 atm overall pressure, 250°C - 550°C temperature in the reactors. Axial species concentrations and temperature profile measurements at different pressure levels and time-on-stream allowed a study of the catalyst deactivation effects for mch conversions up to 99%. The main reaction kinetics were selected by using a parameter sensitivity analysis for model discrimination and the kinetics short-cut identification software package of Maria (1993), Maria and Rippin (1995). The resulting two-parameter model was further tested with experiments in the dual integral reactor system. The activation energy for the main reaction was estimated at 220 ± 11 kJ/mol. A similar sensitivity analysis was used to derive a reduced model for catalyst deactivation, by using data recorded in the dual non-isothermal integral reactor system. The best results were obtained with a zero-order deactivation kinetics. A simple dependence between the catalyst activity and the coke content on the catalyst (up to 17 wt% for significant time-on-stream) was tested.","Catalyst deactivation; Kinetic model; Methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation; Microreactor and integral reactor","Activation energy; Chemical reactors; Computer software; Dehydrogenation; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Reaction kinetics; Reforming reactions; Sensitivity analysis; Differential continuous microreactors; Hydrogen energy storage; Methylcyclohexane; Nonisothermal integral reactors; Catalyst deactivation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030166502

The heat transfer fluid was circulated between the still and the collector through a heat exchanger and storage tank by thermosyphonically induced flow. It was observed that good insulation around the storage tank considerably increased the yield at night due to the decrease of ambient temperature. Thermosyphonically induced flow eliminated the need for pumps and control units. A layer of SnO2 on the transparent cover lowered the thermal radiation loss, one of the major sources of heat energy loss in a solar still. Values for solar radiation, ambient air temperature, salt-water temperature in the basin, temperature of air-vapour mixture within the still, input and output temperatures of the heat exchanger heat transfer fluid, and the distillate yield were collected by a data acquisition system. After making the above modifications, the distillate yield was measured to be 6.745 litres per square metre per day for a September solar radiation of 17 820 KJ at Istanbul-Gebze. To compare the distillate yield, a conventional solar still with similar dimensions to those of the improved still was constructed. The overall efficiency of the improved still was found to be 3·26 times the efficiency of the conventional still.","Desaliniation; Soar collector; Solar still; Tin-oxide coating","Desalination; Distillation; Efficiency; Fluids; Heat exchangers; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Solar collectors; Thin films; Tin compounds; Air vapour mixture; Distillate output; Heat transfer fluids; Solar still; Thermal radiation loss; Thermosyphonically induced flow; Tin oxide coating; Solar equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030166420

The hydride alloy quality of hydride electrodes can be effectively determined by measuring rate capability. The results of vented cell experiments confirm that the capacity decay of non-coated alloy electrodes in sealed cells is not due to the oxidation of oxygen from the nickel hydroxide positive electrodes.

As a method of seeking improvements to the dynamic response, a sixth-order dynamic model of a steam reformer is used with a design optimization process to determine the values of the steam reformer design parameters which will yield the fastest response time to a step input in hydrogen demand under a variety of initial conditions. Results of this analysis suggest that a steam reformer designed to have a maximum output of approximately 12,600 mol/h of hydrogen and optimized for fast response could have response times on the order of 15-20 s. A sensitivity analysis suggests that this response can be achieved primarily by reducing the thermal capacity of the reformer and improving the rate of heat transfer to the gaseous constituents within the reformer. With a steam reformer response time on the order of 15-20 s, supplementary energy storage devices, such as the ultracapacitor and flywheel, become more feasible. These devices are attractive because they have superior life cycle and power density characteristics when compared with traditional chemical batteries. © 1996 by ASME.",,"Dynamics; Energy storage; Flywheels; Heat transfer; Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Methanol; Optimization; Reforming reactions; Sensitivity analysis; Specific heat; Transportation; Fuel cell power plant; Methanol to hydrogen steam reformer; Sixth order dynamic model; Steam reformer design parameters; Ultracapacitor; Chemical equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030164248

Therefore proper modeling of soil liquid water processes is essential to a correct representation of the climate system. This study focuses on the class of summary models of liquid water fluxes in the vadose, or unsaturated zone of the soil, which are applicable to global or regional climate modeling studies. Fourteen such models are represented in this intercomparison study. Observational data from the HAPEX experiment provide validation. Because only limited observational data were available to constrain these models during their development and validation, the models have evolved very diverse treatments of the relevant processes: the basic Darcian (soil internal) and Hortonian (surface liquid flow) processes, as well as the boundary conditions of baseflow drainage and lateral interflow. The annual total local runoff is systematically underestimated by all but one of the participant models. This is one of the few significant biases between the consensus of participant models and the observations. The modeled runoff, averaged over the 14 models, differs from the budget estimate from observations by about 40%. During the period of runoff generation (late winter and early spring) the average model fails to deplete the soil water store as rapidly as is observed, a result consistent with the underprediction of runoff. One cannot rule out insufficient characterization of the field site soils as a primary cause of these discrepancies. Results suggest that model sources of the discrepancy are about equally likely to be related to the prediction of bare soil evaporation (discussed elsewhere in this issue) as they are to the parameterization of runoff and drainage processes.",,"Hortonia; drainage; infiltration; interflow; runoff; vadose zone; water flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030157422

Using vapor-deposited metal films on glass substrates of different roughness the temperature variation of a surface subjected to a heat pulse was recorded. In addition optical methods were used to observe bubble formation and growth. Onset of nucleate boiling, temperature development and critical heat flux are investigated and compared with theoretical predictions. It is shown that for rough surfaces the onset of nucleate boiling occurs at lower temperatures and thus after smaller delay than for smooth surfaces. Furthermore, rough surfaces exhibit higher critical transient heat fluxes characterizing the transition to film boiling.

Whether these rules are sufficient for the strict requirements of hydrogen supply systems in passenger cars, however, is still unclear and therefore requires verification. Unlike industrial plants, it would not be appropriate in the case of passenger cars to assume that only trained personnel will be involved with the new energy carrier, as vehicles with hydrogen drive will be used for all kinds of purposes - and also abused in some cases, with various damage scenarios resulting in the process. In the light of the situation, it is essential to start out by systematically determining and assessing possible hazards, effective improvements of the automobiles involved and their surrounding aspects only being possible after such a fact-finding procedure. This in turn calls for thorough cooperation between the automobile industry, on the one hand, and suppliers, energy utilities, the gas industry, and licensing authorities, on the other. Only a clear and open discussion of the approaches taken and results achieved in safety tests can pave the way for general acceptance by the public at large of hydrogen as a possible energy carrier. Conducting research on the safety of liquefied hydrogen (LH2), BMW is currently cooperating with Messer Griesheim GmbH and Linde AG in a series of research operations and tests serving first to determine the hazard potential of LH2 tanks used in road vehicles, taking into consideration in the process the various parameters influencing the effects of this hazard, and second to determine further requirements to be made of such vehicle tanks in their basic concept. This experimental research is funded by the commission of the European Communities (CEC) as part of the EQHHPP (Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Pilot Project). The following report presents the initial results of these tests.

Although a substantial research effort has been devoted to ANG, very few studies evaluate the impact of heat of adsorption on system performance. This paper concentrates on the impact of heat of adsorption on ANG performance during discharge, while the gas outflow rate is dictated by the energy demand of the application. The temperature drop and performance loss was measured with commercially available ANG cylinders under realistic conditions. Data show as high as a 37°C temperature drop at high discharge rate, with a performance loss approaching 25% of isothermal capacity. The performance loss is expected to be 15-20% at moderate discharge rates. Analysis of data and predictions of a simple model indicate that the ANG system is neither adiabatic nor isothermal during discharge; the thermal capacity of the vessel wall and external heat transfer conditions have a significant effect on system behavior. The poor thermal conductivity of packed adsorbent is a major obstacle for the utilization of these energy sources. Changing the flow direction during discharge from axial to radial by a perforated tube inserted at the center of the cylinder significantly reduces the performance loss by increasing the heat transfer from the wall to the central region. At intermediate discharge rates, where the inserted tube has the largest impact, the performance loss is reduced to 12% from 22% without the tube under identical conditions.","Adsorption; Adsorption heat; Methane; Natural gas; Storage","Discharge (fluid mechanics); Gas adsorption; Gas cylinders; Heat transfer; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermal effects; Adsorptive natural gas; Gas storage cylinders; Isothermal capacity; Natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030151701

An experimental program has been undertaken to see if in a system using an alkaline fuel cell running on hydrogen stored as liquid, both these problems may be solved concurrently. For vehicular hydrogen storage the most suitable system in terms of low mass and volume, is cryogenic storage of liquid hydrogen. Unfortunately, with liquid hydrogen there is always a small amount of boil-off, which necessitates venting of gaseous hydrogen from the storage vessel. Vented boil-off is hazardous and wasteful, and so it is essential that it be rendered safe, and preferably utilized efficiently. For electrochemical power generation, alkaline fuel cells offer the highest efficiency, as well as the possibility of using electrocatalysts that do not include platinum. However, since they operate at low temperatures they do not support hydrogen production by reformation of carbonaceous fuels. Further, they are rendered inoperative by the CO2 content of the (reformed) fuel and or air. Their application to vehicular use is impaired by this inability to use other than pure hydrogen and complexity of on-board CO2 removal. This paper describes a novel and simple process whereby H2 boil-off can be used to continuously sublime and remove CO2 from air, prior to the purified air and hydrogen being supplied to an alkaline fuel cell. It includes a schematic description of the process and an energy balance for refrigeration purification for the CO2 removal. It is shown that the process relies on high effectiveness heat exchangers and water re-vaporization. An overview of thermal analysis of matrix heat exchangers is presented along with experimental results of heat exchanger effectiveness tests, which indicate that heat exchangers of the required effectiveness are easily designed and manufactured.

The AIP options most suitable for low capacities have already been demonstrated, and descriptions have been published. This is not the case for the fuel cell systems which are expected to be most compact for longer endurance AIP and so an example is described briefly in this paper.

This draws on fuel cell and reformer programs at RollsRoyce and Associates Limited.

Thermal storage devices are usually classified as either variable temperature (“sensible heat”) or constant temperature (“latent heat”) devices. For both models a basic question is to determine the efficiency suitably: Only exergy efficiency appears a proper way. The aim of this paper is to examine exergy efficiency in both variable and constant temperature systems. From a general statement of exergy efficiency by the present author, two types of actual definitions are proposed, depending on the fact that the exergy of the fluid leaving the thermal storage during the charge phase can be either totally lost or utilized elsewhere.

Water heaters operated in this manner are referred to as off-peak water heaters. Several utilities are also considering the use of solar domestic water heaters as an additional means of limiting power demand during times of greatest electrical usage. The research described within this paper quantifies the variation in thermal efficiency attributable to subjecting residential electrical water heaters to various off-peak and water removal schedules and, thus, forms a basis of comparison to which the thermal efficiency of solar water heaters or other water heating technologies may be compared. Laboratory tests, where the off-peak period and hot water draw schedule were varied, were conducted on two residential storage water heaters. A computer model of an electric water heater was developed and validated. The laboratory tests and the model were used to quantify the effect that various off-peak and hot water draw schedules have on water heater thermal efficiency. Thermal efficiency was found to vary up to seven percent for water heaters which meet the present minimum efficiency standards as specified within the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. The energy factor, as measured using the Department of Energy Test Procedure for Water Heaters, is shown to be independent of the off-peak schedule because of a “normalizing” that occurs as part of the calculation procedure. © 1996 by ASME.",,"Calculations; Computer simulation; Computer software; Costs; Efficiency; Electric appliances; Electric load management; Electric power measurement; Performance; Solar water heaters; Standards; Thermodynamics; Computer model; Electric water heater; Energy factor; Off peak schedules; Thermal efficiency; Water removal schedules; Water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030142966

Using the hybrid variational principle, the region to which HFEM is applied is divided into elements with suitable interpolation functions; the inhomogeneous region including electrodes is divided into conventional quadratic elements of the serendipity class, and the remaining homogeneous substrate region is replaced with a hybrid element with specialized interpolation functions which are derived from modal expansions and satisfy the radiation condition of LSAWs. In this method, all the effects of piezoelectric perturbation, mechanical perturbation, energy storage due to nonradiated bulk waves, and radiation loss of LSAWs are automatically taken into account.

The pellet was heated at a constant rate from room temperature to 773 K and the heat storage rate of the pellet due to thermal decomposition (1.08 Mg2NiH4→1.08 Mg2NiH0.3+2H2) was measured. Independently the properties of the pellet (thermal conductivity, specific heat, etc.) and intrinsic decomposition rate were determined, and then a mathematical model was proposed for simulating the heat storage phenomena of the pellet. The decomposition rate was successfully estimated by a constant-temperature thermogravimetric method with a rapidly heating apparatus. As a result, the thermal decomposition began over 573 K at atmospheric pressure of hydrogen and its rate followed a first-order rate law. The computed decomposition curve of the pellet agreed with the measured one reasonably without any adjustable parameter, in which the heat storage rate of the pellet was controlled by the chemical reaction (decomposition) and heat transfer rates, not by the hydrogen diffusion rate. This work will be also utilized for designing a packed bed unit for energy recovery/storage, charged with the pellets of a metallic-hydride forming alloy.","Heat storage, thermal decomposition, kinetics, a single pellet, magnesium nickel hydride, copper microencapsulation, waste heat","Coated materials; Copper; Heat storage; Heating; Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Powder metals; Pyrolysis; Sorption; Thermal variables measurement; Thermogravimetric analysis; Waste heat utilization; First order rate law; Magnesium nickel hydride; Pellet; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030141890

An example is the provision of wire for the winding of high field magnets, and a methodology is proposed here that links these design criteria to the processing of fine scale composites. In developing the descriptions of the dependence of both mechanical strength and resistivity on the microstructural scale of the composite the modelling reveals the importance of new processes such as interface scattering and energy storage mechanisms at the interface that give new insights into the behaviour of fine scale structures.

A trial was conducted to determine the effects of intercropping with maize on micro-environment, growth and yield of cassava. Radiant energy teaching the soil surface and maximum diurnal soil temperatures were lower with intercropping, with the lowest values being observed in the fertilized plots. Similarly, soil moisture content and earthworm activity were greater with intercropping, with the highest values occurring in fertilized plots. Soil fertility, especially N, was lower in intercropping than in cassava grown alone, with the lowest fertility occurring in non-fertilized mixtures. Intercropping with fertilizer application thus lowered exposure and temperature, and increased soil water and earthworm activity. Inclusion of maize with cassava increased plant height, reduced leaf area index and stem branching and diameter, favoured lodging, delayed hulking of storage roots and decreased nutrient uptake in cassava. The ability of cassava to compensate for impaired early growth after maize harvest depended strongly on soil fertility, especially the level of nitrogen.","Cassava; Intercropping; Maize; Micro-environment","intercropping; maize; Euphorbiaceae; Manihot esculenta; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030131621

In general, results indicate that the energy absorption and release by the tendons of cat SO, GA, and PL make up a substantial part of the total energy absorbed and generated by the corresponding muscle-tendon complexes.The functional significance of tendons, and the differences in tendon properties among synergistic muscles, is not well established for normal locomotion. Previous studies have suggested that tendons may store mechanical energy during the early phase of support, and then release this energy during the late phase of support. The storage and release of mechanical energy by tendons may modify the velocity of shortening and elongation and the power produced by the muscle belly and the fibers, and may influence the metabolic cost of locomotion. The aims of this study were (1) to estimate the amount of negative and positive work done by the tendon and the muscle belly of the cat soleus (SO), gastrocnemius (GA), and plantaris (PL), and (2) to determine the relative contribution of the elastic energy stored in the tendons to the total mechanical work done by these three muscles during walking and trotting. Forces of SO, GA, and PL muscles were measured using standard farce transducers in three cats walking and trotting at speeds of 0.4-1.8 ms-1 on a motor-driven treadmill. Video records and a geometrical model of the cat hindlimb were used for calculating the length of the muscle-tendon complexes of SO, GA, and PL during locomotion. Instantaneous lengths of the tendons of SO, GA, and PL during a step cycle were estimated from the stress-strain properties, the effective lengths, the cross-sectional areas, and the instantaneous forces of the tendons. Stress-strain properties for the tendons were obtained experimentally from one animal. The length of the belly was defined as the difference between the muscle-tendon complex length and the tendon length. Mechanical power of the tendon and the muscle belly was calculated as the product of the measured muscle force and the calculated rates of change in tendon and muscle belly lengths, respectively. Mechanical power and work of the tendons and bellies of SO, GA, and PL were calculated for 144 step cycles. During a step cycle, peak negative and peak positive velocities as well as peak powers of the muscle-tendon complexes of SO, GA, and PL were typically higher than those of the muscle bellies. Positive work done by the muscle-tendon complexes exceeded the positive work done by the muscle bellies. GA and PL tendons stored more mechanical energy than the SO tendon. The contributions of the elastic energy stored in the tendons to the positive work done by the muscle-tendon complexes decreased with increasing speeds of locomotion for two of the three cats studied and did not change for the third one. These contributions equaled 50-21%, 30-14%, and 25-18% for the three cats, respectively. The results of this study suggest that energy absorption and release by the tendons of cat SO, GA, and PL make up a substantial part of the total energy absorbed and generated by the corresponding muscle-tendon complexes.","In-vivo; Muscle force; Power; Stretch-shortening cycle","Energy absorption; Energy storage; Force measurement; Muscle; Tendons; Transducers; Cat locomotion; Force transducers; Mechanical energy absorption; Stress strain properties; Biomechanics; animal experiment; article; cat; energy consumption; force transducer; gastrocnemius muscle; hindlimb; locomotion; male; muscle contraction; muscle force; muscle strength; nonhuman; plantaris muscle; priority journal; soleus muscle; tendon; treadmill; walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030131095

Fresh and stored switchgrass samples were analyzed for their structural and non-structural constituents. These summative analyses of the switchgrass showed differences in the composition of materials harvested at different times and indicated that the compositions changed during storage. On a dry weight, whole biomass basis, significant differences were observed in the extractives (+3%), ash (+1%), hemicelluloses (-1.4%), and cellulose (-4%) components of the switchgrass harvested in October 1991 relative to August 1992. The bales from the switchgrass harvested in October 1991 were exposed to high rainfall (65 cm) during storage and experienced much greater weathering than bales from the second harvest. The largest change in composition occurred in the ethanol-extractable component. The switchgrass showed a significant loss of extractives in both the weathered outer layer (11%) and the unweathered inner fraction (8%) of the bales prepared from the first harvest. Switchgrass harvested in August 1992 underwent much smaller compositional changes compared to the October 1991 harvest. The extractives in switchgrass and other grasses may contain substantial amounts of fermentable carbohydrates. If so, their loss during storage could have a significant impact on the conversion of switchgrass into ethanol. This is an example of the feedstock assessment research being conducted to determine the influence of harvest and storage conditions on the thermochemical and biochemical conversion of various biomass feedstocks into fuels and chemicals. The results of this research are expected to provide a guide to agricultural practices that optimize production of feedstocks for conversion into fuels.`Alamo' switchgrass was harvested in two different years and stored as large round bales, unprotected for 26 weeks.

In this paper, we use analytical solutions of the unsteady one-dimensional energy equation to show that the flow dynamics are generally orders of magnitude more important than the other factors. Heat transfer through the tank walls constitutes a loss which is less than a couple percent of the tank capacity for reasonably sized, underground or above-ground, insulated tanks. The importance of convective fluid motion relative to one-dimensional conduction across the thermocline is quantified with a single parameter. Values for this parameter can be estimated from measurements of in-tank temperature profiles or outlet temperature profiles. The model solutions are also used to calculate an estimate of the maximum first law efficiency for stratified storage. Published data shows current storage tanks generally operate at efficiencies of 50 to 80%. The efficiency of a storage-based cooling system is shown to be the product of storage efficiency and chiller efficiency. Storage tank losses must therefore be offset by improvements in chiller efficiency if these systems are to compare favorably with conventional cooling systems on the basis of energy efficiency. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Calculations; Cold storage; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Thermodynamics; Chilled water storage; Chiller efficiency; One dimensional energy equation; Storage tanks; Tank walls; Tanks (containers)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030125861

The energy level and capture cross section of the deep levels are estimated to be about Ec -0.42eV and of the order of 10-17 cm2, respectively. The charge state of the deep levels is determined to be acceptor type by measuring the temperature dependence of the Schottky junction capacitance made in the specimen with the deep levels. The depth profile of the deep level density is found to correspond to that of the complementary error function, and the diffusion coefficient calculated from the profile is in good agreement with that of nitrogen in silicon. It is assumed that generation of deep levels is due to the formation of nitrogen-vacancy complexes, because quenching to room temperature and several hours' storage after quenching are required to form the deep levels. In order to confirm this assumption, we attempted to control the deep level density by changing the vacancy concentration. Oxidation of the specimen surface and formation of oxygen precipitates in silicon are known to decrease the vacancy concentration, since they supply excess interstitials from the oxide and silicon interface. Experimental results clearly show that the deep level density observed in these specimens is very low.","Acceptor; Complex; Deep level; DLTS; Nitrogen; Vacancy","Activation energy; Annealing; Crystal growth; Crystal lattices; Deep level transient spectroscopy; Diffusion; Electric conductivity; Electron energy levels; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Quenching; Temperature; Schottky junction capacitance; Temperature dependence; Semiconducting silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030123682

It provides a means for the extraction of energy from the pond. It acts also as an in-built seasonal energy store. The ground beneath the pond acts as an additional energy store. To enhance the ground energy storage, a method was earlier proposed by the authors employing trapezoidal-shaped trenches at the bottom of the pond. A rigorous method is presented for the determination of the thickness of the lower convective layer in the case of a flat-bottomed pond and the trench depth for a pond with trapezoidal trenches. The energy storage to be provided depends on the magnitude and the pattern of energy extraction. For a constant extraction rate, the required thickness of the lower convective layer or the trench depth increases with an increase in the rate. For a sinusoidal extraction pattern, the thickness or depth increases with an increase in the phase lag of the extraction pattern from the insolation and exhibits a minimum for the amplitude of the extraction pattern for phase lags less than about 95 days. The results also indicate that, for a given heat load (total energy extracted in a year), there exists an area for which the cost of the pond and the associated system for energy utilization is a minimum.

This technique results in reduced size and enhanced conversion efficiency. Input-current wave-shaping and fast output-voltage regulation are achieved by controlling charge and discharge of an energy-storage capacitor on the primary side of the transformer to compensate for the difference between the ac input and the dc output power. Thus, most of the input power is supplied to the output through only a single conversion stage and the low-frequency ripple in the output voltage can be reduced with a small output capacitor. In addition, operation in the continuous conduction mode makes it possible to reduce the size of the input filter, concomitantly decreasing conduction loss. This paper discusses a push-pull current-fed converter that uses this technique. In this circuit, it is necessary to restrict the pulsewidth for the input current control because the pulsewidth for the output voltage control should be expanded to decrease the rms value of the current flowing in the switches. The characteristics of input current distortion caused by this restriction are analyzed and optimization, which takes into account harmonic current characteristics and reduction of conduction loss, is clarified. High-power factor and an efficiency of 88 percent were achieved experimentally.","Harmonic current; High-power factor; Pushpull current-fed converter; Two-input winding transformer","Efficiency; Electric current control; Electric distortion; Electric power factor; Electric transformers; Optimization; Voltage control; Conduction loss; Harmonic current; Push pull current fed converter; Two input winding transformer; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030122349

It shows that the shape of the fusion product depends on the collision energy and the classical impact parameter between the mass centres of the two colliding partners. At impact parameter b = 0, two C60 molecules, colliding at energy E0 = 50 eV in the laboratory frame, coalesce to form a very stable dumbbell-shaped C120 cluster, which never fragments. When the incident energy increases to 400 eV, the two C60 molecules fuse to form a common larger C120 cluster,completely losing the geometry of the original C60 cages. However,the C60 formed in this case is highly deformed and the intrinsic 'heat' energy stored in it is increasing gradually until the 'temperature' of the cluster goes high enough to result in a fragmentation process,which starts with a sequential evaporation of C-dimers, C-trimers,individually C atoms and other small C clusters. Collisions of C60 molecules at larger impact parameters cause rotating motion of the coalescence products.

Technically feasible designs based on: directly irradiated catalyst filled tubes, sodium reflux heat transfer to catalyst tubes and direct absorption of radiation using a windowed pressure vessel, have been identified.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030117077

After 30 min incubation of freshly isolated hepatocytes at 37°C to allow metabolic equilibration, hepatocytes were supplemented with cryoprotectants and cooled in a stepwise manner to liquid nitrogen temperature. Hepatocytes stored in liquid nitrogen for 2 weeks to 6 months were thawed and centrifuged through Percoll to remove damaged cells. Despite similarities in energy status as indexed by ATP content and the rate of urea synthesis in freshly isolated and cryopreserved hepatocytes, cryopreserved hepatocytes were more sensitive to hepatotoxicants. All three hepatotoxicants caused ATP and rates of urea synthesis to decline to a greater extent in cryopreserved than in freshly isolated hepatocytes. Rates of oxygen uptake were higher in cryopreserved cells than in freshly isolated hepatocytes and declined in cryopreserved cells but not in freshly isolated cells during the initial period of incubation. Rates of mitochondrial respiration stimulated with site-specific substrates were comparable in freshly isolated and cryopreserved cells permeabilized with digitonin. Allyl alcohol and acetaminophen inhibited site-specific respiration to the same extent in both groups of cells. Collectively, these results suggest that increased sensitivity to hepatotoxic agents and elevated oxygen consumption in cryopreserved hepatocytes recovered after storage in liquid nitrogen are related to higher demand for energy in these cells rather than to permanent injury caused by cryopreservation and irreversible uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,"adenosine triphosphate; allyl alcohol; carbon tetrachloride; digitonin; paracetamol; propanol; urea; animal; article; cell separation; comparative study; cryopreservation; cytology; drug effect; energy metabolism; in vitro study; liver; male; metabolism; oxygen consumption; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; 1-Propanol; Acetaminophen; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Carbon Tetrachloride; Cell Separation; Cryopreservation; Digitonin; Energy Metabolism; Liver; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Propanols; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030115814

Rigorous survey research has shown that the public holds intense, negative images of ""nuclear"" and ""radioactive"" technologies, activities, and facilities. Potential host states and opponents claim that these negative images, coupled with an amplification of negative risk events, will potentially stigmatize the area surrounding such facilities and result in significant economic losses. At issue is whether a supporting social amplification of risk model is applicable to communities hosting facilities that are part of the U.S. Department of Energy Nuclear Weapons Complex. An initial assessment of high-profile discrete and cumulative key negative risk events at such nuclear facilities does not validate that there has been stigmatization or substantial social and economic consequences in the host areas.

This paper (part II) presents the main results obtained from the optimization and also reports on the second study objective, which was to investigate the impacts on system operating costs of increasing (i) reservoir storage capacity, (ii) treatment plant capacity, and (iii) water demand by consumers. In general, linear programming was found to be a good modelling option for generating optimized pump schedules and service reservoir releases. The analyses of water management alternatives confirmed that RMOC's water supply system was designed for maximum day water demand; however, day-to-day operations would be facilitated if present storage and (or) treatment facilities were enlarged. Economically, it would be difficult to justify construction costs from the potential energy savings obtained from this study and therefore it seems important to start managing demand.","Modelling; Optimization; Pump scheduling; Pumping costs; Water supply system","Costs; Management; Mathematical models; Municipal engineering; Optimization; Pumps; Reservoirs (water); Scheduling; Water treatment plants; Ottawa-Carleton; Pump scheduling; Water demand; Water management; Water supply systems; Modelling; Optimisation; Pumping; Scheduling; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030111819

A stable predispersed organic solvent in the form of polyaphrons of very small diameter results in high surface areas with a minimum energy requirement for mass transfer of solutes from the aqueous phase to the organic solvent. PDSE should greatly improve the performance of a conventional extraction process. This paper focuses on the characterization and size distributions of polyaphrons. Polyaphrons were generated using different cationic, anionic, and nonionic surfactants in water and an oil-soluble nonionic surfactant. Kerosene was used as the organic solvent to form the polyaphrons. Size distributions were obtained using a particle size analyzer. The optimal instrument parameters (sample quantity, optical parameters, run time, etc.) were identified for these measurements. The size distribution based on volume fraction was found to show a bimodal behavior, with peak size maxima between 1-3 and 10-30 μm for all the polyaphrons. The effects of different surfactant types, surfactant concentrations, and storage times on the size distribution spectrum of polyaphrons were studied. The size distribution of different polyaphrons before and after flotation in an aqueous column using colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs) was also studied. Flotation was deduced to occur as a result of electrostatic forces between the CGAs and polyaphrons.",,"Colloids; Flotation; Impurities; Kerosene; Mass transfer; Optical instruments; Organic polymers; Organic solvents; Particle size analysis; Surface active agents; Volume fraction; Wastewater treatment; Colloidal gas aphrons; Hydrophobic contaminants; Polyaphrons; Predispersed solvent extraction; Solvent extraction; Polyaphrons; Predispersed; Solvent Extraction; Solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030111719

The combination of large-deflection beam analysis, kinematic motion analysis, and energy storage makes the analysis of compliant mechanisms difficult. The design of mechanisms often requires iteration between synthesis and analysis procedures. In general, the difficulty in analysis has limited the use of compliant mechanisms to applications where only simple functions and motions are required. The pseudorigid- body model concept promises to be the key to unifying the compliant and rigidbody mechanism theories. It simplifies compliant mechanism analysis by determining an equivalent rigid-body mechanism that accurately models the kinematic characteristics of a compliant mechanism. Once this model is obtained, many well known concepts from rigid-body mechanism theory become amenable for use to analyze and design compliant mechanisms. The pseudo-rigid-body-model concept is used to develop a loop-closure method for the analysis and synthesis of compliant mechanisms. The method allows compliant mechanisms to be designed for tasks that would have earlier been assumed to be unlikely, if not impossible, applications of compliant mechanisms. © 1996 by ASME.",,"Iterative methods; Kinematics; Mathematical models; Mechanisms; Vectors; Compliant mechanisms; Kinematic motion analysis; Large deflection beam analysis; Loop closure theory; Rigid body mechanism theory; Machine design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030108494

Their spectrum peaks in a wavelength range where conventional x-ray tubes provide poor intensity. With correct optimization, both continuous radiation or line radiation with λ/Δλ&gt;1000 can be produced for broadband and narrowband applications, respectively. Because of their low cost and their compact size, pinch plasmas seem well suited to supplement research activities based on synchrotron radiation. In this paper, pinch plasma sources developed for x-ray lithography and x-ray microscopy are described. Their emission characteristics are optimized with regard to specific requirements given by the particular application and are compared to laser produced plasmas.

The source for microscopy applications enables flash imaging of biological specimens with suboptical resolution (0.1-0.2 μm) at nanosecond exposure times.

The effect of tank height on the annual solar fraction of the system has been investigated for different hot water load temperatures and storage tank volumes. Optimum values (values which maximize the annual solar fraction of the system) for storage tank height and volume are calculated for operating temperatures ranging from 50 to 80°C. The response of the system to the ratio of the storage tank volume to the collector area is investigated. The dependence of the solar fraction on tank height was observed to be more notable in the case of large tank volumes and high load temperatures. The results indicate the existence of an optimum value for the tank volume at a given tank height and a high load temperature. At lower temperatures, the solar fraction rises rapidly with tank volume to a nearly constant level. An optimum value of the storage-tank-volume-to-collector-area ratio was also observed at high load temperatures.

However, there are problems with storage batteries, e.g., long charging time, limited cycle life, low Coulomb efficiency, and inaccurate residual power meters. Because of these problems, practical power applications have not been achieved. To solve these problems, a complex system of capacitors and electronic circuits called the ECS (Energy Capacitor System) is proposed. The capacitor part of the ECS is a group of electric double-layer capacitors of increased energy density. The circuits part is built around switching regulators. Although the capacitors alone are not capable of delivering stable output, the accompanying circuits compensate for various characteristics throughout the charge and discharge cycle. This combination of capacitors and electronic circuits increases the energy density by about 16 times that of the conventional electric double-layer capacitors, close to the level of lead-acid batteries but with lower output resistance and better voltage stability. The ECS inherently features short charging time, very long cycle life, and good Coulomb efficiency. The cells are completely sealed and made from materials which are not harmful to the environment.","Electric double-layer capacitor; Electrical power storage device; Energy density; Power density; Secondary battery; Switching regulator","Electric batteries; Electric charge; Electric discharges; Energy storage; Hydroelectric power plants; Networks (circuits); Switching systems; Coulomb efficiency; Electric double layer capacitors; Energy capacitor system; Energy density; Power storage capacitor systems; Residual power meters; Storage batteries; Switching regulator; Capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030102285

Depending on how the fibres and the plastic are compounded, properties of the composite may or may not depend on particle size. Nevertheless, it is necessary to get the fibres below some top size and into a suitable shape for better handling during storage and feeding and later moulding. Szego Mill products are easier to feed and handle, compared to those from a hammer mill, for example. Particle size distribution, bulk density and flowability of the products were determined after open circuit grinding under different conditions and after classification. Bulk density of newsprint triples when the top size of the particles decreases from 3 mm to 425 μm. Flowability on a volumetric basis remains almost constant and, hence, the mass flow rate depends only on changes of bulk density. Capacity and specific energy consumption of grinding depend strongly on particle size distribution in the feed and the desired top size of the product. A production rate of 220 kg/h was reached while reducing newsprint particle size from 3000 μm to < 425 μm in the SM-320 mill.

The designs differ from previous receivers in utilizing axial conduction in the storage material for attenuation of the solar flux transients due to intermittent cloud cover, and in having convective heat removal at the base of the receiver. One-dimensional, time-dependent heat transfer equations are formulated for the storage material temperature field, including losses to the environment, and a general heat exchange effectiveness boundary condition at the base. The solar source flux is represented as the sum of steady and periodic cloud-transient components, with the steady component solved subject to specified receiver thermal efficiency. For the transient cloud-cover component the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT) is applied, and the complex transfer function of the receiver is obtained as a filter for the input flux spectrum.

PV DSM systems under investigation by CEEP include rooftop, non-dispatchable PV DSM and the integration of PV arrays and storage to provide dispatchable peak shaving capabilities. Analysis to date, on five case study utilities, shows that PV DSM systems can offer substantial value to utilities and their customers.

The slow scan CCD camera allows separating the relatively short data acquisition process from the more lengthy digitizing, storage, and data analysis processes. Typical total effective exposure times can therefore be reduced to about 200-300 s (1 s per energy point) at a primary beam current of 100 nA which corresponds to a total dose of about 12 e per adsorbate particle; further decrease is possible. The total measurement time for collecting a complete set of LEED images is of the order of 30-40 min which assures the exclusion of contamination effects, even for sensitive layers.

The present work investigated the effects of aluminum, magnesium, and silicon ions on hole burning and the phonon sideband for borate glasses that exhibit PHB at room temperature. Hole burning was measured for the 5D0-7F0 transition of Sm2+ and the phonon sideband spectrum for the 5D0-7F0 transition of Eu3+. The hole width was closely related to local structural change, especially as it seemed to decrease with decreases in the number of nonbridging oxygens produced around the rare-earth ions. In the case of sodium aluminoborate glasses, the hole width decreased considerably with increasing alumina content. The ratio Γih/Γh for 85B2O3-·10Al2O 3·5Na2O-·1Sm2O3 glass, then, was 80 at room temperature, the largest value ever reported.",,"Aluminum; Band structure; Composition effects; Doping (additives); Electron energy levels; Magnesium; Photochemical reactions; Samarium; Silicon; Structure (composition); Photochemical hole burning; Glass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030084730

By measuring the amount and ratio of the beam-induced positron-emitting activity, the dose distribution and tissue composition may be determined. The system utilizes fast LeCroy ECLine electronics and a VME multinode transputer based frontend. Utilizing a transputer based filter, positron annihilation events containing timing, energy, and position information will be filtered in real-time at event rates of up to 40 kHz. This will result in only valid events being transmitted back to the host for further analysis and display, reducing both storage media requirements and image reconstruction time. At these rates proton radiotherapy beams may be monitored between beam pulses for on-line range verification. It will also be possible to perform bloodflow studies on tumors using the activity induced by a γ-ray radiotherapy beam. Future electronic developments will allow event rates up to roughly 80 kHz. For both treatment modalities, determination of the composition of tumors will directly affect treatment planning through compensation for oxygen enhancement effects to the dose. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Data acquisition; Gamma rays; Imaging systems; Medical imaging; Oncology; Online systems; Performance; Positron emission tomography; Protons; Radiotherapy; Real time systems; Signal filtering and prediction; Dose distribution; Image reconstruction time; Online imaging systems; Positron emitting activity; Radiotherapy beams; Storage media requirements; Tissue composition; Transputer based data acquisition systems; Tumor; Parallel processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030084547

ECR plasma cleaning shows superior performance over reactive ion etch (RIE), RF plasma, and dilute HF wet cleaning methods. The high density but low incident energy of the ECR plasma process minimizes surface damage. In addition, the high directionality of this process effectively removes surface impurities from sub-half-micron-sized contacts, resulting in low and stable contact resistance. The ECR plasma cleaning process also reshapes the contact profile in favor of contact filling by Al reflow and is extremely effective for contact cleaning, especially when H2 is incorporated to the ECR plasma cleaning process. Thus it shows great promise as a future contact cleaning technology of choice.","Al; Contact cleaning; Contact resistance; DRAM; ECR; H2; Reflow; RF; RIE","Aluminum; Auger electron spectroscopy; Electric contacts; Electron cyclotron resonance; Hydrogen; Impurities; Plasma applications; Random access storage; Scanning electron microscopy; Surfaces; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Contact cleaning; Contact resistance; Dynamic random access memory; Surface cleaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030079612

School of Medicine, London, NW3 2QG, United Kingdom","The current study was undertaken to investigate energy metabolism during hypoxia in the cold in livers from euthermic and hibernating Columbian ground squirrels. We hypothesized that the hibernating Columbian ground squirrel would be able to maintain liver energetics for a considerably longer time than euthermic animals. Particular reference was made to the function of glycolysis, which is the only mechanism for energy production under hypothermic ischemia. The transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism was apparent in both euthermic and hibernating animals as lactate levels rose within 1-3 h; total lactate accumulation was 2.5 μmol/g in both groups. In euthermic squirrels, liver ATP and ADP decreased considerably over the first 3-h storage; values dropped by 55% and 34%, respectively. Conversely, as the drain on high energy phosphate pools progressed, there was an increase in low energy adenylate, AMP. Between 10 and 24 h of storage, increases in AMP accounted for approximately 25-30% of total ATP + ADP decrease. The remainder of the drop in adenylates was accounted for by considerable decreases in total adenylate (TA) contents; by 24 h TA contents had decreased by 2.0 μmol/g. Livers from hibernating squirrels exhibited similar patterns of adenylate change and were not significantly higher than their euthermic counterparts. With respect to regulatory control of glycolysis, livers from euthermic squirrels exhibited no regulatory control at phosphofructokinase (PFK) or pyruvate kinase (PK). Livers from hibernating animals, however, showed an activation at PFK by 10 h of cold storage; levels of hexose phosphates, glucose-6-phosphate + fructose 6-phosphate (G6P + F6P), dropped and fructose 1,6-biphosphate (F1,6P2), increased. Changes in metabolite levels (phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate) associated with another key suspect regulatory enzyme, PK, indicated no role in regulatory control of glycolysis during the 24-h period. The apparent increase in PFK responsiveness to declining energy stores may be a futile activation since there was no accompanying increase in anaerobic end product, lactate, and no maintenance of energetics. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,"Animalia; Sciuridae; Spermophilus columbianus; adenine nucleotide; anaerobic growth; animal; anoxia; article; biological model; cold; energy metabolism; hibernation; hypothermia; in vitro study; liver; metabolism; organ preservation; physiology; Sciuridae; Adenine Nucleotides; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Anoxia; Cold; Energy Metabolism; Hibernation; Hypothermia; Liver; Models, Biological; Organ Preservation; Sciuridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030074354

The parallel hybrid system is based on the combination of an Otto-cycle engine with an electric motor and a flywheel providing a short-term energy storage. This configuration permits intermittent charging of the flywheel by the combustion engine which runs only during about 10% of the driving time. Each exhaust gas pulse (duration typically ca. 3 s) is preceded by an air pulse, which results from the filling of the engine cylinders with air at start up and shut off. Experimental studies indicated that the air pulses have a negative impact on the performance of the catalytic converter, reducing the inherent benefits resulting from the intermittent operation mode of the combustion engine. Forced asymmetric λ-cycling during exhaust pulses was found to be most beneficial for improving catalyst performance. A simple reduced kinetic model derived from a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for CO oxidation, which was extended by introducing CO and O2 equivalents to mimic the complex exhaust gas, was used to describe the dynamic behavior of the TWC. The model proved to be useful for finding the optimal λ-cycling conditions. Experiments with a real Otto-cycle engine exhaust proved that the reduced kinetic model is suitable for use in a closed loop λ-control.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Closed loop control systems; Dynamics; Electric motors; Exhaust gases; Oxidation; Performance; Pulsatile flow; Reaction kinetics; Catalytic converter; Combustion engine; Hybrid drive system; Intermittent operation mode; Kinetic model; Langmuir Hinshelwood model; Otto cycle engine; Three way catalyst; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030073695

In this study, we examined whether the pancreas grafts preserved by the two-layer method maintained adenine nucleotides pool as substrates for ATP synthesis before reperfusion and had the ability to synthesize ATP promptly and to recover energy charge potential (ECP) of the pancreas graft on reperfusion. After preservation by the two-layer cold storage method using EC for 48 hrs (group 1, n = 5), or simple cold storage in EC for 48 hrs (group 2, n = 5), canine pancreas grafts were autotransplanted. In control (group 3, n = 5), canine pancreas grafts were autotransplanted without preservation. Tissue adenine nucleotides concentrations were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) before and after preservation, before reperfusion and after 1 hr- and 2 hr-reperfusion. Graft survival rates were 5/5, 0/5, and 5/5, in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Total adenine nucleotides before reperfusion in group 1 was almost same levels as group 2 (7.41 +/- 1.47 vs 6.64 +/- 2.23 mumol/g dry weight, N.S.). Furthermore, ATP tissue levels in group 1 before reperfusion was 2.90 +/- 0.51 mumol/g dry weight and almost same levels as group 2 (2.03 +/- 0.68 mumol/g dry weight, N.S.). However, tissue ATP levels in group 1 after 2 hrs of reperfusion (6.71 +/- 1.19 mumol/g dry weight) were significantly higher than group 2 (4.51 +/- 0.51 mumol/g dry weight, P < 0.05), and almost same levels as control (group 3) (6.32 +/- 1.62 mumol/g dry weight, N.S.). In addition, ECP in group 1 and 3 (0.90 +/- 0.03 and 0.83 +/- 0.09, respectively) after 2 hr-reperfusion, were significantly higher than the value in group 2 (0.73 +/- 0.09, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). It was clear that recovery of ATP on reperfusion was not depend on the residual nucleotides pool before reperfusion but the ability of the pancreas graft to recover tissue ATP levels and energy charge potential after reperfusion.

Saturating illumination enhanced the magnitude of the PA signal in MV-treated leaves in contrast with the opposite result usually found in untreated intact leaves where saturating illumination abolishes the photobaric component of the PA signal due to oxygen evolution and thus decreases the total PA signal. A linear relationship was found between the changes induced by continuous background light in the negative response of PA signal to saturating light in intact leaves and in the positive response in MV-treated leaves. A linear relationship was also observed in MV-treated leaves between the positive changes in the PA signal and the changes in the rate of electron transport through photosystem II (PSII) calculated from chlorophyll fluorescence data. The conclusion was drawn that only the thermal component contributes to the PA signal measured at low modulated frequency in MV-treated leaves because the enhanced O2 uptake provides a zero net oxygen exchange by superimposing with O2 evolution. The leaves preheated at temperatures above 43°C demonstrated the positive response of the PA signal to saturating light at 35 Hz. In leaves preheated at 41.5°C, the first and second saturating pulses induced the enhancement of PA signal, whereas other pulses decreased the PA signal due to onset of oxygen evolution. The energy storage activity measured in the absence of oxygen evolution in heat-treated leaves is proposed to be associated with cyclic electron transport activities around PSII and PSI.",,"Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030069305

A nonlinear least-squares numerical fitting program based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was developed to analyze the glow curves. General-order kinetics formula with a single energy level of traps was adopted as the fitting function. The results indicate that both fading and photon energies have pronounced influence on the kinetic parameters. In the storage times experiments, change in traps distribution due to diffusion at room temperature may be the main reason causing the variations in activation energies. In the different sources experiments, different spatial distributions of trapped charge carries due to the different photoelectric effect of different photon energies may influence the binding energies. Other factors such as trapped charge conversion from one type of trap to another, competing non-radiation defect interaction and different photon energies may be used for interpreting the drift phenomenon of activation energies. Temperature dependence of frequency factor, variations of temperature lag and fluctuation and shift of the distribution frequency factor can be used to interpret the drift phenomenon of frequency factor. Kinetic order variation during the heating stage can also be used to interpret the drift phenomenon of kinetic order. Peak 3 of 55Fe (high LET radiation) irradiated samples exhibits a different character with respect to peak 3 of other source-related glow curves. This may be due to the invalidity of the general-order equation and the increase of retrapping probability.",,"article; controlled study; linear energy transfer; priority journal; storage; thermoluminescence dosimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030064881

After the breeding season, migrant passerine birds moult and subsequently migrate to their winter quarters. Moult and migration involve different physiological processes (replacement of body proteins vs energy storage for endurance flights). This study investigates metabolic responses to three phases of the annual cycle (postbreeding, moulting and migratory periods) in three physiological situations (feeding during the day, overnight fasted, short-term fasted) by examining six plasma metabolite levels of three bird species. 2. In birds feeding during the day, diurnal body mass gain, triglyceride and free fattyacid plasma levels were higher during the migratory period than during the postbreeding and moulting periods. This reflects hyperphagia and hyperlipogenesis in preparation for migratory flights. 3. No clear effects of moult were found on the metabolite levels examined. 4. Overnight fasting was generally characterized by low protein catabolism (low uric acid levels) and increased fat utilization (high free fatty-acid, glycerol and β-hydroxy-butyrate levels), compared with feeding birds. 5. During the migratory period, however, overnight fasted birds showed no elevated free fatty-acid levels, a more marked drop in triglyceride levels, unchanged glucose levels, less increased β-hydroxy-butyrate levels and a stronger decrease in uric acid levels than birds in the postbreeding and moulting periods. This suggests that the increased fat deposition rate during the migratory period leads to increased hepatic and muscular lipid stores by the end of the day. During the migratory period, a higher utilization of these triglycerides allows a lower utilization of fatty acids from adipose tissues and a more effective sparing of protein and carbohydrates during overnight fasting than during the postbreeding period. 6. These metabolic responses were more pronounced in the Blackcap and Robin than in the Garden Warbler which starts migration when it is in the last stages of moult.","Bird migration; Fat metabolism; Glucose; Moult; Protein metabolism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030063180

Addition of sucrose resulted in a transitory alkalinization of the bathing solution whereas additions of glucose, fructose or raffinose had no effect. Dissipating the proton motive force by exposing cotyledons and isolated transfer cell protoplasts to an alkaline pH, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, weak acids (propionic acid and 5,5′-dimethyl-oxazolidine-2,4-dione) or tetraphenylphos-phonium ion resulted in a significant reduction of sucrose uptake. The ATPase inhibitors, erythrosin B (EB), diethylstilbestrol (DES) and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) were found to abolish the sucrose-induced medium alkanization as well as reduce sucrose uptake. Cytochemical localization of the ATPase, based on lead precipitation, demonstrated that the highest activity was present in the plasma membranes located in wall ingrowth regions of the dermal transfer cells. The presence of a transplasma-membrane redox system was detected by the extracellular reduction of the electron acceptor, hexa-cyanoferrate III. The reduction of the ferric ion was coupled to a release of protons. The redox-induced proton extrusion was abolished by the ATPase inhibitors EB, DES and DCCD suggesting that proton extrusion was solely through the H+-ATPase. Based on these findings, it is postulated that cotyledonary dermal transfer cells take up sucrose by a proton symport mechanism with the proton motive force being generated by a H+-ATPase. Sucrose uptake by the storage parenchyma and inner epidermal cells of the cotyledons did not exhibit characteristics consistent with sucrose-proton symport.","Cotyledon (developing; Vicia); Dermal transfer cells; Plasma membrane ATpase; Proton motive force; Proton sucrose symport; Vicia (sugar uptake)","Vicia faba; Vicia faba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030060702

The mechanism of sucrose accumulation was studied by measuring 14C-sucrose and 14C-glucose uptake rates at three different stages of fruit development, and by assaying weekly the activity of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis and/or synthesis of the soluble sugars. Uptake of 0.5-100 mM 14C-sucrose and 14C-glucose by mesocarp tissue slices showed a complex pattern at the first stage of fruit development (62 DAA). During the subsequent growth stages the pattern of sugar uptake changed and was approximately monophasic at the third stage of fruit development. At 10 mM, glucose was taken up more rapidly than sucrose at the first and second stage of fruit development. Uptake was partially inhibited by the uncoupler carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) at 25 μM. These results, together with the presence of a putative extracellular invertase, suggest an apoplastic route for sucrose uptake which is dependent, at least in part, on energy supply. Activities of sucrose hydrolyzing enzymes (insoluble acid invertase, soluble acid invertase, neutral invertase, sucrose synthase) were high in young fruits and declined sharply with fruit development concomitantly with accumulation of sucrose. The storage of the sugar was not accompanied by a rise in synthetic activities (sucrose synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase), suggesting that sucrose could, at least in part enter the carbohydrate pool directly.","14C-sugar uptake; Peach fruit; Prunus persica; Sucrose accumulation; Sucrose enzyme activities; Sucrose metabolism","Prunus persica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030057613

This paper reports the effects of supplying nitrogen as nitrate, ammonia, and molecular nitrogen on the growth, trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation capacity, and energy storage capacity of a mixed methane-oxidizing culture. Cells inoculated from a nitrate-supplied methane-oxidizing culture grew fastest while fixing atmospheric nitrogen when oxygen partial pressures were kept less than 8%. Cell growth and methane oxidation were more rapid for ammonia-supplied cells than for nitrate-supplied or nitrogen-fixing cells. However, nitrogen-fixing cells were capable of oxidizing TCE as efficiently as nitrate- or ammonia- supplied cells, and they exhibited the highest TCE transformation capacity of all three cultures both with and without formate as an exogenous reducing energy source. The TCE product toxicity was not as pronounced for the nitrogen-fixing cells as for the nitrate- or ammonia-supplied cells after exposure to high (20 mg/L) or low (2 mg/L) TeE concentrations. Energy storage in the form of po]y-β-hydroxybutyrate was 20% to 30% higher for nitrogen- fixing cells; increased energy storage may be responsible for the higher transformaton capacity of nitrogen-fixing cells when no external reducing energy was available. However, because nitrogen-fixing cells also exhibited the highest transformation capacity in the presence of formate, their cometabolic activity was enhanced beyond that which can be explained by increased energy storage alone.","biodegradation; methanotrophs; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen source; trichloroethylene","methane; trichloroethylene; article; bacterium culture; biodegradation; cell growth; degradation; methanotrophic bacterium; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; oxidation; oxygen tension; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030052804

Commissioning and quality assurance techniques were developed for the EPID. Methods and Materials: A commissioning procedure was developed consisting of five parts: (a) physical operation and safety; (b) image acquisition, resolution, and sensitivity calibration; (c) image storage, analysis, and handling; (d) reference image acquisition; and (e) clinical operations. Results: The physical operation and safety tests relate to the motions of the unit, stability of the unit supports, safety interlocks, and interlock overrides. Imager contrast and spatial resolutions are monitored by imaging a contrast-detail phantom. The imager calibration procedure consists of a no-radiation image to compensate for signal offsets, as well as a 'flat-field image.' The flat-field image is taken with 5.0 cm of homogeneous phantom material placed at isocenter to provide some photon scatter and to approximate the presence of a patient. Daily quality assurance procedures consists of safety tests and the acquisition and inspection of images of the contrast-detail phantom. After 1 year, the frequency of the daily procedure was reduced to weekly. Quarterly QA procedures are conducted by the physicist and consist of the same procedures conducted in the weekly test. The annual QA procedure consists of a duplication of the commissioning procedure. Conclusion: The procedures discussed in this article were applied to an ionization-chamber device. They have been useful in identifying difficulties with the EPID operation, including the need for recalibrating and monitoring the accelerator output stability.","Electronic portal imaging devices; On-line radiation therapy imaging; Radiation therapy quality assurance","article; calibration; image analysis; imaging system; machine; priority journal; quality control; radiotherapy; safety",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030051211

Under similar conditions, glutaraldehyde inactivated approximately 90%, and hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, and phenol produced little killing of spores in suspension. By kinetic analysis at different temperatures, we calculated the rate of spore inactivation (k) and the activation energy of spore killing (ΔE) for each chemical agent. Rates of spore inactivation had a similar ΔE value of approximately 20 kcal/mol (ca. 83.68 kJ/mol) for every substance tested.

Under normal refrigerated storage conditions, the shelf life of these products is limited by enzymatic and microbiological spoilage. However, with increasing consumer demands for fresh products with extended shelf life and increasing energy costs associated with freezing and frozen storage, the fish-processing industry is actively seeking alternative methods of shelf life preservation and marketability of fresh, refrigerated fish and at the same time economizing on energy costs. Additional methods that could fulfill these objectives include chemical decontamination, low-dose irradiation, ultra-high pressure, and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). This review focuses on the biochemical and microbiological composition of fresh fish/shellfish, the spoilage patterns in these products, factors influencing spoilage, and the combination treatments that can be used in conjunction with refrigeration to extend the shelf life and keeping quality of fresh fish/shellfish. The safety concerns of minimally processed/MAP fish, specifically with respect to the growth of Clostridium botulinum type E, is also addressed.","Chemical decontamination; Fish; High pressure; Irradiation; Modified atmospheres; Preservation; Safety; Shellfish; Spoilage","enzyme; food preservative; animal; fish; food control; food handling; food irradiation; food preservation; methodology; review; shellfish; temperature; time; Animals; Enzymes; Fishes; Food Irradiation; Food Microbiology; Food Preservation; Food Preservatives; Food Technology; Shellfish; Temperature; Time Factors; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030037942

The model provides a self-contained description of energy and mass fluxes and regulation of partitioning of photosynthate during phytoplankton adaptation to irradiance. The kinetics and steady-state outcomes of photoadaptation are described in terms of changes in the rates of synthesis of three intracellular carbon pools. These pools account for the distribution of cell material between light-harvesting components, the biosynthetic apparatus, and energy storage compounds. Regulation of the flow of recent photosynthate to these pools is controlled by the ratio of realized to potential photosynthetic electron flow at a given instant. The responses of growth rate and Chl a:C to static and dynamic irradiance regimes can be adequately described by specifying four parameters: the initial slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve, the maximum growth rate, the maximum Chl a:C observed under light limitation, and the maintenance metabolic rate.

Ischemia was modeled by disabling the generation of active stress in a region comprising ~12% of total wall volume. In the model simulations, the ~12% reduction in the amount of normally contracting tissue resulted in an ~25% reduction in stroke work compared with the normal situation. The more- than-proportional loss of stroke work may partly be attributed to storage of elastic energy in the bulging ischemic region. Furthermore the mechanical performance in the nonischemic border zone deteriorated because of reduced systolic fiber stress (if fibers were in series with those in the ischemic region) or reduced fiber shortening (if fibers were parallel). The deformation pattern of the ventricle was asymmetric with respect to the ischemic region because of the anisotropy of the myocardial tissue. Epicardial fiber shortening in and around the ischemic region, as predicted from the model simulations, was in qualitative agreement with shortening, as measured in four dogs in which ischemia was induced by occlusion of the distal part of the left anterior interventricular coronary artery.","contractile work; finite-element model; ischemic border zone; left ventricular deformation","animal model; article; biomechanics; dog; heart cycle; heart left ventricle contractility; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle pressure; heart left ventricle volume; heart muscle ischemia; heart stroke volume; mathematical model; nonhuman; pressure volume curve; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030022226

The deficiency in light harvesting capacity of PSII caused by the Cu-induced chlorophyll loss may result in the energy distribution of the two photosystems being out of balance. Copper decreased maximal fluorescence (Fm, Fm′) and changes at the variable fluorescence were also observed. The reduction state of the primary electron acceptor (QA) of PSII in leaves resulted in changes due to the imbalance between the rate of QA reduction by PSII activity and the rate of QA- reoxidation by PSI activity. Copper treatment also resulted in a dramatic decrease of Rfd (vitality index), a moderate decrease in PES (energy storage) and a marginal decrease in Fv′,/Fm′ values. High Cu concentrations inhibit O2 evolution and the enhanced heat emission may be due to an inhibition of electron transfer and consequently of photochemistry.

To investigate the questions of oil bleed and the fate of triglycerides that might escape from ruptured breast implants, experiments reported here used peanut oil labeled with radioisotopes so that it could be traced in the urine, feces, and organs of two groups of rabbits. In one experiment, 18 rabbits were implanted with peanut oil-filled implants labeled with tritium to determine whether triglycerides diffuse across silicone elastomer shells. In another experiment, 19 rabbits were injected with 14C-labeled peanut oil to study what might happen to the oil if an implant ruptures. At the end of the follow-up period, we measured radioisotope levels in tissue samples taken from the periprosthetic capsule or injection site of each rabbit, as well as from major organs and the subcutaneous fat on the dorsum opposite the experimental site. One experiment revealed that triglycerides do bleed across the implant shells. Tritium levels were highest in the implant capsule, the omentum, the aorta, and the subcutaneous fat on the nonexperimental side. In the experiment simulating implant rupture, 14C levels were above the background radiation count at the injection site and in the same tissue sites as in the bleed experiment. Both in vivo radiolabeling studies indicate that triglycerides freed from implants by means of bleed or rupture would be absorbed, metabolized, and either excreted or redistributed to the body's normal fat storage sites if they are not needed for energy. In a third in vitro experiment, triglyceride oil specimens were inoculated with various microorganisms associated with wound infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. The data demonstrate that neutral triglycerides used as a breast implant filler do not support growth of common infection-producing bacteria and suggest that triglycerides may have bactericidal properties.",,"triacylglycerol; tritium; animal experiment; animal model; article; bacterial growth; breast endoprosthesis; implant; isotope labeling; membrane rupture; nonhuman; priority journal; radiography; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Aorta; Arachis hypogaea; Biology; Breast Implants; Carbon Radioisotopes; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure; Escherichia coli; Feces; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Mammary Glands, Animal; Omentum; Plant Oils; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Rabbits; Silicone Elastomers; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Tissue Distribution; Triglycerides; Tritium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030002999

We investigated whether inhibition of the exchanger can protect the heart against damage after prolonged hypothermic storage with the use of the selective inhibitor 3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl-guanidine methanesulfonate (HOE 694). Methods: After equilibration, isolated rabbit hearts were arrested with a 3 minute infusion of modified St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution and subsequently maintained in ischemic arrest at 4°C for 12 hours before reperfusion at 37°C for 60 minutes. Left ventricular function and creatine kinase release were measured at intervals throughout reperfusion. High-energy phosphate and adenine nucleotide content were determined in hearts before cardioplegia, at the end of the 12-hour storage period, and at the end of reperfusion. HOE-694 (1 μmol/L) was administered either with cardioplegia and throughout reperfusion (study 1) or selectively with either cardioplegia or reperfusion only (study 2). Results: In study 1, systolic function in untreated hearts recovered to less than 40% of preischemic values and was associated with a greater than 1,000% percent sustained elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. In contrast, systolic recovery in HOE 694-treated hearts was significantly accelerated and improved to approximately 80%, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased to only 300% of baseline. Significant protection also occurred in those hearts in which HOE 694 was administered only at reperfusion while the drug was less effective if given only during cardioplegia. Creatine kinase release was not significantly affected except in study 2, where it was significantly lower after 60 minutes of reperfusion in hearts where HOE 694 was added at the time of reperfusion. Tissue metabolite content was not affected by drug treatment. Conclusions: This study shows a marked protective effect of the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor HOE 694 in rabbit hearts subjected to 12 hours of hypothermic ischemia and strongly suggests that antiport inhibitors could play an effective role in myocardial preservation.",,"(3 methylsulfonyl 4 piperidinobenzoyl)guanidine methanesulfonate; animal tissue; article; heart function; heart muscle ischemia; hypothermia; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit; regional perfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029996322

Excessive refeeding results in major fat deposition which is not well tolerated by patients. Prediction of BMR is, therefore, a clinical issue during refeeding, but measurement by indirect calorimetry is time-consuming and not widely available. The study aim was to determine if and when BMR could be estimated from prediction formulas based on FFM derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in AN patients during refeeding. Indirect calorimetry and BIA were prospectively measured bi-weekly in 9 AN patients (body mass index 13.7 ± 0.5 kg/m2) for in weeks of refeeding. Initial BMR was 969 ± 46.7 kcal/d and 27.7 ± 1.4 kcal/kg FFM, and at week 10 increased to 1360 ± 44.6 kcal/d and 35.8 ± 0.8 kcal/kg FFM. While correlations improved with increasing weight, FFM and body mass index, prediction formulas are insufficient to permit prediction of BMR based on weight or FFM, even after 10 weeks of refeeding. To allow for optimal nutritional support, indirect calorimetry measurements may be useful in the early weeks of refeeding because of a large variability of basal metabolic rate between patients.",,"adolescent; adult; anorexia nervosa; article; basal metabolic rate; body mass; calorimetry; clinical article; energy expenditure; female; human; impedance; lipid storage; nutritional support; prediction; refeeding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029991628

Euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp experiments were performed with somatostatin infusions so that insulin could be replaced to basal levels or to physiological hyperinsulinemia. Arteriovenous leg balance methods were used to measure the pathways of leg muscle glucose uptake, oxidation, and storage. Percutaneous biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were taken to determine the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or glycogen synthase activities. During basal insulin replacement, obese compared with lean nondiabetic subjects had higher values for glucose uptake, respiratory quotient, and glucose oxidation (all P < 0.05) and a higher proportion of leg energy expenditure derived from glucose. Obese NIDD patients had a greater reliance on fat calories than lean diabetics during basal insulin replacement (P < 0.05). Hyperinsulinemia increased leg glucose metabolism (P < 0.001) in all groups, but obese NIDD patients were significantly more insulin resistant. Hyperglycemia in NIDDM compensated for insulin resistance to the extent that rates of glucose metabolism were the same as those for nondiabetics studied at euglyemia. When nondiabetics were studied at hyperglycemia matched to the diabetics, the insulin resistance was still readily apparent.","non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; substrate oxidation","alanine; carbohydrate; fat; glucose; glycogen synthase; insulin; lactic acid; pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; somatostatin; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; article; calorimetry; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; enzyme activity; female; gas exchange; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; glucose transport; human; human tissue; hyperglycemia; insulin resistance; leg blood flow; male; muscle metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; respiratory quotient; skeletal muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029980383

In the present study we examined the importance of the greater incremental glucose and insulin concentrations on glycogen repletion by comparing intake of large carbohydrate meals ('gorging') with a pattern of frequent, small, carbohydrate snacks ('nibbling'), which simulates the flattened glucose and insulin responses after low-GI carbohydrate meals. Eight well-trained triathletes (x̄ ± SEM: 25.6 ± 1.5 y of age, weighing 70.2 ± 1.9 kg, and with a maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2 max) of 4.2 ± 0.2 L/min] undertook an exercise trial (2 h at 75% VO2 max followed by four 30-s sprints) to deplete muscle glycogen on two occasions, 1 wk apart. For 24 h after each trial, subjects rested and consumed the same diet composed exclusively of high GI carbohydrate foods, providing 10 g carbohydrate/kg body mass. The 'gorging' trial provided the food as four large meals of equal carbohydrate content eaten at 0, 4, 8, and 20 h of recovery, whereas in the 'nibbling' trial each of the meals was divided into four snacks and fed at hourly intervals (0-11, 20-23 h). However, there was no significant difference in muscle glycogen storage between the two groups over the 24 h (gorging: 74.1 ± 8.0 mmol/kg wet wt; nibbling: 94.5 ± 14.6 mmol/kg wet wt). The results of this study suggest that there is no difference in postexercise glycogen storage over 24 h when a high-carbohydrate diet is fed as small frequent snacks or as large meals, and that a mechanism other than lowered blood glucose and insulin concentrations needs to be sought to explain the reduced rate of glycogen storage after consumption of low-GI carbohydrate foods.","glycemic index; meal frequency; Postexercise glycogen storage","adult; article; athlete; carbohydrate intake; dietary intake; energy metabolism; exercise; frequency analysis; glucose blood level; glucose oxidation; glycogen muscle level; glycogen synthesis; human; human experiment; malabsorption; meal; normal human",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029946519

Cellular parameters: volumes, sodium, pH and high energy phosphates, were measured by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in rat hearts during 12 h of storage at 4°C and reperfusion, along with functional parameters. Cell volumes were measured by 1H and 59Co NMR using the extracellular marker cobalticyanide, pH and energetics by 31P NMR and sodium compartmental distribution by 23Na NMR spectroscopy using the shift reagent Dy(TTHA)-3. Three storage solutions were applied: Krebs-Henseleit (containing 144 mM sodium, KH), a solution supplemented with 0.20 mM amiloride (KH-ami) and a solution containing 23 mM sodium and 242 mM mannitol (KH-man). Inhibition of the Na/H antiport with amiloride reduced the cellular sodium accumulation by 56%. The end-ischemic concentrations were 45 mM (KH-ami) and 77 mM (KH). Amiloride also reduced the extent of cell swelling by 53% from an end-ischemic volume of 3.56 ml/gdw (KH) to 2.97 ml/gdw (KH-ami), however cell swelling persisted in both groups at reperfusion (33% increase in cell water). The molar ratio of sodium and water cellular accumulation was constant: Na/H2O ~ 3.7 x 10-3 throughout the whole storage period. Inhibition of the antiport was protective for the high energy phosphates during ischemia and reperfusion. In KH-ami the pH acidified after 6 h of storage to an end-ischemic value of 6.35 (pH = 6.50 in KH); this difference persisted after 60 min of reperfusion, pH = 6.98 in KH-ami and pH = 7.1 in KH. Storage in the low-sodium solution was disadvantageous for the high energy phosphates during ischemia and reperfusion, with a recovery of pH to 6.92 when reperfused with KH. Hearts stored with amiloride or mannitol solution failed to resume contraction at reperfusion. It is concluded: (a) the antiport is active at 4°C; (b) during ischemia it mediates sodium influx and contributes to cell swelling with minor effects on the cytosolic pH; (c) at reperfusion the antiport is active, it participates in the extrusion of excess protons, but has a minor impact on sodium and water homeostasis; (d) inhibition of the antiport does not protect the cardiac muscle at low temperatures.","23Na NMR; 31P NMR; 59Co NMR; Hypothermic ischemia; Intracellular volumes; Na/H antiport; Rat hearts","amiloride; cobalt derivative; mannitol; sodium; animal tissue; article; cell pH; cell swelling; cell volume; cold; controlled study; heart contraction; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle reperfusion; high energy phosphate; homeostasis; male; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; proton sodium exchange; rat; sodium cell level; sodium transport; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029944768

We investigated two kinds of samples: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) normal pool (from patients without meningitis) and CSF pathological pool (from patients with pyogenic meningitis). Results of the stress protocol indicated that storing both normal and pathological CSF samples at -70 °C would maintain sample stability-i.e., retain at least 90% of the original TNF-α content- for 5 years. At -20 °C and 4 °C, the projected stability time at which the same recovery would he obtained was 190 and 90 days, respectively.","accelerated stability testing; cytokines; inflammation; meningitis, pyogenic; sample handling","tumor necrosis factor alpha; article; bacterial meningitis; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical protocol; controlled study; heat stress; human; inflammation; protein degradation; protein denaturation; protein stability; storage; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029937886

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the PLS on ankle function by using computerized gait-analysis techniques. Multiple barefoot versus brace walks were compared in 31 children with cerebral palsy. Results indicate that the PLS reduces excessive equinus in swing and is sufficiently flexible to allow ankle dorsiflexion in midstance. In terminal stance, the peak power-generating capabilities of the ankle were reduced when the child was wearing the PLS. Energy results indicate that more mechanical energy was absorbed during midstance and less produced during terminal stance with the PLS. Therefore, the PLS improved ankle function but did not augment ankle function through storage and return of mechanical, or spring, energy.","Cerebral palsy; Gait-Joint kinematics; Joint kinetics; Posterior leaf spring orthosis","ankle; article; cerebral palsy; child; cineradiography; clinical article; diagnostic value; gait disorder; human; joint function; orthosis; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029913702

The purpose of this study was to estimate the relative contribution of the time available for force development and the storage and reutilization of elastic energy to the enhancement of performance in CMJ compared with SJ. Six male volleyball players performed CMJ and SJ. Kinematics, kinetics, and muscle electrical activity (EMG) from six muscles of the lower extremity were monitored. It was found that even when the body position at the start of push-off was the same in SJ as in CMJ, jump height was on average 3.4 cm greater in CMJ. The possibility that nonoptimal coordination in SJ explained the difference in jump height was ruled out; there were no signs of movement disintegration in SJ, and toe-off position was the same in SJ as in CMJ. The greater jump height in CMJ was attributed to the fact that the countermovement allowed the subjects to attain greater joint moments at the start of push-off. As a consequence, joint moments were greater over the first part of the range of joint extension in CMJ, so that more work could be produced than in SJ. To explain this finding, measured and manipulated kinematics and electromyographic activity were used as input for a model of the musculoskeletal system. According to simulation results, storage and reutilization of elastic energy could be ruled out as explanation for the enhancement of performance in CMJ over that in SJ. The crucial contribution of the countermovement seemed to be that it allowed the muscles to build up a high level of active state (fraction of attached cross-bridges) and force before the start of shortening, so that they were able to produce more work over the first part of their shortening distance.","ELASTIC ENERGY; FORCE DEVELOPMENT; MUSCLE MODELING; PRE-STRETCH","adult; article; athlete; body movement; body position; electromyography; height; human; human experiment; jumping; kinetics; male; model; motor coordination; motor performance; muscle force; muscle stretching; normal human",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029912768

The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the significance of free axoplasmic amine concentration and disturbed neuronal sodium homeostasis for nonexocytotic noradrenaline release in the human heart by comparing the release induced by anoxia with that induced by reserpine, tyramine, or veratridine. The overflow of endogenous noradrenaline and dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol was assessed in human atrial tissue incubated in calcium-free Krebs-Henseleit-solution to prevent interferences by exocytotic release. The overflow of dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol served as indicator of the free axoplasmic noradrenaline concentration. When vesicular uptake was blocked by the reserpine-like agent Ro 4-1284, high dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol overflow was observed without concomitant noradrenaline overflow. If, however, Ro 4-1284 was combined with sodium pump inhibition (by omission of extracellular potassium) or with alteration of the transmembrane sodium gradient (by lowering the extracellular sodium concentration), both dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and noradrenaline were released. The indirectly acting sympathomimetic tyramine induced a marked increase in noradrenaline overflow which was accompanied by overflow of high amounts of dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, indicating interference of the drug with both vesicular catecholamine transport and amine transport via uptake. Likewise, veratridine induced an overflow of noradrenaline (which was prevented by blockade of uptake1) and dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol indicating a reserpine-like action of the drug. A disturbed energy status of the sympathetic neuron induced by cyanide intoxication or anoxia caused noradrenaline overflow which was suppressed by uptake, blockade. Blockade of sodium channels by tetrodotoxin effectively reduced noradrenaline overflow during cyanide intoxication but not during anoxia. Anoxia-induced noradrenaline release, however, was markedly suppressed by inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange with ethylisopropylamiloride, indicating the Na+/H+ exchange as the predominant pathway for sodium entry into the sympathetic neuron during anoxia. The results demonstrate that disturbed neuronal sodium homoeostasis and impaired vesicular storage function are critical conditions, causing nonexocytotic noradrenaline release in anoxic human cardiac tissue.","Calcium-independent noradrenaline release; Human atrium; Myocardial ischemia; Tyramine; Uptake1-carrier; Veratridine","2 ethyl 1,2,3,4,6,7 hexahydro 2 hydroxy 3 isobutyl 9,10 dimethoxy 11bh benzo[a]quinolizine; 3,4 dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol; 5 (n ethyl n isopropyl)amiloride; cocaine; desipramine; noradrenalin; reserpine; sodium channel; sodium cyanide; tetrodotoxin; tyramine; veratridine; amine transport; anoxia; article; axoplasm; controlled study; energy metabolism; exocytosis; heart atrium; heart muscle ischemia; human; human tissue; ion exchange; noradrenalin release; sodium balance; sodium transport; sympathetic nerve cell",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029900322

In eliminating the background this method relies on lead shields and a 'control location'. By using two different types of passive dosemeter, a photoluminescence dosemeter (PLD SC-1) and a thermoluminescence dosemeter (TLD CaSO4:Tm), three runs of monthly measurements have been carried out to evaluate their applicability in isolating the elevated dose at locations close to the radioactive waste storage in the Oarai site and the Tokai site of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI). The results obtained were intercompared with the reference values measured with a 3' diam. spherical NaI(T1) detector applying a function G(E).

However, since the production of bicarbonate-containing solutions is associated with technical problems, lactate was favored. To avoid the well-known disadvantages of lactate solution concerning biocompatibility and possible metabolic side effects, different attempts have been made to use bicarbonate as a buffer in peritoneal dialysis. One of the major approaches was the total replacement of lactate by bicarbonate combined with storage of the fluid in a specially designed double-chamber bag. Further solutions of the above-mentioned problem were the on-line preparation of bicarbonate fluids for intermittent peritoneal dialysis, the addition of bicarbonate just before use, the combination of bicarbonate with organic acids, or its combination with the dipeptide glycylglycine as a stabilizing agent. By now, the beneficial effect of the neutral bicarbonate fluid, for example, on cell viability and cell functions, has been demonstrated in many different in vitro and animal studies. However, only few reports on clinical experience have been published. These investigations demonstrated independently that bicarbonate fluids diminish inflow pain, are well tolerated by the patients, and may correct metabolic acidosis of uremic patients. A controlled randomized multicenter trial using 34 mmol/L bicarbonate for at least three months confirmed that bicarbonate is as efficacious as lactate in equimolar concentrations. Concomitant investigations on energy metabolism and redox state of red blood cells and phospholipid secretion of mesothelial cells additionally demonstrated the improvement of cell function with bicarbonate solutions. For some patients with severe metabolic acidosis the bicarbonate concentration used in the multicenter trial seemed to be too low. Thus, a fluid containing a higher bicarbonate concentration was tested in a pilot study resulting in the expected significant increase of arterial bicarbonate levels. In summary, bicarbonate-containing peritoneal dialysis solutions are a promising alternative to lactate, especially if bicarbonate concentrations are adjusted individually to the patient's need.","Acid base status; Bicarbonate; Biocompatibility; Buffer; Metabolic acidosis; Randomized controlled trial","bicarbonate; buffer; carboxylic acid; glycylglycine; lactic acid; peritoneal dialysis fluid; bicarbonate blood level; biocompatibility; cell function; cell viability; conference paper; energy metabolism; erythrocyte; human; kidney failure; mesothelium cell; metabolic acidosis; oxidation reduction state; peritoneal dialysis; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029895021

In order to reduce the crosstalk of201Tl to the123I energy window to less than 5%, a dose of123I-MIBG more than five times greater than that of201Tl was administered following201Tl scintigraphy. Regional uptake of201Tl (% dose) was significantly increased in the heart (left ventricle) and lung (both P &lt; 0.01) in the patients with CHF. The increased global cardiac uptake could have been related to the enlarged left ventricle. The patterns of regional uptake of123I-MIBG (% dose) at 15 min were similar to those of201Tl, suggesting that early123I-MIBG uptake could in part depend on regional perfusion in both groups. At 3 h, regional uptake of123I-MIBG was significantly increased in the heart, lung and kidney (all P &lt; 0.01) in the patients with CHF. The delayed123I-MIBG uptake indicates the degree of neuronal accumulation of the tracer, and therefore reflects adrenergic activity. Interestingly, the cardiac123I-MIBG (adrenergic activity) to201Tl (unit of perfusion) ratio decreased significantly in the heart (P &lt; 0.01) but increased significantly in the kidney (P &lt; 0.01) in the patients with CHF compared with the control group. Cardiac123I-MIBG washout was also significantly increased in the CHF patients. Moreover, the cardiac123I-MIBG;201Tl ratio was negatively correlated with plasma norepinephrine concentration (r = −0.74, P &lt; 0.01), but positively correlated with LVEF (r = 0.60, P &lt; 0.01). These data suggest that there may be impairment of both the neuronal uptake function and the vesicular storage function in the failing heart, and an increment in neuronal uptake function in the kidneys in patients with CHF. We suggest that dual-tracer scintigraphy is a useful non-invasive method for the simultaneous assessment of adrenergic activity and perfusion in various organs in patients with heart failure. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.",,"(3 iodobenzyl)guanidine i 123; adrenergic activity; adult; aged; article; clinical article; congestive heart failure; controlled study; female; heart muscle blood flow; heart scintiscanning; human; intravenous drug administration; male; 3-Iodobenzylguanidine; Adult; Female; Heart; Heart Failure, Congestive; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Iodobenzenes; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Norepinephrine; Regression Analysis; Thallium Radioisotopes; Tissue Distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029878042

The mechanisms underlying plyometric activity are identified as the storage and re-utilization of elastic energy during the stretch-shorten cycle and the stretch reflex. They cannot easily be separated, and in practice plyometric training attempts to develop the effectiveness of both mechanisms. The benefits of plyometric training are increased muscle force, rate of force development and, as a result, enhanced performance. There is clear evidence in the literature that plyometric training leads to adaptation at the level of the muscle fibre as well as improvements in neuro-muscular functioning and gross body performance. It is commonly accepted that plyometric training is more dangerous than conventional strength training but the literature is sparse with regard to the injury profiles resulting specifically from plyometric training. The major negative effect of plyometric training is the delayed onset of muscle soreness, but this lasts no longer than 5 days and does not appear to have any lasting injurious affects. Current practice is based on the use of a wide variety of plyometric exercises, but mainly focused on lower body activities. They are often used as a part of a mixed training programme and the literature suggests that such a programme yields the best results. Plyometric training does lead to enhanced performance but its superiority over conventional weight training and other forms of explosive power training has not been clearly established.",,"adaptation; human; literature; muscle cell; muscle force; muscle strength; myotatic reflex; physical performance; priority journal; review; training",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029874978

A comparison was made between gas exchange rates of apples directly after harvest and after a period of storage. Apples of three harvest dates were used. Optimal O2 concentrations were based on gas exchange data and gas exchange models fitted on the data, using the Anaerobic Compensation Point (ACP) and the Respiratory Quotient Breakpoint (RQB). A third way was comparing total ATP production with estimated maintenance energy requirements, revealing the Maintenance Oxygen Concentration (MOC). ATP production was calculated using gas exchange models. MOC was defined as the oxygen concentration with the minimal ATP production rate necessary for maintaining cell viability. The optimal O2 concentrations as established by ACP, RQB and MOC differed considerably. Because ACP values differed from normally advised values, the ACP was unsuitable for a quick determination of the optimal O2 concentration of the apples used. The RQB, however, might be suitable, but than the limit used to establish the RQB should be more than 0.5 units higher than the RQ measured in normal air. The ACP and the RQB were decreased to lower O2 concentrations after storage, suggesting that optimal concentrations decreased during storage. In contrast the MOC was increased after storage, in agreement with results found in practice. Model calculations indicated the lowest optimal O2 concentration for the second (optimal) harvest using the ACP, the RQB and the MOC.

GSD 1a patients can have severe idiopathic osteopenia, often beginning at a young age. Since calcium tracer studies offer a sensitive probe of the bone microenvironment and of calcium deposition, kinetics might be disturbed in patients with GSD 1a. Plasma dilution kinetics obtained using the stable isotope 42Ca are shown in this paper to be quite different between GSD 1a patients and age-matched controls. Comparison of kinetic parameters in these two populations is made using a new binding site model for describing calcium dynamics at the plasma-bone interface. This model describes reversible binding of calcium ions to postulated short-term and long-term sites by a retention probability density function ψ (t). Using this analysis, adult GSD subjects exhibited a significant decrease (P = 0.023) in the apparent half-life of a calcium ion on the longer-term site compared with controls. The general theory of calcium tracer dilution kinetics is then discussed in terms of a new model of short- term calcium homeostasis recently proposed by Bronner and Stein [5].","Calcium kinetics; Calcium metabolism; Calcium stable isotopes; Glycogen storage disease 1a; Von Gierke's disease","calcium; adolescent; adult; article; binding site; calcification; calcium homeostasis; calcium metabolism; calcium mobilization; clinical article; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; glycogen storage disease type 1; human; male; mathematical model; mineralization; osteopenia; osteoporosis; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029856587

In addition, state 3 and 4 respiratory rates as well as ketone body production with palmitoylcarnitine as substrate were determined in isolated mitochondria. Metabolizable energy intake and energy expenditure increased in rats fed an energy-dense diet, but the gain in body weight and lipid content remained unchanged. No variation occurred in the mitochondrial palmitoylcarnitine utilization rate and ketone body production, but a significant increase in the mitochondrial content of ketone bodies and the serum levels was found in rats fed an energy-dense diet. Furthermore, we have shown a significant increase in fatty acid-stimulated respiration in hepatocytes from rats fed an energy-dense diet. The enhanced hepatic fatty acid utilization as an energy substrate found in rats fed an energy-dense diet may contribute to reduce the availability of lipids for storage, thus counteracting the development of obesity.","Energy balance; Energy-dense diet; Fatty acid; Hepatic oxygen consumption; Mitochondria","fatty acid; ketone body; palmitoylcarnitine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; caloric intake; controlled study; diet; energy balance; energy expenditure; fatty acid metabolism; liver metabolism; male; metabolic rate; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029850535

Although the molecular and enzymatic regulation of the components for DNL are well characterized, the quantitative importance of the assembled pathway and its physiologic functions have remained uncertain. We review methods that have been used for measuring DNL in vivo, their limitations and the conclusions based on them. Two new methods for direct measurement of DNL in humans are discussed-mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA), a mass spectrometric technique based on combinatorial probabilities, and 2H2O incorporation. Recent findings with these methods in a variety of dietary and hormonal settings are reviewed. In particular, we focus on the question of whether or not surplus carbohydrate energy is converted to fat by the liver in humans. A somewhat surprising model of the response to carbohydrate overfeeding emerges from these studies, with a number of implications for metabolic regulation in health and disease. We close by speculating on potential functions of DNL in physiology and pathophysiology if storage of surplus carbohydrate energy is not an important function of DNL. The availability of techniques for quantifying DNL in vivo should make it possible to resolve these uncertainties regarding its functions and regulation in humans.","biosynthesis; dietary carbohydrate; energy balance; hepatic metabolism","acetyl coenzyme A; fatty acid; sex hormone; adipose tissue; alcohol consumption; body weight; caloric intake; calorimetry; carbohydrate intake; fat intake; human; infection; insulin resistance; lipid composition; lipid diet; lipogenesis; liver metabolism; low fat diet; mass spectrometry; menstrual cycle; obesity; overnutrition; priority journal; review; smoking cessation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029846701

The present paper reports on relative efficiencies of charge trapping vs luminescence production in the most widely used TL dosemeter materials, based on parallel measurements of radioluminescence and thermoluminescence with the same light detection system. In this way it was possible to measure relative yields without geometrical, optical transmittance and detection efficiency corrections.

Lipids, glucose, lactate and glycerol are possible metabolic substrates for sperm in the epididymis, but the role of these is uncertain and it may differ between marsupials and eutherians. Sperm are normally immotile in the epididymis, but ram and rabbit sperm may have an uncoordinated motility. Sperm metabolism is suppressed but is probably not strongly coupled to motility. Work on diluted sperm indicates that cyclic adenosine monophosphate, Ca2+, and pH play roles as intracellular messengers controlling the motility and metabolism of sperm, but no first messenger has been identified. A number of mechanisms of suppressing sperm motility and metabolism in the epididymis are considered, including a collective autoregulation, oxygen tension, osmotic pressure, viscosity and the extracellular concentration of H+, Ca2+ Na+, HCO3- and carnitine. However, there is no conclusive evidence for any of the mechanisms and there is clearly some variation between species in the mechanism of suppressing sperm activity. Sperm activation stimulates motility and a 4-5-fold increase in respiration rate that has not been reversed without compromising viability. Following activation, respiration supported by endogenous and/or exogenous substrates is much higher in marsupial than eutherian sperm, and marsupial sperm do not show a large stimulation of respiration on the addition of exogenous substrate, as is characteristic of most eutherian sperm.",,"bicarbonate; calcium ion; carnitine; cyclic AMP; glucose; glycerol; lactic acid; lipid; proton; sodium ion; animal cell; autoregulation; cell respiration; conference paper; epididymis; extracellular fluid; male; mammal; marsupial; metabolism; nonhuman; osmotic pressure; oxygen tension; pH; rabbit; sheep; signal transduction; species difference; sperm preservation; spermatozoon motility; viscosity; Animalia; Eutheria; Mammalia; Metatheria; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Ovis aries; Theria",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029842595

Samples were also fed to broiler chicks at 600 g/kg diet in a growth trial. There were no significant differences in crude protein contents of the maize samples, but there was evidence for the development of Maillard reaction products.

The new active detector utilizes electro-optical modulation of the response of the storage phosphor screens to allow duel exposure acquisition with no motion of the screens. Electro-optical modulation can be done rapidly so the detector can acquire the voltage switched images in a short enough time to minimize patient motion artifacts. Voltage switching produces effective detected energy spectra that result in much lower noise for a given patient dose than the effective spectra of double screen detectors. In this paper the new concept is described, optimal voltages and filter materials are determined by computer simulations, and the active detector performance is compared to other energy selective detectors. The new detector provides over 30 times better signal to noise ratio squared (SNR2) for the same dose and over five times better SNR2 for the same x-ray tube loading than a double screen detector. The effects of incomplete erasure of the x-ray exposures are determined quantitatively. With achievable erasing fractions, the SNR2 is over 20 times better for the same dose and over three times better for constant tube loading than a double screen detector. The active detector is also compared to mechanical screen switching. Mechanical switching provides somewhat better SNR2 for the same dose, approximately 1.1 times the active detector SNR2 at optimal x-ray tube voltages. The performance is compared with highly absorbing back screens. If these are used in both the active and passive detectors, both detectors' quality factors increase, but the advantage of the active detector over the passive detector decreases with large back screen thicknesses.","computed radiography; dual-energy; storage phosphor; x-ray","Light emission; Light modulation; Optical signal processing; Phosphors; Signal to noise ratio; Switching; X ray radiography; X ray tubes; X rays; Computed radiography; Dual energy; Electro-optical modulation; Mechanical switching; Selective detectors; Storage phosphors; Voltage switching; X-ray tube voltages; X ray detectors; article; computer analysis; image quality; priority journal; radiography; signal noise ratio; X ray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029838811

Hearts were microperfused at 4°C for 24 or 48 h with a storage buffer that in some cases contained one of these protein kinase C inhibitors either alone or in combination with 2,3-butanedione monoxime. After hypothermic storage, hearts were rewarmed to 37°C with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Cardiac function was then assessed in either Langendorff mode or working heart mode. 3. Compared with values from fresh non-stored hearts, hypothermic stored hearts showed a significant decrease in both coronary flow and left ventricular developed pressure when the stored hearts were reperfused in Langendorff mode. The decrease in coronary flow and left ventricular developed pressure was more pronounced in hearts stored for 48 h than in those stored for 24 h. 4. Hearts stored for 24 or 48 h, with or without the protein kinase C inhibitors, and then perfused in working mode generated less aortic flow and less cardiac output than fresh unstored hearts. 5.

Design: 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into four groups, were investigated. Rats fed orally were used as a reference group and compared to three groups of rats receiving PN either without fat or with 33% of non-protein energy as fat or with 66% of non-protein energy as fat. The PN regimens were equicaloric and administered continuously via a jugular catheter for 7 days. Interventions: After suffocation, blood was collected for determination of serum lipids. Epididymal fat and heart were collected for analysis of lipoprotein lipase activities, and pieces of liver were saved for analyses of liver triglyceride concentration and hepatic lipase activity. Light and electron microscopy were used for examination of lipid deposition in Kupffer cells. Results: Directly after termination of parenteral feeding, the serum levels of triglycerides were similar in all PN groups, while the levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL phospholipids were significantly increased in parallel with increased doses of fat. Lipid-free PN resulted in significantly less liver steatosis than high-fat PN. Lipid PN also resulted in downregulated hepatic lipase activity, signs of lipid accumulation in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes and an increased number of phagosomes in Kupffer cells. Conclusion: Fat vacuoles were found in Kupffer cells after lipid PN, although serum levels of triglycerides were not elevated and lipoprotein lipase activities were not depressed. The cells were distended by fat vacuoles after administration of PN solutions with a high fat concentration. Morphological signs of increased Kupffer cell activity were also found, suggesting that intravenous fat emulsions may activate macrophages.","Fatty liver; Histology; Intravenous fat emulsion; Kupffer cells; Lipid metabolism; Lipoprotein lipase","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell ultrastructure; cell vacuole; controlled study; electron microscopy; enzyme activity; epididymis fat; fat intake; fatty liver; heart; intravenous catheter; Kupffer cell; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver; liver cell; macrophage; male; microscopy; nonhuman; parenteral nutrition; phagosome; rat; triacylglycerol blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029828161

This study used continuous whole-body calorimetry to measure changes in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation during a 12-d imposed energy imbalance in six lean men on mixed diets (overfeeding: 16.5 MJ/d, +33%, n = 3; underfeeding: 3.5 MJ/d, -67%, n = 3). Changes in total energy expenditure (TEE) and its components were modest: TEE changed by +6.2% (overfeeding) and -10.5% (underfeeding). In consequence, body weight changed by +2.90 and -3.18 kg. Marked changes in metabolic fuel selection occurred over the course of the study. Carbohydrate intake (540 and 83 g/d for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively) exerted direct autoregulatory feedback on carbohydrate oxidation (551 and 106 g/d at day 12 for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively). Subjects were close to balance by day 5. Changes in protein oxidation were small and not sufficient to prevent the oxidation of body protein mass, or its accretion, in response to energy deficit or surplus. Fat oxidation (59 and 177 g/d for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively) was not sensitive to dietary fat intake (150 and 20 g/d, for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively), rather, its oxidation was inversely related to the oxidation of other substrates. Changes in fat balance accounted for 74.1% and 84.0% of the energy imbalance during overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively. This study shows a clear oxidative hierarchy for the macronutrients.

Ewes were grown on either a low- (LE) or high-energy (HE) diet for 120 days (six per diet). In fresh tissue of HE ewes, LPL activity was higher (P &lt; 0.05) for adipose tissue, and lower (P &lt; 0.05) for skeletal and cardiac muscles than fresh tissues of LE ewes. Frozen storage altered these dietary effects and decreased (P &lt; 0.01) LPL activity in adipose and cardiac tissues; treatment differences were maintained in skeletal muscle, and LPL activity was similar for fresh and frozen skeletal muscle of LE ewes. In subsequent experiments, ovine adipose and cardiac tissues were subjected to frozen storage, and LPL activity assayed with either a protease inhibitor (aprotinin, 2 μg/mL), or with 1 mM/L EGTA and without Ca2+ in the medium. Either treatment inhibited loss of LPL activity in frozen tissues. Frozen storage of hearts from five male, Sprague-Dawley rats decreased (P &lt; 0.01) LPL activity; no decrease in activity was observed when protease inhibitor was used. However, it is not certain whether inclusion of protease inhibitor and (or) elimination of Ca2+ in frozen-thawed tissue prevents loss of effects on LPL activity that would be observed in fresh tissue in response to dietary changes or other physiological perturbations. In conclusion, frozen storage causes loss of LPL activity in ovine and rat tissues. Thus, frozen storage of tissue may be inappropriate when subsequent analysis of LPL activity is of interest.","adipose tissue; frozen; heart; lipoprotein lipase; ovine; rat","lipoprotein lipase; adipose tissue; animal tissue; article; controlled study; heart; nonhuman; rat; storage; Animalia; Ovis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029808690

The adenine nucleotide metabolism, the tissue blood flow, and the pathological profiles of the grafts were all compared among the groups. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels at the end of cold storage and at 30 minutes after reperfusion, as well as the total adenine nucleotide (TAN) levels at the and of cold storage, before reperfusion, and at 30 minutes after reperfusion were significantly lower in the 48-hour group than those in the other groups, and the blood flow level at reperfusion was significantly lower in the 48-hour group than that in the others.

Their 'metabolism' is connected with the world economy and is run mainly by fossil energy carriers. Up to now there are no validated models for the evaluation of a sustainable development of urban regions. The guidelines for a 'sustainable development' suggest the reduction of resource consumption. The article is concerned with the problem of how the 'sustainable-development concept' can be transformed from a global to a regional scale. In urban settlements the strategy of final storage should be applied. By this, the subsystem waste management can be transformed within 10 to 15 years to a 'sustainable status'. With regard to the system 'agronomy', the article concludes that agriculture in urban systems should focus on food production instead of promoting reduction of food production in favour of energy plants, which is not a suitable strategy. The main problems are the energy carriers. Transformation to a 'sustainable status' is only possible by a reconstruction of the urban system, i.e. of buildings and the transportation network. The rate determining step in achieving such a status is the change in the fabric of buildings and in the type of transportation networks. The reconstruction of an urban system needs, mainly for economical reasons, a time period of two generations.","agronomy; anthroposphere; carbon fluxes; energy; forestry; material flows; metabolism; regional material management; Sustainable development; urban systems; waste management",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029800737

A hierarchy of potential climate change shifts in weather, forest canopy physiological processes, and forest cover were used to operate RHESSys for comparison with control simulations for present-day conditions. Use of projected temperature and precipitation changes alone led to qualitatively different forecasts of watershed climate change impact when compared to simulations that also incorporated adjustment of canopy physiology to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2. In addition, ecosystem processes may be more resilient to climate change due to the existence of a series of offsetting effects. Annual net effects on specific processes such as watershed outflow and forest productivity may qualitatively vary from year to year rather than showing consistent increases or decreases relative to current conditions.

We propose that the brain is the primary center of this regulation. The brain has evolved mechanisms for sensing the energy status of the body using neural and metabolic signals such as glucose, insulin, and leptin. It has central processing and storage capacity for handling this afferent information and can change both structurally and functionally in response to its internal and external milieu. The brain regulates energy balance through its control of energy intake on the one hand and expenditure and storage on the other using neurohumoral mechanisms that include the autonomie nervous system. Work in animal models suggests that the brain of obese individuals largely ignores signals of excess adiposity from the periphery, keeping the body weight set point at pathologically high levels. Disordered regulation of neuropeptide Y and monoamine metabolism within the ventromedial hypothalamus is a consistent finding in the brains of obesity-prone and obese rodents. Such dysregulation causes inappropriate neurohumoral control of metabolism and autonomie output to organs such as the pancreas, resulting in increased metabolic efficiency and persistent adiposity. The high recidivism rate in the treatment of obesity suggests that central dysfunction may be due to long-term reorganization of the nervous system in such a way as to perpetuate the abnormally high set point of body weight.","Autonomie nervous system; Parasympathetic nervous system; Sympathetic nervous system","glucose; insulin; leptin; monoamine; neuropeptide y; animal cell; autonomic nervous system; body weight; caloric intake; energy balance; energy expenditure; human; human cell; hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; recurrence risk; review; Animals; Brain; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Neural Pathways; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029797442

In spite of numerous efforts, finding a simple technique for predicting recovery of the liver after ischemic damage is still an unresolved problem. During ischemic storage of isolated rat livers at 25°C tissue concentrations of high energy phosphates and lactate were determined photometrically and interstitial pH was measured by glass electrodes. In comparison, the metabolic rate was measured continuously by direct calorimetry. In a second series of experiments these results were compared with functional recovery after ischemia and reperfusion. Following ischemic storage at 25°C for 60, 120 or 240 min, the isolated livers were reperfused for 30 min in a nonrecirculating system with a constant flow rate. During reperfusion functional recovery, as assessed by oxygen consumption and bile flow, was determined. At the end of reperfusion tissue samples were taken for biochemical analysis of adenine nucleotides. Furthermore, morphologic integrity was determined by electron microscopy. Results: Whereas the ATP concentration drops within 60 min of ischemia to 6.9% of the control value without further significant change, the continuously measured metabolic rate as assessed by direct calorimetry decreases in an exponential manner. Accordingly, a better correlation of hepatocellular secretory function and calorimetrically measured heat output (r2 = 0.85; P &lt; 0.001) was observed than with high energy phosphates (r2 = 0.56; P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: These data suggest that if the metabolism of the ischemic rat liver falls below a critical level, recovery is incomplete or impossible. Therefore, assessment of the global metabolic rate by direct calorimetry seems not only to be a very good predictor of recovery after ischemic damage but also a good tool in the laboratory for studies concerning the sequelae of ischemic metabolism and for improvement of tissue protection.","ATP; calorimetry; hypothermia; ischemia; isolated rat liver","phosphate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; calorimetry; controlled study; electron microscopy; liver function; liver ischemia; liver metabolism; male; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; rat; tissue preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029795776

Although numerous studies have shown that genetic factors have a major influence on the regulation of energy homeostasis and the susceptibility to obesity, the genes and predisposing mutations involved are insufficiently understood. Among several known rodent models of obesity due to single gene mutations, mice homozygous for the obese (ob) gene exhibit massive early-onset obesity, hyperphagia, non-insulindependent diabetes mellitus, defective thermoregulation and infertility. Recently the ob gene was identified by positional cloning and shown to be mutated in ob/ob mice. Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a 167-amino acid secreted protein that is synthesized exclusively in adipose tissue. With the exception of oblob mice, circulating plasma leptin is elevated in obesity. Administration of recombinant leptin to ob/ob mice reduces fat mass, food intake, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The various effects of the hormone are mediated by leptin receptors expressed at high levels in the hypothalamus, but also in several other non-neuronal tissues. A mutation in the leptin receptor gene is responsible for the obese phenotype of db/db mice. Plasma leptin in humans is positively correlated with body fat mass, suggesting that leptin resistance rather than leptin deficiency is a common feature of human obesity. This review briefly summarizes the current status of the rapidly growing evidence that leptin plays an important role in the regulation of body weight and fat deposition.","db/db mouse; Leptin; Neuropeptide Y; ob/ob mouse","gene product; hormone; hormone receptor; leptin; neuropeptide Y; animal model; body fat; energy balance; food intake; gene mutation; hormone blood level; hormone resistance; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hypothalamus; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029790521

Rats were fed on an F or C diet for 28 days. For an additional 3 days, half of the rats in both F and C groups were fed the same diets as before (F-F and C-C) and the other half of the rats were switched to the counterpart diets (F-C and C-F). On the final day of the experiment, half of the rats in each diet group were exercised by swimming for 1.5 h and the other half were rested. Short-term diet change from F to C diets increased, but the change from C to F diets decreased, glycogen stores of soleus and plantaris muscles and liver, resulting in no difference in glycogen stores between F-C and C-C, and between F-F and C-F. The dietary change also had an affect on TG stores of red gastrocnemius muscle and liver - however, muscle TG stores were still higher in F-C than in C-C and C-F, and there were no differences in liver TG stores between F-C and C-F. Exercise decreased muscle glycogen contents markedly in F-C and C-C, whereas, it decreased muscle TG concentrations in F-F and C-F. Liver glycogen depletion was lower in F-C than in other groups. Lipolytic activities of epididymal adipose tissue at rest and postexercise were no differences between F-F and F-C, and were higher in F-C than in C-C and C-F. P-adrenergic receptor binding was determined with [125I] iodocyanopindolol, and maximal numbers of β-adrenergic receptor of plasma membrane from perirenal adipose tissue were approximately 170%-200% higher in F-C than in other groups at rest and postexercise. These results suggested that short-term C diet fed rats adapted to F diet enhanced not only glycogen stores of muscle and liver but also did not decrease lipolytic activity of adipose tissue with increased a-adrenergic receptor density, resulting in the preservation of energy reserves (glycogen and TG) of muscle at rest, and liver glycogen sparing during exercise.","Glycogen triacylglycerol; Lipolysis; Rat; Short-term dietary change","beta adrenergic receptor; corticosterone; cyanopindolol i 125; fatty acid; glucose; glycerol; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; insulin; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body mass; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; exercise; fatty acid blood level; gastrocnemius muscle; glucose blood level; glycerol blood level; glycogen analysis; glycogen liver level; glycogen metabolism; glycogen muscle level; insulin blood level; lipid diet; lipolysis; liver; male; nonhuman; plantaris muscle; priority journal; rat; receptor binding; receptor density; receptor upregulation; soleus muscle; triacylglycerol blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029783505

A cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) crystal permits the identification of the radioactive isotopes of cesium (134 and 137). The cesium isotope concentrations, with proper calibration, can be used to determine the assembly burnup independent of reactor records, and to provide a measure of minimum cooling time. Tungsten gamma-ray collimators are used to define the spatial resolution of the gamma-ray detectors along the axis of the assembly. The capability to rapidly perform a burnup distribution scan using the collimated ion chamber may be important to the verification of burnup for boiling water reactors (BWR).",,"Boiling water reactors; Calibration; Cesium; Design; Gamma ray spectrometers; Gamma rays; Neutrons; Nuclear instrumentation; Pressurized water reactors; Radioactive waste storage; Radioisotopes; Spent fuels; Assembly burnup measurement; Burnup distribution; Cadmium zinc telluride crystal; Fork system; Gamma ray collimation; Spent fuel assembly; Radiation detectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029780213

Scientifically-based criteria for environmental limits to drying and storing the fuels for this system are being developed to avoid excessive degradation in sealed and non-sealed (open to air) dry storage systems. These limits are based on consideration of degradation modes that can cause loss of net section of the cladding, embrittlement of the cladding, distortion of the fuel, or release of fuel and fission products from the fuel/clad system. Potential degradation mechanisms include corrosion mechanisms from exposure to air and/or sources of humidity, hydrogen blistering of the aluminum cladding, distortion of the fuel due to creep, and interdiffusion of the fuel and fission products with the cladding. The aluminum-clad research reactor fuels are predominantly highly-enriched aluminum-uranium alloy fuel which is clad with aluminum alloys similar to 1100, 5052, and 6061 aluminum. In the absence of corrodant species, degradation due to creep and diffusion mechanisms limit the maximum fuel storage temperature to 200°C. The results of laboratory-scale corrosion tests indicate that this fuel could be stored under air up to 200°C at low relative humidity levels (< 20%) to limit corrosion of the cladding and fuel (exposed to the storage environment through assumed pre-existing pits in the cladding). Excessive degradation of fuels with uranium metal up to 200°C can be avoided if the fuel is sufficiently dried and contained in a sealed system; open storage can be achieved if the temperature is controlled to avoid excessive corrosion even in dry air.",,"Aluminum alloys; Corrosion; Creep; Degradation; Diffusion; Drying; Environmental impact; Fission products; Spent fuels; Temperature; Uranium; Aluminum clad fuels; Environmental limits; Fuel distortion; Hydrogen blistering; Interim dry storage systems; Storage criteria; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029779993

Hence, we propose a fourth neural architecture capable of displaying all the three precedent behaviors. The core of our architecture is a principle of mutual redefinition between the activation dynamics and the weight dynamics of the net for each pattern to be recognized, so as to overcome some computability problems typical of pattern recognition. The main characteristic of such an architecture are: (1) its capability to automatically redefine the optimal correlation neighborhood of each neuron of the network in view of the correct recognition of a given input; (2) the constructive use of noise, which, added automatically to the net dynamics and to the input itself, allows the correct recognition of highly noisy patterns. To illustrate this point, we develop a systematic comparison between the performances of this new architecture and of a backpropagation architecture in solving the classical ""T-C"" recognition problem. Then, we show a successful application of our new architecture to real time particle discrimination in a high energy physics experiment (""FENICE"" experiment) carried out at the ADONE e+e- storage ring in Frascati (Italy). © 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,"Backpropagation; High energy physics; Pattern recognition; Performance; Statistical mechanics; Storage rings; Real time particle discrimination; Relaxation neural networks; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029778610

We studied the response of lactating red squirrels to reproductive demands that were experimentally increased by litter-size manipulations. 2. Females with experimentally increased reproductive demands ('augment' females) gained significantly more body mass during the first half of lactation than did unmanipulated ('control') females. However, augment females lost more mass following the mid-point of lactation than control females, so that the net mass difference between early lactation and late summer was negligible for both treatments. 3. Measurements of total body water at the mid-point of lactation confirmed that mass gains during early lactation reflected changes in body fat levels, indicating that females adjusted their energy stores according to their reproductive demands. 4. We also analysed the relationship between early lactation mass gain and natural litter size among a larger group of control females, studied at the same site between 1990 and 1994. There was a significant, positive relationship between natural litter size and female mass gain. Furthermore, females characterized by the largest gains in body mass had the highest levels of juvenile survival to emergence, indicating that early lactation mass gain is an important component of parental investment. 5. These responses suggest that (i) energy storage during early lactation is used to reduce daily energy requirements during late lactation; (ii) breeders use demands during early lactation to 'forecast' requirements during late lactation; and (iii) that despite the elevated energetic demands of lactation, individuals can quickly adjust their energy budgets from slightly positive to highly positive levels.","Energy stores; Lactation; Litter-size manipulation; Sciuridae; Tritiated water","body mass; lactation; red squirrel; Tamiasciurus hudsonicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029777710

One part of this effort focused on the dose resulting from the ingestion of contaminated food. The PATHWAY radionuclide transport model was developed to provide estimates of food concentrations for 20 radionuclides for each of 86 test events and 15 agricultural scenarios. These results were then used as input to the Human Ingestion model to provide dose estimates for individuals and populations in 9 western states. The model considered the life-style and age of the people, and accounted for the transport of milk between locations. Estimates of uncertainty were provided for all doses using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Propagation of uncertainty between the PATHWAY model and the Human Ingestion model required the development of special strategies to ensure that the inherent correlations between concentrations of the radionuclides in foods were handled properly. In addition, the size of the input data base (60 megabytes), the number of cases to consider (over 30,000), and the number of Monte Carlo simulations (over 6 million) required the development of efficient and reliable methods of data access and storage while running simulations concurrently on up to 14 UNIX workstations. The problems encountered in this effort are likely to be typical of any dose reconstruction involving geographically heterogeneous environmental conditions. This paper documents the methods used to disaggregate the system to achieve computation efficiency, the methods used to propagate uncertainty through the model system, and the techniques used to manage data in a distributed computing environment.

The experiments were conducted in a diamond-anvil cell heated with a CO2 laser with argon as a pressure transmitting medium. With this newly developed experimental set-up, the molar volume of periclase was measured as a function of pressure and temperature, which were both measured on-line. The thermal expansion coefficient (a) determined in these preliminary experiments has apparently too strong a pressure dependence, decreasing for instance from 4.9 10-5 K-1 at room pressure to 7.5 10-6 K-1 at 13.0 GPa. These results would yield a very high Anderson-Grüneisen parameter (δT = 25-30), in disagreement with the expected δT = 6.5-4.3, as calculated for MgO or obtained by Fei et al. (1992a) on magnesiowüstite from room temperature to 900 K.

In this work we study the impact of different passivation layers on the data retention of single polysilicon EEPROM cells, processed with an advanced 0.7 mm process technology. Three passivation layers have been considered: (1) Phosphorus doped Silicon Glass (PSG), (2) Planarized (Oxynitride/SOG/Oxynitride/PSG), and (3) UV-Nitride. Accelerated tests were performed at high temperature (250-350 °c) up to 500 hours in order to monitor the threshold voltage shift of the floating gate transistor programmed either in the written or in the erased state. In the case of planarized passivation and of UV-Nitride passivation the charge loss is small and it largely fulfils the data retention requirements; in the case of PSG passivation a much higher charge loss is observed. The effect of tunnel oxide degradation after extended cycling (1 Mcycles) has been investigated. No significant difference has been found after 200 hours at 250 °C between cycled and one time programmed cells, evidencing that the charge loss mechanism does not involve tunnel oxide degradation. The activation energy of the charge loss mechanism has been evaluated in the case of planarized passivation, using written cells. The measured value is 1.84 eV. The impact of different passivation schemes was studied with conventional techniques; the best results were obtained with the planarized passivation stack and with the UV-nitride layer.",,"Activation energy; Cellular arrays; Data storage equipment; Passivation; PROM; Reliability; Data retention; Nonvolatile memory cells; Planarized passivation; Tunnel oxide degradation; Nonvolatile storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029772749

The motivation of this work is found in solar thermal storage tanks. The finned heat exchanging surface provides a means to charge and discharge the thermal energy in the tank. The governing time-dependent conservation equations are solved by a finite difference method. Solutions are obtained for 106 ≤ Ra ≤ 108, for 0-3 fins, for fins of length L/H = 0.3 and 0.75, and for fins parallel and perpendicular to the gravity vector. Results indicate that the storage process is characterized by three distinct heat transfer regimes and that most of the energy is stored during the last regime, referred to as the decay period. The time-changing Nussett number at the heat exchanging surface is strongly dependent on the Rayleigh number and the number of fins. It is, however, much less sensitive to the size of the fins and their orientation.

Further, we separately determined the individual contributions from the different conductor components to the coupling losses. Also, the influence of the void fraction in the conductor on the coupling losses was investigated. In addition, d.c. transverse resistance measurements were performed on the cable. The measured hysteresis and coupling losses are small for such a large current conductor and were sufficiently low for our purposes.

After birth, energy homeostasis is rapidly regained through milk nutrients which supply the newborn with the fatty acids and ketone bodies required for neonatal development. However, immediately after birth and before the onset of suckling there is a time lapse in which the newborn undergoes a unique kind of starvation. During this period glucose is scarce and ketone bodies are not available owing to the delay in ketogenesis. Under these circumstances, the newborn is supplied with another metabolic fuel, lactate, which is utilized as a source of energy and carbon skeletons. Neonatal rat lung, heart, liver and brain utilize lactate for energy production and lipogenesis. Lactate is also utilized by the brain of human babies with type I glycogenosis. Both rat neurons and astrocytes in primary culture actively use lactate as an oxidizable substrate and as a precursor of phospholipids and sterols. Lactate oxidation is enhanced by dichloroacetate, an inhibitor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase in neurons but not in astrocytes, suggesting that the pyruvate dehydrogenase is regulated differently in each type of cell. Despite the low activity of this enzyme in newborn brain, pyruvate decarboxylation is the main fate of glucose in both neurons and astrocytes.

The aim of this work was to study the kinetics of oxidation of methionine in human Insulin-like Growth Factor I (hIGF-I)1 in aqueous solution and in the solid state by the aid of quantification of oxygen. Methods. The oxidized form of hIGF-I was characterized by tryptic peptide analysis, RP-HPLC and FAB-MS and quantified by RP-HPLC. The oxygen content was quantified polarographically by a Clark-type electrode. Results. Second-order kinetics with respect to amount of protein and dissolved oxygen was found to be appropriate-for the oxidation of methionine in hIGF-I. The rate constants ranged from 1 to 280 M-1 month-1 and had an activation energy of 95 (+/- 4) kJ/mole. Light exposure, storage temperature and oxygen content were found to have a considerable impact on the oxidation rates. No significant difference in reaction rates was found for the oxidation of hIGF-I in aqueous solution or in the solid state. A method for decreasing the oxygen content in aqueous solution without purging is described. Conclusions. Polarographic quantification of dissolved oxygen makes it possible to establish the kinetics for oxidation of proteins. The oxidation of methionine in hIGF-I appears to follow second-order kinetics.","hIGF-I; HPLC; Kinetics; Methionine; Oxidation","somatomedin C; article; drug oxidation; fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry; high performance liquid chromatography; human; kinetics; light exposure; polarography; priority journal; technique; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029759450

With a new neonatal piglet model, we determined changes in myocardial metabolism during global ischemia after chronic hypoxia. Five- day-old piglets (N = 30) were randomly assigned to two groups and exposed to an atmosphere of 8% oxygen or to room air for 28 days before they were killed. Left ventricular myocardium was then analyzed at control and at 15- minute intervals during 60 minutes of global normothermic ischemia to determine high-energy phosphate levels, glycogen stores, and lactate accumulation. Time to peak ischemic myocardial contracture was measured with intramyocardial needle-tipped Millar catheters as a marker of the onset of irreversible ischemic injury. Results showed an initially greater level of myocardial adenosine triphosphate in the hypoxic group (27 ± 1.2 vs 19 ± 1.8 μmol/gm dry wt, p = 0.001) and a delay in adenosine triphosphate depletion during 60 minutes of global ischemia compared with the control group. Initial energy charge ratios ( 1/4 adenosine diphosphate + adenosine triphosphate/adenosine monophosphate + adenosine diphosphate + adenosine triphosphate) were also greater in the hypoxic group (0.96 ± 0.01 vs 0.81 ± 0.04, p = 0.01) and remained so throughout global ischemia. Initial glycogen stores were greater in the hypoxic group (273 ± 13.3 vs 215 ± 14.7 μmol/gm dry weight, p = 0.02) when compared with the control group. Lactate levels in the hypoxic group were initially higher (19.1 ± 6.4 vs 8.9 ± 3.1 μmol/gm dry weight, p = 0.001) compared with control levels and remained elevated throughout 60 minutes of ischemia. Time to peak ischemic contracture was prolonged in the hypoxic group (69.5 ± 1.8 vs 48.9 ± 1.4 minutes, p = 0.001) compared with the controls group. These data show that chronic hypoxia results in significant myocardial metabolic adaptive changes, which in turn result in an improved tolerance to severe normothermic ischemia. These beneficial effects are associated with elevated baseline glycogen storage levels and an accelerated rate of anaerobic glycolysis during ischemia.",,"adaptation; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; glycogen metabolism; glycolysis; heart function; heart left ventricle; heart muscle cell; heart muscle metabolism; high energy phosphate; hypoxia; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; priority journal; swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029758322

It consists of interacting subsystems like the cold-store air, goods, room structures, cold-store walls, evaporator, refrigerator and environment. The mathematical description is based on mass and energy balances, coupled with simple assumptions on heat and mass transfer. Freezing of goods and frosting of the evaporator is accounted for, as well as the possibility of defrosting. A concise description of the overall dynamic behaviour is achieved by using a modular structure together with top-down modelling. An advantage of this model is its limited number of parameters, most of which can be determined from readily available information, e.g. from data sheets. Using these parameters, the transient behaviour of the most important variables in cold-store operation can be predicted. Such predictions are compared to experimental data taken in the present work in a medium-size cold store. The transient behaviour of the temperature and relative humidity in that cold store is reported for a cooling period with two different controllers and for a defrosting period. For all studied operating conditions the results of the simulation show favourable agreement with the experimental data. This shows that the simulation model is suited for studies of improved automation and control concepts for refrigeration systems, aiming, for example, at preventing losses in the quality of the goods or for energy savings.","Automation; Control; Dynamic model; Experimental data; Refrigeration plant; Simulation; Thermodynamics","Automation; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Process control; Thermodynamics; Cold storage plants; Top down modeling; Cold storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029757821

In view of macroeconomic constraints, PEMEX is currently facing difficulties in financing its activities. The government is thus discussing whether to authorize a partial opening in exploration and production activities through a special type of service contract. As for the private sector's participation in transport, storage and distribution, there are still institutional, regulatory, entreprenurial and legal questions pending that may delay or inhibit investments. PEMEX's performance is crucial for private capitals to set up and survive in the spaces that have been opened to them.

Our measurements at standard room temperature conditions after the aging treatments indicated tensile strength increases of up to 5% at 85 degrees Celsius and 15% in filling compound after one- to six-month aging. The dynamic fatigue for the fibers aged in the filling compound also improved (n-values from 17 - 20 to 25 - 30) in parallel with the fiber strength while the fiber static fatigue tests gave large n-value increases from 30 to 140. In order to examine the effects of the aging treatments on the fiber coatings, we used dynamic mechanical analysis to measure the coating mechanical properties, storage modulus E' and loss tangent tan δ. In general, we have found that aging in hot air and in the filling compound results in a significant decrease in E' and increase in tan δ, thereby suggesting an aging-related increase in the capacity of the coating to absorb substantial amounts of mechanical energy. A qualitative theoretical analysis of the coating contribution to the fiber crack growth and mechanical behavior in conjunction with our experimental results suggests that the coatings' ability to absorb more mechanical energy during aging contributes to increased fiber strength and improved fatigue behavior. Thus, our results to date provide the first experimental evidence that a fiber coating can stabilize cracks on fused silica surfaces and contribute in a significant way to fiber mechanical behavior.",,"Dynamic fatigue; Dynamical mechanical analysis; Fiber strength; Hot air aging; Hot filling compounds; Aging of materials; Coatings; Crack propagation; Fatigue of materials; Fused silica; Mathematical models; Mechanical properties; Tensile strength; Optical fibers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029756086

The bentonite studied consisted of randomly interstratified illite/montmorillonite with 15% illite. Minor amounts of other minerals (3% quartz, plagioclase, and cristobalite) were also present. The run conditions of the hydrothermal treatments were combinations of the following variables: KCl concentration 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 mol L-1; temperature 60, 120, 175, and 200°C; time 1, 5, 15, 30, 90, and 180 days. The solid:solution ratio was 1:5. Pressures were those corresponding to water vapor. The solid reaction products were analyzed by means of XRD, DTA/TG, FTIR, and NMR. The final solutions were chemically analyzed for Si and exchange cations (K, Ca, Mg, and Na), and pH. XRD detected some transformation (up to 15%), while DTA/TG, FTIR, NMR, and exchange cation analysis did not show any appreciable transformation. This leads to the conclusion that analysis of the amount of illite in illite/smectite, in hydrothermally treated samples, by means of XRD can be inaccurate. Transformation to illite was observed, however, when aqueous silica concentrations were examined. These concentrations yielded the kinetic expression - dS/dt = kK1/4 Sn, where S is the fraction of smectite in illite/smectite, t time, k the rate constant, and K potassium concentration in solution. The exact value for n could not be determined, although data from this and other studies suggest n &gt; 1. The activation energy of the process is ∼7 kcal mol-1, suggesting a solid transformation mechanism. Based on these results, smectite seems to offer a safe barrier for nuclear waste.",,"bentonite; clay barrier; illite; mixed layer mineral; radioactive waste storage; smectite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029751545

Seventy-five per cent of the 1-year-old males were mature, but only 25% of the females reached maturity at this age. In females, gonads formed an increasingly greater proportion of the total weight with age, but in males the proportion decreased. A bimodal distribution of gonadosomatic indices classes was observed in 2-year-old males (intermediate size), which reflected the lower opportunity that intermediate size males have to spend the ejaculates than have the younger and older males. The liver played an important role in the storage of energy before the reproductive season and reserves were utilized during the breeding season. Physical condition was at its lowest in July in both sexes, but in May, just before the breeding season began, large maturing females had significantly lower eviscerated condition than males. This could be due to females investing in oocyte development, while the priority for the males was to reserve their energy for the parental activities to come.

The size of this 'insurance' is dependent on a trade-off between storage costs and anticipated needs. Previous theoretical and empirical studies in birds have shown that fat levels are tailored to short-term needs. However, in some situations animals must match intake to longer term requirements. Here we develop a model of this situation, and compare it with experimental data from juvenile Atlantic salmon, which become anorexic and gradually deplete their energy reserves over winter. Responses to experimentally-accelerated depletion of reserves matched theoretical predictions: an elevation of appetite to restore lost reserves was dependent not on current energy state, but on projected energy state at the end of the winter. This is the first demonstration of an adaptive regulation of appetite tailored to long-term requirements for an energy insurance rather than short-term needs.",,"article; body fat; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; nonhuman; priority journal; salmon; season; winter; Animalia; Aves; Salmo salar; Salmo salar; anorexia; Atlantic salmon; fat reserve; foraging; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750925

Addition of protein or other partially- hydrophobic compounds (e.g., surfactants) to the solution act to stabilize the ICG, presumably by binding the dye and preventing occurrence of the degradation reaction. Solutions of ICG in other, less polar solvents, such as methanol, are also stable under normal conditions of handling and storage. We have discovered, however, that both protein-stabilized and methanol solutions of ICG will degrade when exposed to high-intensity monochromatic illumination. We irradiated 10 μM aqueous solutions of ICG, containing human serum albumin (HSA) as a stabilizer, with light from an alexandrite laser (wavelength: 750 nm; pulse energy: 100 mJ; pulse repetition rate: 20 Hz). While the HSA did act to slow the degradation process somewhat, even concentrations as high as 3% were not sufficient to prevent measurable degradation after as little as 30 seconds of irradiation. We obtained similar results with methanol solutions. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the type of illumination used during tissue welding in order to control ICG degradation. We present our measurements of the intensity dependence of ICG degradation in the presence of stabilizers. In addition, we discuss nonlinear effects (saturable absorption and multi-photon absorption and fluorescence) exhibited by ICG during high-intensity pulses irradiation.",,"Alexandrite lasers; Indocyanine green dye; Laser tissue welding; Degradation; Dyes; Fluorescence; Light absorption; Photochemical reactions; Solid state lasers; Stabilization; Laser surgery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029748978

This paper will briefly describe the major applications of flywheel technology, design considerations for the composite wheel and other portions of the systems, and the status of current device developments. United Technologies Corporation (UTC) has concentrated on an automo-tive Flywheel Surge Power Unit (FSPU) and utility power quality unit having a rated power of 25 to 50 kW and an energy storage capability of 800 Wh at 35,000 RPM. Other developments of larger units for buses and utility load leveling applications have also begun. Several failure mode tests of composite wheels have been demonstrated. Efforts to intentionally fail these filament wound graphite/thermo-plastic wheels at operational speeds have so far been unsuccessful, indicating a robust design.

Certain aspects of bio-incompatibility in dialysis can be viewed as leading to a chronic inflammatory state. In most chronic inflammatory diseases, loss of mean body mass is independent of reduced caloric intake. However, reduced caloric intake accounts for most of the weight loss in these patients and also dialysis patients. Refeeding is associated with increased fat deposition more than restoration of muscle mass. In addition to reduced caloric intake, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a classic example of a chronic inflammatory disease, have an elevated resting energy expenditure associated with decreased lean body mass. Elevated cellular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-lβ production can be demonstrated in these patients. However, in many dialysis patients, increased cytokine production can be ‘normal’ or reduced. This takes place as the level of malnutrition increases. Thus, cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF play a decreasing role in the pathogenesis of loss of body mass as malnutrition increases and curtails the synthesis of cytokines. Similar to patients with AIDS, progressive disease in patients on chronic dialysis may exhibit subclinical malnutrition which leads to decreased cytokine production. Reduction in cytokine production can be viewed as a protective mechanism. © 1996 S.

Measured thermic effects of nutrient are 0-3% for fat, 5-10% for carbohydrates and 20-30% for proteins. Stimulation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis during intestinal absorption, initial metabolic steps and nutrient storage are responsible for this food thermic effect. The autonomic nervous system modulates the thermic effect of nutrients. Parasympathetic muscarinic antagonists reduce the thermic effect of orally administered nutrients, most likely by delaying gastric emptying and decreasing the amount of nutrient storage. Antagonists of the beta-adrenoreceptors decrease the thermic effect of glucose. The part of glucose induced thermogenesis which is eliminated by beta-adrenergic antagonists has been called 'facultative thermogenesis' and takes place, at least in part, in skeletal muscle. Insulin-induced stimulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity may be involved in this facultative thermogenesis. The thermic effect of food is reduced in obese, insulin-resistant patients. The effect of thermogenesis represents about 50-150 kcal/day in such patients, and can explain only a minor part of their excess body weight. Defective thermogenesis may, however, contribute to weight gain, or impair weight loss in such patients.","Energy expenditure; Obesity; Parasympathetic nervous system; Sympathetic nervous system","adenosine triphosphate; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; carbohydrate; fat; glucose; insulin; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; protein; adrenergic system; body weight; cholinergic system; conference paper; energy expenditure; food intake; human; hydrolysis; insulin resistance; intestine absorption; metabolism; nutrient; obesity; skeletal muscle; stomach emptying; storage; sympathetic tone; thermogenesis; weight gain; weight reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029742073

In the present study, we evaluated an unusual patient with both MD and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that insulin resistance would limit transport of extracellular glucose to skeletal muscle during exercise, resulting in impaired exercise performance that was reversible by insulin infusion. The effect of a hyperinsulinemic 'euglycemic' clamp on exercise tolerance was evaluated by in vivo 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as total work performed. We observed that insulin infusion significantly increased the rate of systemic glucose utilization (P &lt; 0.01) and also significantly decreased the ratio of inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine (P &lt; 0.001) during forearm exercise compared with the control study. Insulin clamp was also associated with an increase in total work performed (56%) during exercise. Our findings demonstrate that resistance to the biological actions of insulin, as occurs in type II diabetes mellitus, leads to a defect in glucose transport that limits the availability of extracellular glucose to exercising muscle. In our subject with a substrate-limited skeletal muscle metabolism (MD), reversal of this defect in insulin-dependent glucose transport by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was associated with significant improvement in magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters of skeletal muscle metabolism as well as exercise performance.","31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy; diabetes mellitus; hyperinsulinemic clamp; non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus","glucose; glycogen phosphorylase; insulin; adult; article; case report; controlled study; exercise tolerance; glucose transport; glucose utilization; glycogen storage disease type 5; glycogenolysis; human; insulin resistance; male; muscle metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029738298

In order to get information on energy allocation in guinea pigs, fat-free mass (FFM) of young (1-30 days) and adult females (reproducing vs. non-reproducing) was determined by measuring TOtal Body Electrical Conductivity (TOBEC; indexed by TOBEC) which was calibrated by Soxhlet extraction. FFM was predictable from body length alone, but was best predicted as a function of (TOBEC*length)0.5. Prediction was further improved by separating the data into two sets, for animals of ≤ 23cm and of &gt;23cm body length. Fat and total body water (TBW) can also be determined from TOBEC, but the reliability of fat determinations is low unless samples of 5-10 equally treated animals can be averaged. The formula developed by Pace and Rathbun (1945) for the estimation of TBW has frequently been used for all kinds of mammals, but is shown consistently to underestimate TBW even in guinea pigs. Using our calibrations, we studied the development of FFM and body fat in young guinea pigs from birth to 30 days, and the development of FFM and fat stores in reproducing, primiparous, and non-reproducing females of equal age. Young were born with about 11% fat. Young in large litters (3-5) had relatively and absolutely less fat reserves than young in small litters. In eight young measured on days 1, 3, and 5, fat declined until day 3 and returned to the mass at birth on day 5. Fat mass increased slowly during the lactation period, until day 20, and faster thereafter in weaned young. Relative to body mass, fat decreased from 11.2% at birth to 9.3% on day 30, with a minimum of 6.6% on day 20. Mass of fat on day 30 was independent of litter size. FFM began to grow linearly from day 5 onwards. Body water in FFM varied with age in an inverted U-shaped pattern. Reproducing females grew in FFM at equal rates to non-reproducing females, but deposited less than half as much fat until day 210, by which time they had two litters. Under ad libitum food conditions and a mild thermal regime, reproducing females allocated as much of the available resources to growth in FFM as non-reproducing females, but reduced storage of fat, instead producing biomass of precocial young.",,"Capia porcellus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029738216

Worldwide, there are currently more than 976,000 natural gas-vehicles, most of which are located in Europe and South America. At present, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is the technology most widely used, which stores gaseous fuel at very high pressures (about 3,000 psig). However, short driving ranges and questions of safety and cost have limited the penetration of Natural Gas Vehicles (NGV) into the transportation market in the U.S. This is in spite of the relatively lower price of natural gas compared with other fuels on an energy basis. A new technology called Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) is being developed, which contains the gaseous fuel in a dense form at a moderate pressure (500 psig). The lower pressure utilized by ANG allows the usage of conformable tanks which overcomes the short driving range of CNG. Nonetheless, the hope for ANG vehicles depends on further development in the areas of heat management and gas conditioning, in order to preserve the gas tank capacity.",,"Adsorbents; Costs; Energy resources; Gas adsorption; Gas fuel storage; Petroleum industry; Pressure; Technology; Vehicles; Adsorbed natural gas; Compressed natural gas; Gaseous fuel; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029735646

Box 1, NL 1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands, College of Advanced Technology, Groningen, Netherlands, Free University of Amsterdam, Netherlands, University Twente, Netherlands, Reactor Assessment Group","High-level radioactive waste (HLW) contains nuclides that present a potential risk for man and the environment for a very long time - up to many thousands of years. Worldwide research activities are directed toward establishing how HLW can be safely disposed in stable geological formations such as rock salt formations. The unusual timescale of the problem has given rise to public and scientific concern about the reliability and the longevity of the proposed solutions. This has led to many suggestions about mechanisms that might provide a pathway for the nuclides to reach the biosphere. Although some of these suggestions are rather far fetched, disregarding them without thorough and scientifically sound argumentation is considered unacceptable. This paper should be viewed in this light. The disposal of HLW in a salt formation will result in the deposit of gamma energy in the rock salt. Most of this energy will be converted into heat while a small part will create defects in the salt crystals. It has been shown that energy is stored in the defected crystals. Because of uncertainties in the models and differences in the disposal concepts, the estimated values for the stored energy range from 10 to 1000 J/g in the most heavily defected crystals close to the waste containers. Given the uncertainties in the model predictions and in the possible release mechanism, this paper concludes that at this moment, an instantaneous release of stored energy cannot be completely excluded. Therefore, the thermomechanical consequences of a postulated instantaneous release of an extremely high amount of radiation-induced stored energy have been estimated. These estimations are based on the quasi-static solutions for line and point sources. An amplification factor has been derived from mining experience with explosives to account for the dynamic effects and the occurrence of fractures. A validation of this amplification factor has been given using postexperimental observations of two nuclear explosions in a salt formation. For some typical disposal concepts in rock salt, the extent of the fractured zone has been estimated. It appears that the radial extent of the fractured zone is limited to 5 m. Given the much larger distance between the individual boreholes and the distance between the boreholes and the boundary of the salt formation (>100 m), one can conclude that the probability of a release of radiation-induced stored energy creating a pathway for the nuclides from the containers to the groundwater is negligible.","Radiation damage; Radioactive waste repository; Rock salt","Accident prevention; Boreholes; Crystals; Defects; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Groundwater; Isotopes; Parameter estimation; Radiation effects; Radioactive waste disposal; Sodium chloride; Amplification factor; Radiation induced stored energy; Rock salt; Waste containers; Geological repositories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029733277

Two of the systems - the system NIKOS in the Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor HASYLAB in Hamburg and the system in Brookhaven - allow investigations of patients. The aim of the work is to visualize coronary arteries down to 1 mm diameter with an iodine mass density of 1 mg/cm2, thus allowing non-invasive investigations by intravenous application of the contrast medium. The two images for subtraction are simultaneously taken with photon energies just below and above the iodine K-edge (33.17 keV) in a line scan mode. In principle the system NIKOS consists of six main parts: A 20-pole wiggler with a total length of 2.4 m and a field of 1.26 T is installed in the storage ring DORIS at DESY in Hamburg. In a two beam monochromator two bent perfect Si(111) crystals in Laue geometry are used for filtering the quasi-monochromatic beams with a bandwidth of 180 eV out of the white synchrotron radiation beam. In a safety system three independent very fast beam shutters are installed which close within less than 10 ms at any malfunction of the system. Because the line scan mode is used a scanning device moves the patient with up to 50 cm/s through the two monochromatic beams. As a detector a two-line ionization chamber with a spatial resolution of 0.4 mm is installed. The chamber has a dynamic range of 39,000:1 and reads a line within 0.73 ms. The quantum efficiency for 33 keV photons is 85%. The computer system is used for control of the system, data acquisition, image processing and presentation. Since 1990 thirty patients were studied with the system NIKOS. In all cases follow-up investigations after interventions like bypass surgery, angioplasty or rotablation were performed. Intravenous angiograms from investigations with version III of the system are presented.",,"Blood vessels; Computer control; Computer systems; Contrast media; Ionization chambers; Medical imaging; Monochromators; Noninvasive medical procedures; Photons; Quantum efficiency; Scanning; Synchrotron radiation; Digital subtraction angiography; Intravenous angiograms; Intravenous coronary angiography; Line scan mode; Angiocardiography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029733244

The lateral birefringence is a result of the flow-induced molec. ular orientation in the skin layers generated in the mold filling stage, and the cooling-induced energy-elastic stresses generated inside and outside the mold. Cooling-induced energy-elastic birefringence relaxes quickly, and consequently the flow-induced birefringence with a radial dependence of decrease at the outer radius becomes predominant after annealing below the glass transition temperature. The annealing behavior of the vertical birefringence follows a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts-type relaxation. The results serve as a predictive tool for similar substrates.","Annealing; Birefringence; Injection molding; Optical disk; Polycarbonate; Relaxation of polymer","Annealing; Birefringence; Elasticity; Glass transition; Injection molding; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetooptical devices; Molecular orientation; Polycarbonates; Relaxation processes; Temperature; Magnetooptical disks; Mold filling stage; Polymer relaxation; Optical disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029733160

Since the energy change in the energy-storage capacitor can be compensated in the next cycle, and a larger DC bus voltage ripple can be tolerated if a sampling technique is used, a relatively smaller energy storage capacitor is required. The advantages of this APF circuit are simplicity of control circuits, low cost (a smaller energy-storage capacitor) and good transient response.

These waters, mixed with the underlying Atlantic Water, participate in a variable, mainly wind-driven, cyclonic surface circulation in the Skagerrak. This paper presents a thorough analysis of hydrographic data to provide insight into the distribution and circulation of freshwater in the Skagerrak. From measured salinity and temperature profiles, we compute vertically integrated variables such as the freshwater content, the potential energy and the steric sea level. Furthermore, the density variance is calculated from the density fields. The calculations show that freshwater is accumulated mainly along the Swedish and Norwegian coasts. The computed topography of the steric sea level agrees well with published results for the coast as determined by geodetic methods. This shows that the steric effect gives the dominating contribution to the topography of the mean sea level in the Skagerrak. The computed distribution of freshwater along the coasts is thus largely verified by the geodetically determined mean sea level. We find strong indications of an extensive recirculation of freshwater within the Skagerrak, due to advection/dispersion from the storage along the Norwegian coast. The horizontal distribution of density variance in the upper 10 m mirrors the spreading of low-saline water from the Kattegat. Deeper down there are maxima in density variance along the coasts, reflecting occasional downwelling and strengthening of the baroclinic coastal currents due to time-varying winds. The mean potential energy along the coasts increases monotonously in the cyclonic direction, from the inflow region in the southwest to the out-flow region off the western part of the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. The corresponding flow increase is mainly due to incorporation of Atlantic Water into the surface layer. Using a rough energy budget for the Skagerrak, we find that the potential energy of the coastal current system cannot be maintained by wind-driven diapycnal mixing. We suggest that isopycnal downwelling along the coasts provides the necessary energy. The considerable annual variation found in potential energy in the coastal currents covaries with the variation of the wind stress amplitude.","Circulation; Dynamics; Freshwater; Potential energy; Sea level; Skagerrak","density variance; freshwater input; potential energy; surface circulation; Skagerrak",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029730744

Multiple quantum well (MQW) structures with AlGaAs QWs allow the fabrication of optical devices operating at much shorter wavelengths than conventional GaAs QW devices which operate in the vicinity of 860 nm. We show bias-dependent photocurrent (PC) measurement results from p-i-n MQW samples containing 10 nm Al xGa 1-xAs QWs with x-values ranging from 0 to 0.54 and corresponding wavelengths ranging from 860 to 570 nm.

We are investigating the potential of a hybrid photodiode array-CCD which will overcome this problem. The photodiode converts the x-ray energy directly into charge which is stored in the CCD. The detector is used in a slot-scan configuration to image the entire breast. Due to the large amount of charge generated in the photodiode, a charge divider is incorporated on the CCD to prevent detector saturation. Feasible values of design parameters such as photodiode thickness, operating voltages, and charge divider ratio were determined by modeling the signal and noise propagation through the detector. The quantum accounting diagram (QAD) and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) were used to measure imaging performance. A photodiode thickness of 1.5 mm ensures acceptable quantum efficiency. This thickness, however, causes significant geometric blur due to obliquely incident x-rays at edges of the detector unless the detector is curved by using a number of hybrid sections less than 2 cm long. No more than 90% of the photodiode charge can be discarded by the divider without causing a significant reduction in DQE due to direct x-ray interaction in the CCD.

The predicted and measured results for the brine exit temperatures and load profiles are in good agreement throughout most of the charge and discharge cycles. Additional results are presented to show a complete system simulation for a typical day in which the thermal energy storage component is coupled with a chiller and load.",,"Algorithms; Brines; Computer simulation; Computer software; Ice; Mathematical models; Performance; Pipe; Temperature measurement; Thermal load; Ice on pipe brine thermal storage; Software Package IceTES; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029718261

Both methods use essentially short range spectral projection operators to produce a complete set of solutions of the wave equation that need be valid only inside the interaction region. While the spectral projection method is more generic than the stabilization method which is based on using the more difficult to compute spectral density operator, the latter becomes very efficient when narrow resonances exist. For problems of small size both methods are practical in the sense that they involve only real, symmetric matrices resulting from Hamiltonians represented on ℒ2 basis sets. For more challenging larger systems the spectral projection method lends itself to a very efficient time independent iterative procedure that obtains results simultaneously at all energies. This procedure uses modified Chebyshev recursion relations to essentially expand the operator (E-Ĥ)-1. It requires minimal storage and the resulting series converges rapidly in a manner that is uniform in energy. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.",,"Calculations; Current voltage characteristics; Electron resonance; Electron scattering; Electron transport properties; Fermi level; Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Set theory; Chebyshev recursion; Chemical reactive scattering; Spectral projection method; Stabilization method; Semiconductor devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029716623

We measure this quality factor by making images of a calibration phantom containing steps with known aluminum and plastic thickness. From the energy selective data, we compute an aluminum equivalent thickness image. The signal is the difference in the average value between two steps of the phantom with different aluminum thickness. The noise is the standard deviation of the computed values over the steps. The dose is the incident x-ray exposure.

DuPont de Nemours & Co.,, Wilmington, DE, USA, United States","The imaging performance of a new direct digital radiographic detector based on amorphous selenium and amorphous silicon TFT array which is under development is discussed. Progress has been made on the development of a multilayer digital x-ray detector panel with a structure consisting of a thin-film transistor pixel array, selenium x-ray photoconductor, dielectric layer and top electrode. An electronic system allows the rapid readout of image data which produces high resolution and wide dynamic range images. Using a straight edge, small wires and low contrast small holes targets, we have studied the spatial resolution, contrast detectability, and dynamic range of this new detector. Digital signals obtained from each pixel of this detector are almost linear with the total x-ray energy absorbed within the pixel area over a wide range of x-ray exposures. The resultant wide dynamic range allows extended latitude of exposure conditions and the enhancement or emphasis of different gray level regions from a single set of image data. For example, from one single exposure of the head, the soft tissue of the nose, detail structure of the teeth, as well as the bone structure of the neck can be examined by displaying and emphasizing selective gray levels of the image data. Image information obtained from this detector appears to be more evenly distributed over a wide dynamic range which is different from digital data obtained from other digital modalities such as the electrometer sensing of discharged potentials on photoconductors or from film digitization. Examples of images are shown. The discrete pixel structure of this detector and the higher intrinsic spatial resolution of selenium combine to produce image sharpness greater than those produced from digital detectors of similar pixel pitch using indirect conversion method or from digitizing film-screen images. The applicability of mathematical tools, such as the MTF which was developed primarily for analog images on a continuous imaging medium, is discussed with respect to our new discrete element detector.",,"Amorphous selenium; Digital radiographic detectors; Discrete element detectors; Gray level regions; Soft tissue; Spatial resolution; Detectors; Digital image storage; Multilayers; Performance; Semiconducting selenium; Thin film transistors; Tissue; X ray radiography; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029712682

To improve the x-ray interaction efficiency and absorption efficiency of an SFS, high Z elements can be added into the scintillating fiber core.

X-ray interaction efficiency, scintillating light intensity distributions and line spread functions were generated using Monte Carlo simulation. DQE(0) and MTF(f) were computed for x-ray energies ranging from 15 to 50 keg. Loading high Z elements into the SFS markedly increased the DQE(0). For x-ray energies used for mammography, DQE(0) values of both high Z element loaded SFSs are about a factor of three higher than the DQE(0) of an Min-R screen. At mammographic x-ray energies, MTF(f) values of all three SFSs are greater than 50% at 25 lp/mm spatial frequency, and were found to be dominated by the 20 micrometer individual scintillating fiber diameter used.

The main characteristic of this system is the use of advanced natural language processing to enhance the effectiveness of term-based document retrieval. The system is designed around a traditional statistical backbone consisting of the indexer module, which builds inverted index files from pre-processed documents, and a retrieval engine which searches and ranks the documents in response to user queries. Natural language processing is used to (1) preprocess the documents in order to extract content-carrying terms, (2) discover inter-term dependencies and build a conceptual hierarchy specific to the database domain, and (3) process user's natural language requests into effective search queries. This system has been used in NIST-sponsored Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC), where we worked with approximately 3.3 GBytes of text articles including material from the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press newswire, the Federal Register, Ziff Communications's Computer Library, Department of Energy abstracts, U.S. Patents and the San Jose Mercury News, totaling more than 500 million words of English.

Dual-energy is one technique to reduce the structured noise associated with the complexity of the background of normal anatomy surrounding a lesion. This can be done by taking the advantage of the x-ray attenuation characteristics of two different structures such as soft tissue and bone in chest radiography. We have applied this technique to the detection of microcalcifications in mammography. The overall system performance based on this technique is evaluated. Results presented are based on the evaluation of phantom images.",,"Computed radiography; Digital mammography; Dual energy mammography; Microcalcifications; Phantom images; Screen film mammography; Computerized tomography; Digital image storage; Efficiency; Oncology; Optimization; Phosphors; X ray radiography; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029703450

The proposed holographic associative memory is used to replace the optical modulator (reticle) by using a Fourier hologram. The target radiant flux is collected by optical system. A hologram is inserted in the optical path between the optical lens of the optical system and the detector in the focal plane of the lens. When the IR fluxes illuminate the hologram, the hologram redirects the flux to the desired direction. After the energy transferred by the detector arrays, we can get the codes, corresponding to the position of target, from the output of detector arrays by particular arrangement of the redirected radiant flux. Thus, generating the electric signal corresponding to target position in the IR tracking system by optical signal processing becomes easy and effective. Besides providing directional information, it can also be used for background suppression.

The adhesive behavior of tackified polymers was quantitatively analyzed by applying the rheological principle of time-temperature superposition2 and the mapping approach,3, 4 and the pressure sensitive rheological mode5 developed earlier. This model5 was developed by expanding and modifying an equation [adhesive fracture strength = (intrinsic adhesion) × (bulk energy dissipation)] proposed by Gent et al.6, 7 and Andrews et al.8, 9 This study delivers two key results. The first is that the fracture strength of the PSA/steel bond is the multiplication of three terms: the intrinsic (or interfacial) adhesion, the bonding and the debonding terms (Fig. 1). The debonding term is correlated with the logarithm of the loss modulus at the PSA debonding frequency or with the logarithm of the monomeric friction coefficient of the block copolymer/tackifier system. Both the loss modulus and the monomeric friction coefficient measure the energy dissipation in the bulk adhesive. The second is that PSA design pathways can be established by a mapping approach in the rheological space of the plateau modulus versus the loss modulus peak position in the frequency scale (Fig. 2). Plateau modulus is the bonding parameter because it measures the wetting capability of the adhesive with the substrate surface. The loss modulus peak position is the debonding parameter because it corresponds approximately to the time scale (or the frequency scale) in which one deforms the adhesive to maximize energy dissipation. Therefore, the tackifier and oil combination lowers the plateau modulus, but increases the Tg of the polyisoprene phase of the SIS polymer. This increase in Tg is equivalent to the lowering of the rate of local rearrangement (frequency of segment jumps) of the polyisoprene chains of the block copolymer An optimal ""tackification pathway"" in this rheological space is achieved by tailoring the tackifier type and Tg, and the amount of oil used in the PSA. In brief, the PSA rheological model and mapping approach described in this work for Vector SIS polymers give a comprehensive understanding and adhesive design pathways. This concept and approach not only allow raw material suppliers to improve and design better tackifier and polymer products, but also provide PSA formulators a quantitative tool to achieve PSA end property results.","Adhesion, tack; Block copolymer; Pressure sensitive adhesive; Rheology; Storage modulus, loss modulus; Tackifier; Time-temperature superposition","Adhesion; Block copolymers; Bonding; Elastic moduli; Energy dissipation; Fracture toughness; Friction; Mathematical models; Mathematical techniques; Organic polymers; Rheology; Wetting; Loss modulus; Monomeric friction coefficient; Pressure sensitive rheological model; Pure sensitive adhesives; Storage modulus; Tack; Tackifier; Time temperature superposition; Vector SIS polymers; Adhesives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029697130

A generation of space charge during stages 1 and 2 leads to the high local accumulation of energy in the polarized dielectric medium. The chaotic destabilization events between 2 and 3 stages (rapid detrapping ↔ restoration of space charge) release this energy via strong mechanical relaxation and, as a consequence, form a leakage channel (area less than 10-11 cm2). Thus, the second stage of degradation chain - SLDP (self-localization of degradation process) - plays a crucial role in oxide reliability. The main result of this work - SLDP Model, allowing to explain non-linear decrease of substrate hole current (DSHC effect), which was observed in small MOS structures, subjected to stresses caused by electron injection. It is also shown that the most popular degradation/breakdown models are inapplicable for interpretation of DSHC effect. The presence of local SiO2 regions, resistant to the negative space charge formation (endurance up to 104 A/cm2 and 104 Cl/cm2), allows us to explain a positive feedback of SLDP. Temperature analysis strongly supports new degradation/breakdown model and models which involve hydrogen related effects in oxide films under the field/temperature stress.",,"Degradation; Electric breakdown; Electric currents; Electric space charge; Electrons; Models; MOS devices; Nonvolatile storage; Semiconducting films; Semiconductor device structures; Silica; Electron injection; Injection current; MOS structures; Nonlinear decrease of substrate hole current; Self localization; Thin films",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029696830

Minimizing raw materials is efficient both in terms of the energy expended by the organism to synthesize the structure and in terms of the strength-to-weight ratio of the structure. Wood is the most obvious example of cellular bio-materials, and it is the focus of other presentations in this symposium. The lightweight bone structure of birds is another excellent example where weight is a key criterion. The anchoring foot of the common muscle [Mytilus edulis] whereby it attaches itself to objects is a further example of a biological system that uses a foam to fill space and yet conserve on raw materials. In the case of the muscle the foam is water filled and the foot structure distributes stress over a larger area so that the strength of the byssal thread from which it is suspended is matched to the strength of interfacial attachment of the foot to a substrate. In these examples the synthesis and fabrication of the cellular material is directed by intercellular, genetically coded, biochemical reactions. The resulting cell sizes are microns in scale. Cellular materials at the next larger scale are created by organisms at the next higher level of integration. For example an African tree frog lays her eggs in a gas/fluid foam sack she builds on a branch overhanging a pond. The outside of the foam sack hardens in the sun and prevents water evaporation. The foam structure minimizes the amount of fluid that needs to be incorporated into the sack and minimizes its weight. However, as far as the developing eggs are concerned, they are in an aqueous medium, i.e. the continuous fluid phase of the foam. After precisely six days the eggs hatch, and the solidified outer wall re-liquefies and dumps the emerging tadpoles into the pond below. The bee honeycomb is an example of a cellular material with exquisite periodicity at millimeter length scales. The cellular structure provides strength through geometric regularity and functions as both honey storage vessels and incubators.",,"Biochemistry; Biology; Biomaterials; Bone; Cell culture; Fabrication; Microstructure; Muscle; Bee honeycombs; Cell growth; Cellular materials; Cellular structure; Intelligent materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029695611

The technical efficiency of CHP is shown to consist of a quality aspect (the heat/power ratio) and a quantity aspect (the thermal conversion efficiency). The technical efficiency numbers depend on three processes: the CHP one, the single power one and the single heat one. Understanding CHP starts with a study of the major features of the joint end-uses to be served: heat and electricity, such as storage, transport, market extent and service reliability. Next, it is important to situate CHP in a wider context of fuel markets and of electricity markets. The triple relationship of CHP to the electric grid is the single most influential factor of CHP feasibility: surplus electricity must be sold at a 'fair' price to the grid, while the latter should supply make-up and back-up power also at 'fair' prices. For the appraisal of CHP projects it is necessary to make an hour-by-hour analysis of the heat and power loads, and a simulation of the performance of the CHP plant in meeting these loads, given the production possibility set of the CHP plant and given the conditions for trading power with the grid. Forecasting the future of CHP requires a neat distinction between independent (industrial and commercial) CHP and utility (district heating) CHP. The two types of CHP development own different characterisitcs and require very different regulatory and public policies.","Cogeneration; District heating; Energy efficiency; Energy markets; Energy policy","District heating; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Industrial heating; Combined heat and power process; Heat/power ratio; Thermal conversion efficiency; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029695496

Fats have important roles in the intestinal absorption of fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and also produce satiety signals that regulate meal size. Fats, however, are likely best known for representing the greatest source of calories in the diet (e.g. approximately 9 kcal per gram for fat compared to 4 kcal per gram for protein and carbohydrates). Regulatory recommendations state that a maximum of 30% of calories derived from fat should be consumed by adults in the North American diet to assist in the prevention of chronic diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease and cancer). A growing body of evidence suggests that metabolic utilization of dietary fats is influenced by the overall composition of fatty acid comprising the fat; more specifically the size, isomeric configuration, degree of unsaturation and the esterified position on the glycerol molecule. Thus, qualitative factors of fat consumption in addition to the amount consumed may be a regulator of caloric balance. Various factors influencing the digestion, absorption and partitioning of dietary fat for energy utilization and synthesis of triacylglycerides are reviewed, with particular emphasis given to the methodology of evaluating the partition of fat for oxidation versus storage.","dietary fat; energy balance; metabolism; oxidation; storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029684471

An analysis technique has been developed to calculate elemental maps and quantitative distributions from ESI sequences. Extensive experience has been obtained with a practical implementation of this technique. A procedure for more robust element detection has been investigated and optimized. With the use of Fe-loaded Chelex beads, the measurement system has been evaluated with respect to the linearity of the element concentration scale, the reproducibility of the measurements and the visual usage of image results. In liver specimens of a patient with an iron storage disease the detectability of iron was tested and we tried to characterize iron-containing components. The concentration measurement scale is approximately linear up to a relative section thickness of ~ 0. 5. Monitoring of this parameter is therefore considered to be important. The reproducibility was measured in an experiment with Fe-Chelex. The iron concentration differed by 6.4% between two serial measurements. Element distributions are in many applications interpreted visually. For this purpose the frequently used net-intensity distributions are regarded as unsuitable. For the quantification and visual interpretation of concentration differences mass thickness correction has to be performed. By contrast, for the detection of elements the signal-to-noise ratio is the appropriate criterion. Application of ESI analysis demonstrated the quantitative chemical capabilities of this technique in the investigation of iron storage diseases. Based on an assumed ferritin iron loading in vivo, different iron components can be discerned in liver parenchymal cells of an iron-overloaded patient.","biochemistry; EELS; electron energy-loss spectroscopy; electron spectroscopic imaging; ESI; ferritin; haemochromatosis; haemosiderin; image processing; iron","ferritin; hemosiderin; iron; conference paper; electron energy loss spectroscopy; hemochromatosis; image processing; ion exchange; iron storage; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029682598

We report here on a non-Ashkenazic woman with the onset, at the age of 48 years, of a progressive limb girdle myopathy that was not preceded by a history of exercise intolerance. Muscle biopsy findings at the age of 58 years showed deposition of amylopectin-like material in muscle fibers and the absence of histochemical PFK activity. Enzymatic PFK activity in vitro was only 4% of normal. Since the forearm ischemic exercise test induced a sub-normal production of serum lactate, the patient underwent phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS), a noninvasive method that allows in vivo assessment of the functional status of the glycolytic pathway and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by measuring the high-energy phosphates and cytosolic pH. In vivo, 31P-MRS disclosed a residual glycolytic flux and a normal rate of ATP production both at rest and during exercise. These results suggest that, in some patients, muscle PFK deficiency may be partial in vivo, and more severe in vitro, possibly due to protein or mRNA instability rather than absence. The presence of these findings in a patient with the late-onset myopathic form is compatible with a distinct pathogenetic mechanism, relying on progressive polysaccha- ride accumulation, rather than on acute energetic shortage in muscle fibers.","Glycogenosis type VII; In vivo phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Muscle energy metabolism; Myopathy; Phosphofructokinase","6 phosphofructokinase; phosphorus; adenosine triphosphate; amylopectin; lactic acid; article; case report; enzymology; female; glycogen storage disease type 7; glycolysis; human; metabolism; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pathology; skeletal muscle; ultrastructure; adult; enzyme deficiency; enzyme histochemistry; exercise test; glycogen storage disease; human tissue; lactate blood level; muscle biopsy; muscle cell; myopathy; onset age; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII; Glycolysis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Phosphofructokinase-1; Phosphorus Isotopes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029679898

Size and weight constraints require that the energy and power densities of the source be as large as possible. While, in general, it is not possible to optimize both these parameters simultaneously, chemical double-layer (CDL) capacitor technology offers an excellent combination of the desirable energy and power density characteristics required in a source for these applications. The work presented here focuses on the design, testing, and evaluation of the CDL capacitor technology in combination with batteries as a unique power source for electrical actuation systems. In this research effort CDL capacitor technology was applied in the design and development of a power source for thrust vector control electromechanical actuators currently being developed for use on the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters. CDL capacitors have many properties that make them well suited for actuator applications. Among them are that they have the highest demonstrated energy density for capacitive storage (about a factor of 5-10 less than NiCd batteries), have power densities up to 50 times greater than NiCd batteries, are capable of 500,000 charge-discharge cycles, can be charged at extremely high rates, and have nonexplosive failure modes.

In order to assure large charging and discharging rates, finned heat pipes are used to transfer heat to and from the phase-change material (paraffin in this case). The evolution of the solid - liquid interface is studied by considering the radial heat transfer (due to the heat pipe wall) and the angular one (due to the fin). Two mathematical models, corresponding to exponential, respectively polynomial functions describing the fin temperature profile are presented and the results are compared. The two models allow the evaluation of the discharge time of the storage unit for a certain number of fins for a single heat pipe. When the discharge time has a fixed value, the methods presented in the paper allow to conclude whether the number of fins is sufficiently large to assure the complete solidification of the phase-change material.","Angular heat transfer; Finned heat pipe; Freezing time; Latent heat; Radial heat transfer; Thermal storage system","Energy conversion; Fins (heat exchange); Freezing; Heat pipes; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Phase interfaces; Polynomials; Solar energy; Heat transfer agent; Latent heat; Solar conversion system; Thermal storage system; Heat storage; Fins; Heat; Pipes; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029675594

All three species examined reproduce sexually and proved to be oviparous and gonochoristic. A considerable number of asexually produced reproductive units was found in Thenea abyssorum, but owing to morphological details the origin of these buds is equivocal, and asexual reproduction is therefore judged to be of minor importance. Oogenesis in the three species can be divided into two developmental periods and does not differ greatly from processes known from shallow water species, except for the almost complete absence of nurse cells. For Thenea abysorum a distinct seasonal reproductive cycle was found. The onset of yolk accumulation coincides precisely with a maximum in vertical particle flux as detected in sediment trap studies (von Bodungen et al. 1994). In addition, prior to yolk accumulation the sponge tissue appears almost 'empty', without storage units. Once yolk accumulation (i.e. the second growth period) has started, gamete development and release are completed within a few weeks. Thus sexual reproduction is an important reproductive mode in deep-sea sponges, which may be triggered by the pulsed input of POC to this food-limited environment, the energy-dependent process of yolk accumulation being the most sensitive process.",,"benthos; deep sea; deep-sea benthos; seasonal cycle; sexual reproduction; vertical particle flux; Norwegian Sea; Porifera; Thenea abyssorum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029669669

During the summer the crab's diet switches to encrusting algae due to a die-off of filamentous algae. As a result of the switch the nutrients in the diet of the crab vary seasonally and may influence the fitness of the crab. Maintenance, growth, reproductive performance and nutrient storage of crabs were examined under four dietary regimes of increasing nutritional value ranging from low organic to high protein content. The nutritional quality of these diets significantly affected crab survival and moulting. Crabs fed on the nutritionally superior diet of algae and meat exhibited enhanced growth, higher levels of energy in the reproductive organs and stored more energy in the hepatopancreas than did individuals on the shore and crabs fed only on algal diets in the laboratory. Filamentous algae were a better food source than other algae, resulting in fewer deaths and superior levels of maintenance and growth. Growth and maintenance can occur on a pure algal diet, but reproductive performance and nutrient storage require some degree of added nutrients in the form of animal matter in the diet. Crabs fed coralline or foliose algae had higher mortality and fewer successful moults than crabs fed the other two diets. The fitness of G. albolineatus appears to be limited by the amount of extra nutrients obtained from animal matter. The opportunistic consumption of animal material in the form of carrion, or of animals associated with dietary algae, could be a key factor in the reproductive success of this crab.","Algal diet; Growth; Reproduction; Rocky shore; Storage; Tropical","algal diet; diet; diets; fitness; growth; nutritional quality; reproduction; rocky shore; Decapoda; Grapsus albolineatus; Grapus albolineatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029668981

The amount of carbohydrate determines whether there are sufficient carbon skeletons and sufficient energy available to support synthesis of new material. Growth of roots, tillers/stems and leaves is simulated with leaf divided into photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic structures. The model keeps account of soluble carbohydrate and nitrogen pools in each of the organs and storage pools of carbohydrate in the leaves and roots. The modelled crop has an age structure so that each plant organ has an age profile describing daily changes in growth; when the oldest tissue becomes senescent a fraction of its nitrogen is recycled. Seasonal changes in the percentage nitrogen content of the crop, when large amounts of soil nitrogen are available, are shown to be a consequence of changes in both soluble and stored carbohydrate. The contrast between high and low nitrogen treatments is shown to be a consequence of different allocation priorities for nitrogen. The model demonstrates that considering nitrogen as the primary element of synthesis provides an approach that predicts dry matter production successfully, as well as giving a different perspective of the growth processes, and suggesting that the capacity of the enzymatic processes governing synthesis ultimately limits crop yields. This different perspective may be most useful when trying to understand what controls growth and the relative influence of environmental changes on the physiology and morphology of the crop. © 1996 Annals of Botany Company.","C:N ratio; Grass growth; Mathematical model; Nitrogen use; Partitioning","grass; growth; modelling; nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029668092

An important part of this concept concerns the geochemical environment of a disposal vault and includes consideration of rock and groundwater compositions, geochemical interactions between rocks, groundwaters, and emplaced vault materials, and the influences and significance of anthropogenic and microbiological effects following closure of the vault. This paper summarizes the disposal concept and examines aspects of the geochemical environment. The presence of saline groundwaters and reducing conditions at proposed vault depths (500-1000 m) in the Canadian Shield has an important bearing on the stability of the used nuclear fuel, its container, and buffer and backfill materials. The potential for introduction of anthropogenic contaminants and microbes during site investigations and vault excavation, operation, and sealing is described with examples from AECL's research areas on the Shield and in their underground research laboratory in southeastern Manitoba.","Canadian Shield; geochemistry; groundwater chemistry; nuclear waste disposal","ground water; radioisotope; Canada; controlled study; geology; nonhuman; nuclear waste; pollution transport; priority journal; radioactive waste disposal; review; soil pollution; crystalline bedrock; geochemistry; groundwater; radioactive waste storage; redox conditions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667969

Under appropriate chemical conditions, bound metal ions can form a variety of minerals that may be of major geological importance. Many studies have shown the occurrence of metal binding and biomineralization in nature, but detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. The microbial influence of this binding may be indirect, such as physicochemical influences on the solution chemistry, E(h), and pH; or direct, when it is determined by the type of organisms present, their energy metabolism, and the structural and chemical characteristics of the cell surface and extracellular polymers. Metal binding by bacterial cell surfaces has several implications in nuclear waste disposal including adsorption of soluble radionuclides. A detailed knowledge of the chemical mechanisms of metal interactions with the microbial cell surface will enhance our understanding of the geochemical environment within a nuclear waste disposal vault.","bacterial cell surface; biofilm; biomineralization; radionuclide immobilization","metal; radioisotope; bacterial cell wall; biofilm; immobilization; mineralization; nonhuman; nuclear waste; priority journal; radioactive waste disposal; review; ultrastructure; bacteria; biomineralization; radioactive waste storage; radioanuclide transport; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667962

The model was developed for use as a submodel of the air-soil systems in greenhouses where the soil is used as a heat storage medium, with a network of burled pipes acting as a heat exchanger. The model assumes soil thermal properties are spatially and temporally constant and that energy transfer between the greenhouse and soil is primarily a result of net radiation and sensible heat transfer. First-or- der energy transfer terms are also used to account for lateral energy exchanges with the surrounding soil and the heat source is included as a plane at a fixed depth. This was achieved by obtaining a Green's function solution in the Laplace domain and performing a numerical inversion with a fast Fourier-transform algorithm, which requires very little computational time. Model parameters are optimized using a Simplex algorithm during a 3-d simulation to show the ability of the method to describe the greenhouse soil temperature.

However, attaining this cost requires that special consideration be given to selecting the land base, carefully matching appropriate clones to sites and using whole-tree direct load harvesting concepts. The direct load system significantly reduces harvest and handling costs by eliminating skidding and minimizing in-field handling, using high-speed continuous cutting principles and harvesting all year round for better equipment utilization and reduced biomass losses from handling and storage. Our estimate is also based on regenerating new stands by replacing cut trees with improved clones rather than by coppice regrowth.","Economics; Harvesting; Short-rotation woody crops; Whole-tree","article; biomass; cost effectiveness analysis; economics; forestry; priority journal; technique; wood; Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Feedstocks; Harvesting; Industrial economics; Short rotation woody crops; Whole tree direct load harvesting; Crops; biomass energy; economic potential; energy production; whole-tree feedstock",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663518

A hydrodynamic model for unsteady jet propulsion was developed in which propulsion performance is characterized by three nondimensional parameters: the storage/discharge volume ratio, reduced clapping frequency, and reduced discharge frequency. Pulsed jet propulsion is designed to achieve high thrust, although not necessarily with low hydrodynamic propulsive efficiency, as was previously widely considered. Swimming in scallops is realized by orientating the body at a certain angle of attack and maintaining a minimum swimming speed to prevent sinking. The working frequency of the locomotor system is determined and adjusted by the swimming strategy (angle of attack, swimming speed, and trajectory angle). For Placopecten magellanicus, the optimum angle of attack is about 6°-12°, at which swimming requires the lowest energy input (lowest frequency) and hydrodynamic behaviour is ideal (without severe separation and stall). To maintain level swimming, P. magellanicus, during almost all their life, must swim at 5-7 body lengths per second if postured at a 6°-12° angle of attack. The estimated Froude efficiency decreases during growth from about 0.5 to 0.3 for level swimming and from about 0.4 to 0.2 for climbing at an angle of 25°. It is suggested that the heavy body and inferior hydrodynamic characteristics (low aspect ratio and imperfect planform shape) have prevented scallops from becoming good swimmers. These problems are enhanced as the animals grow.",,"Animalia; Pectinidae; Placopecten magellanicus; Placopecten magellanicus; jet-propelled swimming; locomotion; mechanics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663239

Individual forages did not activity rates or nectar sizes in response to changes in honey stores, and colonies did not increase nectar rates when honey stores within the hive were decreased. This result contrasts with pollen foraging behavior, which is extremely sensitive to colony state. Our data show that individual foraging decision during nectar and colony regulation of nectar intake are distinctly different from pollen foraging. The behavior of honey bees illustrate that foraging strategy (and therefore foraging models) can incorporate multiple currencies, including both energy and protein intake.","foraging theory; honey bees; nectar foraging","Apis mellifera; Apidae; Apis mellifera; Hymenoptera; honeybee; nectar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029662713

It is shown that drop volumes of primary raindrops can be calculated from the Marshall-Palmer distribution and drop volumes of secondary drops can be estimated from disdrometer measurements of the characteristic volume appropriate to the particular vegetation species. It is recognized that, in addition to the volume dependent stochastic wetting effect, there is also another drop-size-dependent wetting effect that is related to the kinetic energy of the raindrops, which reduces the maximum storage that can be achieved on the canopy. The predicted wetting functions for canopies of different density are described and compared with observations made with the use of a rainfall simulator. It is also shown that the species-dependent model parameters can be determined from measurements made with the rainfall simulator. The improved performance of the model compared with conventional interception models is demonstrated for a tropical forest in Sri Lanka. Application of the two-layer model may explain why interception losses from coniferous, fine-leaved forests in the temperate, low-intensity rainfall climate of the uplands of the U.K. are among the highest in the world, whereas interception losses from tropical broad leaved forest in high- intensity rainfall climates of the tropics are among the lowest.","canopy wetting; drop volume; kinetic energy; Marshall-Palmer distribution; rainfall simulator","canopy; drop size; interception model; model calibration; Sri Lanka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659666

In addition, partial outlet obstruction induces marked alterations in the utilization of intracellular calcium. Although calcium ATP-ase provides the energy for the translocation of intracellular free calcium into storage sites within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, very little is known about the properties of this enzyme in bladder muscle and mucosa. As an initial study, divalent ion specific ATP-ase activity was measured in extracts of rabbit bladder muscle and mucosa from control animals and from rabbits following partial urinary outlet obstruction. In both normal bladder muscle and mucosa, magnesium and calcium ions were equally effective in activating the enzyme. Seven days following partial urinary outlet obstruction, the ATP-ase activity in both bladder muscle and mucosa was significantly depressed by over 70%. The degree of the decreased enzyme activities observed within the muscularis and mucosa would indicate that specific membrane functions supported by divalent-ion-ATP-ase are dysfunctional. This hypothesis is supported by marked alterations in the utilization of intracellular calcium following partial outlet obstruction and the marked dysfunctions in both mucosal permeability and bacterial adherence to mucosa observed following partial outlet obstruction.","ATP-ase; calcium; magnesium; obstruction; urinary bladder","adenosine triphosphatase (calcium magnesium); adenosine triphosphatase (calcium magnesium); animal tissue; article; bladder mucosa; bladder muscle; bladder neck stenosis; calcium transport; controlled study; detrusor muscle; enzyme activity; male; nonhuman; rabbit; sarcoplasmic reticulum; smooth muscle contraction; animal; bladder; bladder obstruction; enzymology; kinetics; microsome; mucosa; physiology; smooth muscle; Animals; Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase; Kinetics; Male; Microsomes; Mucous Membrane; Muscle, Smooth; Rabbits; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029658038

Emphasis is placed on interaction of transpiration and soil water status, on nonlinear and nonuniform overland flow, and on the controlling function of each storage on water fluxes. The model is calibrated by using the SIMPLEX optimization, at the Shirakawatani catchment in Western Japan, with hydrometeorology data for 2 years.

One major issue that needed to be addressed is that most phase-change materials (PCMs) with high energy storage density have an unacceptably low thermal conductivity. Two enhancement techniques are proposed in this paper. The baseline case utilizes LiH encapsulated in a thin SS304 container. The first enhancement technique uses LiH encapsulated in smaller containers of various shapes contained in a bigger cylindrical container filled with Li. The second enhancement technique focuses on a metal/phase-change material (M/PCM) composite. Specifically, 5% Ni is added uniformly to LiH so that the mixture has the same volume as the baseline storage unit. The enhancement techniques are analyzed numerically and their effectiveness is assessed for both constant surface heat flux and constant surface temperature conditions. Results shown include the amount of PCM melted as a function of time and the maximum temperature within the storage units.

Because a low phosphorus/carbon feeding ratio (2/100, wt/wt) was used to suppress the growth of polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria, the sludge exhibited no biological phosphorus removal activity. Still, under anaerobic conditions, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, pyruvate, lactate, most key intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconate were taken up and stored as polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA); and glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, trehalose, and raffinose as cellular glycogen and PHA. The energy and reducing equivalents required for the carbon uptake and storage were generated from the glycolysis of either cellular glycogen or a sugar taken up. Results of substrate uptake further suggested that the sludge preferred to utilize glucose instead of cellular glycogen as an energy source during acids uptake. Different morphological types of bacteria with deposits of cellular PHA granules after substrate uptake were observed as the majority in the sludge, suggesting that they could assimilate or possibly scavenge most of the dissolved substrate of the waste water and dominate in the deteriorated biological phosphorus removal processes.","Activated sludge; Biological phosphorus removal; Glycogen; Glycolysis; Oxidation reduction; Polyhydroxyalkanoate; Polyphosphate","acetic acid; butyric acid; carbon; fructose; gluconic acid; glucose; glycogen; lactic acid; maltose; phosphorus; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polyphosphate; propionic acid; pyruvic acid; raffinose; sucrose; sugar; trehalose; valeric acid; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; article; bacterial growth; bioaccumulation; citric acid cycle; energy; energy resource; feeding; glycolysis; morphology; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; storage; waste water management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Activated Sludge; Bacteria; Biological Removal; Glycogen Accumulating; Phosphorus; Sewage Treatment; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029655383

We employ finite element methods (FEMs) to reduce the number of the required variables and improve the efficiency in storage and computation. The fundamental forms in differential geometry are used to measure rigid-motion invariant properties and formulate the internal energy of the shell. We also develop a wireframe model associated with a subdivision scheme to overcome the difficulty of generating a smooth boundary between two adjacent patches. This is a direct application of the 2-D contour model where curve segments or wires are used instead of patches. In the subdivision scheme, we impose the co-plane constraints to determine a unique normal vector at the interpolated mid-point. To demonstrate the descriptive ability of a wireframe model, we conduct experiments on 3-D data set of a tumor and a face. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Pattern recognition; Adjacent patches; Closed surfaces; Contour modeling; Differential geometry; Internal energies; Invariant properties; Subdivision schemes; Wireframe model; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013326294

We consider the time-dependent compressible Newtonian extrudate swell problem with slip at the wall. Steady-state solutions are unstable in regimes where the shear stress is a decreasing function of the velocity at the wall. Compressibility provides the means for the alternate storage and release of elastic energy, and, consequently, gives rise to periodic solutions. The added novelty in the present work is the assumption of periodic volumetric flow rate at the inlet of the die. This leads to more involved periodic responses and to free surface oscillations similar to those observed experimentally with the stick-slip instability. To numerically simulate the flow, we use finite elements in space and a fully-implicit scheme in time.","Compressible Newtonian flow; Extrudate swell; Slip; Time-dependent flow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009564544

The knowledge and understanding of the dynamics, together with the stability over time are essential for efficient use of SRFEL sources. This is illustrated with the Super-ACO FEL experiment, analyzed from growth from the positron bunch to laser saturation and induced positron beam modification.

By operation on rails at urban speeds, with brake energy recovery, energy losses and consumption are minimised. A further application of the system is in load matching in autonomous wind diesel systems, as a means of load levelling and absorbing fluctuations in wind power.

The user-oriented program, running under Windows® 3.1 or higher, was written with the Visual Basic® 3.0 Professional Edition. The transient recorder and the laser energy meter were controlled with a 16 bit General Purpose Interface Board (GPIB, IEEE 488.2) card purchased from National Instruments® (type: CCA, AT-GPIB/TNT).

An on-line automatic mass calibration procedure (AUTOFIT) was designed, which reduces mass deviations caused by instabilities of the instrument as high as 0.4 amu to less than ∼0.05amu. Furthermore, the program is able to send informational text to the transient recorder during analysis about the completion of mass calibration and storage routines. A Microsoft® Access 2.0 database is used to store the parameters and results of the AUTOFIT and spectra integration routines for each spectrum.

Net radiation and rate of thermal storage were measured with conventional net radiometers, soil heat flux discs and temperature-based storage models. The turbulent fluxes discussed in this report were obtained with an interchanging Bowen ratio energy budget system (BREB, at 14 m), two one-propeller eddy correlation systems (OPEC systems 1 and 2 at 17 m), a 1-dimensional sonic eddy correlation system (SEC system 3) at 15 m, all on one ""low"" tower, and a 3-dimensional sonic eddy correlation system (SEC system 22) at 22 m on the ""high"" tower that was about 46 m distant. All systems measured sensible and latent heat (H and LE) directly, except for OPEC systems 1 and 2 which estimated LE as a residual term in the surface energy balance. Closure of turbulent fluxes from the two SEC systems was around 80% for daytime and 30% for night, with closure of 1-dimensional SEC system 3 exceeding that of 3-dimensional SEC system 22. The night measurements of turbulent fluxes contained considerable uncertainty, especially with the BREB system where measured gradients often yielded erroneous fluxes due to problems inherent in the method (i.e., computational instability as Bowen's ratio approaches - 1). Also, both eddy correlation system designs (OPEC and SEC) appeared to underestimate |H| during stable conditions at night. In addition, both sonic systems (1- and 3-dimensional) underestimated |LE| during stable conditions. The underestimate of |H| at night generated residual estimates of OPEC LE containing a ""phantom dew"" error that erroneously decreased daily LE totals by about 10 percent. These special night problems are circumvented here by comparing results for daytime periods only, rather than for full days. To summarize, turbulent fluxes on the low tower from OPEC system 2 and the adjacent SEC system 3 were in reasonable agreement, while the BREB system appeared to overestimate H and underestimate LE; H and LE measured by SEC system 22 on the high tower were lower than from OPEC and SEC3 on the low tower. The turbulent flux measurements tended to converge, but the data exhibit unexplained differences between days, between systems, and between locations.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003317757

Composite samples, taken both before and after storage, were analyzed for dry matter content, nitrogenous, volatile and carbohydrate constituents, gross energy concentration, buffering capacity, pH and osmolality. There were no significant changes in the concentrations of dry matter or volatile constituents following storage. When expressed on a fresh basis, total and acid insoluble nitrogen concentrations, water soluble carbohydrate and gross energy concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) lower after storage, but in all cases the absolute differences in concentration were small. The significance of the change in total and acid insoluble nitrogen, and water soluble carbohydrate concentrations was increased (P < 0.01) when results were expressed on a dry matter basis. Gross energy and neutral detergent fibre concentrations showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05), and acid detergent fibre concentration a significant increase (P < 0.05) after storage, when results were expressed on a dry matter basis. The changes normally associated with aerobic deterioration, such as decreases in lactic and acetic acids, total alcohol, and soluble carbohydrate concentrations, and an increase in ammonia nitrogen level did not occur during the course of the study, neither was there any visual evidence of mould growth. These factors indicate that the methodology adopted for the preservation effectively maintained anaerobic conditions, and offers considerable potential for use in detailed feeding experiments.","Aerobic deterioration; Silage - general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002270095

The method involves dropping fruit from a geometrically increasing series of heights onto a flat steel surface using a pendulum, and counting the number of bruises observed with skin intact. The resulting number is termed the bruise factor, to distinguish it from other measurements of bruising. The bruise factor test requires a sample of 20 fruit and can be conducted in 30 min by an inexperienced operator. Experimental studies on bruising produced by a commercial grading machine on various apple cultivars in different states were conducted to compare relative bruising levels with those predicted from current laboratory methods. Data obtained using the bruise factor technique on Gala at 0·5°C and 20°C, and Braeburn, Fuji and Granny Smith apples at 20°C, followed similar trends to the number of bruises produced when fruit were run four times over a commercial grading machine. In particular, more small bruises were produced on Gala apples at low temperature than at high temperature. In comparison, measurements of bruise susceptibility determined by a ball dropping test and fruit firmness measured by penetrometer did not follow these trends. The size and location of bruises produced by the grader were also examined. The majority of impacts during grader tests occurred on the cheek area of the fruit. Bruise sizes were mostly small, resulting from low energy impacts, and the number of small bruises was affected by storage and temperature of testing, while the numbers of large bruises did not change with these factors. It was concluded that laboratory measurements involving high impact energy levels may be insensitive as indicators of bruising levels on fruit during commercial operations. It is argued that bruise area is a more appropriate measure of bruising than volume for commercial purposes in the fresh fruit industry. It is also suggested that bruise initiation and threshold visibility should be used as the basis for the assessment of bruising, rather than bruise areas or volumes generated by impacts at energies well above threshold levels. © 1996 Silsoe Research Institute.",,"Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002023473

The method was applied for the first time at the Experimental Storage Ring ESR at GSI observing electron cooled highly charged ions up to bare nuclei at relativistic energies around several hundred MeV/u. To demonstrate the performance and feasibility of the method at the ESR, experimental tests have been carried out using beams of nuclear fragments produced in the ring itself by the interaction of different primary beams with the internal gas jet target. Futhermore, first Schottky mass measurements of secondary nuclear beams produced by projectile fragmentation of Au and Bi primary beams in a thick Be-target were carried out in order to determine the masses for numerous heavy neutron deficient nuclei which had not been measured before. Relative accuracies for the measured mass values in the order of 1 × 10-6 and below can be achieved. The method is briefly discussed and some early results are presented. © J.C.

The enhanced delayed reemission is due to the release of the energy stored during the period of suppression.

During resonant excitation, the average ion kinetic energy increases when the ion secular frequency motion is in phase with the resonant excitation and decreases when the phases are opposed. The temporal variation of ion kinetic energy when subjected to resonant excitation exhibits two cyclical forms, one with low ion kinetic energy and one with relatively high ion kinetic energy. The low ion kinetic energy cyclical form is characterized by smoothly rounded profiles at time intervals of ca. 2 ms; the high ion kinetic energy cyclical form is characterized by sharply pointed crests at time intervals of ca. 1 ms. In the low ion kinetic energy cyclical form, the maximum instantaneous ion kinetic energy attained is ca. 16 eV and corresponds to axial excursions of up to 3 mm. In the high ion kinetic energy cyclical form, the maximum instantaneous ion kinetic energy attained increases in value to in excess of 70 eV, with an axial excursion of 6.2 mm, as the resonant excitation frequency is increased. At a critical frequency, ∈c, there is a discontinuous change from the high to the low ion kinetic energy cyclical form. The maximum instantaneous ion kinetic energy, KEmax, varies as a simple quadratic function of the axial excursion of the ion, so that ion kinetic energy is derived from the main storage field within the ion trap. The asymmetric form observed in the experimental resonance absorption curve, obtained as a function of resonant frequency, has been reproduced qualitatively and the asymmetry can be ascribed to the transition between the two cyclical forms of the temporal variation of ion kinetic energy.

This paper describes the basic heat transfer analysis and presents the characteristics of the charging and discharging modes determined from the model. The output results of the cooling charge model were the volume of ice in the TES tank and the cooling charge rate. Error analyses of the ice volume and cooling rate indicated that the model predictions were within 5 and 12%, respectively, of the experimental values. A factorial design sensitivity analysis was conducted to show that the variable Tf - Tmax and the interactions (Tf - Tmax) × ho, hi, × F, and hi × ho × F had significant effects on both the cooling charge rate and the ice radius. The output results of the cooling discharge model showed that the tank bulk water temperatures were within 5% of the experimental values. The sensitivity analysis showed that the variables ho and Tci, as well as the interactions ḿ × %ice × Tci and ḿ × ho × %ice, had significant effects on the bulk water temperature.

The spectral density is expressed as the solution of an integral equation in which the kernel is a renormalized one-sided energy correlation function of the full microcanonical density operator and a microcanonical density operator for a reference Hamiltonian. The integral operator associated with this equation transforms a known spectral density function for the reference Hamiltonian into the spectral density of the full Hamiltonian. The integral equation, by virtue of its formulation in energy space, is inherently one-dimensional and offers no storage difficulties, and the elements of its kernel may be computed by applying the Lanczos algorithm to randomly selected eigenfunctions of the reference Hamiltonian. This spectral density correlation method offers a number of advantages over variational methods. In particular, it has the potential for overcoming the hitherto largely insurmountable problem of tracing over a multidimensional Hubert space in order to compute the spectral density of a nonseparable molecular Hamiltonian. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001317335

In order to separate the effect of physiological changes from those associated with water loss, the cell turgor pressure of potato parenchyma was adjusted by hyper-and hypotonie solutions of mannitol. Tubers of the cv. Russet Burbank were stored for long (10 months) and short (1 month) periods. Slices and cylinders of parenchyma were obtained from the centres of the tubers along three axes; slices were also taken from the outer part of the tuber along two of the axes. Slices were subjected to small strain oscillatory shear at 0.02, 0.2 and 2 Hz and the storage and loss moduli (shear stiffnesses) obtained. Cylinders were compressed to 10.5% strain at 2 and 20 cm min-1 and initial and end moduli (longitudinal stiffnesses), and energy absorption terms obtained. Variability in measured mechanical properties was less when cells were fully turgid. Anisotropicity in shear stiffness was evident, although anisotropicity in longitudinal stiffness was dependent on turgor pressure. Shear stiffness was greater in outer parts of the tuber when slices were adjusted to common turgor pressures. Longitudinal stiffness was affected much more by osmotic adjustment than was shear stiffness. Although quantitatively different, hypotonic solutions caused the load-deformation curves of long term storage tubers to resemble those of short-term storage tubers. Similarly, hypertonic treatment brought about a load-deformation response in new tubers that made them appear as though they had been stored for ten months. The results indicate the importance of water content when analysing the mechanical properties of potato parenchyma.

Jet-cooled molecules are introduced as neutrals into the ion trap and ionized by multiphoton absorption. Varying the storage time causes a dramatic change in the ion intensities, depending on their m/z ratio. This observation cannot be explained by electronic synchronization effects, but is identified as secular motions of the stored ions. In this paper it is demonstrated that for a time span of up to several milliseconds the ions remain coherent in space and kinetic energy. The molecular ions as well as their fragment ions are not dispersed in the ion trap but move in close ion clouds describing Lissajous trajectories. Consequently, the distance between the middle of the ion trap and the ion cloud periodically changes, resulting in a storage time dependence on mass resolution, flight time and signal intensity. The influences of storage time and other trapping parameters as well as their effect on the interpretation of the results, which are obtained in investigations of time-resolved ion processes, will be discussed. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

A single set of parameters was found which quantitatively represents the dependence of the initial adsorption probability on incident energy and angle and accurately reproduces scattering distributions of ethane from Pt(111). The simulations suggest that, on average, rotational excitation serves as an effective temporary energy storage mechanism which facilitates trapping. Excess rotational excitation into cartwheel motion, however, can cause ethane to scatter by a chattering collision. At moderate translational energies trapping is determined primarily by energy transfer from translational energy to cartwheel rotation and surface phonons for molecules incident along the surface normal, whereas cartwheel rotation combined with parallel translational energy retention determine trapping at glancing angles of incidence. As the incident translational energy is increased, trapping becomes more dependent on the excitation of cartwheel rotational excitation at normal incidence. Finally, the trapping probability of ethane on Pt(111) was found to be determined to within 10% by the fate of the first bounce. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001005164

A model describing the transient behavior of a phase change energy storage unit is used. The model of the tank holds the numerical description of a short term (by day) heat-storage tank. In the tank, the energy is stored as the latent heat of the phase change material (PCM). In the tank, the PCM is packed in cylinders, and the heat transfer fluid (HTF) flows parallel to it. The basis of the model is the enthalpy method. The resulting set of equations is solved by means of the Gauss-Seidel iteration process. Selected computer simulations are drawn versus some parameters of the model, and the heat storage capacities of different PCMs, which can be used as heat storage materials for domestic heating by heat pumps, were determined and compared. Results show that the PCM, cylinder radius, the mass flow rate, and the inlet temperature of the HTF must be chosen carefully in order to optimize the performance of the tank.

One way of storing the reaction product CO2 gas is in the form of an other carbonate by letting it react with a metal oxide, such as MgO or ZnO. Two metal oxides, MgO and (CaMg)O2 were selected for CO2 storage, with the CaO-CO2 energy storage system as CaO-CO2-MgO and CaO-CO2-CaMgO2 systems, and studies on CaO-CO2, MgO-CO2 and CaMgO2-CO2 reactions over the temperature range 773-1073 K were carried out. As the CaO-CO2 system is used not only for storing the heat energy but is also expected to perform as a heat transformer, verification of the temperature upgrading ability is made by means of a lab-scale adiabatic reactor. Pseudo-steady state temperature and pressure existed during the experiments, which correspond quite well with Haul's equilibrium dissociation values of CaCO3, illustrating that upgraded temperatures of above 1273 K can be achieved by adjusting the carbonating CO2 gas pressure to around 500 kPa.","Calcium Oxide; Carbonation; Decarbonation; Dolomite; Magnesium Oxide; Temperature Upgrading; Thermal Energy Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000960657

In the absence of the electron beam, bare, and hydrogenlike Kr35+ and K36+ ions remain trapped due to externally applied magnetic and electric fields for at least 5 s; xenon ions with an open L shell, i.e., Xe45+-Xe52+, remain trapped at least as long as 20 s. The ion storage time in this ""magnetic trapping mode"" depends on the pressure of background atoms as well as on the value of the externally applied trapping potential, and even longer ion storage times appear possible. The magnetic trapping mode enables a variety of new opportunities for atomic physics research involving highly charged ions, which include the study of charge transfer reactions, Doppler-shift-free measurements of the Lamb shift, measurements of radiative lifetimes of long-lived metastable levels, or ion-ion collision studies, by x-ray or laser spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Because the trap is filled in situ during the electron trapping phase, transfer losses associated with filling the trap from an external source are avoided. We present spectra of the K-shell emission from heliumlike and hydrogenlike Kr34+ and Kr35+ as well as Xe52+ and Xe53+ that are produced by charge transfer reactions in collisions between ions and neutral atoms. Marked differences with K-shell spectra produced by electron-impact excitation are evident. We use the measurements to infer the Lamb shift contribution to the energy of the 1s1/2-2p3/2 transition in hydrogenlike Xe53+ and determine it to be 31 276(12) eV. The measurement technique can be applied to any ion produced in an EBIT so that Doppler-shift-free Lamb shift measurements of hydrogenlike U91+ are within reach.

For storing high temperature heat energy such as concentrated solar energy at 773 K, various candidate chemical reactions have been evaluated in terms of energy storage density, turning temperature, toxicity, corrosiveness, and other factors. The dissociation reaction of CaCO3 is found to be very promising. Three methods for storing the dissociation product CO2 gas; (i) storing as a compressed gas, (ii) letting the CO2 gas react with a metal oxide and storing it in the form of another carbonate, and (iii) adsorbing with an appropriate adsorbent and storing as an adsorbed gas; have been proposed and the respective thermal operating efficiencies at various upgraded temperatures are evaluated. The CaO-CO2-metal oxide system seems very effective for temperature upgrading around 1273 K and the CaO-CO2-compressor system seems suitable for storing and delivering heat energy at the same temperature.

The seasonal agreement is quite good, reflecting the improvements in land-surface parameterizations in recent years. Detailed studies, however, identify several places where still further improvements in model parameterizations are possible. Clear-sky shortwave absorption and cloudiness may be underestimated in this model as has been noticed in other global models. More frequent updates of the model cloud cover (currently every 3 h) would improve the land-surface interaction after the initial onset of precipitation. The model produces a realistic well-mixed boundary layer, but underestimates boundary layer deepening by entrainment. For much of the summer, precipitation is close to that observed; however, for a period in June and early July, the reanalysis model has excess precipitation, which comes from daytime interactions between the surface evaporation, boundary layer, and convection schemes. The model, which has a deep 2-m soil reservoir, has adequate soil moisture storage for several weeks without rain, although surface evaporative fraction fluctuates more strongly after rain than is observed. Surface evaporation is generally too high at night, especially in high winds.

Fourier transform NMR spectra of both liquid and solid samples can be measured, and spin-lattice relaxation times (T1Z) investigated over a broad range of magnetic field strengths ranging from 0 to 2 T. The instrument is based upon an existing personal computer-based NMR spectrometer [C. Job, R. M. Pearson, and M. F. Brown, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 65, 3354 (1994)] which has been expanded into a fully computer-controlled field-cycling instrument. The magnetic field cycling is accomplished electronically by utilizing fast switching thyristors and a storage capacitor based on the Redfield energy storage concept. Unique aspects of the design include the field-cycling magnet, which can reach fields as high as 2 T; the personal computer-based NMR spectrometer and associated waveform electronics; and the use of a commercially available pulse width modulation switching current amplifier, having low internal power dissipation and a fast current settling time.

It is involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH, sequestration of toxic ions and xenobiotics, regulation of cell turgor, storage of amino acids, sugars and CO2 in the form of malate, and possibly as a source for elevating cytoplasmic calcium. All these activities are driven by two primary active transport mechanisms present in the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast). These two mechanisms employ high-energy metabolites to pump protons into the vacuole, establishing a proton electrochemical potential that mediates the transport of a diverse range of solutes. Within the past few years, great advances at the molecular and functional levels have been made on the characterization and identification of these mechanisms. The aim of this review is to summarize these studies in the context of the physiology of the plant cell.","Channels; Cotransporters; V-ATPase; V-PPase; Vacuole","Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000677403

A simple conceptual model of the regulation is presented which permits the linking of rumen function and energy metabolism. It takes cognizance of upper physiological limits for (i) energy disposal, (ii) the clearance of digesta organic matter from the rumen, and (iii) muscular fatigue, as well as a range of dietary and environmental constraints. The transmission to the brain of signals relating to amount of digesta in the rumen and the ruminant's energy deficit are considered to be important in the intake regulation. An alternative conceptual model which recognises the amount of energy in the circulating energy pool, rather than the energy deficit, as the origin of signals relating to energy metabolism, is also discussed. It is considered that over a range of forage qualities neither the rumen digesta load ceiling nor the capacity to use energy limit intake; in this range both the resistance of the forage organic matter to removal from the rumen and the net energy value of the forage act as constraints. A method to calculate forage intake constraint is presented, and theoretical relationships between rumen digesta load, net energy intake, energy deficit and forage intake constraint have been formulated to facilitate interpretation of data obtained in forage intake studies. Forage intake in the reproduction cycle is discussed in the context of an optimum nutritional strategy for ensuring species survival. It is considered that the intake changes at mating and immediately prior to parturition, together with the decrease in rate of nutrient storage in maternal reserve tissues in late pregnancy and the use of these tissue stores in early lactation, are consistent with such a strategy. In this context it is suggested that (i) the relevant reproduction hormones affect intake via modulation of the metabolism of the maternal tissue stores and (ii) this type of regulation and its accompanying production losses need not be necessary in those production systems permitting some control of nutrition.","Energy deficit; Feed intake; Rumen load","Bovidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000668031

Three generation mechanisms are identified: bulk generation in the depletion regions of the pn junctions, surface generation at the periphery of the capacitors, and defect generation associated with imperfections in the material. All three generation mechanisms are thermally activated. Bulk generation and surface generation have activation energies of approximately half bandgap, while defect generation exhibits field-induced barrier lowering resulting in an apparent activation energy less than half bandgap. Because the generation rate is extremely low, most measurements are conducted at elevated temperatures (250-350°C).

This detector, installed in January 1995, complements a 1024×1024 CCD detector that has been in continuous operation at CHESS since December 1993. The new detector is based on a 4‐port, 2048×2048 pixel CCD that is directly coupled to a Gd2O2S:Tb phosphor by a 3:1 tapered fiber optic. The active area of the phosphor is a square 82 mm on an edge. The readout time is 7 seconds. In the standard mode of operation, the pixel size at the active area is 41 μm on the edge leading to the capability of resolving approximately 200 orders of diffraction across the detector face. The detector also operates in a 1024×1024 mode in which the pixel size is electronically increased by a factor of 4 in area resulting in smaller data files and faster detector readout but at the expense of spatial resolution. Most of the data that has been collected by this detector has been collected in this mode. Dozens of data sets have been collected by many experimenters using this detector at CHESS during the four month period from its installation until the start of the six‐month down period of the storage ring. The capabilities of the detector will be illustrated with results from various crystallographic measurements including experiments in which the recorded diffraction patterns extend in resolution as far as 1 Å. The results demonstrate that this detector is capable of collecting data of quality at least equal to that of imaging plates but, in many circumstances, with much greater beamline efficiency. © 1996, American Institute of Physics.

Methods employed to reduce the electron energy distribution and improve the accuracy of resonance energy measurements have yielded an energy resolution of 30 meV full width at half maximum at low energies, and an energy uncertainty better than 30 meV. The high energy resolution results from the use of an adiabatic expansion technique to reduce the transverse electron energy distribution. The improved accuracy in energy determinations is achieved through the inclusion of variations in the ion velocity, which occur during scans of the electron velocity, in the relative velocity transformations. Calculations of the resonance strengths and energies were made using two different methods, multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock and multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli approximations.

The shear and compressive stiffnesses of different regions of potato parenchyma were measured to more fully characterize the mechanical properties of this important storage organ. Measurements were performed on tubers that had been stored for 1 and 10 months. Slices and cylinders of parenchyma were excised from the centre of the tubers in three directions (and slices from the outer portion in two directions). Slices were subjected to small-strain oscillatory shear at frequencies of 0.02, 0.2, and 2 Hz. Cylinders were subjected to three cycles of uniaxial compression at 2 and 20 cm ·min-1. The coefficient of variation of measured parameters ranged on average from 16 to 44% for both crops and both tests. At small strains, potato parenchyma behaved essentially as an elastic material. The results from both small-strain oscillatory shear and uniaxial compression suggested that potato parenchyma is anisotropic in nature. Slices from the outer and inner regions of the tuber had different shear stiffness values. The shear stiffness of tubers stored for 1 month was approximately 70% greater than those stored for 10 months.

To achieve polarized proton beams in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC, 250 GeV), the Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA, 820 GeV), and Fermilab’s TeV accelerator (TEVATRON, 900 GeV), ideas and techniques applicable to accelerator physics are needed. In this publication we will stress an important aspect of very high energy polarized proton beams, namely, the fact that the equilibrium polarization direction can vary substantially across the beam in the interaction region of a high energy experiment when no countermeasure is taken. Such a divergence of the polarization direction would not only diminish the average polarization available to the particle physics experiment, but it would also make the polarization involved in each collision analyzed in a detector strongly dependent on the phase space position of the interacting particle. In order to analyze and compensate for this effect, methods for computing the equilibrium polarization direction are needed. In this paper we introduce the method of stroboscopic averaging, which computes this direction in a very efficient way. Since only tracking data are needed, our method can be implemented easily in existing spin tracking programs. Several examples demonstrate the importance of the spin divergence and the applicability of stroboscopic averaging. © 1996 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000338094

The combination of the localization and pseudospectral approximations attacks both the problems of two-electron integral storage on disk and CI vector storage in memory that, respectively, hinder nondirect local spectral and nonlocal pseudospectral SDCI calculations individually and provides a scaling advantage over even direct local spectral SDCI calculations. The reproduction of total energies to within a kcal/mol leads to speed increases with respect to nonlocal calculations that grow larger with increasing molecular size: little or no savings for ethane and a factor of 1.1-1.6 for larger molecules studied (glyoxal, glycine, C6H2, and C8H2). The prediction of conformational energy differences with the new method appears quite promising, since energy difference predictions accurate to within a kcal/mol of the exact energy differences are obtained even when the single-point total energies are individually many kcal/mol in error. The speed increases for energy difference predictions of both local spectral and pseudospectral SDCI also grow with molecular size: from a factor of 4 in ethane and glyoxal to a factor of 6 in glycine. Additionally, when compared to the exact spectral result, the fastest local pseudospectral prediction of the conformational energy difference in glyoxal is in error by 0.2 kcal/mol and saves a factor of 10 in CPU time, indicating the prospects of combining local correlation and pseudospectral methods. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000282383

Those interested in documenting this negative relationship often assume that a fixed pool of resources in excess of those needed for maintenance are divided up among growth, storage and reproduction, and thus increased investment in one of these ""surplus"" compartments reduces the potential for investment in the other two compartments. However, in a series of experiments I document a negative relationship between investment in reproduction and the amount of food consumed caused by a volumetric constraint of the body cavity. This negative relationship indicates that reproductive investment actually reduces the total pool of resources available to reproductive individuals. Considering this volumetric constraint may prove important to those interested in documenting trade-offs in life history traits, in that negative correlations between reproduction and growth or fat storage can be the indirect result of reduced overall energy budgets rather than the direct result of partitioning a fixed energy pool.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000232413

It was found that hydrogen atom made a stronger chemical bond with Ni atoms than with La atoms in pure LaNi5. The bond strengths between hydrogen and Ni (or La) atoms were scarcely influenced by alloying, despite the fact that hydriding and dehydriding characteristics are greatly modified by the addition of alloying elements. On the contrary, both the Ni-Ni and the La-Ni atomic interactions were greatly affected by alloying. It was shown that the ratio of the La-Ni bond order to the Ni-Ni bond order correlated well with experimental data of dissociation pressures. This correlation was also found in other compounds, YNi5 and CaNi5.

Adipocytes are now known to produce many proteins that have systemic effects. Many of these proteins, including leptin, tumor necrosis factor α, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, angiotensin II, and acylation-stimulating protein are dysregulated in obesity. Additionally, the role of adrenoceptors in human adipocyte biology and the pathophysiology of obesity is being expanded, and a possible role of cholinoreceptors has recently been discovered. Overall, adipose tissue is proving to be a complex and regulated organ with both regional and systemic effects on metabolism.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000050753
