Some aspects of solar energy storage in active and passive heating and cooling systems are presented. The focus is put on utilization of Phase Change Materials in passive solar heating/cooling systems. Building integrated PCMs are under consideration in a project developed at the Institute of Heat Engineering of Warsaw University of Technology. Apart from experimental studies also the mathematical modelling of the dynamics of buildings and building elements with PCMs incorporated has been developed. On the basis of simulation studies, recommendations for application of PCMs to be incorporated in the building structure have been formulated. It can be concluded that in high latitude countries there is always a need to use thermal insulation of opaque elements in the building envelope and PCM can be integrated with the construction material.

The mean annual average of total solar radiation varies from about 3.5 k\Whm-2day-1 in the coastal latitudes to about 7 kWlmr-2day-1 along the semi arid areas in the far North. On the average, the country receives solar radiation at the level of about 19.8 MJm -2 day-1. The daily sunshine hours has an annual average of 4 to 9 hours per day. increasing from south to north. Given an average solar radiation level of about 5.5 kWhm-2day-1, and the prevailing efficiencies of commercial solar-electric generators, then if solar collectors or modules were used to cover 1% of Nigeria's land area (an area of 923,773km2), it is possible to generate 1850x103 GWh of solar electricity per year. This is more than one hundred times the current grid electricity consumption level in the country. Solar energy has always been used in its natural form for drying through the open-to-sun method. Due to technological constraints, electricity generation from the sun using photovoltaic technologies started about two decades ago. The activities of the energy research centres and other tertiary institutions in the country have led to the development of a number of solar-thennal, biomass and biogas devices and improved wood-burning stoves. Pilot and demonstration projects 011 solar pliotovoltaics have been carried out by relevant government agencies like the Energy Commission of Nigeria. Other government and international agencies have established thousands of solar-PV plants, mostly for rural water supply, refrigeration and drug storage in rural clinics and for powering telecommunication repeaters and radio communication equipment. Solar PV is the fast growing renewable energy into the nation's energy supply mix. About 15MW of dispersed isolated stand alone systems have been installed hi the country. However. 110 solar system either Solar PV or Solar thermal system is yet to be connected to the grid despite the huge solar energy resource in the country.

The collector is made by Nep Solar from Australia. It has an aperture area of 14.4 m2, a concentration ratio of 13.7 and can be operated up to 200°C. The collector aperture is 1208 mm and the receiver pipe is stainless steel 304 L with a diameter of 28mm, coated with selective coating having an absorptance of 0.93 and an emitance of 0.18. The collector is orientated with its axis in the East-West direction. The advantages of this tracking mode are that very little collector adjustment is required during the day and the full aperture always faces the sun at noon. A dedicated computer-operated tracking system is responsible for keeping the collector focused at all times. The collector is connected to a hot water storage tank which has a capacity of 300 liters. The collector fluid used in the tests is water, which is pressurized to avoid boiling in the receiver.

In order to meet this growing challenge, this paper propose an adaptive building envelope system that can optimize its configuration by responding to environmental changes that could achieve new levels of sustainable performance and energy efficiency. Most of the current adaptive building envelope uses kinetic techniques in order to make its formation transformable. However, with the use of kinetic components such as a large amount of interactive motorized system that require electrical power may also cause further decrease the building energy efficiency. This paper proposes a camshaft mechanism system for adaptive building envelope that uses less motors, controllers, and sensors. This system uses pre-programmed analysis data of daily solar radiation changes to parametrically drive the number of rotation phase and length of nose (Lobe Lift) that generates the shape of camshaft. This camshaft then controls the changing opening and closing values of the building envelope components. The advantages of this system are less energy consumption, less maintenance and lower cost since it uses less motors, controllers and wiring. In conclusion, this paper has developed a prototypical tool that facilitates the new approach to energy efficient kinetic buildings. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Adaptive building envelope; Camshaft mechanism; Energy efficiency; Kinetic building","Building energy efficiency; Building envelopes; Electrical power; Energy efficient; Environmental change; Radiation change; Rotation phase; Sustainable building; Sustainable performance; System use; Aerospace engineering; Camshafts; Climate change; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Kinetics; Solar buildings; Sun; Sustainable development; Adaptive control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871554288

The use of complex substrates has however profound implications in the PHA metabolism. In this paper we investigate PHA accumulation using a lumped metabolic model that describes PHA storage from arbitrary mixtures of volatile fatty acids (VFA). Experiments were conducted using synthetic and complex VFA mixtures obtained from the fermentation of sugar cane molasses. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and flux balance analysis (FBA) were performed at different stages of culture enrichment in order to investigate the effect of VFA composition and time of enrichment in PHA storage efficiency. Substrate uptake and PHA storage fluxes increased over enrichment time by 70% and 73%, respectively. MFA calculations show that higher PHA storage fluxes are associated to an increase in the uptake of VFA with even number of carbon atoms and a more effective synthesis of hydroxyvalerate (HV) precursors from VFA with odd number of carbons. Furthermore, FBA shows that the key metabolic objective of a MMC subjected to the feast and famine regimen is the minimization of the tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes. The PHA flux and biopolymer composition (hydroxybutyrate (HB): HV) could be accurately predicted in several independent experiments. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Fermented feedstock; Metabolic modelling; Mixed microbial cultures; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Volatile fatty acids","Food supply; Industrial wastes; Metabolism; Mixtures; Molasses; Substrates; Sugar cane; Agro-industrial wastes; Flux balance analysis; Metabolic flux analysis; Metabolic modelling; Mixed microbial culture; Number of carbon atoms; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Tricarboxylic acid cycle; Volatile fatty acids; acetic acid; butyric acid; carbon; carbon dioxide; molasses; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; propionic acid; valeric acid; volatile fatty acid; molasses; Article; Azoarcus; bacterium culture; calculation; carbon source; catabolism; chemical composition; citric acid cycle; energy balance; fermentation; metabolic flux analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; steady state; sugarcane; synthesis; Thauera; article; biological model; bioreactor; biotechnology; kinetics; metabolism; methodology; microbiology; sugarcane; systems biology; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Fermentation; Kinetics; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Biological; Molasses; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Saccharum; Systems Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868464488

The basic concept is to take advantage of the energy generated during the braking process of trains, which is otherwise wasted and transformed into heat. A power system simulation was created as a tool to analyze the behavior of a stationary ultracapacitor bank connected to the Metro system. Ultracapacitor modules were dimensioned adequately, power electronic elements were adjusted and further a control system was established. Amongst others the simulation demonstrates the impact of varying the distance between ultracapacitors and traction power substation. Furthermore the dependency of the ultracapacitor's technical specifications on charging and discharging behavior is shown. The simulation allows a large number of parameters to be modified through the easy-to-handle user interface.

The essence is always the same: it is really a grid that permits network operators to maximise their assets with real-time Information, which allows them to react to changing demand and fluctuating generation patterns, as well as avoid power disruption caused by failures in part of the system.

An OLED device is typically formed in a sheet with emissive organic layer(s) located between a cathode and anode and deposited on a substrate. The substrate can be rigid such as glass or metal or flexible using a polymer plastic. The number of emissive layers depends on the desired light output of the device. OLED technology has great potential for new uses such flexible paper-thin OLED panels, transparent OLED panels and white OLED. White OLED was developed as device with extremely high power efficiency and long lifetime. The performance achieved was 64lm/W, and 10.000 hours of lifetime at initial luminance of 1000cd/m2 with light out-coupling technique. New technologies, such as sophisticated organic layer structure, were applied to the device. The device also exhibited good durability such as storage stability, which is important performance in practical use. We hope that this paper will show possibilities to practical use of OLED in different types of displays, lighting sources for illumination use, back light and others. From a recent environmental problem and energy supply circumstances, light sources of low energy consumption and eco-friendly are demanded. An enormous amount of research effort goes into the field. Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is regarded as a powerful candidate because it is an area light source, can be driven at low voltage, and does not include a material which is harmful to the human body and environment like mercury. As a light source for illumination or backlight, a white light is usually required. To realize a white OLED device, plural light emissive materials such as blue, green, red are used generally. © 2012 ELMAR (Electronics in Marines).","flexible paper-thin OLED; Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED); transparent OLED; white OLED","Cathode and anode; Eco-friendly; Emissive layers; Emissive materials; Energy supplies; Environmental problems; flexible paper-thin OLED; Good durability; Human bodies; Light output; Long lifetime; Low energy consumption; Low voltages; OLED technology; Organic layers; Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs); Plural lights; Power efficiency; Research efforts; Solid state lighting; Storage stability; transparent OLED; White light; White OLED; Energy utilization; Light sources; Mercury (metal); Organic light emitting diodes (OLED)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871093489

However, this results in large fluctuations in output power, and the resulting peak to average power ratio exceeds most other energy producers. Moreover, the typical average power production from a WEC is lower than that of other power plants, and array connection of several WECs is necessary to help mitigate these shortcomings. Earlier studies performed on arrays by Fred. Olsen (FO) has shown a favorable outcome, and has demonstrated a reduction factor of four in the peak to average ratio for a small array. These results were obtained without further power conditioning and resulted in poor utilization of installed capacity. In an endeavor to fully optimize the WEC system for grid connection, this study investigates three possibilities for power quality improvements: Introduction of energy storage, implementation of controlled power capping and implementation of reactive power compensation. By simulation of annual production for a specific production site, the resulting power quality improvements are estimated, and demonstrates that the WEC system can obtain a power quality level close to wind power. Reactive power compensation demonstrate the ability to increase the power quality and to improve the local power balance by optimizing the grid utilization during no production periods. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Annual production; Average power; Energy producers; Fred.

The addition of AN to the EMImBF4 has strong influence on the bulk viscosity, conductivity and melting temperature of EMImBF4, when more than 1.6 wt% of AN is added.

More pronounced distortion effects and deviations from ideal capacitive behavior have been observed at higher applied potentials (3.2 V) when the addition of AN in the electrolyte of EDLC is higher than 3.3 wt%.

The main developed technology is based on charging an electrical double-layer (EDL) at the electrode-electrolyte interface of high surface area carbons. The main disadvantages of the latter are a relatively low energy density and safety issues related to the use of organic electrolytes. This paper describes alternative solutions where pseudocapacitive contributions play together with the EDL capacitance in a protic aqueous electrolyte, giving rise to a possible enhancement of energy density. It first reviews traditional solutions by using materials that are able to undergo fast faradic redox reactions, e.g. oxides and electrically conducting polymers (ECPs). Since the surface of materials essentially plays in this case, the realized capacitance values are much lower than theoretically expected; additionally the working voltage is generally lower than 1 V and the stability of some of these materials, e.g. ECPs, is relatively low. The realization of composites with carbon nanotubes which play as three-dimensional conductive supports contributes to the enhancement of performance of oxides and ECPs. A new source of pseudocapacitance involving a redox electrolyte is demonstrated by high surface area carbons. The latter is based on the interface formed by species with a large variety of oxidation states, e.g. iodine, bromine and vanadium, and gives rise to capacitance values as high as 250 F g -1 at 1 A g-1 for 1 mol L-1 KI aqueous solution. The last pseudocapacitive phenomenon involves electrochemical hydrogen storage in the negative electrode of carbon-carbon capacitors in neutral aqueous electrolytes, e.g. alkali sulphates. The voltage (and consequently the energy density) is considerably enhanced by comparison with systems in basic or acidic electrolytes owing to an important overpotential for di-hydrogen evolution at the negative electrode; besides a pseudocapacitive contribution related to hydrogen storage appears at the highest voltage values. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",,"Acidic electrolytes; Aqueous electrolyte; Capacitance values; Carbon-based; Electrical double-layer; Electrically conducting polymer; Electricity storage systems; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical hydrogen storage; Electrode-electrolyte interfaces; Energy density; Energy enhancement; High surface area; High-power pulse; Negative electrode; New sources; Organic electrolyte; Overpotential; Oxidation state; Pseudocapacitance; Pseudocapacitive; Redox electrolytes; Safety issues; Short periods; Sulphates; Working voltage; Bromine; Conducting polymers; Electric energy storage; Electrolytes; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Interface states; Iodine; Potassium iodide; Redox reactions; Surfaces; Vanadium; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873110498

This paper proposes a novel magnetic gearbox configuration in which a conventional planetary magnetic gearbox is equipped with n-phase coils fitted around the ferromagnetic pole-pieces to extract output electrical power. The turbine mechanical power is thus divided into mechanical power to drive the electrical generator and extra electrical power that can be diverted into a storage system to perform the power leveling function.

The battery converter is controlled with variable-frequency, variable-amplitude sinusoidal PWM modulation. The system frequency is determined by the state of charge (SOC) of the battery while the voltage at the main bus is held constant. The PV inverter is controlled as a current source following a reference active and reactive power with the active power being a function of the system frequency. The induction machine of the wind generator (WG) is directly connected to the grid. Detailed simulation shows that with this type of control the grid voltage and frequency remain within the limits specified by the EN 50160 standard even under large variations in active and reactive power caused by the wind generator, the PV or the load. It is further shown that, by changing the operation mode of the battery converter to current-controlled, the system can provide, in case of faults, adequate current for the protective devices to operate. Since the frequency is used as control signal, a wireless communication among the renewable energy sources is achieved while the battery SOC and thus its state-of-health is continuously monitored. © 2012 IEEE.","harmonic distortion; Micro grid; power quality; PV inverter; renewable energy sources; stand-alone converters; wind generator","Active power; Battery converters; Battery SOC; Battery storage system; Control signal; Current sources; EN 50160; Grid voltage; Induction machines; Micro grid; Operation mode; Photovoltaics; Protective devices; PV inverter; Renewable energy source; State of charge; State of health; Storage battery; System frequency; Wind generator systems; Wireless communications; Electric batteries; Electric machinery; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Harmonic distortion; Lead acid batteries; Natural resources; Power quality; Reactive power; Wind turbines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870835845

The generator is directly coupled to a wind turbine, its output rectified and boosted to a desired DC voltage level, which supplies a DC-load directly. A bidirectional DC-DC converter links the DC-bus with a brushless DC (BLDC) motor, which finally turns a flywheel.

Our framework, is founded on an in-situ data storage model, where captured objects remain local on their owners smartphones and searches then take place over a novel lookup structure we compute dynamically. Initially, a query user invokes a search to find an object of interest. Our structure concurrently optimizes several conflicting objectives (i.e., it minimizes energy consumption, minimizes search delay and maximizes query recall), using a Multi-Objective Optimization approach and calculates a diverse set of high quality non-dominated Query Routing Trees (QRTs), in a single run. The optimal set is then forwarded to the query user (decision maker) to select a particular QRT to be searched based on instant requirements and preferences. To demonstrate the capabilities of SmartP2P during the conference, we will utilize our cloud of smartphone devices, i.e. the SmartLab testbed composed of 40+ Android smartphones and tablets, as well as mobility and social patterns derived by Microsofts Geolife project, DBLP and Pics n Trails. We will allow the attendees to use a real SmartLab Android device to query our local Smartphone Network using any of the four algorithmic choices provided by the SmartP2P framework. The query device will then be provided with the optimal QRTs and the attendees will be able to visually decide the optimal QRT to be searched.

This will extend the concept of controllable loads to include thermal storage, and in particular, the use of ice batteries to replace standard forms of air-conditioning (AC). The analysis is done by simulation in Matpower ([1]) for a Multi-period, stochastic, security constrained AC optimal power flow. This is a continuation of work in stochastic AC-OPF modeling ([2]). A set of constraints reflecting specific ramping costs for all generation is included. The expected amount of Load Not Served (LNS) is also endogenously solved. Wind is modeled as the RES, with a characterization similar to historical data from New York and New England. The network model is a reduction of the Northeastern Power Coordinating Council (NPCC, [3]), modified to focus on New York and New England. Since the adoption of renewables leads to higher cost of capacity for conventional generation, new investments need to be made to be able to manage the load in more economical ways. A load-following ramping reserve product is proposed as an example of a mechanism for participants to signal their technical characteristics and constraints.

This paper proposes a short-term Energy Resource Management (ERM) methodology performed in two phases. The first one addresses the hour-ahead ERM scheduling and the second one deals with the five-minute ahead ERM scheduling. Both phases consider the day-ahead resource scheduling solution. The ERM scheduling is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize the operation costs from the point of view of a virtual power player that manages the network and the existing resources. The optimization problem is solved by a deterministic mixed-integer non-linear programming approach and by a heuristic approach based on genetic algorithms.

While, it is economical to compensate wind with a conventional synchronous generator, the slow behavior of such a system may result in some stability concerns. Here, virtual inertia method, which imitates the kinetic inertia of synchronous generator, is used to improve the dynamic behavior of the system. In order to prevent any additional cost of inverter or energy storage device, the proposed control is implemented in the grid side converter of the back-to-back inverter connected to the DFIG rotor. The rotor side converter of this inverter is used to extract the maximum available power of wind. The concept and the proposed control method are discussed in details. Several case studies are used to show that this control algorithm can improve the dynamic performance of systems in case of disturbances such as islanding.

The maximum output power of a photovoltaic panel depends on atmospheric conditions, such as (direct solar radiation, air pollution and cloud movements), load profile and the tilt and orientation angles. This paper describes an experimental analysis of maximizing output power of a photovoltaic panel, based on the use of existing equations of tilt and orientation angles derived from mathematical models and simulation packages. Power regulation is achieved by the use of a DC-DC converter, a fixed load resistance and a single photovoltaic panel. A data logger is used to make repeated measurements which ensure reliability of the results. The results of the paper were taken over a four month period from April through July. The photovoltaic panel was set to an orientation angle of 0 degrees with tilt angles of 16 degrees, 26 degrees and 36 degrees.

The goal of the work is to provide decision makers with a tool that would allow the safety of the NNP environmental requirements within the reservoir management policy to be included. An important issue is the competition between many water-dependent systems and agents, e.g., agriculture, energy, wetlands, for limited water resources. The proposed system allows a trade-off between different reservoir users to be found, including protected wetland ecosystems of the Narew Nation Park.

In this case it is not necessary to give a unique material number to each burn up cell. Cells having similar burn up and power, achieved during similar irradiation history at same initial fuel composition, will experience similar composition evolution and can therefore be given the same material number.

Incretins are a significant component of the complex homeostatic network regulating the metabolic state in humans. This narrative review will focus on the basic concepts regarding incretins physiology and their regulatory feedback mechanisms affecting energy homeostasis. In this context, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) promotes satiety and weight loss through centrally and peripherally mediated pathways. On the other hand, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is implicated in energy storage by its actions on adipose tissue. Understanding this biological model requires a holistic approach, since it is dually manifested by promoting weight reduction, in the case of GLP-1, or favoring lipid accumulation, in the case of GIP. The complete spectrum of incretin actions related to energy homeostasis is yet to be fully elucidated. Currently, new drugs based on incretin physiology are available for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas the implication of similar drugs in the treatment of obesity is under investigation.

Due to ever-increasing energy consumption, rising public awareness of environmental protection, and steady progress in power deregulation, alternative (i.e., renewable and fuel cell based) distributed generation systems have attracted increased interest. There is an accelerating world demand for environmentally friendly power. Among the renewable energy sources, the Photovoltaic (PV) energy is the most promising candidate for research and development for large scale users. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898117574

Starch and non-starch polysaccharides (dietary fiber) are the major carbohydrate constituents. Starch is a polymeric mixture of essentially linear (amylose) and branched (amylopectin) a-glucans. Starch owes much of its functionality and physical organization into a granular structure to these macromolecules. In Mexico, and gradually in other countries like the United States, consumption of maize tortillas becomes common. The process to convert maize into tortillas, called nixtamalization, starts when the grain is cooked in lime [Ca(OH)2] to produce nixtamal. The moist nixtamal is stone-ground into a dough (masa), that is further shaped into disks and baked on a hot griddle or gas-fired oven to produce tortillas. Tortillas can be produce from fresh masa using traditional nixtamal, or instant corn flour, which is dehydrated masa. During maize tortillas production, many changes occur, especially in starch, and the changes that this polymer suffers during processing are responsible for the textural and sensorial properties of masa and tortillas. The masa obtained from the nixtamalization process is a network of disperse and soluble starch polymers; starch granules, partially gelatinized in a continuous water phase, supported by free starch granules, other pieces of endosperm and lipids. The reassociation of the starch granules can also significantly affect the rheological properties of products made from masa. On the other hand, reassociation of the starch molecules may occur on cooling. Retrogradation, the ability of starch chains to form ordered structures in pastes, gels, and baked foods during storage, greatly influences the texture and shelf life of these products. In starch-rich products, amylose retrogradation is a rapid process taking only a few hours. Cereal-based foods such a tortillas can contain appreciable amounts of resistant starch (RS) which survives prolonged incubation with amylolitic enzymes. The occurrence of RS has important implications for human bowel physiology. Diets rich in RS produce a larger faecal mass with lower pH and increase daily butyrate production. The presence of fermentable substrates helped in preventing inflammatory intestinal diseases. The study of the reactions leading to the staling of stored tortillas has considerable technological, commercial and health implications, because different physicochemical and structural changes in RS formed during nixtamalization, tortillas elaboration and storage happen. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This effect may be utilized in thermal energy storage and passive thermal management. In order to enhance the rate of heat transfer into PCMs, various techniques have been suggested, like fins, metal and graphite-compound matrices, dispersed high-conductivity particles inside the PCM, and micro-encapsulation. The present work deals with a hybrid PCM-air heat sink. The heat is dissipated on the heat sink base, and may be either absorbed by the PCM stored in compartments with conducting walls, or dissipated to the air using fins, or both. The heat sink is made of aluminum 6061. Eicosane (C20H42, 96% purity, nominal melting temperature 36.7°C) is used as the PCM. In order to exclude the effect of sensible heating below the melting temperature, a controllable environment is used. The latter is created in a programmable forced-circulation oven. A simplified thermal model is developed for a conservative estimation of temperature growth of the heat sink base. The results of this model are compared to the experimental results. The relative contributions of heat accumulation, both by latent and sensible heat, and of heat removal by air are presented and discussed.

This has increased research on new energy technologies to produce clean fuels. One of them is the use of biomass as feedstock in gasification processes. The rice agriculture industry around the world produces a great amount of rice husk wastes (RHW) which show the potential for water, soil, and air pollution (including global warming by way of potent greenhouse emissions such as CH4) since waste handling system and structures for storage and treatment frequently are not appropriate. However, the concentration of the rice husk in industrial units makes this low Btu feedstock a viable source for locally based thermal gasification. The current paper presents results on both HRW adiabatic gasification modeling using air-steam blends for partial oxidation and pyrolysis kinetic model to determine, by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the RHW activation energy (E). The Chemical Equilibrium with Applications program (CEA), developed by NASA, was used to estimate the effect of both the equivalence ratio (ER) and the steam to fuel ratio (S:F) on adiabatic temperature, gas quality (gas composition and energy density), and energy recovery of an unlimited number of species (∼150). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using N2 as carrier gas and under different heating rates (β: 10, 20, 40, and 50 °C/min). Furthermore, the activation energy (E) was estimated based in the results from TGA and using the isoconversional method (i.e., free-model). In general, for the range of parameters studied (0.2 &lt; S:F &lt; 0.8 and 1.5 &lt; Φ &lt; 6), the results from equilibrium adiabatic modeling (CEA) showed that increased ER and (S:F) ratios increase the production of H2 and CO2 but decrease the production of CO. Equilibrium temperature decreases with increased ER until ER = 3.0 whereas at ER &gt; 3.0, the effect of ER on equilibrium temperature is negligible. Also, the activation energy average value, estimated from the kinetics model, results to be 233 kJ/kmol.

Although potato might be stored for longer time compared to other crops, tubers are often affected by some physiological and diseases disorders due often to poor handling and storage and losses are reported to vary between 40-50 per cent. These postharvest losses could be qualitative and quantitative losses. Beside sprouting which is the main important disorder affecting potato during storage, other physiological caused by environmental conditions could affect tubers and these are caused by exposure to (i) extreme temperatures before and during storage, overheating of tubers due to direct exposure to sunlight or non-refrigerated storage, and (ii) rough handling of tubers during harvesting. The pathological disorders might be cause by attacks of pathogens and insects and the diseases would be aggravated by poor or inappropriate handling and storage practices.

Potato tubers are underground sinks originated from stolons in a process that requires the cessation of apex growth, the swelling of the stolon by subapical radial growth, and enlargement of the body. Potato plants produce tubers as a result of the changing balance of endogenous growth regulators, which is brought about by the plant's ability to perceive changes in the environment. An important aspect of tuber induction is that the stimulus is received on the leaves and is graft-transmissible. Environmental and hormonal signals, such as those mediated by light and gibberellins, are integrated in the leaves and a mobile signal is exported to the underground stolons to initiate tuber formation. This process is accompanied by the accumulation of starch and storage proteins. Tuberization allows the plant to reproduce in a vegetative way and determines that it can be considered a potential perennial plant. With the onset of sprouting, the tuber turns into a source organ; the reducing sugars increase as starch is hydrolyzed, providing carbon and energy for growth of the developing sprout. Tuber development and sprouting require coordinated transcriptional and metabolic changes as well as major changes in gene expression patterns. Signalling cascades are involved in sensing and transducing the environmental and hormonal stimuli that modulate both developmental processes. In this chapter we will review the different external and endogenous factors that regulate both processes and the signal transduction cascades associated to them. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Over a 15-year period, the RFS seeks to establish a market for biofuels in the transportation sector by requiring that increasing amounts of biofuels-36 billion gallons by 2022-be blended into transportation fuel. The mandate is to be accomplished with an assortment of advanced biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels-fuels produced from cellulosic materials including grasses, trees, and agricultural and municipal wastes-which will ramp up over time to comprise some 44% of the RFS in 2022. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to lower the cellulosic biofuel standard if the projected volume of cellulosic biofuel production is less than the volume specified in the statute. The cellulosic biofuel allotment in the mandate, as established by Congress in EISA, was 100 million gallons due in 2010, 250 million gallons in 2011, and 500 million gallons in 2012, increasing to 16 billion gallons by 2022. However, analysis suggested the United States did not have sufficient cellulosic biofuel production capacity to meet the RFS mandate for 2010, 2011, and 2012. As a result, EPA lowered the RFS cellulosic biofuel mandate (actual volume) to 5 million gallons in 2010, 6.6 million gallons in 2011, and 8.65 million gallons in 2012. The cellulosic biofuel community may fare better at achieving the lower mandates set and proposed by EPA if certain obstacles are overcome. Roadblocks include unknown levels of feedstock supply, expensive conversion technology that has not yet been applied commercially, and insufficient financial support from private investors.EPA reports that very few, if any, facilities are consistently producing cellulosic biofuel for commercial sale. Some financial support from the Departments of Energy and Agriculture is available to expedite cellulosic biofuel production. For example, the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP), created under the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 farm bill; P.L. 110-246), is designed to support establishment and production of crops for conversion to bioenergy in selected areas, and to assist agricultural and forest land owners and operators with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility. Also, the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program, created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05, P.L. 109-58), distributes loan guarantees to eligible commercial-scale renewable energy systems, including cellulosic biofuel plants, although criticisms have been raised that the program has been slow to get started.Many questions regarding cellulosic biofuels and the RFS may arise as the 112th Congress engages in energy legislation debates. EPA compliance data indicate that there was no commercial production of cellulosic biofuel under the RFS for 2010. Results for 2011 are still unclear. Can and will the 2012 and future RFS mandates for cellulosic biofuels be met? What impact will the continued lowering of the cellulosic ethanol mandate have on investment in cellulosic ethanol production? Should the 112th Congress continue to provide support for U.S. cellulosic biofuel production, and if so, how? This report, in a question and answer format, discusses some of the concerns facing the cellulosic biofuel community, including feedstock supply estimates, and potential legislative options to address cellulosic biofuel production uncertainty for the RFS. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Its environmental distribution depends on natural occurrence and has been influenced by human activities such as energy production, coal and phosphate fertilizer exploration which may impact freshwater ecosystems. In terms of radiological exposition, focusing chemical toxicity, uranium that is ingested or inhaled in sufficient amounts can be harmful. Radiological hazards associated with uranium isotopes are usually less severe than those of plutonium. The industrial activities involved in the nuclear fuel cycle should be considered including the uranium ore mining, milling, refining, conversion, fuel production, nuclear power generation, and nuclear waste management that is subjected to licensing and control processes. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the waste generated by these activities require appropriate procedures for its treatment, before disposing them in the environment. The use of nuclear fuels based on uranium is closely related to energy production by nuclear power plants, design and production of atomic weapons. Uranium-238 and uranium-235 are the two most abundant isotopes with half-lives respectively with order of magnitude of couple of billion and hundreds of million years. Thus, the different uranium salts used in fuel cycle production represent a permanent risk of environmental exposure as nuclear accidents can spread them out of the nuclear facilities and, depending on the accident, these salts can be chemically dispersed as they dissolve in water sources. When the uranium chemical species are subjected to extremely high temperatures of fire they can merge to form a residue with only a part of it oxidizing providing airborne contamination risk. The fissile nuclide uranium-235 has been used as nuclear fuel due to the fact that nuclear fission reactions take place when slowed thermal neutrons hit 235U nucleus releasing two lighter nuclides, three free neutrons and a tremendous amount of energy. However, in terms of weight, the naturally occurring uranium isotopes has respectively 99.284% of 238U, 0.711 % of 235U and traces of 234U requiring physicochemical separation process that is able to increase the content of 235U. Natural uranium is the term referred to the refined uranium with the same isotopic ratio found in nature and despite the fact that natural uranium can be used to fuel both low- and high-power reactors, but the enrichment processes based on gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge using uranium hexafluoride UF6 are very common. Unfortunately, these enrichment processes give rise to large amounts of uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope 235U named depleted uranium. About 95 % of the depleted uranium produced to date is stored as UF6 , in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants causing a permanent environment risk contamination. The long-term storage of depleted uranium as UF6 represents safety risks and potential danger to health and environment because of its chemical instability. When exposed to moist air, UF6 reacts with the water in the air to produce uranyl fluoride UO2F2 and hydrogen fluoride both of which are highly soluble and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades. There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States and the government has been converting depleted uranium UF6 to solid uranium oxides for disposal. Such disposal of the entire depleted UF6 inventory could cost from tens to hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892121444

The development of ship building is subject to solve major problems arising from industry-nature relationships, strictly targeted on pollution control and the protection of natural resources and energy. Comparatively with the practices in the field worldwide, the Romanian ship building has unsolved problems in terms of collection, transport and storage of all categories of wastes, along with their recovery.

Rosia career is the biggest surface mining of lignite from the mining basin of Oltenia. In this career monthly are evacuated very big quantities of water through some specific works and equipments. Those quantities have values approximately constant of about 1.250.000 m3/month. Considering those big quantities of water discharged, the problem is to use them, through not very complicated hydraulic improvements, in order to produce energy from renewable sources. Another reason to responde to this challenge is the Law no. 139/2010 regarding to modify and complete the Law no. 220/2008 for the establishment the system of promoting the production of energy from renewable energy sources, according to that, for every 1 MWh produced and delivered, in hydroelectric plant with installed powers of at most 10 MW new, the producer receives 3 green certificates. A green certificate is a document which shows a quantity of 1MWh of electricity produced by renewable sources of energy (the minimum value of a certificate is 27 EUR, and the maximum value is 55 EUR). The perimeter Rosia de Jiu is situated on the administrative territory of village Farcasesti and the rest of it is situated on the administrative territory of the town Rovinari, at 25 kilometers south of Targu-Jiu, Gorj county, Romania.

One of which is sunflower variety PAN7411 that was recently grown in Gezira Agricultural Research Corporation to be tested for yield productivity. The second sample was commercial oil purchased from the local market. Both seeds of the variety, as a whole and its extracted oil was stored and compared. Commercial oil samples were stored in containers of different materials and colors. Stored seeds and oils were periodically sampled and tested for oil oxidative stability namely: color, refractive index, viscosity, refractive index, viscosity, acid value, peroxide value and iodine value. Results demonstrate that the immediately extracted oil after plant harvesting is more resistant to deterioration than the oil kept stored inside the seed, for the variety under the study. Glass container seemed to be more resistant to deterioration factors than polythene while galvanized container was found to be the worst. Brown container revealed more resistance to oxidative stability followed by colorless container and the black container was the worst.

Gyromonotron is a simplest gyrooscillator for converting energy of transversal beam energy to oscillation of electromagnetic energy. Cooling of electron beams due to synchrotron radiation (radiative ""cooling"") is ineffective not only for energy W<50 MeV (low level of synchrotron radiation), but for high relativistic energies too, when positive radiative losses for cooling of a beam were prevailed by another increasing negative force named as Ternov-Sokolov effect (beam radius and emittance growth take place as result of quantum fluctuations of electron trajectories in accelerators). Hence, under high energies (starting from some hundreds MeV) synchrotron radiation is source not only focusing radiative cooling force, but defocusing force too due to recoil effect of electrons under radiation high energy quantum. Using gyromonotrons give possibility to increase maximal beam energy in synchrotrons through cooling of electron beam for prevention beam particles losses due to Ternov-Sokolov effect.

Rough rice grains were conditioned to moisture contents of 12, 18, 24, and 30% (w.b.). Five mechanical expressions named rupture force (Fr), maximum stress (σmax), grain deformation (D), energy (E) and toughness (T) were extracted from stress-strain curve for all tested varieties as a function of moisture content. Also, some physical properties such as bulk density, true density, porosity and some morphological features of grain were determined as a function of moisture content for tested rough rice grain. The results revealed that the measured physical and mechanical properties are significantly effected by moisture contents for the three tested rice varieties. In general, when the moisture content increased, the rupture force and maximum stress decreased for all investigated grains. However, the deformation, energy and toughness firstly decreased with moisture content increase and after that increased with further increase of moisture content for all rice varieties. On the other hand, the bulk density, true density and porosity do not have a specific trend with increasing moisture content. Moreover, there was a significant difference among the selected rice varieties in terms of their bulk density and porosity at the same moisture content range.","Moisture content; Physical and mechanical properties; Rough rice; Stress-strain relationship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888874945

Biomass appears as a very interesting alternative for direct conversion into heat. In this context, densified forms of biomass such as pellets are of great relevance because of their easy of use, high efficiency and low emissions. The practical interest in pellet combustion has been driven by the domestic heating sector, which favors the characteristics that are intrinsic of this fuel, despite its relatively higher price. However, the growing costs of fossil fuels have extended the interest of pellet fuels into industrial applications, including cofiring in power stations. A fast growing market includes the retrofitting of existing fuel boilers and furnaces with alternative burners that can be fitted into existing combustion systems. Such an approach has proved very attractive due to the low installation cost and the growing existence of fuels produced in the vicinity of the end user. This involves in most cases a custom built application which requires a high level of flexibility to variable operating conditions. This work reports on the development of a 120 kW pellet burner. A prototype of the burner was built that enables the independent control of the air supply into various regions of the combustion chamber and an accurate supply of fuel. The burner was fitted into a testing furnace of cylindrical shape oriented horizontally. Its diameter is 0.5 m and is constructed in a modular fashion with a total length of 2.2 m. All the facility is fully instrumented and includes : Temperature data in various locations inside the chamber, flue gases emissions (CO, CO2, NOx) measurements and flow rates. The objective of the test and development is to optimize the combustion over the thermal load range of the facility. The excess air, fuel supply (primary and secondary) and the shape of the furnace grate enable the optimization of the burner with CO emissions of approximately 50 ppm, well below the acceptable limits.

Because of these fluctuations, a wave farm may have a negative impact on the power quality of the local grid to which it is connected. Hence, the impact of these devices on both distribution and transmission networks needs to be well understood, before large scale wave farms can be allowed to connect to the grid.

The analysis presented in the paper is based on the EREC strategy which foresees the share of 82% of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The problem of implementation of this strategy is that the more significant RES (Sun and wind) are characterized by intermittence of input energy, for which reason they cannot provide continuous and reliable supply of energy to consumers without electric storage. The solution to this problem and to creating conditions for achieving SEPS is an innovative concept of Solar Hydro Electric (SHE) power plant which is a basically combined photovoltaic power plant and pump storage which can produce and store relatively large quantities of energy and provide continuous supply of electric power and energy to consumers. In this way SHE is put into equal position with power plants using conventional power fuels, and because of that, SHE is presented in this paper as the main building element of the future SEPS. The conducted analysis and results clearly point not only to the reality, but the necessity for SEPS and to the exceptionally big achievements which the PV generator use will reach in the future. The proposed strategy of SEPS development could significantly contribute to realization of sustainability objectives, particularly to reduction of the problem of global warming. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

In this regard, two different energy storage solutions are investigated, i.e. a more mature one corresponding to lead acid batteries and a more innovative one corresponding to hydrogen storage. At the same time, limited contribution of the island's thermal power station (TPS) is also taken into account in the current study, in order to investigate the influence of the latter on the size and economic efficiency of various wind-energy storage systems. To this end, using the developed algorithm, numerous energy autonomous wind-based configurations are produced, that are accordingly evaluated in terms of both capital investment and long-term electricity production cost. According to the results obtained, battery storage selection leads to cost-competitive configurations even in the case of zero contribution of the local TPS, while for hydrogen storage, increased costs attached to the specific solution encourage for the diffusion of hydrogen in other flows of energy consumption as well, so as to better exploit the entire potential offered by hydrogen production.","Battery storage; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Island network; Wind power","Battery storage; Capital investment; Economic efficiency; Electricity production costs; Sizing algorithms; Storage solutions; Storage systems; Thermal power stations; Algorithms; Costs; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Investments; Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884400135

The intensive integration of these sources has led to situations in which the demand is lower than the available renewable resources. In these situations a part of the available generation is wasted if not used for storage or to supply additional demand. This paper proposes a real time demand response methodology based on changing the electricity price for the consumers expecting an increase in the demand in the periods in which that demand is lower than the available renewable generation. The consumers response to the changes in electricity price is characterized by their price elasticity of demand considered distinct for each consumer type. The proposed methodology is applied to the Portuguese power system, in the context of the Iberian electricity market (MIBEL). The renewable-based producers are considered as special producers, with special tariffs, and so it is important to use the energy available as it will be paid anyway. In this context, consumers are entities actively participating in the operation of the market.",,"Electricity prices; European Countries; Iberian electricity market; Power systems operation; Price-elasticity of demand; Real-time demand response; Renewable generation; Renewable resource; Commerce; Electric power generation; Exhibitions; Wind power; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884392361

A short-term Energy Resource Management (ERM) methodology performed in two phases is proposed in this paper. The first one addresses the day-ahead ERM scheduling and the second one deals with the five-minute ahead ERM scheduling. The ERM scheduling is a complex optimization problem due to the high quantity of variables and constraints. In this paper the main goal is to minimize the operation costs from the point of view of a virtual power player that manages the network and the existing resources. The optimization problem is solved by a deterministic mixedinteger non-linear programming approach.

In case of MicroGrids autonomous operation, management of instantaneous active power balance imposes unique challenges. Traditionally, power grids are supplied by sources having rotating masses and these are regarded as essential for the inherent stability of the system. In contrast, MicroGrids are dominated by inverter interfaced sources that are inertia-less, but do offer the possibility of a more flexible operation. When a forced or scheduled islanding takes place in a MicroGrid, it must have the ability to operate stably and autonomously, requiring the use of suitable control strategies. The MicroGrid power sources can also be exploited in order to locally promote a service restoration strategy following a general blackout. A sequence of actions for the black start procedure is also presented and it is expected to be an advantage in terms of reliability as a result from the presence of very large amounts of dispersed generation in distribution grids. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882945607

The differences between the actual demand and produced energy are caused by unpredictable level of electric power generation by uncontrolled sources, like wind turbines or solar panels, and/or randomness of power utilization.

In mammals, improper control of these metabolic pathways can result in serious health problems, such as obesity, increased risk of coronary artery diseases, diabetes and related problems, such as hypertension and lipidemia. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ), together with its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor (RXR), is a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, being involved in the regulation of food intake, metabolic efficiency and energy storage. Triorganotins such as tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPhT) are high affinity ligands of both RXRs and PPARγ. In line with these findings, the use of the 3T3-L1 cell system, a well characterized model for adipogenesis, demonstrated that organotins stimulate 3T3-L1 cells differentiation and the expression of adipocyte marker genes. In vivo exposure of neonate mice to TBT significantly elevates lipid accumulation in several tissues, thus supporting the hypothesis that chronic lifetime human exposure to organotins may increase the risk of obesity. While PPAR has not been described outside deuterostomes, RXR is ubiquitous within metazoans. Thus, the taxonomic scope for organotin-mediated lipid homeostasis disruption may be wider than initially anticipated. This is further supported by the observation of increased lipid accumulation in amphibians and teleost fish and changes to the lipid profile in molluscs after organotin exposure. Therefore, we review here the current evidence on the molecular and biochemical mechanisms for organotin-mediated lipid homeostasis disruption within several metazoan phyla. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

Also, despite all manual wheelchairs human work efficiency during propulsion plays an important role, there is not enough research carried out that would focus on this problem regarding lever-driven wheelchairs. The research, presented in this paper, according to the authors' intention, is to make this knowledge gap smaller. The article describes an analytical optimization method for adjusting important lever-drive system parameters - levers length and its axis of rotation position - to individual human anthropometry. The method is based on experimental data regarding maximum human push capabilities acquired in another study. The optimized parameters' values were determined after assessment of maximum human expendable energy during a single work phase (pushing the levers). As a result of this study authors determined optimal levers length and their axis of rotation position for a 50 percentile French male.

A new wind turbine design is presented which is able to catch this energy. The engine is intended to be mounted on a bridge between two ship bodies similar to a catamaran. Wind enters horizontally - the wind turbine resembling a very large jet engine - and is reduced in speed by a diffuser. The blade arrangement is similar to a last stage steam turbine ahead of a condenser. Power is produced by this single stage reaction turbine. The deficiency of flow power at the turbine outlet is counteracted by energy from the surrounding air flow by feeding bypass air into the outlet area behind the rotor blades. The now increased flow carries sufficient flow power to pass through the outlet diffuser and to reach the pressure conditions behind the wind turbine.

The deployment of these computer systems in large numbers and in very dense configurations in a data center has resulted in very high power densities at room level. These computer systems are deployed in a rack. A standard 2-meter high rack can accommodate an equivalent of 34 thin desktop systems. If the maximum power dissipation from each system is 300W, a single rack in a data center cans be assumed to dissipate 7.2 KW. A data center can have hundreds of these 7.2 KW racks. Due to such high heat loads, designing the air conditioning system in a data center using simple energy balance is no longer adequate. Moreover, the data center design cannot rely on intuitive design of air distribution. It is necessary to model the airflow and temperature distribution in a data center. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics model of a prototype data center is presented to make the case for such modeling. The present work was carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation techniques as embedded in the commercially available CFD code (FLUENT 6.2). The CFD modelling techniques solved the continuity, momentum and energy conservation equations in addition to standard k - ε model equations for turbulence closure. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Different treatments for controlling building envelope, thermal storage and its peaks were investigated. This paper is devoted to the physical modeling for Thermally Activated Building Systems 'TABS' especially the Concrete-Core-Radiant-Slab, 'CCRS' cooling system in roofs and typical partitioned slab constructions. These investigations were achieved by using five real standard size samples having 0.75 m Length, 0.75 m Width, 0.12 m Thickness with embedded 15mm diameter plastic PE pipes with different layouts, on which each construction is exposed to conditions similar to reality. With the aid of custom made test facility, external slabs surface, slab core temperatures, embedded pipe temperatures and heat flux intensities were experimentally measured during simulated climatic condition periods at Al-Minya governorate, the first southern city at Upper Egypt governorates. Climatic conditions were simulated based on averaged weekly temperature distributions recorded over a year leading to real year simulation within real 52-Days 'The duration of one experiment'. Measurements are conducted with the aid of state-of-the-art probes and sensing elements that wired to data acquisition and controlling unit which are managed via pre-programmed computer handmade software. Almost two months were required to execute one experiment. Each experiment provides valuable and huge collected data. These gained data allow for better understanding of the actual behaviors of TAB system and the expectations of the thermal impacts on buildings. While, results show that CCRS can not work alone for exposed roofs without external shading and efficient thermal insulation. Although, TAB system shows an effective cooling capacity from 40.0W/m2 to 55.0W/m2 but it can shave the peak loads and reduce the initial and running costs of the applied cooling systems by maintaining stable Energy Efficiency Ratio, 'EER' at the optimum conventional cooling system performance. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Since that time, some important improvements were carried out. At first, accuracy of the reactor power and power rate measurements was significantly improved. Detailed complete calibration (neutron chamber signals evaluation) of the I&C was carried out, and comparative measurement with an independent power measurement system developed at the Department was done. New evaluated constants for the power calculation based on the comparative measurement were set into I&C, and the comparative measurement to approve the new setting was performed. Next, the human machine interface was significantly upgraded. The new software provides enhanced presentation of the reactor operational status (Czech or English version selectable), displays new operational data (e.g. reactivity measurement), and offers storage of all reactor operational data for documentation of the safe reactor operation, evaluation of experiments or reactor calibration. The connection with the computer for evaluation of experiments proposes enhanced evaluation of reactor tasks and provision of the on-line reactor operational data via Internet at the whole university.","Human-machine interface; I&C; Reactor power measurement; Training reactor","Comparative measurements; Human Machine Interface; Measurement system; Operational data; Power calculation; Reactivity measurements; Reactor power; Technical universities; Calibration; Digital storage; Experiments; Man machine systems; Nuclear energy; Measurements",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880494664

Attacks of this type exhaust power supply of sensor nodes and reduce the sensor lifetime. Most of existing researches propose authentication and encryption solutions to protect the network from denial of sleep attacks. However, it is more efficient to use simpler solutions to the same security challenges due to limited processing capability, memory storage, and energy capacity. In this paper we propose a cross layer energy-efficient security mechanism to protect the network from these attacks.

One of them is the use of biomass as feedstock in gasification processes. Biomass fuels which include energy crops, agricultural and forestry residues, and municipal, industrial, and animal wastes can serve as renewable feedstock for thermal gasification to produce gaseous and liquid fuels. The inclusion of biomass as feedstock in thermal conversion processes does not increase the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere because biomass is a carbon neutral fuel. The sugarcane agriculture industry around the world produces a great amount of wastes, e.g., only in Colombia about 9 million tons of bagasse wastes are produced per year. That great amount of bagasse wastes can cause pollution of natural sources (land, water, and air) if waste handling systems and storage and treatment structures are not properly managed. If thermal gasification technology is developed for sugarcane bagasse wastes (SCBW), the negative environmental impact from both SCBW and fossil-fuels could be mitigated. The current paper deals with i) SCBW adiabatic gasification modeling using air-steam blends for partial oxidation and ii) pyrolysis kinetic model to determine, by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the SCBW activation energy (E). The Chemical Equilibrium with Applications program (CEA), developed by NASA, was used to estimate the effect of both the equivalence ratio (ER) and steam to fuel ratio (S:F) on adiabatic temperature, gas quality (gas composition and energy density), and energy recovery of an unlimited number of species (~150). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using N2 as carrier gas and under different heating rates (β: 5, 10, 20, and 40 °C/min). The activation energy (E) was estimated based in the results from TGA and using the isoconversional method (i.e., free-model). In general for the range of parameters studied (0.3&lt;S:F&lt;0.8 and 2&lt;ER&lt;6), the results from equilibrium adiabatic modeling (CEA) showed that increasing ER and (S:F) ratios increases the production of H2 and CO2 but decreases the production of CO. At ER &lt;4, the equilibrium temperature decreases with increased ER, but at ER &gt; ~ 4.0, it remains stable. The production of CH4 is only possible at ER&gt;4. The average value of the activation energy, estimated from the kinetics model, was 266 kJ/kmol.

Accordingly, this significantly affects the socioeconomic development of all nations including Thailand, depending upon imported fossil flue, mainly. The exploration and development of renewable energy sources for generating electricity becomes a necessity and urgent. One of the interesting renewable energy sources such as micro hydropower, which requires a small investment and can be easily developed with minimum environmental impact, is considered to be an important alternative energy source for generating electrical power. This study is, therefore, to assess potential area where could be used to develop of a micro hydropower plant in the Chi-river Basin using geographical information systems together with multi-criteria decision making. It was founded that there are seventy potential areas, where could be installed the hydropower generator of more than five kilowatts. The total installation capacity of the generator of these potential areas is 23 megawatts resulting in unit of electricity of 83 gigawatt hours. The potential sites were classified into two categories: (1) the storage project of 28 sites; and (2) the in-river project of 42 sites. These sites were prioritized considering their strengths and weaknesses, in order to develop a pilot project, using multi-criteria decision making with five groups of expertise viz., engineering, economy, environment, socio-economy and community participation. From the prioritization process of community micro hydropower pilot project in the Chi river basin, the top ten ranking were: Chilong-4, Chilong-5, Kanchu-4, Lampao-Dam, Wangyang-Reservoir, Chi-1, Kuichurk-Weir, Thartnoi-Weir, Chi-2 and Chi-3. In addition, the top three ranking were chosen into the intensive community participation process, resulting that the Chilong-4 site was selected to be a pilot project for developing micro hydropower.","Chi River Basin; Geographic information systems (GIS); Intensive community participation process; Micro hydropower potential site; Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)","Alternative energy source; Community participation; Exploration and development; Hydropower potential; Micro hydropower plants; Multi-criteria decision making; River basins; Socio-economic development; Decision making; Economics; Electricity; Environmental impact; Hydroelectric generators; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Investments; Natural resources; Nuclear power plants; Remote sensing; Renewable energy resources; Reservoirs (water); Site selection; Watersheds; Weirs; Geographic information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879997214

The main purpose of this analysis is to investigate the active power losses resulting from the coordinated control of DER in Microgrid operation by their owners, in comparison with DER individual operation aiming at the supply of their in-house loads only. Absence of the distributed resources, and therefore the satisfaction of the full load from the upstream network, is considered as the base case. Moreover, each operating scenario is examined under the assumption of both absence and presence of reactive power demand and production.

In this paper, the design, optimisation, piloting, field implementation, and post-job field data evaluation for the most critical well are discussed. The re-development strategy for the company hinges on the move to an islands-based development concept. This concept dictates that a significant number of wells be extended reach, long horizontals to maximize reservoir contact and exposure. The increased reservoir exposure will translate proportionally to accrued production (or injection) benefits and value, balanced reservoir sweep, and maximizing recoveries. Hundreds of these MRC wells will be ultimately needed, to maximize recovery and drive the field daily production output from the current level to an increase of at least fifty per cent. However the challenges of designing, drilling and completing these complex wells are new to the operating company. The operator embarked on a program of drilling pilot wells with a view to establishing new learning and understanding, which translates into efficiently designing, deploying and operating these wells for the field re-development. The paper shows the methodologies employed for one of these pilot wells, right from the concept stage through to the modelling, design and optimisation. It also shows how operational considerations were fed into the optimisation workflow, and how the resulting design was implemented in the field. The obtained field measurements such as resistivity, fluid mobility, production logging, production rates were compared to the initial design and performance forecasts, and excellent conformance is demonstrated, further validating the robustness of the implemented designs. The paper highlights the lessons learnt from this exercise, and also proposes a recommended methodology for approaching and adopting the design and implementation of advanced wells, within oil and gas producing assets.

The reservoir, on active water drive, has its inherent problem of rapid increase in water cut, the production performance of wells declining drastically after water cut level of 40%. The well production improvement is continuous effort based on understanding of well fundamentals and actual analysis of well's historical performance. This can be enhanced with Well modeling based on latest field real time parameters to predict well performance and production forecast. The persistent approach to improve well performance was implemented by dividing entire Field into segments based on water encroachment, pressure distribution and fluid properties as each well is located in a segment requiring specific approach and technique's to sustain well production and performance improvement. To implement production sustenance and enhancement plan, huge well surveillance plan was adopted to acquire TDT/PNC, PLT, FBHP and SBHP, PGOR to get latest well and field data to implement following specific actions a) Quick wins: Rig less water shut-off jobs, additional and re-perforations in dry zones to improve well production; b) Rig work overs to cement squeeze the high water cut zones to reduce water cuts and improve well vertical lift performance on natural flow; c) Selective ESP in low pressure and high water cut field segments to sustain the existing production; d) Use of latest ICD design based on PLT results to sustain well production from the existing horizontal wells with less water cut; e) Recompletion of poor performance wells of other zones after critical evaluation.

(QSUI) re-entered Exploration in Qatar focusing on the relatively deep conventional Pre-Khuff gas plays with a view to discover additional hydrocarbons in the State of Qatar. The Pre-Khuff plays pose two main challenges; firstly the geophysical challenge of being able to image the deep Pre-Khuff structure and hence trapping configurations and secondly the geological challenge of being able to realistically predict reservoir and top seal quality. This paper highlights the approach to geological issues associated with Pre-Khuff exploration and how technologies were deployed to address pre drill exploration challenges in the venture. Significant uncertainty exists in relation to the deep structure of the Qatar Arch particularly when in the region the Pre-Hercynian package has been shown to be structurally different to the overburden. 2D seismic reprocessing has helped to significantly improve seismic imaging encompassing clear improvements in seismic data quality with better reflector continuity and elucidation of structural and stratigraphic complexity. The overall structure of the Qatar Arch and the trap styles in the Pre-Khuff are assessed using a combination of gravity anomaly data and interpretation of 2D seismic profiles, while incremental restoration of 2D seismic lines provides insight on the timing of trap formation. The Devonian Jauf and the Permo-Carboniferous Unayzah plays are primary targets in Block D. Key petroleum system risks are taken as top seal retention, reservoir quality and charge timing and migration. To address these geological factors, data has been re-assessed and new work undertaken on stratigraphic definition, depositional models, reservoir quality prediction, integrated charge evaluation and seal integrity of the Pre-Khuff. Pre-Khuff top seal effectiveness in the focus plays have been assessed through MICP analysis and demonstrates that the relevant seals can hold back significant gas columns. Revised depositional models, based on core observations, have been used to extend potentially successful play fairways into Qatar. New petrographic analysis programs address the diagenetic controls on reservoir quality and their relationship with depositional environments aiding the prediction of potential net viable reservoirs at depths greater than conventional cementation floors. Integrated charge evaluation using basin modeling and geochemical techniques comprising Compound Specific Isotope, TOC, visual kerogen and chitinozoan reflectance analysis suggests a working petroleum system for Pre-Khuff reservoirs. 1D basin models suggest the Pre-Khuff on the Qatar Arch has received gas charge over the last 100 Ma but despite these favorable conditions, a key risk remains the presence of effective vertical migration pathways (i.e. faults) from the source rock into the prospective reservoirs.

Failure to correctly represent the natural fractures when working on a reservoir development plan can lead to poor performance and failure to analyze reservoir response. Pressure transient testing is widely recognized as a core competency in the oil industry as it provides subsurface specialists with valuable information regarding the reservoir properties, well connectivity to the reservoir and extent of reach into the reservoir. When borehole image (BHI) data triggers a signal that fractures are seen in wells but flow rates do not show production dominated by fractures, the engineers working on the reservoir need to pay attention to pressure transient tests. Depending on the contrast between fracture permeability and matrix permeability, pressure transient analysis in a fractured reservoir can show clear dual porosity behavior, or the effect can be masked by the wellbore storage. The latter happens when the contrast between the matrix permeability and the fracture permeability is small. The two parameters which characterize a dual porosity model are the storativity ratio, ω, and the inter-porosity flow coefficient, λ. The average value of λ for the vertical wells studied is 25*10-4, confirming a low contrast between fissure and matrix permeability. For the storativity ratio, a typical value is between 0.001% and 0.1%. An average of 0.03% has been calculated from the well tests. With the results from pressure transient tests, BHI and core description, fractures have been defined as mild with relative low-intensity. Numerical modeling on a field sector was employed to test the impact of the fractures on production.

Discovered in 1938, commercial production from this giant field commenced in 1946 accelerating rapidly to a peak of nearly 3 MMBOPD in 1972. The Burgan structure is an anticlinal dome with numerous faults. The main producing reservoirs are sandstones of Cretaceous age. Four major sandstone horizons within the gross productive section account for most of the current and cumulative production. The 3SM is the main contributory sand which is much thicker than the others. A strong natural water drive maintains reservoir pressure. The compartmentalization of the main reservoir sands by faults, combined with high production rates, resulted in water incursion problems since the early seventies and made worse by uncontrolled flow from wells sabotaged during the Iraqi invasion. As the 3SM reservoir gets further depleted, water encroachment studies reveal that there is a differential rate of rise in OWC in the massive sand implying un-even sweep. This has created uncertainties in the remaining oil column in flank areas of the field for placement of infill well locations. This paper presents a methodology applied to successfully identify infill well locations in flank areas of Burgan field. The behavior of faults and rise in water in different compartments were analyzed utilizing seismic surveys, pressure buildup tests and PNC log data combining with production history. Based on the analysis minor faults were characterized and mapped which led to identification of unswept areas where new well locations were proposed. Gross pay found in three new infill wells drilled have been very encouraging. The process leading to identification of these successful well locations is discussed in length. More infill locations and well intervention opportunities are being identified by using this methodology with increased surveillance to further enhance production from this field.

With such a fast pace of development and recovery from several recessions over a number of years, dependency on energy sources became inevitable to satisfy the rising demand. This paper represents a proposed global energy price model that has the flexibility of modeling the energy price, using data from specific regions of the world, as well as the global energy pricing equation. The ANM (Alternate Novel Model) is presented here. The model focuses mainly on oil price modeling, since oil accounts for more than 84% of the current world energy supply. The model duration is 50 years; starting from 1980 to 2030, model matching period from 1980 to 2011, and the prediction period is from 2012 to 2030. The modeling approach used in ANM adopts weighted averaging of individual factors and it relies on line regression technique. Therefore, future trends are being predicted based on the cyclic nature of the market and historical data ""the future is reflection of the past"". ANM can then preduct the future oil prices, depending on the factors and variables that have been placed in the process for the output results. The paper aims to propose a reliable model that accounts for most governing factors in the global energy pricing equation. All steps followed and assumptions made will be discussed in detail to clarify the working mechanism for this model and pave the road for any future modifications.

However, it is prohibitively slow for current sized datasets, and would continue to be a critical bottleneck with the trend of increasing dataset sizes to billions of particles and more, which makes TPCF a compelling benchmark application for future exa-scale architectures. State-of-the-art TPCF implementations do not map well to the underlying SIMD hardware, and also suffer from load-imbalance for large core counts. In this paper, we present a novel SIMD-friendly histogram update algorithm that exploits the spatial locality of histogram updates to achieve near-linear SIMD scaling. We also present a load-balancing scheme that combines domain-specific initial static division of work and dynamic task migration across nodes to effectively balance computation across nodes. Using Zin supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (25,600 cores of Intel® Xeon® E5-2670, each with 256-bit SIMD), we achieve 90% parallel efficiency and 96% SIMD efficiency, and perform TPCF computation on a 1.7 billion particle dataset in 5.3 hours (at least 35x faster than previous approaches). In terms of cost per performance (measured in flops/$), we achieve at least an order-of-magnitude (11.1x) higher flops/$ as compared to the best known results [1].

There has been a push for HPC machines to be rated not just in Petaflops, but also in ""GigaTEPS"" (billions of traversed edges per second), and the Graph500 benchmark has been established for this purpose. Graph traversal on single nodes has been well studied and optimized on modern CPU architectures. However, current cluster implementations suffer from high latency data communication with large volumes of transfers across nodes, leading to inefficiency in performance and energy consumption. In this work, we show that we can overcome these constraints using a combination of efficient low-overhead data compression techniques to reduce transfer volumes along with latency-hiding techniques. Using an optimized single node graph traversal algorithm [1], our novel cluster optimizations result in over 6.6X performance improvements over state-of-the-art data transfer techniques, and almost an order of magnitude in energy savings. Our resulting implementation of the Graph500 benchmark achieves 115 GigaTEPS on a 320-node/5120 core Intel® Endeavor cluster with Intel® Xeon® processors E5-2670, which matches the second ranked result in the recent November 2011 Graph500 list [2] with about 5.6X fewer nodes.

In brief, a smart grid is the use of sensors, communications, computational ability and control in some form to enhance the overall functionality of the electric power delivery system. A system becomes smart by sensing, communicating, applying intelligence, exercising control and through feedback. For an ideal power system, this permits several functions which can optimize in the combination of the use of bulk generation and storage, transmission, distribution, and consumers. It can fulfill the goal which can ensure reliability and optimization of the use of Energy. It will also keep the environment free from pollution, save the assets, minimize the cost, easy operation against all hazards, maximum possibility to keep out from danger, provides power quality for 21st century needs. The focus of this paper is to familiarize with smart grid perspective to Bangladesh. The conception of smart grid is almost new is Bangladesh. The whole power system network in Bangladesh is very elaborate and complex but primitive. To reduce this complexity and improve the performance of the system, smart grid can be a better solution. Load-shedding is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. It can be solved by smart grid technology. As it can automatically detect, calculate and distribute electricity as per load requirements, it reduces the system loss and at the same time a certain amount of electricity from the grid would always be available at each consumer side even at the time of load shedding. Bangladesh can be greatly benefited by using this technology. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the necessity of smart grid for the perspective of Bangladesh which may be an effective solution to overcome the recent power crisis. © 2011 IEEE.","Communication; Distribution Loss; Energy storage; Load Shedding; Power system; Security System; Sensor; Smart grid; Smart Meter; Transmission Loss","Computational ability; Distribution loss; Electric power delivery system; Load-shedding; Power system networks; Smart grid; Smart Grid technologies; Transmission loss; Communication; Complex networks; Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electricity; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Optimization; Security systems; Sensors; Smart meters; Standby power systems; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876834929

Such storage systems are exemplified by the hierarchical data format(HDF/HDF5), the network common data format (NetCDF) and recently the SciDB. Given that the array is mapped onto linear locations in a file, i.e., a representation of an array file, in either row-major or column-major order, a fundamental feature of the representation is that they should be allowed to grow to massively large sizes by gradual expansions of the array bounds. In both the row-major and column-major order of array elements, extendibility is allowed in one dimension only. We present an approach of storing multi-dimensional dense array on physical storage devices, that allows arbitrary extensions of any of the array bounds, without reorganising previously allocated array elements. For a k-dimensional N-element array, the organisation allows an element to be accessed in time O(k + \log N) using O(k2 N1/k) additional space. By chunking the array to size Nc chunks, the time and space requirements reduce to O(k + \log Nc) and O(k2 Nc1/k). © 2012 IEEE.","arrays; chunking; extendible; multidimensional; storage","arrays; chunking; extendible; Fundamental features; Hierarchical data; multidimensional; Scientific database; Space requirements; Energy storage; Models; Virtual storage; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876575503

A load shifting controller is developed to find the optimum trajectory for CTES in a dynamic environment. The variation in ice building efficiency due to the nonlinear relationship between changing ambient air temperature and ice charge level is accommodated by employing dynamic programming in a three dimensional space. The combined system learns from its errors and adapts during simulation. The optimum ice building trajectory is progressively updated as new information comes online.

The Pico hydro turbine is installed over the storage tank where the tank is filled with water by the high capacity pump which is installed at the ground floor of the building. In the storage tank of high rise building water is thrown by the pump with a very high velocity which pushes the turbine to make it spin. The spinning of the turbine is turned into electricity by means of a generator and immense amount of wasted kinetic energy of the water is recovered thrown by the pump. The electrical energy created is usually stored in a battery which can then power electrical objects in house, such as appliances and lights. When the storage tank will be filled by water no more power can be extracted from the Pico hydro turbine. A wind turbine could also be installed at the roof of the high rise building with the purpose of acquiring additional power supply as the wind velocity is generally higher at the roof of the building. The electrical power, obtained from both the generators one coupled with the Pico hydro turbine impeller and another with the wind turbine blade can be utilized in houses, offices, and also in the industries. With the integration of Pico hydro turbine and wind turbine more electrical power could be gained. Moreover the major advantage of this system is the elimination of the cost of fuel and it is an eco-friendly clean power generation method. The feasibility of the overall integrated system is analyzed in this research work.","High Rise Building.; Pico Hydro Turbine; Wind Turbine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876089140

To match the range of an internal combustion powered vehicle, the EV needs a battery capable of delivering 30-50kWh (commonly the standard capacity is 15 to 20 kWh). The present paper represents a study on a proposed hybrid supercapacitor-battery electric system to control a reversible electric motor used in demanding application or in automotive applications. When an AC electric motor is used the deceleration energy (power generation control) is recovered and stored in a battery of supercapacitors. The designed method uses an electronic control module that has minimal electromagnetic interference due to switching of the power semiconductor device as it passes through zero voltage and filtering of conducted emissions. The supercapacitor battery allows rapid storage and release of energy of 300 - 400A if needed without using the energy stored in the battery system increasing its life cycle. © 2012 SPIE.","Electric motor control; Electromagnetic compatibility; Regenerative energy; Supercapacitor","Automotive applications; Electric motor control; Electronic control modules; Power generation control; Power semiconductor devices; Regenerative energy; Super capacitor; Supercapacitor batteries; Capacitors; Control; Electric motors; Electromagnetic compatibility; Electromagnetic pulse; Microelectronics; Nanotechnology; Optoelectronic devices; Power electronics; Power generation; Zero voltage switching; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875750883

During the first 5-20 min of application of -3V bias with respect to open circuit voltage, the formation of graphite is minimal and the resulting TiC layer is ~10 μm thick. Applying negative bias for longer time results in the formation of graphite dendrites. This behavior can be explained by the fact that the overpotential of CO is lower on TiC than on graphite. The resulting Ti\TiC structure can be employed to good advantage as the anode in the electrolysis of molten Li2CO3 for CO2 to CO conversion for energy storage. It has higher conductivity than the graphite electrode used previously and can be prepared in situ. The process described here can therefore make a valuable contribution to the practical implementation of the electrochemical production of CO. In addition, the fact that the TiC coating is perfectly conformal suggests that the same process can be used as a general method of coating Ti by TiC.

In this paper, it is reported that the SMES system with a voltage-source IGBT converter and a DC chopper can smooth the line power and can also maintain the terminal voltage of fixed-speed wind generator at desired level, as it has both real and reactive power control abilities. For wind generator output power smoothing, constant output power reference is not a good choice, because sufficient power cannot be obtained when wind speed is very low, hence, more energy storage capacity is needed to smooth the wind farm (WF) output power. Therefore, among the various methods, a suitable method for selection of reference line power is presented. Finally, it is verified that the low pass filter (LPF) approach is very effective to smooth the line power with reduced energy storage capacity. © 2012 IEEE.","low pass filter and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit; Reference generation method; wind power smoothening","Constant output power; Energy storage capacity; Fixed-speed wind generators; Power fluctuations; Real and reactive power; Reference Generation; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Wind generator systems; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Low pass filters; Wind effects; Wind turbines; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875546970

This reduction decreases the bandwidth and energy used during transmission. Storing the compressed data on storage media also uses less space. This study aims to determine suitable lossless compression algorithms for EMG signal on small embedded devices. These devices have much less processing power than laboratory-sized devices thus a proper tool has to be carefully chosen. Various algorithms are studied with a set of simulated and real EMG signals. The performances of the algorithms are measured and compared. The memory requirement of the algorithms are also recorded for future reference. The result shows that the LPC based algorithms performs very well with EMG signal. The average compression ratio of these tools are 2.44. While BWT and LZMA algorithms are comparable to LPC in term of CR, these tools are very complex and have a much higher resource requirement. In this study, FLAC outperforms other compression tools with average CR of 2.61. This tool is fast and consumes slightly more resource than a much simpler scheme like SHN. For the standard LPC modeling, choosing an order of the model greater than 4 produces insignificant benefit. The simpler SHN scheme performs 4.2% better than the best LPC. ©2012 IEEE.","Bruxism; Data compression; Electromyography; Lossless compression","Bruxism; Compressed datum; Electromyographic signal; Lossless compression; Lossless compression algorithm; Memory requirements; Processing power; Resource requirements; Algorithms; Biomedical engineering; Chromium compounds; Data compression; Digital storage; Image compression; Electromyography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875117291

Such disorders imply dysfunction of a cellular process either as a result of a toxic gain of function due to protein aggregation, or loss of function due to protein instability, inefficient folding or defective trafficking. For a number of cases, drugs acting directly on the affected protein have been found to prevent misfolding and rescue function. This brief review will illustrate molecular mechanisms through which small molecules acting as folding correctors can prevent excessive protein buildup or recover faulty protein conformers, thus acting as effective therapeutic pharmacological chaperones. As background, the principles underlying the thermodynamics and kinetics of the protein folding reaction will be overviewed, as well as pathways leading to the formation of misfolding. The mechanism of action of small molecule correctors will then be discussed in light of these basic principles using illustrative examples referring to drugs that are effective over proteins involved in trafficking and folding diseases, amyloid aggregation disorders and metabolic deficiencies. An outlook on synergistic effects between different folding correctors and their combination with proteostasis regulators will also be addressed, as a relevant strategy towards the design of more effective therapies against protein folding diseases. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Folding correctors; Lysosomal diseases; Metabolic diseases; Neurodegenerative diseases; Pharmacological chaperone; Pro-teostasis; Protein aggregation; Protein folding; Protein stability","1 deoxynojirimycin; amyloid beta protein; chaperone; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; doxycycline; ivacaftor; lumacaftor; miglustat; prealbumin; tafamidis; tauroursodeoxycholic acid; tetrahydrobiopterin; thyroxine; Alzheimer disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; cystic fibrosis; diseases; energy transfer; familial amyloid polyneuropathy; gene mutation; human; lysosome storage disease; medical procedures; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); protein aggregation; protein folding; protein homeostasis; protein misfolding; review; small molecule therapy; Amyloid; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Humans; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Prealbumin; Protein Folding; Protein Transport; Proteostasis Deficiencies",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874905513

A total of 17 major emission sources distributed in different geographical development areas were identified. In two geographical areas can be made linked networks for CO2 transport depending of the locale storage opportunities. In 2008, the total GHG emissions in Romania were 145.916 Mt CO2 eq, of which 71.07% CO2, 17.61% CH4, 10.86% N2O, 0.43% PFC.

Mathematical programming for the rescheduling of the operations was used to maximize the direct use of renewable energy and to minimize the need for the energy storage. This reduces the consumption of utilities with a higher impact on the environment by exploiting an inherent flexibility of the processes on the demand side. Some operations can be shifted in time if the site has enough of a certain resource in stock. A flexible operation can also be rescheduled. However, the size of the stock implies a limitation for the shifting in time. The optimal solution of the operational level depends on the design parameters. A retrofit sensitivity analysis where the optimal schedule has been identified for different design conditions has been developed.

METHODS: We assessed the effect of hypothyroidism on the long-term (6 months) regulation of food intake, body weight, and energy expenditure in rats. We then generated the recovery of a euthyroid condition in the brain while maintaining a low T3 availability for the peripheral organs, i.e. a combined condition of central euthyroidism with peripheral hypothyroidism, with the aid of a pharmacological combination. RESULTS: Hypothyroidism caused a decrease in the daily food intake, body weight, and body temperature. The food intake and body temperature stabilized at a lower value, whereas body weight kept decreasing at a constant rate. The administration of exogenous T4 increased food intake and body-weight gain, but had no effect on body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: The thyroid hormones are necessary for the long-term regulation of energy intake, storage, and expenditure by different mechanisms. The feeding behavior seems to be partially dependent on a direct action of the thyroid hormones on the brain and this effect is independent of the energy expenditure in the peripheral organs. The body weight is closely dependent on the thyroid status and its maintenance seems to involve thyroid action on mechanisms other than feeding and metabolic rate. © 2012 Neuroendocrinology Letters.","Body-weight regulation; Feeding behavior; Food intake; Long term; Methimazole; Pharmacological hypothyroidism; PTU; Thyroid hormones; Thyroxine","liothyronine; thyroid hormone; thyroxine; animal experiment; article; body temperature; body weight; brain; energy balance; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; fluid intake; food intake; hypothyroidism; liothyronine blood level; nonhuman; rat; thyroxine blood level; Animals; Antithyroid Agents; Body Temperature; Body Weight; Brain Chemistry; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Hypothalamus; Hypothyroidism; Male; Methimazole; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Thyroxine; Time Factors; Triiodothyronine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874746910

The differences of this paper to conventional approaches are the use of a four wires grid architecture, system operation under load, and voltage unbalances. The smart grid utilizes a voltage source inverter operating in island mode with the droop control technique, and an energy storage device with additional task is proposed to inject the current according to a coordination algorithm. The compensation of current uses a flexible ABC theory based on the formulation by Lagrange optimization. Hence the analysis is realized for two compensation objectives, one is invariant instantaneous power and the second uses constant power (non-oscillation of power in the system is desired). An analysis has been done by simulation of the micro-grid using a segment of the CIGRE benchmark. Finally, the results for compensation show a comparison of the classical ABC theory and the flexible ABC method. © 2012 IEEE.","distributed generation; non-active power compensation; optimization; Power Electronics Systems; smart grids","ABC method; Constant power; Conventional approach; Coordination algorithms; Current compensation; Droop control; Four-wire; Grid architectures; Instantaneous power; Island modes; Lagrange optimization; Micro grid; Non-active power; Non-oscillations; Power compensation; Power electronics systems; Smart grid; System operation; Under loads; Voltage source inverter; Voltage unbalances; Distributed power generation; Optimization; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874738376

In particular, we will develop two methodologies for the combined sizing/energy management of hybrid ESS. The first method assumes that the division of power between the sources is performed through low/high pass filters, which allow us to evaluate, in a simple and rapid way, the trade-offs and economic gains due to the hybridization. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization problem, and seeks the minimization of the installation and electrical charging costs of the sources. Simulation results reveal the existence of a threshold in the EV range, from which the introduction of the supercapacitors is less beneficial in economic terms. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Economic gains; Electrical charging; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid ess; Hybrid storage systems; Non-linear optimization problems; Optimal sizing; Super capacitor; Blending; Capacitors; Energy management; Propulsion; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874435475

Ultracapacitors and lithium based batteries are used as energy storages and induction and permanent magnet electric motors as traction motors. Simulations were performed in four different city bus driving cycles. Specific simulations were carried out for investigating the impact of the weight and auxiliary power on the energy consumption. The simulation results indicate that the powertrain efficiency and high potential for regenerating braking energy have significant impact on overall energy efficiency of the electric city bus. It was also observed that the most of the powertrain alternatives are well adapted for all simulated driving cycles. The driving cycle mainly impacts on the potential for regenerating the braking energy.

In CM applications each sensor node transmits periodically its sensed data to the sink node while in Event-Detection Driven (EDD) applications, once an event occurs, it is reported to the sink node by the sensors within the event area. Applications using both continuous monitoring and event driven reporting can also be considered. In this paper, we investigate such hybrid WSNs. Specifically, we propose two different strategies that explicitly assign a time period for the event reporting data by means of the NP-CSMA random access protocol. Both strategies take advantage of the clustered based architecture which assign a TDMA schedule for the continuous monitoring data transmission. By doing so, the continuous monitoring clusters are also used for the event reporting. Hence, no extra energy is consumed for separate event clusters. The performance of these strategies is analyzed for low and high event rate occurrence. These strategies are compared to both continuous monitoring protocols (such as LEACH) and event driven reporting protocols (such as TEEN). © 2012 IEEE.","clustering; continuous monitoring; event detection; Wireless sensor networks","clustering; Continuous monitoring; Data transmission strategies; Event detection; Event reporting; Event-driven; Random access protocol; Sink nodes; Supervised areas; Time-periods; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Communication; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Leaching; Monitoring; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Time division multiple access",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874273212

However, the effects of the inflow uncertainty on a reservoir operation which cannot maintain the water level so that it is sufficient for generating power in some critical periods, makes reliable energy generation in certain periods unpredictable. Thus, this research developed different types of optimal hedging policies (one-point hedging, two-point hedging, three-point hedging, multiple hedging-non seasonal effects and multiple hedging-seasonal effects), which facilitate energy generation in association with basic operational concepts. The aim of the hedging policies was to reduce the water release in some periods even when there was enough water for serving all sectors of water demand. Consequently, the water level in the reservoir would be higher and this would be beneficial for energy generation. This research used the reservoir water balance concept to construct a reservoir operational model and applied the optimization approach with a genetic algorithm to find the optimal parameters of each policy. The Ubolratana Reservoir in Thailand was selected as the study area. The simulated results and their performance based on the reservoir operational model with the optimal hedging policies using daily long term data from 1970 to 2010 showed that using the various types of optimal hedging for the reservoir operation produced higher levels of firm energy. Moreover, the two types of multiple hedging gave better performance in terms of higher energy production compared to the existing rule curve. Additionally, using optimal multiple hedging with the seasonal parameters for operation increased energy production by controlling the reservoir water level so that it did not exceed the normal pool level and was not lower than the minimum pool level. In principle, when the optimal hedging policies were applied, the water storage in the reservoir was strictly limited and did not encroach the surcharge storage and inactive zones in some critical drawdown and fulfilled periods. Therefore, some water storage was kept in the active storage zone and was beneficial for energy generation together with other off-stream uses downstream.","Hydropower; Reservoir operation; Ubolratana reservoir",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874261576

The energy storage reduces load variations of diesel and generator. This can lead to fuel consumption savings, especially during dynamic positioning mode of offshore supply vessel. Energy storage can be connected to vessel AC power network by power electronics, which means additional losses on energy transfer upon charging and discharging. The other more effective way is to connect energy storage directly to the DC link of the propulsion drives. In this case, the DC link voltage level must be controlled to charge and discharge ES according to generator power and drive load. The aim of the control is to keep generation output in optimal fuel consumption range of the prime mover with keeping up the energy storage state of charge.

The most important consideration for harvesting is that the power consumption of the controller circuitry must be less than the energy generated by the power source. Energy harvesters use a storage capacitor slowly charged from power source through the controller and the leakage current of this capacitor is wastes a certain percentage of the generated energy. This paper will evaluate this effects of different technology capacitors on energy harvester performance. © VDE Verlag GMBH - Berlin.",,"Energy Harvester; Internal impedance; Low currents; Power sources; Storage capacitor; Capacitors; Energy management; Exhibitions; Intelligent robots; Power electronics; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874182452

The storage system is based on a cascaded multi-level converter topology where each (lead-acid) battery is equipped with dedicated low-voltage buck type DC/DC converter stage placed directly at the battery terminals. To minimize the output ripple, the cells are operated in a phase-shifted PWM manner. For active charge balancing of the individual battery cells first a simple P-type control scheme is developed showing good balancing characteristic provided that the batteries show almost equal Ah capacity. In case of significant different capacity Ah ratings (which may appear in practice if some batteries of the storage unit are in a weak life-cycle condition) the P-type balancing is not further applicable because a tremendous rise of the output ripple takes place. The P-type balancing therefore is extended/replaced by a concept where weak cells periodically completely are taken out of operation for specific time intervals. For this, a dynamically reconfigurable PWM generation unit is required which is implemented fully digital using a FPGA device. It is demonstrated that the proposed concept shows proper balancing behaviour, low output ripple and allows maximum battery utilization. © VDE Verlag GMBH - Berlin.",,"Active charge balancing; Ah capacities; Battery cells; Cell balancing; Control schemes; Dc micro-grid; FPGA devices; Generation units; Low-voltage; Micro grid; Multi-cell batteries; Multilevel converter; P-type; Phase-shifted PWM; Reconfigurable; Renewable energies; Specific time; Storage systems; Storage units; DC-DC converters; Energy management; Exhibitions; Intelligent robots; Reconfigurable hardware; Power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874169411

Power systems and the codes of their operation will be modified to take into account the specific characteristics of variable renewable energy operation (wind energy, photovoltaics). A number of issues arise in the context of developing new generation expansion planning methodologies, under a large scale penetration of renewable energy. A probabilistic approach is necessary due to the strong stochastic nature of variable (non dispatchable) renewables incorporating the statistics of the customer load and the non dispatchable RES generation. The level of penetration of variable renewable energy has to be calculated according to restrictions implied by the energy curtailment which can occur when the customer load is low and RES generation is high. Hydro pumped storage plants decrease this curtailment and consequently increase the level of RES penetration. In addition, fast reserve capacity is required to deal with big variations of variable RES energy generation. In summary the necessary storage and reserve capacity has to be calculated and incorporated in the costs of different scenarios related to expansion planning or operation simulation. In addition, grid costs mainly related to the Transmission System Expansion have to be calculated since they are related to the penetration of areas with high RES potential. In the present paper an attempt is made to incorporate such costs in the TIMES model in order to have a more accurate approach of generation expansion scenarios, incorporating storage, reserve plants and Transmission System expansion in the cost of RES technologies. Using the results as an input, a more detailed probabilistic approach is used to calculate the relevant production costs under a wide-scale penetration of RES. Methodologies presented here are based on the so called residual load duration curves approach. © 2012 IEEE.","Electricity system expansion planning; High RES penetration","Electricity system; Energy generations; Expansion planning; Generation expansion; Generation expansion planning; High RES penetration; Hydro pumped storages; Operation simulation; Photovoltaics; Probabilistic approaches; Production cost; Renewable energies; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewables; Reserve capacity; Residual load; Stochastic nature; Transmission system expansion; Variable renewable energies; Developing countries; Lead acid batteries; Wind power; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874099171

Of their different characteristics and challenges, network lifetime and efficiency are the most considered issues in WSN-based systems. The scarcest WSN's resource is energy, and one of the most energy-expensive operations is route discovery and data transmission. This paper presents a novel design of a cooperative nodes learning scheme for cooperative energy-efficient routing (CEERA) in wireless sensor networks. In CEERA, nodes perform a cooperative learning in delivering data to the base station. The retransmission of packets is controlled through an address-based timer. CEERA achieves overhead reduction and energy conservation by controlling various parameters that affect the overall network efficiency. Performance results are evaluated using NS2 simulator and our own implemented event-driven simulation.

The ever growing number of application areas requires a diverse set of algorithms with disparate processing needs. The wireless sensor networks also need to adapt to the prevailing energy conditions and processing requirements. The preceding reasons rule out the use of a single fixed design. Instead a general purpose design that can rapidly adapt to different conditions and requirements is desired. In lieu of the traditional inflexible wireless sensor node consisting of a micro-controller, radio transceiver, sensor array and energy storage, we propose a rapidly reconfigurable miniature sensor node, implemented with a transport triggered architecture processor on a low-power Flash FPGA.

The implemented processors and algorithms are intended for rolling bearing condition monitoring, but can be fully extended for other applications as well. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Application area; Application fields; Energy condition; Flash fpga; Floating point implementation; Floating points; General purpose; Low Power; Miniature sensors; Processing needs; Radio transceivers; Reconfigurable; Rolling bearings; Silicon area; Transport triggered architecture; Wireless sensor node; Algorithms; Bearings (machine parts); Computer simulation; Condition monitoring; Digital arithmetic; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873554935

Recent research shows that cluster-based routing has many advantages in increasing network performance. ARPEES, OEDSR, HPEQ are such efficient cluster-based routing protocols, however they all create only one optimal route from data source to the base station (BS) and this route can be broken when the power of sensor nodes are extremely negligible. In this paper, we propose a multipath solution for event-driven cluster-based routing in WSN called Energy-Aware Mesh Routing Protocol (EMRP) with main design features: reliable data transmission, load balance and energy efficiency. In addition, by using the residual energy as main parameter for dynamically switching between two alternative paths, EMRP can be also deployed for purpose of virtualization of WSN. The simulation results show that our solution achieves better performance than other event-driven cluster-based routing protocols. © 2012 IEEE.","Cluster-based; energy-aware; event-driven; fault-tolerant; multipath; wsn","Cluster-based; Energy aware; Event-driven; Fault-tolerant; Multipath; wsn; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Network performance; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873535124

Advantages of a multipath data delivery protocol can be realized if there exist large number of paths in the network.

Therefore, we propose minor modifications to a basic multipath approach so that it does not require large number of multipaths. We augment multipath approach with only one per hop retransmission. Through analytical models and trace driven simulations, we show that the data delivery probability of the proposed approach is generally higher than the multipath approach.

The availability of water required for cooling is becoming more limited especially in the arid areas where parabolic trough CSTP plants are located. This has prompted the use of dry (air) cooling to condense the steam turbine exhaust vapor. However the capital costs of a dry cooled plant are approximately 5% higher than a wet cooled plant. The cost of electricity from a dry cooled plant is over 10% higher than that from a wet cooled plant. The energy losses that occur in dry cooled make it less efficient compared to wet cooling. The net energy production of a dry cooled plant is low and hence achieves lower capacity values. This paper presents compares dry and wet cooled parabolic trough CSTP plants with two-tank indirect storage system in terms of energy production, solar to electricity energy conversion efficiency, water consumption, land usage, capacity factor and levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for CSTP deployment in Lowdar, Kenya. © 2012 IEEE.","capacity factor; concentrating solar thermal power (CSTP); dry cooling; levelised cost of electricity; parabolic trough; thermal energy storage; wet Cooling","Capacity factors; Cost of electricity; Dry cooling; Parabolic trough; Solar thermal power; Wet cooling; Arid regions; Conversion efficiency; Costs; Electricity; Energy dissipation; Heat storage; Solar heating; Thermal energy; Vapors; Water supply; Cooling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873310214

It proposes a market for energy imbalance to counteract primarily intermittency of wind and solar generations.

This paper supposes that wind generators offer as a firm capacity product into the wholesale electricity market. An algorithm is presented to determine the hydro-wind-DR operating strategy for 24 hours; ahead of real-time operations in order to minimize cost or maximize the generator's profit. The algorithm uses i) hydro generation from the small storages in a river chain to mitigate the wind generation variability, ii) Demand response (DR) and iii) variable penalty prices in the objective function to incentivize combined hydro, wind and DR to minimize the deviation from a committed schedule and iv) environment constraints on hydrology.

In this way it is possible to identify the best possible methods that would allow the integration of the wind turbines into the energy production mix. The paper shows that the parallel operation of wind turbines and conventional plants within a system is possible and reduces the negative effects of the integration of renewable sources in the energy system. In this case, if the conventional power plant compensates the power variations of the wind farm, then the specific investment necessary for the energy storage decreases thus leading to a smaller specific investment for the construction of the wind farms. The results reveal the necessity of a differentiated CO2 emission tax calculated at system level and not at the level of the conventional power plants. This is important because sometimes the increased CO2 emissions of the conventional power plants might lead to an overall decrease of the CO2 emissions at system level (for example when conventional plants are operating at partial loads in order to allow an increased electricity production of the wind turbines). In this case calculating the CO2 emissions for the entire system leads to a smaller increase of the price of the electrical energy, thus decreasing the negative effect of the construction of new wind farms. © 2012 IEEE.",,"CO2 emissions; Combined heat and power plants; Conventional power plants; Electrical energy; Electricity production; Energy productions; Energy systems; Entire system; Parallel operations; Partial load; Power variations; Renewable sources; Specific investment; System levels; Wind farm; Carbon dioxide; Electric utilities; Investments; Power plants; Wind turbines; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873190903

One of the target areas is the revision of the current safety concepts and adoption of new ideas. An important safety issue which draws great attention is the station blackout event, caused by loss of all offsite and onsite alternating current (AC) power supply. The station blackout event has a substantial share in the core damage frequency in most of the existing nuclear power plants. Therefore, the need for mitigation of this event applying alternate AC (AAC) power sources or additional standby emergency AC (EAC) power sources is identified. In this paper a new idea, which relies on an existing technology, adopted as an emergency AC power source, is presented. The idea is based on independent electrical connection between the nearest pumped-storage hydro plant (PSHP) and the NPP of interest. The PSHPs are used as an energy storage capacity for the base load units such as the NPPs, therefore significantly increasing the economy and reliability of power production. The objective of this paper is to analyze the impact to core damage frequency due to added PSHP used as an independent power source. The approach extends probabilistic safety assessment from its original use, which is focused to consideration of on-site safety systems to extended use in order to consider other, off-site systems in addition. The fault tree and event tree models of the selected NPP are modified in this sense. The risk analysis is not considering the economic aspects. The obtained results show significant decrease of core damage frequency, which indicates improvement of safety if the PSHP is introduced.","Nuclear power plant; Probabilistic safety assessment; Pumped-storage hydro plant; Station blackout","AC power source; Alternating current; Base-loads; Core damage frequency; Current safety; Economic aspects; Electrical connection; Energy storage capacity; Event trees; Fault-trees; Nuclear power plant safeties; Power production; Power sources; Power supply; Probabilistic safety assessment; Pumped-storage hydro; Safety issues; Station blackout; Electric connectors; Nuclear power plants; Reliability; Safety engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873161123

The items date to the Early, Middle and Late Cycladic Bronze Age (c. 3000-1600 bc) and include materials or pigments found in their natural state, in specifically made forms or inside vessels. Some of the contexts do not provide any indication of the pigments' use, storage, trade or application. Among the investigated materials, which include red and yellow ochres and blue riebeckite, are those that can be associated with pigments that were widely used in the past in wall paintings or to decorate pottery. There is also evidence for the selective use of purple pigments, which were derived from shellfish, in wall paintings. However, there are other raw colouring materials, such as lead pigments that have not been previously known to have been used in wall paintings or in any other applications during the prehistoric period in the Aegean. A thorough macro- and microscopic visual examination of the quality and morphology of these items enabled the identification of physical features (colour, homogeneity, grain size and shape) that indicate their nature or degree of processing. To identify the mineral composition of the pigments and to investigate their provenance from a geological perspective, quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted. For those samples requiring additional information on their composition and for the refining or confirming of the XRD data, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), micro-Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies were performed. This work is part of a larger project, supported by Institute for Aegean Prehistory, that aims to clarify major archaeological queries that are not restricted to the identification of the nature, composition and provenance of the colouring materials but extend to aspects of their selection, preparation and application techniques used during the Early to the Late Bronze Age. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Akrotiri, Thera, Greece; Archaeological context; Bronze Age; FT-IR; micro-Raman spectroscopies; Raw pigments; SEM-EDX; X-ray diffraction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873037495

Being the energy storage designed according to the requirements of the electric traction system, many additional features are somewhat limited. However, in certain situations, the energy stored on board can be used for conventional electrical networks, without affecting the performance of the electric vehicle. This article addresses the reactive power compensation as a feature inherent to the vehicle-to-grid connection. In this paper, the battery set on board of the electric vehicle supplies the traction system and a single phase inverter, which is connected to an ordinary AC grid. The inverter is controlled in order to supply current to the AC grid in order to compensate the AC grid power factor. The performed analysis is based on the PQ theory getting the current component that should be driven by the single phase inverter. This compensation, at this stage only compensates the fundamental component of the current and neglects the effects of the harmonics.

In the first one the VSI is connected to a synchronous generator which could be considered as a large capacity grid or infinite busbar. The second operating mode is obtained when the VSI is feeding an isolated load and several small micro-sources. Therefore, for a proper operation of this system, the VSI has to be controlled in order to operate in the grid-connected or stand-alone modes, with seamless transfer between them. This paper proposes a master-slave control strategy for the main energy storage VSI operating in a microgrid. The proposed control strategy achieves seamless transfer between these two situations with minimal communication requirements between the VSI and the micro-grid controller, and allows the VSI to operate in parallel with virtually any type of generator or inverter. The control scheme is formulated for a micro-grid operated using conventional droop strategy. A control strategy is proposed for each of the VSI control levels. The control strategies have been experimentally tested in a full practical micro-grid implemented in a small village located in the Chilean Andes. Experimental results are presented and analyzed in this paper. © 2012 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; distributed power generation; micro-grid; micro-source controller; power inverter; smart micro-grid","Battery energy storage systems; Battery storage system; Control level; Control schemes; Control strategies; Dual modes; Experimental validations; Grid-connected; Isolated loads; Master slave control; Micro grid; Micro sources; Operating modes; Power inverters; Seamless transfer; Stand-alone modes; Voltage source inverter; Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Industrial electronics; Synchronous generators; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872941637

Thereby, through the energy stored in the batteries, these vehicles can be used to regulate the active and the reactive power, as local Energy Storage Systems. This way, EVs can contribute to help the power grid to regulate the active and reactive power flow in order to stabilize the production and consumption of energy. For this propose should be defined usage profiles, controlled by a collaborative broker, taking into account the requirements of the power grid and the conveniences of the vehicle user. Besides, the interface between the power grid and the EVs, instead of using typical power converters that only work on unidirectional mode, need to use bidirectional power converters to charge the batteries (G2V - Grid-to-Vehicle mode) and to deliver part of the stored energy in the batteries back to the power grid (V2G - Vehicle-to-Grid mode). With the bidirectional power converter topology presented in this paper, the consumed current is sinusoidal and it is possible to regulate the power factor to control the reactive power, aiming to contribute to mitigate power quality problems in the power grid.

For high voltage applications, batteries cells are connected in series, raising the issue of voltage balancing among cells. This paper presents a new structure of active voltage balancing of Li-ion cells associated in series in battery stack. It is based on the use of micro-converters network. The principle of the charge equalization is to derive energy from an overcharged cell and to transfer it to an undercharged cell no matter whether the battery is currently in charge or in use supplying a load. The highlight of this structure is not only its high efficiency and its ease of implement but moreover, its integration capacity in contrast to state of the art passive and active balancing topologies. A monitoring system is required to perform forced balancing.

The microgrid should be able to work both in grid-connected and island mode, while its voltage and frequency deviations follow the EN 50160 standard. The use of energy storage system is generally recommended in order to absorb the mismatches between the demand and the generation side and to preserve the quality of the microgrid voltage.

Previous research has focused on the improvement of FRT capability as long as the generator is still connected to the grid. The existence of distributed generation units in the power system has consequences for the conventional protection devices, as they might become blind to overcurrents and short circuits. This paper proposes the disconnection of the wind power unit when a fault occurs in the grid and the voltage does not recover within a time limit. The energy produced during the fault is stored in a Supercapacitor Energy Storage System, allowing the generator to stay functional for a period of time, despite being disconnected from the grid.

Two methods are developed. The first method is based on the average annual monthly values in which the size of photovoltaic (PV) and wind generators is determined from the average monthly contribution of each component. In the second method, the determination of the size of these two components of the system is based on the worst month. The data comes from the local meteorological station. The consumption profile which has been adopted corresponds to the profile typically found in isolated sites. The optimization was performed taking into account the economic parameter to find the technical and economic optimum configuration. The results show that the studied site is well adapted for solar and wind applications. The sunshine duration is over 2000 hours annually. The energy acquired daily on a horizontal surface can exceed 7kWh/m2 in the summer period and it is annually in the order of 1780 kWh/m2 for a horizontal plane and can exceed 2000 kWh/m2 for an optimal tilt. The average annual wind speed at a 10m height is 3.61m/s and the monthly average speed is over 4m/s in the period of March, April and May.

Nowadays, deduplication is also becoming appealing in cloud computing, where large-scale virtualized storage infrastructures hold huge data volumes with a significant share of duplicated content. There have thus been several proposals for embedding deduplication in storage appliances and file systems, providing different performance trade-offs while targeting both user and application data, as well as virtual machine images. It is however hard to determine to what extent is deduplication useful in a particular setting and what technique will provide the best results. In fact, existing disk I/O micro-benchmarks are not designed for evaluating deduplication systems, following simplistic approaches for generating data written that lead to unrealistic amounts of duplicates. We address this with DEDISbench, a novel micro-benchmark for evaluating disk I/O performance of block based deduplication systems. As the main contribution, we introduce the generation of a realistic duplicate distribution based on real datasets. Moreover, DEDISbench also allows simulating access hotspots and different load intensities for I/O operations. The usefulness of DEDISbench is shown by comparing it with Bonnie++ and IOzone open-source disk I/O micro-benchmarks on assessing two open-source deduplication systems, Opendedup and Lessfs, using Ext4 as a baseline. As a secondary contribution, our results lead to novel insight on the performance of these file systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Benchmark; Cloud Computing; Deduplication; Storage","Application data; Archival systems; Benchmark; Block based; Data volume; Deduplication; Disk I/O; File systems; Hotspots; I/O operations; Load intensity; Micro-benchmark; Open-source; Performance trade-off; Real data sets; Storage infrastructure; Storage systems; Virtual machines; Cloud computing; Energy storage; Virtual storage; Internet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872775333

To improve disaster preparations, we aimed to use scenario development and linear programming to identify the lowest-cost foods for emergency storage. Methods We used NZ food price data (e.g., from the Food Price Index) and nutritional data from a NZ food composition database. Different scenarios were modelled in Excel and R along with uncertainty analysis. Results A collection of low-cost emergency storage foods that meet daily energy requirements for men were identified e.g., at a median purchase cost of NZ$2.21 per day (equivalent to US$1.45) (95% simulation interval = NZ$2.04 to 2.38). In comparison, the cost of such a collection of foods which did not require cooking, was NZ$3.67 per day. While meeting all nutritional recommendations (and not just energy) is far from essential in a disaster setting, if such nutritionally optimised foods are purchased for storage, then the cost would be higher (NZ$7.10 per day). Where a zero level of food spoilage was assumed (e.g., storage by a government agency), the cost of purchasing food for storage was as low as NZ$1.93 per day. Conclusions It appears to cost very little to purchase basic emergency foods for storage in the current New Zealand setting. The lists of the foods identified could be considered by organisations who participate in disaster relief (civil defence) but also by citizens. © NZMA.",,"algorithm; animal product; article; canned food; cereal; cost; disaster planning; food; food spoilage; food storage; fruit; government; grain; human; New Zealand; nut; nutritional assessment; nutritional value; plant seed; vegetable; Disasters; Emergencies; Food Storage; Humans; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872768452

The infantile form is the most severe with a rapidly fatal outcome, while the late onset form has a greater phenotypic variability, characterized by skeletal muscle dysfunction and early respiratory involvement. Bone mineral density (BMD) has been recently reported to be reduced in many patients with both forms of the disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is now available with an undefined, impact on BMD in patients with late onset disease. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate BMD in patients with late onset form of Pompe disease before and after ERT initiation. Patients and Methods: Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was examined in four newly diagnosed patients with late onset Pompe disease and in four adults under ERT before and after ERT initiation with a treatment duration of 18 to 36 months. Results: The initial DEXA showed normal total body BMD z-score in all the patients, while L2-L4 and femoral neck BMD was reduced in three and two patients, respectively. After ERT administration, two patients had an improvement in L2-L4 lumbar spine and one patient in femoral neck BMD z-score with values within normal range. Conclusions: The results suggested that regional BMD may moderately reduce in some patients with the late onset form of Pompe disease, although profound osteopenia was not observed. The improvement of measurements in L2-L4 and femoral neck BMD zscore in some patients with low pre-treatment values after ERT administration needs to be confirmed in larger scale studies. © 2012 Research Institute For Endocrine Sciences and Iran Endocrine Society; Published by Kowsar Corp.","α-Glucosidase; Bone density; Pompe disease","alpha glucosidase; recombinant glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; absence of side effects; adult; aged; article; body fat; bone density; clinical article; clinical assessment; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme replacement; female; femur neck; glycogen storage disease type 2; human; lean body weight; lumbar spine; male; osteopenia; scoring system; treatment duration; treatment response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872575794

Model 1 assumes that the work power is linear with the work rate, while Model 2 assumes a linear relationship between the alactic anaerobic power and the rate of change of the aerobic power. In order to test these models, a cross country skier ran with poles on a treadmill at different exercise intensities. The aerobic power, based on the measured oxygen uptake, was used as input to the models, whereas the simulated blood lactate concentration was compared with experimental results. Thereafter, the metabolic rate from phosphocreatine break down was calculated theoretically. Finally, the models were used to compare phosphocreatine break down during continuous and interval exercises. Results: Good similarity was found between experimental and simulated blood lactate concentration during steady state exercise intensities. The measured blood lactate concentrations were lower than simulated for intensities above the lactate threshold, but higher than simulated during recovery after high intensity exercise when the simulated lactate concentration was averaged over the whole lactate space. This fit was improved when the simulated lactate concentration was separated into two compartments; muscles + internal organs and blood. Model 2 gave a better behavior of alactic energy than Model 1 when compared against invasive measurements presented in the literature. During continuous exercise, Model 2 showed that the alactic energy storage decreased with time, whereas Model 1 showed a minimum value when steady state aerobic conditions were achieved. During interval exercise the two models showed similar patterns of alactic energy. Conclusions: The current study provides useful insight on the kinetics of anaerobic power. Overall, our data indicate that blood lactate levels can be accurately modeled during steady state, and suggests a linear relationship between the alactic anaerobic power and the rate of change of the aerobic power. © 2012 Moxnes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Blood lactate; Cross-country skier; Mathematical model; Oxygen uptake; Phosphocreatine","anaerobic growth; article; biological model; biomechanics; computer simulation; exercise; human; kinetics; male; physiology; skeletal muscle; Anaerobiosis; Biomechanics; Computer Simulation; Exercise; Humans; Kinetics; Male; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872559375

In such nodes, most of the energy is consumed when transmitting or receiving data. Sleep-wake scheduling mechanism is an effective way how to prolong node's lifetime. However, this mechanism can result in delays because a transmitting node has to wait until his neighbor wakes up. Another solution is event-driven communication model, where nodes communicate in case an event occurs. Although, events occur asynchronously, the node needs to send a keep alive message periodically. An event can be caused by very high temperature (indicating fire), or presence of movement in a surveillance system. Good communication pattern can reduce energy consumption. However, the main issue remains the design of network node power unit. We propose supercapacitor power unit circuit which is charged from solar cells and discuss a sensor node energy balance. © 2012 Polish Info Processing Socit.",,"Communication models; Communication pattern; High temperature; Keep-alive; Network node; Power units; Scheduling mechanism; Super capacitor; Surveillance systems; Wireless sensor; Wireless sensor node; Capacitors; Communication; Computer science; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Information systems; Information theory; Wakes; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872548423

Cooking oil emulsions generally perform as physical control agents, they comply with the world trend toward minimal tolerance of toxic residues, not particularly in agricultural produce, and they are intended for immediate application. Emulsion stability was addressed mainly by reducing the oil droplet size. Reducing emulsion droplet size consumes energy; therefore, a compact, inexpensive, energy-efficient, continuous mechanical emulsifier was developed to enable on-site continuous emulsification. Cooking oils are generally inexpensive and easy to conserve, so on-site emulsion production is potentially inexpensive for growers. Energy consumption and droplet diameter of emulsions produced by this emulsifier were compared with emulsions produced by ultrasonic oscillator technology. Energy consumption of the mechanical system increased from 1.9 to 10.2 J mL -1 as rotational speed increased from 2000 to 5000 rpm and the average droplet diameter (D32) decreased from 7.5 to 4.1 μm, whereas the ultrasonic energy required to produce 1 mL of oil-in-water emulsion increased from approximately 10 to 50 J while average droplet diameter (D 32) decreased from approximately 6 to 2.6 μm. The ultrasonic system produced smaller droplet sizes but presently can only operate on batches in the laboratory. Energy consumption of the mechanical system was lower and since the droplet sizes were fine for the required storage duration and the system could operate continuously, it was favored for on-site operation. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Cooking oils; Emulsifier; Pest control; Physical control agents; Sprayer.","Control agent; Cooking oil; Droplet diameters; Droplet sizes; Emulsifier; Emulsion droplets; Emulsion production; Emulsion stability; Energy efficient; Mechanical systems; Oil droplets; Oil-in-water emulsions; On-site production; Physical control; Rotational speed; Sprayer; Technical notes; Ultrasonic energy; Ultrasonic oscillators; Ultrasonic system; Drops; Emulsification; Emulsions; Energy utilization; Mechanical engineering; Mechanics; Pest control; Oils and fats; cooking appliance; diameter; droplet; economic analysis; energy conservation; manufacturing; mechanical property; oil; pest control; spray; stabilization; technological development; tolerance; toxic substance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872512144

Besides, it is commonly used by power systems analysts who use it as input data for simulation programs. The parameter is defined as kinetic energy per apparent power unit. It has the advantage of conferring simplicity to the motion equation of the unit connected to a power system, with the torques and speeds expressed per unit, and the time expressed in seconds. With regards to this parameter and the motion equation, there seems to be a certain level of confusion, mainly among people without the necessary expertise related to both, power systems stability and electrical rotating machines. Apart from being a parameter used exclusively in complex stability simulation programs, it is a useful parameter that can be used in simple calculations for obtaining a rapid and reliable idea about the dynamic behavior of the rotating unit, without the need of neither using sophisticated computing programs, nor memorizing values of torques and angular speeds in the traditional units. Considering the communication between the different parties involved in the problem, the aims of this paper are: - to refresh the concept of inertia constant for those people who are not familiar with it; - to clarify some eventual misunderstandings, - to spread out its use by means of some simple examples which make the concept more understandable; - to contribute to having better communication among power systems analysts, generator manufacturers and turbine designers. Besides, this paper is intended to show the impact of the inertia on the generator investment cost, performance, dimensioning and the settings of some associated equipment. Therefore, the following items are analyzed: - The Investment cost of a hydro-generator as the value of the specified GD2 or H varies from a minimum ""natural value"" to a specified higher value, having the same level of efficiency. - The influence of the inertia on the dimensioning of some associated systems is also analyzed; for example, the case of the dimensioning of the starting system of the unit when it works in pump mode at a pumped storage facility. - The risk of resonance between the natural oscillation frequency of the generator rotor and the exciting frequencies coming from the turbine. - The treatment of the inertia constant value after the unit has been refurbished with a new rated power. - The optimal settings of governor parameters for those cases in which the hydro-generator operates in islanding mode. Different cause-effect relationships are analyzed around the inertia of the unit. The impact of GD2 specifications are shown in terms of the cost and efficiencies obtained, and some recommended practices are suggested when special calculations are required.","Accelerating torque; Acceleration time; Flywheel effect; Inertia constant","Acceleration time; Angular speed; Apparent power; Cause-effect relationships; Complex stability; Computing program; Dynamic behaviors; Exciting frequency; Flywheel effect; Generator rotors; Hydro generator; Inertia constants; Input datas; Investment costs; Islanding; Natural oscillation frequency; Optimal setting; Per unit; Pumped Storage; Recommended practice; Rotating machine; Simulation program; Starting systems; Systems analysts; Turbine designers; Communication; Computer simulation; Digital storage; Efficiency; Electric machinery; Equations of motion; Kinetics; Machinery; System stability; Turbines; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872121195

As so, it has a focus on the companies' performance, considering equally the environmental, social and economic aspects in the decision making processes. More than take into account the profit, the people and the planet, as intended by the term known as ""triple bottom line"", Corporate Sustainability also ascribes a central role to communication and the involvement of a plurality of legitimate actors (""stakeholders"") in decision-making, just as Sustainable Development principles do. Beyond the recognized environmental, social and economic issues, the communication is also a challenge and a condition to achieve the sustainable pattern. This specific challenge includes conveying sustainable development values in public relations, marketing and all other forms of public or corporate communication, in a way to guarantee the engagement of the different stakeholders. According to the International Finance Corporation - IFC (2007), an important development in stakeholder engagement since the early 1990s has been the rapid growth in reporting on environmental performance. The IFC demonstrate that one of the benefits of good reporting is that sharing credible performance information provides a solid base for future dialogue. The value of stakeholder engagement to reporting is also recognized under the principle of inclusivity in the Global Reporting Initiative's sustainability reporting guidelines. A review of the State of Art realized by CEPEL (2007a) shows that the companies of electric sector all over the world are following that tendency and trying to improve stakeholder communication and engagement. These two aspects play an important role in the electric sector as it could be noted that it is much more mentioned the negative impacts to the environment and to the communities due to the construction and operation of hydropower plants, thermoelectric plants, transmission and distribution lines than the benefits that it brings to the society, as the improvement of the access to energy, and to regional and local environments. In Brazil, ELETROBRAS is also focused on those sustainability challenges, including the communication ones, in such a way that it has turned into an strategic issue, incorporated in the company Strategic Planning. The IGS Project (Indicators for the Sustainaility Management) has the objective of developing a group of environmental indicators and a computational system for storage, edition, treatment, retrieve and visualization of sustainable information, and is being held by CEPEL, since 2007. The idea is to find the appropriate indicators that, considering the reality of the Brazilian Power Sector, can assist the management of corporate sustainability and the long-term communication strategy, focusing on the social and environmental practices of the company and on dialogue with stakeholders.

Monitoring of voltages and currents gives the network operator information about the performance of their network both for the system as a whole and for individual locations and customers. Developments in enabling technology (monitoring equipment, communication technology, data storage and processing) have made it possible to monitor at a large scale and to record virtually any parameter of interest. While many network operators are installing monitoring equipment and while more and more manufacturers have monitors available, there is a lack of knowledge and agreement on a number of aspects of the monitoring process and in particular on processing the recorded data.

The performance of the machine is first predicted using classical machine theory. Detailed 2-D and 3-D numerical analyses of the machine topology are then presented, and a sensitivity analysis is conducted with the help of the numerical analysis, in which the influence of the PM dimensions on the performance of the machine is investigated.

In common with many other countries, the electricity distribution networks in New Zealand experienced large investments and expansions, particularly in rural areas, during the post war period of 1950 to the late 1970s. In remote rural areas, much of this investment was funded through subsidies and the goodwill of the new customers. During the last decade, some of the lines built in the post war period have reached the end of their design lives: the beginning of an anticipated bow wave of required asset renewal. Many of the remote rural lines nearing end of life are economically marginal (if not negative), they serve communities whose population density has decreased over the years and where the costs of on-going vegetation maintenance have increased due to changing land use towards forestry plantations. At the same time, legislation in New Zealand gives pre 1993 customers the right of continued electricity supply from distribution utilities. The regulatory framework promotes innovation by distribution utilities, their efficient use of resources, benefit sharing with customers and the maintenance of adequate levels of service. Recent changes to legislation allow distributors to provide alternatives to grid supply if acceptable quality and service criteria are met. Over the past five years, as an alternative to renewing the traditional overhead line network supply arrangements, Powerco has been implementing and monitoring Stand Alone Power Systems, whose aim is to continue supplying existing customers at a lower overall (or whole of life) cost than grid supply. These alternative energy systems have been developed using modules that allow the flexibility to cater for the specific energy needs of each customer without the need for specialised hybrid systems for each site. The systems include energy storage modules, load management (inverter) modules, scalable photo voltaic cells, scalable micro-hydro generation, fossil fuel generators, and the use of bottled LPG for stoves and water heating and energy efficient products for lighting and motive power. The modules are designed to facilitate easy installation, commissioning and on-going maintenance. Satellite or mobile communications are used to monitor performance and indicate system failures. Powerco's first Stand Alone Power System was commissioned as a trial in 2008 to supply a wool shed. The direct cost of this investment was $NZ70,000, which alleviated the need to spend around $NZ200,000 in line replacement. The project enabled the viability of an alternative energy system solution to be studied in terms of supply continuity, power quality, maintenance regimes and overall customer acceptability. The trial demonstrated that the Stand Alone Power System solution fulfilled all of the customer's needs, the solution could be installed in one day, capacity can easily be changed if the system is modular, and that the system needs to be installed outside the customer's buildings to allow unimpeded maintenance. This paper describes the features, benefits and drawbacks, and customer perspectives of the Stand Alone Power Systems that Powerco has installed. The break even point between off grid and on grid supply options depends on the nature of the load served, terrain factors and known future developments. Around two kilometres of line per customer has been found to be a rough threshold for analysis to take place. The modules allow a ""plug and play"" energy supply with no specialist skill set required from the customer to operate or maintain the system. This makes the Stand Alone Power System attractive to all electricity users, and interest is coming from new customers in remote areas as a solution for their energy needs using the modular system. At the time of writing, Powerco has installed, and is installing, Stand Alone Power systems at four sites, with a further five sites being planned for the coming year. Each site has different energy needs, ranging from wool sheds with high loads for two weeks per year and low energy consumption for the remainder; single households with consistent daily load patterns throughout the year; and island networks comprising several households, woolsheds and pumps. Even so, we are finding that thus far the Stand Alone Power Systems are meeting the needs of each of the customers seamlessly. That is, apart from some minor maintenance differences, customers are experiencing little difference from being on grid.","Distribution; Photovoltaic; Remote; Rural; SAPS","Alternative energy; Asset renewal; Benefit sharing; Bow waves; Break-even point; Design life; Direct costs; Distribution; Distribution lines; Distribution utilities; Economic benefits; Electricity distribution networks; Electricity supply; Electricity users; End of lives; Energy needs; Energy storage modules; Energy supplies; Energy-efficient products; Forestry plantation; Fossil fuel generators; High load; Load patterns; Low energy consumption; Micro-hydro generation; Mobile communications; Modular system; New zealand; Off-grids; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaics; Plug and play; Population densities; Powerco; Regulatory frameworks; Remote; Remote areas; Remote rural areas; SAPS; Specific energy; Stand alone power systems; System failures; Terrain factors; Water heating; Cost accounting; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Heating; Hybrid systems; Investments; Laws and legislation; Low power electronics; Maintenance; Population statistics; Rural areas; Systems engineering; Wool; Yarn; Sales; Accounting; Batteries; Biological Populations; Economics; Electricity; Energy Consumption; Fossil Fuels; Heating; Investment; Legislation; Maintenance; Statistics; Systems Engineering; Wool; Yarn",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872101270

When the vehicle brakes or comes to a stop, the motor on the axle generates electricity which is stored in a super capacitor storage device housed on the roof of the vehicle. Then, when the driver sets off over the first few hundred yards, this energy is transferred back from the super capacitor unit to the drive motors helping to accelerate the vehicle. At this stage the driver does not need to increase engine rpm so less fuel is used.

The most well-known applications of these arrangements are needed in automotive and transportation industry, in devices of emergency starting of internal combustion engines, for supplying pulses of high current in special equipment and so on. Most of these implementations may be developed on the base of conventional electrochemical storage batteries (ESB). ESB are representing the suitable kind of rechargeable electrical sources and may be applicable in moveable equipment. But the power parameters of batteries compare to their dimensions leave much to be desired. If the high power (current) is required (together with the small dimensions of the energy system) the employ of ESB only is not really capable. The synergetic combination of ESB together with UC seems to be very promising solution in this case. A conjunction between these two different energy sources links together the outstanding power characteristics of UC with relatively high specific energy of ESB. However, the combination of these devices requires decisions of some technical problems. For example, when the voltages of UC and ESB a priori are different, and this difference is used for special goal, for example to provide high load current when the battery is weak and unable to deliver the needed power. The special inverter has to be included between UC and ESB in this case. Its major function is providing UC charging from ESB. The problem of UC charging is stemming from its very small (sometimes negligible) internal resistance and usual connection between terminals of UC and ESB may cause to the serious difficulties such as a very high equalizing current, small charging efficiency and diminished battery's service life. These problems become expremely smart when UC before charging is fully or partially empty. Additional serious difficulties are associated with electric security needs. This kind of devices are equipped, as a rule, with flexible cables are being ended by special clamps for load connecting. An occasionally shortening of these clamps during a device leading to a load may cause serious troubles. Thus, the preventing of such cases depicts an important technical challenge. The supplementary problem is represented by the need to switch the power supply on at the right moment of time and only after this device will be connected by cables to the load. This problem is issuing in principle from the previous one. If it will be solved this would solve automatically the first problem too because the switching power supply at the needed moment of time means that shortening of clamps before their connection to the load will not cause any damage. Thus, this device has to be equipped with special power circuit and it's control system which algorithm will i) avoid occasionally clamp shortening ii) will define the moment of time when the load has to be connected to the power supply. The presented work is dealing with the research and development of this kind of compact electric source where conventional ESB is used with UC, a special electronic circuit provides the optimal connection between these two electrical devices and makes available the protected functionality of the entire energy system. © 2012 IEEE.","control system; Electrochemical storage batteries (ESB); power BUCK/BOOSTcharge circuit; ultracapacitor (UC)","Charging efficiency; Electric sources; Electrical devices; Electrochemical storage; Energy source; Energy systems; Flexible cable; High currents; High load; Internal resistance; Power characteristic; Power circuit; Power parameters; Power supply; Research and development; Specific energy; Switching power supplies; Technical challenges; Transportation industry; Ultracapacitors; Cables; Capacitors; Control systems; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Internal combustion engines; Land vehicle propulsion; Power electronics; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871975282

To investigate efficiency of information dissemination in wireless networks, epidemic models have been employed to study message forwarding delays, presuming message delivery whenever an opportunistic contact occurs. A practical concern is typically neglected, that one mobile user may only be willing to pass information onto others with social ties, rather than anyone upon contact. Under such a constraint, information dissemination may behave differently, according to the pattern of social ties that exist in the network. In this paper, we model social-aware epidemic forwarding in mobile social networks using mean-field equations, and carefully study the end-to-end unicast message propagation delays under different levels of social ties among users. Both cases of limited and unlimited message validity are considered in our models, i.e., whether relay nodes may delete a message after carrying it for some finite time T or never. Through careful theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we made a number of intriguing observations: First, the topology of social relation graphs significantly influences message forwarding delays, i.e., the more skewed the social relationship distribution is, the larger delay it results in. Second, the average delivery delay remains fairly stable with the growth of system scale, presenting a sharp contrast with the case without social awareness. Third, we observe that with a moderate choice of T, message delivery can achieve a successful ratio of almost 100% with an expected delay very close to the case of unlimited validity, signifying that a good tradeoff can be achieved between end-to-end message delivery efficiency and energy/storage overhead at the relay nodes in a network. All these provide useful guidance for efficient information dissemination protocol design in practical mobile social networks. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Delivery delay; Empirical studies; Epidemic models; Expected delay; Finite time; Information dissemination protocols; Mean-field equations; Message delivery; Message forwarding; Mobile social networks; Mobile users; Relay node; Sharp contrast; Social awareness; Social relations; Social relationships; Social ties; Social-aware; Unicast messages; Global system for mobile communications; Information dissemination; Topology; Social networking (online)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871972952

In this context, several marking techniques have been proposed to traceback the attacker IP address or network. These schemes have shown limitations when dealing with the investigation of attacks since they are unable to reconstruct the attacker actions, and tolerate any form of missing traces or marks. In addition, these schemes are vulnerable to mark spoofing and altering. To deal with these limitations, we propose in this paper an outbound global marking scheme which uses a novel structure, called mark association, that holds enriched information about the intruder activity either at the network, system or storage level. The proposed scheme enables the monitoring of the intruder activity, the tracking of occurred events, the traceback of the attackers source addresses, in addition to the reconstruction of attack scenarios. The capabilities of the proposed scheme are illustrated through a distributed attack performed against the monitored environment. © 2012 IEEE.","dependency graph; investigation; mark association; storage","Attack scenarios; Dependency graphs; Distributed attack; investigation; IP addresss; Novel structures; OR-networks; Research fields; Source address; Storage level; Traceback; Energy storage; Communication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871961710

In a typical VRB, the proton exchange membrane (PEM) separates two compartments (positive and negative), each filled with vanadium sulfate in dilute sulfuric acid [2]. The function of the PEM is to allow proton flow, and to prevent the flow of other cations - specifically vanadium ions, which are present in the electrolyte solution on both sides of the PEM. In practice, however, existing PEMs have only limited cation selectivity, and this property influences the dynamic behavior of the battery and its energy efficiency. The present paper models VRB dynamic behavior including the presence of contaminants in the electrolytes. Coupled differential equations for the various ion flows were solved numerically using the Simulink subroutine of MATLAB and compared with a series of measurements performed on an actual VRB. © 2012 IEEE.","contamination properties of proton exchange membrane; dynamic behavior; numerical solution by Simulink(MATLAB); system of differential equations; Vanadium redox batteries","Dynamic behaviors; Proton exchange membranes; Simulink; System of differential equations; Vanadium redox batteries; Differential equations; Electrolytes; Energy efficiency; Positive ions; Renewable energy resources; Sulfuric acid; Vanadium; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871961019

Anti-obesity drugs affect different targets in the central nervous system or peripheral tissues and improve regulatory and metabolic disturbances that contribute to the development of obesity. Anti-obesity medications provide modest additional fat loss to that achieved by lifestyle modification alone, reduce visceral fat stores, improve programme adherence, weight loss maintenance, diminish obesity-related health risks and improve a quality of life. Anti-obesity drugs do play a role in weight management. Their replacement with placebo is followed by weight regain. Due to adverse events, several anti-obesity drugs were withdrawn from the market over the past few years and currently only orlistat remains available for long-term obesity management. Drug withdrawals, failure of clinical trials with several new anti-obesity compounds as well as inappropriate demands of drug regulating agencies concerning the study protocol led to scepticism about the perspectives in the pharmacotherapy of obesity. However, recently developed anti-obesity medications such as gut hormone analogues and drug combinations provided encouraging results in terms of weight loss, safety and improvement of cardio-metabolic health risks. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Anti-obesity drugs; Efficacy; Lifestyle modification; Novel compounds; Obesity treatment; Safety","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; amfebutamone plus zonisamide; amfepramone; antiobesity agent; cetilistat; dapiclermin; dexfenfluramine; ecopipam; exendin 4; fenfluramine; gastrointestinal hormone; human growth hormone[176-191][176 tyrosine]; liraglutide; lorcaserin; mazindol; metreleptin; otenabant; oxyntomodulin; peptide YY [3-36]; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; pramlintide; rimonabant; sibutramine; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; taranabant; tesofensine; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; unindexed drug; abdominal obesity; anorexia; anxiety disorder; binge eating disorder; birth defect; blood brain barrier; blood pressure variability; cardiovascular disease; central nervous system; cognitive defect; comorbidity; constipation; depression; diabetes mellitus; diet therapy; dizziness; dopamine release; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug induced headache; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dysgeusia; energy balance; energy expenditure; fatigue; food intake; glycemic control; health hazard; heart disease; human; insomnia; insulin sensitivity; intraabdominal fat; lifestyle modification; lipid absorption; lipid storage; mental disease; metabolic disorder; monotherapy; mood disorder; nausea; neurotoxicity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; paresthesia; physical activity; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; satiety; side effect; suicidal ideation; thermogenesis; unspecified side effect; urinary tract infection; vomiting; weight control; weight reduction; xerostomia; Anti-Obesity Agents; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871834052

Following the selection of the vehicle the appropriate sizing of electrical components was undertaken considering a scaled standardized drive cycle selected to be utilized for testing.

The global growth of data is caused by ubiquitous personal devices, enterprise and scientific applications, etc. As the size of data grows new challenges are emerging in the context of storage management. Modern data and storage resource management systems need to face wide range of problems - minimizing energy consumption (green data centers), optimizing resource usage, throughput and capacity, data availability, security and legal issues, scalability. In addition users or their applications can have QoS (Quality of Service) requirements concerning the storage access, which further complicates the management. To cope with this problem a common mass storage system model taking into account the performance aspects of a storage system becomes a necessity. The model described with semantic technologies brings a semantic interoperability between the system components. In this paper we describe our approach at data management with QoS based on the developed models as a case study for distributed environments.","Data management; Data storage; Quality of service; Service level agreement; Storage system","Data availability; Data centers; Data storage; Developed model; Distributed computing environment; Distributed environments; Global growth; Legal issues; Mass storage system; Performance aspects; Personal devices; QoS (quality of service); QOS management; Resource usage; Scientific applications; Semantic interoperability; Semantic technologies; Service Level Agreements; Storage management; Storage resource management; Storage systems; System components; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Interoperability; Quality of service; Semantics; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871820541

The current trend to meet this requirement includes the data compression and growth of storage capacities. This approach, however, has technical and practical limits. A further reduction of the archived data volume can be achieved by means of an optimisation of the archiving that consists in data selection without losing the useful information. We describe a method of optimised archiving of solar images, based on the selection of images that contain a new information. The new information content is evaluated by means of the analysis of changes detected in the images. We present characteristics of different kinds of image changes and divide them into fictitious changes with a disturbing effect and real changes that provide a new information. In block diagrams describing the selection and archiving, we demonstrate the influence of clouds, the recording of images during an active event on the Sun, including a period before the event onset, and the archiving of long-term history of solar activity. The described optimisation technique is not suitable for helioseismology, because it does not conserve the uniform time step in the archived sequence and removes the information about solar oscillations. In case of long-term synoptic observations, the optimised archiving can save a large amount of storage capacities. The actual capacity saving will depend on the setting of the change-detection sensitivity and on the capability to exclude the fictitious changes. © 2012 SPIE.","Data handling; Sun; Synoptic observations","Archived data; Block diagrams; Change detection; Computer technology; Data Selection; Helioseismology; Information contents; Large data volumes; Optimisations; Solar activity; Solar images; Solar oscillations; Storage capacity; Synoptic observations; Time step; Buildings; Data compression; Data handling; Data reduction; Observatories; Optimization; Solar energy; Sun; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871699290

Although software implementations of TM (STM) have been extensively analyzed in terms of runtime performance, little attention has been paid to an equally important constraint faced by nearly all computer systems: energy consumption. In this work we conduct a comprehensive study of energy and runtime tradeoff sin software transactional memory systems. We characterize the behavior of three state-of-the-art lock-based STM algorithms, along with three different conflict resolution schemes. As a result of this characterization, we propose a DVFS-based technique that can be integrated into the resolution policies so as to improve the energy-delay product (EDP). Experimental results show that our DVFS-enhanced policies are indeed beneficial for applications with high contention levels. Improvements of up to 59% in EDP can be observed in this scenario, with an average EDP reduction of 16% across the STAMP workloads. © 2012 IEEE.","Energy Consumption; Parallel Computing; Transactional Memory","Comprehensive studies; Conflict Resolution; Energy delay product; Multi-core processor; Runtime performance; Runtimes; Software implementation; Software transactional memory; Synchronization mechanisms; Transactional memory; Computer architecture; Computer systems; Energy utilization; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Parallel programming; Storage allocation (computer); Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871645369

The late-onset form of the disease is characterized by progressive skeletal and respiratory muscle dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT, Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA) was recently introduced and resulted in significant prolongation of the life expectancy of the patients with the infantile form while the results were less significant for the late-onset form. It has been postulated that the weak influence of ERT in late-onset patients might be due to a non-effective delivery of the recombinant enzyme to the skeletal muscles perhaps due to the relatively low blood flow to the resting skeletal muscles during infusion. Exercise training acutely increases the blood flow to the exercising muscles. Thus, it was hypothesized that exercise training during enzyme infusion might increase the effectiveness of the ERT therapy. Five late-onset Pompe disease patients receiving ERT and following regular exercise training for approximately 10. months, followed a 6-month period of exercise training during infusion of the recombinant enzyme. Before and after this period, body composition, isometric strength and 6. minute walking distance were determined. Analysis of the results revealed that none of these parameters changed significantly after the 6-month intervention period (e.g. 6 minute walking distance before: 532 ± 31 m, vs after: 527 ± 29 m, P = 0.246). These results suggest that exercise training during infusion may not add significant functional changes in late-onset Pompe patients receiving ERT and undergoing regular exercise training. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","6MWT; Acid maltase deficiency; Lysosomal storage disease; Muscular strength","glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; recombinant glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; absence of side effects; adult; article; body composition; clinical article; drug infusion; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme replacement; exercise; female; follow up; functional assessment; glycogen storage disease type 2; human; life expectancy; male; muscle blood flow; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; onset age; priority journal; skeletal muscle; walking; Adult; Age of Onset; alpha-Glucosidases; Body Composition; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Exercise; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869872640

It was found that Y(BH4)3 and YH3 formed in situ during milling are effective to promote LiBH 4 destabilization but differ substantially from each other in terms of the dehydrogenation pathway. During LiBH4-Y(BH4) 3 dehydriding, Y(BH4)3 decomposes first generating in situ freshly YH3 and subsequently, it destabilizes LiBH4 with the formation of minor amounts of YB4. About 20% of the theoretical hydrogen storage was obtained via the rehydriding of YB4-4LiH-3LiCl at 400 °C and 6.5 MPa. As a novel result, a compound containing (B12H12)2- group was identified during dehydriding of Y(BH4)3. In the case of 4LiBH4-YH3 dehydrogenation, the increase of the hydrogen back pressure favors the formation of crystalline YB4, whereas a reduction to ≤0.1 MPa induces the formation of minor amounts of Li 2B12H12. Although for hydrogen pressures ≤0.1 MPa direct LiBH4 decomposition can occur, the main dehydriding pathway of 4LiBH4-YH3 composite yields YB 4 and LiH. The nanostructured composite obtained by mechanochemical processing gives good hydrogen storage reversibility (about 80%) regardless of the hydrogen back pressure.

The air-suspension process was performed in a Würster coater system with a bottom-spraying atomizer. In the first stage, a solution containing trehalose, maltodextrin, and probiotic cells was spray-coated onto and absorbed by the inert carrier microcrystalline cellulose to produce nonagglomerating dry coated particles with high probiotic cell viability (109 colony-forming units [cfu]/g particles). The effect of inlet air temperature, spray flow rate, solids concentration, cell concentration, and encapsulation formulation on survival was investigated. The inlet air temperature had the most pronounced effect; a 15°C increase in inlet air temperature led to a 250-fold decrease in survival percentage. There was no agglomeration of the coated adsorbed particles at spray flow rates of 1 to 3.5 mL/min. Spraycoating was performed with both laboratory- and pilot-scale Würster systems. Scaling up the equipment from the lab scale to the pilot scale did not affect cell survival percentage. Low solids concentration (&lt;20%) and low probiotic cell concentration (6%) resulted in a fair survival percentage (35-40). Spraying a solution formulation of trehalose-maltodextrin with dextrose equivalent (DE) 3 at a 1:1 ratio provided the best protection in terms of cell viability during the spray-coating process as well during storage. Layering with ethylcellulose (ETHOCEL) provided some protection in a low acidic environment (12%); however, the nonuniform coating and cracks detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging were the main reasons for the layering's relatively poor protection of the cells against humidity, oxygen, and acid environment. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Layering; Microencapsulation; Probiotic; Spraycoating; Storage; Survival","Layering; Microencapsulation; Probiotics; Spray coating; Survival; Coatings; Crack detection; Cytology; Encapsulation; Energy storage; Flow rate; Fluidized beds; Packaging; Polysaccharides; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal load; Cells; Cells; Coatings; Encapsulation; Energy; Flow Measurement; Fluidized Beds; Packaging; Polysaccharides; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Spray Coating; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869783140

The storage modulus value at RT is improved by 44 % as the weight fraction of SWCNTs increases up to 1 wt%. Electrical results show that the percolation threshold is around 0.4 % SWCNTs and incorporation of 1 % SWCNTs into PC will decrease PC resistivity up to six order of magnitudes.

Container heat management is among the most relevant aspects of study in this field, particularly because in many cases it is the limiting factor for charge and discharge rate. However, given the complexity of the container system and the great variety of possible configurations (type of absorbing material, geometry of the container, hydrogen charge pressure, cooling temperature, etc.), according to the authors' best knowledge, yet there is no general rule for hydride containers design. In this paper we propose general design guidelines using non-dimensional parameters to assess the thermodynamic and kinetics behavior in order to predict the absorption fill up time.

Consideration has been given to nanoporous carbon and metal-organic framework structures, complex hydrides and nanoporous materials that were created by the authors of this review using radiation-induced methods. It has been shown that the structures that adsorb hydrogen adhering to a mechanism either of physical or chemical adsorption can accumulate it in a sufficient amount, but are not capable of desorbing it in the temperature range required by DOE [1]. It is asserted that the prospects for the creation of hydrogen absorbers with performances acceptable for the practical application are viewed from the standpoint of the development of structures capable of adsorbing hydrogen both in its molecular and atomic states. The authors give the results of their recent research; these show that nanocrystalline materials containing nanopores in their intergranular junctions can adsorb huge amount of hydrogen adhering to the mechanism of both physical and chemical adsorption.

With wind based generation gaining relevance, in terms of the generation mix, the fact that wind forecasting accuracy rapidly drops with the increase of the forecast anticipation time requires to undertake short-term and very short-term re-scheduling so the final implemented solution enables the lowest possible operation costs. This paper proposes a methodology for energy resource scheduling in smart grids, considering day ahead, hour ahead and five minutes ahead scheduling. The short-term scheduling, undertaken five minutes ahead, takes advantage of the high accuracy of the very-short term wind forecasting providing the user with more efficient scheduling solutions. The proposed method uses a Genetic Algorithm based approach for optimization that is able to cope with the hard execution time constraint of short-term scheduling. Realistic power system simulation, based on PSCAD®, is used to validate the obtained solutions.

In this paper we assess the influence of probiotic bacteria on the degradation rate of anthocyanins in yoghurts with a highbush blueberry preparation during storage. Four types of yoghurts were prepared: first with the yoghurt starter culture YC-X16 only (Steptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacilllus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) and three more, each with the starter culture YC-X16 and one of the three probiotic cultures: Bb-12, La-5 and LCP, respectively (Bif. animalis subsp. lactis - Bb-12; Lactobacillus. acidophilus - La-5 and Lactobacillus. paracasei subsp. paracasei - LCP).Derivatives of malvidin were the predominant anthocyanins in the tested yoghurts. Degradation of pigments occurred in accordance with the first-order reaction and its half-life time depended on the bacterial cultures. Anthocyanins in the probiotic yoghurt made with LCP culture were characterized by lower stability than those made with the other bacterial cultures.

The study of air ions, positively and negatively and the use of negative air ionizing apparatus for human, animals and plants has increased recently. Research conducted so far have shown a definite action of ionized air on the intracellular synthesis process and also shows that when used with an excess air of negative ions, it produces an increase in oxygen consumption. By analogy, it was assumed that positive ions increase energy reserves in cells, leading to increased cell functions (living organisms). Since after horticultural products harvest, metabolism continues for a certain period of time, the research conducted and presented in this paper have highlighted the influence of ionized air on metabolism, namely the shelf life of these products. Two plum varieties were studied and they have been subjected to fresh storage under the influence of the ionized air. To highlight the effects of the ions on the plums metabolism, there was used as an air flow both positive and negative ionized, the length of the treatment was approximately 30 min., by using a ions generator having as design value the electrical field ""corona"", which produces an average amount of ions around 1000000/cm3. The results were studied comparatively with a witness, respectively with unionized samples stored in the same conditions. The influence of the plums exposure at the ionized oxygen action on their physical and chemical properties was studied during the storage under refrigeration. The plums treated with negative air ions presented an increase of the storage length with two weeks comparatively with the witness and the positive air ions reduced the storage length, due to the enhancement of the ripeness processes.","European plums; Negative and positive air ions; Preservation; Shelf life","Animalia; Prunus domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872035121

In Brassica napus, an important edible oil crop, valuable lipids are synthesized and stored in specific seed tissues during embryogenesis. The miRNA transcriptome of B. napus is currently poorly characterized, especially at different seed developmental stages. This work aims to describe the miRNAome of developing seeds of B. napus by identifying plant-conserved and novel miRNAs and comparing miRNA abundance in mature versus developing seeds. Members of 59 miRNA families were detected through a computational analysis of a large number of reads obtained from deep sequencing two small RNA and two RNA-seq libraries of (i) pooled immature developing stages and (ii) mature B. napus seeds. Among these miRNA families, 17 families are currently known to exist in B. napus; additionally 29 families not reported in B. napus but conserved in other plant species were identified by alignment with known plant mature miRNAs. Assembled mRNA-seq contigs allowed for a search of putative new precursors and led to the identification of 13 novel miRNA families. Analysis of miRNA population between libraries reveals that several miRNAs and isomiRNAs have different abundance in developing stages compared to mature seeds. The predicted miRNA target genes encode a broad range of proteins related to seed development and energy storage. This work presents a comparative study of the miRNA transcriptome of mature and developing B. napus seeds and provides a basis for future research on individual miRNAs and their functions in embryogenesis, seed maturation and lipid accumulation in B. napus. © 2012 Körbes et al.",,"complementary DNA; microRNA; ribosome RNA; small nucleolar RNA; transfer RNA; article; controlled study; cultivar; embryo development; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic conservation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; nonhuman; plant seed; polymerase chain reaction; protein folding; protein secondary structure; rapeseed; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; Brassica napus; Conserved Sequence; Energy Metabolism; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; MicroRNAs; Polyadenylation; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Seeds; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Brassica napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870578799

This has forced a re-think and development of alternative energy efficiency technology. In South Africa's cold storage chain the entire refrigeration system is among the most energy-intensive areas, but also offers opportunity for short and long term saving. It also provides an opportunity for enhancement of sustainable development and cold chain management. This paper presents a combination of three efficient technologies in those areas: (1) Airflow pattern optimisation through a computer assisted simulation model in which overall energy efficiency of cooling facilities is dependent not only on the energy generation efficiency of the refrigeration system, but also utilisation efficiency of all cooling facilities. Optimal airflow pattern of a cold room would move heat effectively to a refrigeration system, hence increasing both energy efficiency and refrigeration distribution. (2) Variable speed drive (VSDs) technology on evaporator fans motors: VSDs reduce motor electricity consumption by 30-60%; other benefits include prolonging equipment life through motor speed adjustments according to load. (3) Minimising heat transmission load by heat conduction transfer - coloured and shaded external walls being a major factor. Such technologies saved energy, thus reducing cold chain facilities' demand. The system was also cost-efficient and, inter-alia, research detailed in this paper contributed towards alleviating South Africa's energy problems. © 2012 Cape Peninsula University.",,"Airflow patterns; Alternative energy; Cold chain; Computer assisted; Continuous energy; Cost-efficient; Efficient technology; Electricity-consumption; Energy efficient technology; Energy generations; Energy problem; Energy saving potential; Equipment life; External walls; Heat transmission; Major factors; Motor speed; Optimisations; Overall energy efficiency; Refrigeration system; Simulation model; South Africa; Cold storage; Computer simulation; Food processing; Industry; Optimization; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Technology; Variable speed drives; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869474264

However, this simulation study specifically examines the potential impact of the idea in the New Zealand context. The simulation makes use of real and projected data in relation to vehicle usage, full potential wind generation capacity and availability, taking into account weather variation, and typical daily and seasonal patterns of electricity usage. It differs from previous studies in that it is based on individual vehicles, rather than a bulk battery model. At this stage, the simulation does not take into account local or regional flows.

The increasing electricity tariffs in South Africamake it imperative for cement producers to implement or become involved in DSM initiatives in order to remain competitive. In this paper, a case study of a load shifting project that was implemented at a typical South African cement plant is presented. The focus is on an energy management system that schedules the operation of the mills to shift load from peak to off-peak periods. The operating schedules are calculated on the basis of a simulation that minimises the operating costs of the mills, based on Eskom's variable cost, time-of-use tariffstructure. The simulation takes into consideration various factors, such as scheduled maintenance, equipment reliability and silo storage capacities, to provide accurate operating schedules that maximise load shift potential without adversely affecting production targets. The simulation also predicts thelevels of the various silos, which is invaluable information for production planning. The results of the implementation of the load shift project, obtained over a period of three months, is provided as confirmation of the considerable cost-benefits that can be achieved by shifting evening load of the mills to off-peak periods. © 2012 Cape Peninsula University.",,"Cement manufacturing; Cement producers; Electricity tariff; Energy management system; Equipment reliability; Load shift; Load shifting; Manufacturing cost; Off-peak periods; Production Planning; Production targets; Scheduled maintenance; Storage capacity; Variable costs; Cement plants; Cements; Cost accounting; Energy management; Production control; Cement industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869457293

The penetration of these DG units into electrical microgrids (MGs) is growing rapidly, enabling reaching high percentage of the installed generating capacity. However, the fluctuating and intermittent nature of this renewable generation causes variations of power flow that can significantly affect the stability and operation of the electrical grid. To overcome these problems, short-term distributed energy storage (DES) systems based on advanced technologies, such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), supercapacitor (or ultracapacitor) energy storage (SCES or UCES) and flywheel energy storage (FES), arise as a potential alternative in order to balance any instantaneous mismatch between supply and demand in the microgrid.

In this paper, it is reported that the SMES system with a voltage-source IGBT converter and a DC chopper can smooth the line power and can also maintain the terminal voltage of fixed-speed wind generator at desired level, as it has both real and reactive power control abilities. For wind generator output power smoothing, constant output power reference is not a good choice, because sufficient power cannot be obtained when wind speed is very low, hence, more energy storage capacity is needed to smooth the wind farm (WF) output power. Therefore, among the various methods, a suitable method for selection of reference line power is presented. Finally, it is verified that the low pass filter (LPF) approach is very effective to smooth the line power with reduced energy storage capacity.

Konarskiego 18, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland","Limiting the emission of pollutants, including carbon dioxide, to the atmosphere has recently become an important element of global energy policy. This policy is a result of new and existing commitments, such as the Energy-Climate Package and the Emission Trading Scheme, introduced by Directive 2009/29/EC. These obligations impose the requirement for a significant reduction of CO2 emissions from power generation processes on the member countries of the European Union. Such reduction is a difficult task, especially in countries in which the share of coal in the electricity generation process is significant. There are several methods for the reduction of emissions from energy production processes. One of the methods of increasing the efficiency of power systems is to increase the steam parameters. However, limiting emissions only by increasing the efficiency of energy production is not always sufficient. Thus, it is important to consider the implementation of carbon-dioxide-capture installations in supercritical power plants. The greatest disadvantage of existing separation methods is the high-energy requirements of the capture processes. In the case of amine-based chemical absorption, this requirement causes a decrease of the efficiency of the electricity production process by even as much as 10 percentage points. Therefore, new methods of CO2 capture are required that will allow for the reduction of the energy consumption of the process. In this paper, the two methods of post-combustion carbon dioxide capture from the flue gas of an ultra-supercritical coal unit are described and the processes are compared. The selected methods are chemical absorption with the use of an aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) and membrane separation with the use of ceramic-polymer membranes that have an ideal selectivity coefficient equal to 100. To conduct these analyses, adequate models of the systems were built in the Aspen Plus software. A comparison of these methods was made primarily from the perspective of the energy intensity of the particular processes, but also the possibility of decreasing the energy intensity of that process was applied. The calculations for the separation process were made in such a way as to obtain the same CO2-purity and CO2-capture rate levels. The results of this analysis show that, in terms of energy intensity, both separation processes perform at a similar level, although the performance of membranes is slightly better. When the compression process of the captured CO2 before transport to a storage place is considered, the absorption process is significantly less energy-intensive than membrane separation. However, the development of membrane techniques allows for the assumption that this technology could be competitive with other separation methods in the future, especially from the perspective of effectiveness and cost. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption process; Adequate models; Aspen Plus software; Capture rate; Carbon dioxide capture; Chemical absorption; Coal units; Compression process; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Emission trading scheme; Energy intensity; Energy productions; European union; Generation process; Global energy; High energy; Member countries; Membrane separation; Membrane techniques; Monoethanolamine; Percentage points; Post-combustion; Selectivity coefficient; Separation methods; Separation process; Steam parameters; Supercritical power plant; Ultra-supercritical coal power plants; Ceramic membranes; Coal; Coal combustion; Computer software; Electric generators; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Functional polymers; Membranes; Production engineering; Separation; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865425706

In this paper, we examine the storage I/O behavior of twelve data-centric applications as the number of cores per server grows. We configure these applications with realistic datasets and examine configuration points where they perform significant amount of I/O. We propose using cycles per I/O (cpio) as a metric for abstracting many I/O subsystem configuration details. We analyze specific architectural issues pertaining to data-centric applications including the usefulness of hyperthreading, sensitivity to memory bandwidth, and the potential impact of disruptive storage technologies. Our results show that today's data-centric applications are not able to scale with the number of cores: moving from one to eight cores, results in 0% to 400% more cycles per I/O operation. These applications can achieve much of their performance with only 50% of the memory bandwidth available on modern processors. Hyper-threading is extremely effective for these applications and, on average, applications suffer only a 15% reduction in performance when hyper-threading is used instead of full cores. Further, DRAM-type persistent memory has the potential to solve scalability bottlenecks by reducing or eliminating idle and I/O completion periods and improving server utilization. We use a detailed methodology to project that in the year 2020, at 4096 processors, servers will require between 250-500 GB/s under optimistic scaling assumptions. We show that if the current trend in application scalability is not reversed, we will need about 2.5M servers that will consume 10 BKWh of energy to do a single pass over the projected 35 Zeta Bytes of data in 2020. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Application scalability; Current trends; Data centric; Data sets; Full-core; Hyper-threading; I/O operations; I/O subsystems; Memory bandwidths; Modern processors; Multi core; Performance requirements; Potential impacts; Single pass; Storage infrastructure; Storage technology; Computer simulation; Dynamic random access storage; Scalability; Telecommunication systems; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865027239

Estrogens are involved in regulation of lipid metabolism as well, but their effects are cardio beneficial. In order to study effects of fructose rich diet on the main heart fatty acid transporter CD36 and the role of estrogens, we subjected ovariectomized female rats to the standard diet or fructose rich diet, with or without estradiol (E2) replacement. The following parameters were analyzed: feeding behavior, visceral adipose tissue mass, plasma lipids, cardiac CD36 expression, localization and insulin regulation, as well as the profile of cardiac lipids. Results show that fructose rich diet significantly increased plasma triglycerides and decreased plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration, while E2 additionally emphasized FFA decrease. The fructose diet increased cardiac plasma membrane content of CD36 in the basal and insulin-stimulated states, and decreased its low density microsomes content. The E2 in fructose-fed rats raised the total cardiac protein content of CD36, its presence in plasma membranes and low density microsomes, and cardiac deposition of triglycerides, as well. Although E2 counteracts fructose in some aspects of lipid metabolism, and separately they have opposite cardiac effects, in combination with fructose rich diet, E2 additionally enhances CD36 presence in plasma membranes of cardiac cells and triglycerides accumulation, which paradoxically might promote deleterious effects of fructose diet on cardiac lipid metabolism.

The adipogenesis is the process of the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into mature adipocytes. This process occurs in several stages and involves a complex integration of cytoarchitecture, signaling pathways and transcription regulators, which are considered the crucial determinants of adipocyte outcome. Cell differentiation of brown and white adipocytes is determined by their precursors; white adipocytes are derived from myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) negative preadipocytes, while brown adipocytes are originated from Myf5 positive precursors, which also can give rise to skeletal muscle cells. WAT is principally deposited in two compartments - subcutaneously and visceral. WAT is the predominant type of adipose tissue in adult humans and is distributed throughout the body in subcutaneous regions, surrounding visceral organs and in the face. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) is found in the gluteofemoral regions, back and anterior abdominal wall, while the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is present mainly in the mesentery and omentum, and drains directly through the portal circulation to the liver. WAT is characterized by adipocytes containing a single lipid droplet, which occupies almost the entire cellular space to form a large vacuole. WAT ranges from white and dark yellow and has a uniform thickness in the newborn, but accumulates in certain regions of the adult body, regulated by hormones. BAT is located in discrete pockets in the paravertebral, supraclavicular and periadrenal regions, found in large quantities in hibernating animals and newborn babies. BAT is structurally distinct from WAT, provides your cells with multiple fat droplets, and has a number of fat vacuoles and several mitochondria. Its color is brown due to the abundant vascularity and numerous mitochondria, which do generate energy faster than WAT. The view on the roll of both SCAT and VAT has changed, from being solely a passive energy store, to an important endocrine organ. Adipose tissue is known to express and secrete a variety of signaling molecules, collectively termed adipokines and cytokines. These peptides have important autocrine/paracrine roles in regulating systemic lipid and glucose metabolism through endocrine/systemic actions in the brain, liver and muscle. In obesity, an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokine secretion may serve as a pathogenic link between obesity and current chronic diseases. At this way, obese subjects presented higher expression of pro-inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, resistin and C-reactive protein (CRP), which are strongly correlated with insulin resistance and higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Otherwise, in obese subjects the expression of adiponectin is lower. Also, recent literature point for the key role of leptin as a regulatory peptide of energy expenditure, through central mechanisms. Higher concentrations of plasma leptin represent a surrogate of central leptin resistance, which contribute to the obesity state. Different from WAT, BAT is involved in energy dissipation rather than storage. Briefly, its action consists by the mitochondrial release of chemical energy in the form of heat, which is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). Recent evidence indicates that BAT function is affected in obesity, considering that its activity is negatively correlated with age and body mass index, and women display higher activity compared to men. Thus, this chapter aims to discuss the development, differentiation, structure and function of each type of adipose tissue in association with the current context of chronic diseases, such as obesity and insulin resistance. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The study of adipose differentiation has been highly facilitated by cell culture models, such as primary adipocyte cultures,the cell lines ob/ob, and the sister fibroblastic 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A clones. These two clones have helped to advance our knowledge on the adipose differentiation program following stimulation with adipogenic serum proteins or growth hormone, and the metabolic regulation in terminally differentiated adipocytes. The 3T3-F442A cells can also differentiate into fat pads in vivo, therefore responding to physiological signals in the body. Our studies in adipogenesis have been carried out mainly using the 3T3-F442A cells, which have high efficiency to differentiate into adipocytes. Thus, this cell line is suitable to study adipose differentiation, molecules that regulate adipogenesis, and the expression of genes involved very early in this pathway. Recently, we demonstrated that staurosporine (St) induces adipose differentiation in serum-free medium, or in the absence of adipogenic proteins. Dexamethasone (Dex) combined with St enhances adipose differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells. This model offers the following advantages: i) St/Dex promote a maximum differentiation within 4 h without any other adipogenic stimuli (incubation with adipogenic serum requires approximately 48 h for the cells to undergo adipogenesis). ii) St induces two well-defined stages for adipogenesis before clonal expansion. The first stage consists of 4 h of induction during which St induces progenitor cells to differentiate, and the second stage consists of a subsequent 44 h of stabilization, during which adipogenesis continues in the absence of the inducer but it can still be reversed by anti-adipogenic substances or cytokines. These two stages permit the identification and analysis of early gene regulation during adipogenesis. Adipose differentiation is regulated by a complex cascade of transcriptional factors. C/EBPβ (gene: cebpb) activity precedes the expression of pparg2 and cebpa by several hours, raising the possibility that other genes might be expressed during such time regulating the expression of pparg2 and cebpa. The transcription factors Sterol Responsive Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) function as the central hubs in lipid metabolism, and are encoded by the srebf1 and srebf2 genes. Srebf1 encodes two proteins, SREBP1a and SREBP1c. We found that expression of srebf1a is required for the 3T3-F442A cells to undergo adipogenesis, since its knockdown inhibited the adipogenic program blocking the expression of genes encoding PPARγ2, C/EBPα, SREBP1c, and FABP4. SREBP1a activation is upstream of the three essential adipogenic transcription factors. Kinetic analysis during adipogenesis illustrated that the order of expression of adipogenic genes was the following: cebpb, srebf1a, pparg2, cebpa, srebp1c and fabp4. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A quantitative description of such problem showed that a convective motion first produces layer at the bottom. This layer, separated by an oscillatory interface, continues to deepen with time until achieving a critical depth. The mechanisms responsible for the growth of the first mixed layer are poorly understood until now.

The combined UAS and FDDA system is applied to two case studies of northeasterly flow situations in southwestIceland from the international Moso field campaign on 19 and 20 July 2009. Both situations were characterized by high diurnal boundary layer temperature variation leading to thermally driven flow, predominantly in the form of seabreeze circulation along the coast. The data assimilation leads to an improvement in the simulation of the horizontal and vertical extension of the sea breeze as wellasof the local background flow. Erroneously simulated fog over the Reykjanes peninsula on 19 July, which leads to a local temperature underestimation of 8 K, is also corrected by the data assimilation. Sensitivity experiments show that both the assimilation of wind data and temperature and humidity data are important for the assimilation results. UAS represents a novel instrument platform witha large potential within the atmospheric sciences. The presented method of using UAS data for assimilation into high-resolution numerical weather simulations is likely to have a wide range of future applications such as wind energy and improvements of targeted weather forecasts for search and rescue missions. ©2012 American Meteorological Society.","Aircraft observations; Coastal flows; Data assimilation; Numerical weather prediction/forecasting","Aircraft observations; Atmospheric science; Background flow; Boundary layer temperature; Coastal flow; Data assimilation; Field campaign; Flow situation; Four-dimensional data assimilation; Future applications; High resolution; Instrument platforms; Local temperature; Lower troposphere; Numerical weather prediction; Sea breeze; Sea breeze circulation; Search and rescue; Thermally driven; Unmanned aerial systems; Vertical extension; Weather forecasts; Weather simulation; Wind data; Wind profiles; Atmospheric humidity; Digital storage; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Data processing; air temperature; airborne survey; data assimilation; humidity; numerical model; troposphere; unmanned vehicle; weather forecasting; wind profile; Iceland; Reykjanes Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871855142

Specific requirements for wearable antennas are a planar structure and flexible construction materials. Several properties of the materials influence the behaviour of the antenna. For instance, the bandwidth and the efficiency of a planar microstrip antenna are mainly determined by the permittivity and the thickness of the substrate. The use of textiles in wearable antennas requires the characterization of their properties. Specific electrical conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully used. Ordinary textile fabrics have been used as substrates. However, little information can be found on the electromagnetic properties of regular textiles. Therefore this paper is mainly focused on the analysis of the dielectric properties of normal fabrics. In general, textiles present a very low dielectric constant that reduces the surface wave losses and increases the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. However, textile materials are constantly exchanging water molecules with the surroundings, which affects their electromagnetic properties. In addition, textile fabrics are porous, anisotropic and compressible materials whose thickness and density might change with low pressures. Therefore it is important to know how these characteristics influence the behaviour of the antenna in order to minimize unwanted effects. This paper presents a survey of the key points for the design and development of textile antennas, from the choice of the textile materials to the framing of the antenna. An analysis of the textile materials that have been used is also presented. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Dielectric properties; Flexible antenna; Textile materials; Wearable antenna","Compressible material; Design and Development; Electromagnetic properties; Flexible antennas; Low dielectric constants; Pervasive applications; Textile materials; Wireless body sensor networks; Body sensor networks; Characterization; Design; Dielectric properties; Electric impedance; Electromagnetism; Energy harvesting; Health care; Materials properties; Permittivity; Substrates; Surface waves; Surveys; Textile fibers; Textile industry; Textiles; Weaving; Wearable antennas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870565616

Pyrolysis converts part of the biomass feedstock into a gaseous fraction, which can be used for energy production. The remaining fraction is char, which is highly stable and resistant to biodegradation. When char is added to soil it increases carbon storage, reduces emissions and improves soil quality. Agricultural residues such as straw, stover and hulls are seen as the most accessible raw material. These residues could also be used as insulation in passive energy housing. Straw bale construction is a relatively simple technology, which has been applied for decades. It can store the carbon of the straw material into walls structures and in the process provides energy efficient housing. The climate benefits from improved energy efficiency depend on local conditions and energy production forms. In this study life cycle assessment was used to compare the climate impacts of biochar production and straw bale construction. On a life cycle perspective, straw bale construction results in higher net carbon storage than biochar production (3.3 t CO 2eq vs. 0.9 t CO2eq/t of straw). However the result was found to be highly dependent on the assumptions on the overall energy efficiency of the replaced building stock. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Carbon storage; Life cycle assessment; Natural building; Pyrolysis; Straw","Biochar; Biomass feedstock; Building stocks; Carbon storage; Climate impacts; Energy efficient; Energy productions; Gaseous fraction; Key technologies; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Local conditions; Overall energy efficiency; Passive energy; SIMPLE technology; Soil quality; Straw bales; Agricultural wastes; Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Housing; Pyrolysis; Straw; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870330655

A more appropriate alternative is installation of solar water heating (SWH) systems in households. The current number of installed SWH systems in Serbia is negligibly small - only about 0.1% of all households. Serbia has recently adopted feed-in tariffs for generating electricity from renewable energy sources (RES), but it did not provide any incentive for SWH installations. It is generally accepted that best form of SWH incentive is a direct subsidy to reduce high upfront costs. The aim of this work is to suggest the level of the subsidy which Serbian government should offer in order to reach the level of SWH deployment comparable to that of more developed countries. After financial analysis of SWH installation in six Serbian cities, followed by contingent valuation survey among household owners in Serbia, it is concluded that 20% subsidy is justified already by CO 2 mitigation potential of SWH systems, while 50% subsidy, which lowers equity payback period to 5.5-6 years, generates most interest among household owners. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) present immense plasticity. In early obesity, M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages acquire an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β produced by M1 ATM exacerbate local inflammation promoting insulin resistance (IR), which consequently, can lead to type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the triggers responsible for ATM recruitment and activation are not fully understood. Adipose tissue-derived chemokines are significant players in driving ATM recruitment during obesity. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a chemokine-like inflammatory regulator, is enhanced during obesity and is directly associated with the degree of peripheral IR. This review focuses on the functional role of macrophages in obesity-induced IR and highlights the importance of the unique inflammatory cytokine MIF in propagating obesity-induced inflammation and IR.

Both undernutrition and overnutrition in critical periods of life (gestation or lactation) may cause several hormonal changes in the pups and programme obesity in the adult offspring. We have shown that hyperleptinaemia during lactation results in central leptin resistance, higher adrenal catecholamine secretion, hyperthyroidism, and higher blood pressure and heart rate in the adult rats. Here, we evaluated the effect of a maternal isocaloric high-fat diet on breast milk composition and its impact on leptinaemia, energy metabolism, and adrenal and thyroid function of the offspring at weaning. We hypothesised that the altered source of fat in the maternal diet even under normal calorie intake would disturb the metabolism of the offspring. Female Wistar rats were fed a normal (9% fat; C group) or high-fat diet (29% fat as lard; HF group) for 8 weeks before mating and during pregnancy and lactation. HF mothers presented increased total body fat content after 8 weeks (+27%, P < 0.05) and a similar fat content at the end of lactation. In consequence, the breast milk from the HF group had higher concentration of protein (+18%, P < 0.05), cholesterol (+52%, P < 0.05) and triglycerides (+86%, P < 0.05). At weaning, HF offspring had increased body weight (+53%, P < 0.05) and adiposity (2 fold, P < 0.05), which was associated with lower β3-adrenoreceptor content in adipose tissue (-40%, P < 0.05). The offspring also presented hyperglycaemia (+30%, P < 0.05) and hyperleptinaemia (+62%, P < 0.05). In the leptin signalling pathway in the hypothalamus, we found lower p-STAT3/STAT3 (-40%, P < 0.05) and SOCS3 (-55%, P < 0.05) content in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting leptin resistance. HF offspring also had higher adrenal catecholamine content (+17%, P < 0.05), liver glycogen content (+50%, P < 0.05) and hyperactivity of the thyroid axis at weaning. Our results suggest that a high fat diet increases maternal body fat and this additional energy is transferred to the offspring during lactation, since at weaning the dams had normal fat and the pups were obese. The higher fat and protein concentrations in the breast milk seemed to induce early overnutrition in the HF offspring. In addition to storing energy as fat, the HF offspring had a larger reserve of glycogen and hyperglycaemia that may have resulted from increased gluconeogenesis. Hyperleptinaemia may stimulate both adrenal medullary and thyroid function, which may contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases. These early changes induced by the maternal high-fat diet may contribute to development of metabolic syndrome. © 2012 The Authors.

The various efficiencies of the solar system have been predicted by an artificial neural network (ANN) which was trained with historical data. The ANN fails to predict the efficiencies accurately over the long-time horizon because of system parts degradation, environmental variations, date changes within the year from the modelling date and presence of modelling errors. Therefore the ANN is adapted using the error between the ANN-predicted efficiency and the efficiency measurement from the appropriately selected sensors and efficiency laws to update the network's parameters recursively. The adaptation scheme can be performed online or occasionally and is based on the Kaczmarz's algorithm.

For a variety of reasons, mostly related to overgrazing and the resulting problems of soil erosion and weed encroachment, many of the world's natural grasslands are in poor condition and showing signs of degradation. This review examines their contribution to global food supply and to combating climate change.ScopeGrasslands make a significant contribution to food security through providing part of the feed requirements of ruminants used for meat and milk production. Globally, this is more important in food energy terms than pig meat and poultry meat. Grasslands are considered to have the potential to play a key role in greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly in terms of global carbon storage and further carbon sequestration. It is estimated that grazing land management and pasture improvement (e.g. through managing grazing intensity, improved productivity, etc) have a global technical mitigation potential of almost 1·5 Gt CO2 equivalent in 2030, with additional mitigation possible from restoration of degraded lands. Milk and meat production from grassland systems in temperate regions has similar emissions of carbon dioxide per kilogram of product as mixed farming systems in temperate regions, and, if carbon sinks in grasslands are taken into account, grassland-based production systems can be as efficient as high-input systems from a greenhouse gas perspective.ConclusionsGrasslands are important for global food supply, contributing to ruminant milk and meat production. Extra food will need to come from the world's existing agricultural land base (including grasslands) as the total area of agricultural land has remained static since 1991. Ruminants are efficient converters of grass into humanly edible energy and protein and grassland-based food production can produce food with a comparable carbon footprint as mixed systems. Grasslands are a very important store of carbon, and they are continuing to sequester carbon with considerable potential to increase this further. Grassland adaptation to climate change will be variable, with possible increases or decreases in productivity and increases or decreases in soil carbon stores. © 2012 The Author.","carbon sequestration; climate change; food security; Grasslands","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; food production; food security; food supply; global change; global perspective; grassland; grazing management; greenhouse gas; meat; milk production; overgrazing; ruminant; soil carbon; soil erosion; temperate environment; weed; adaptation; agriculture; animal; bovids; carbon sequestration; catering service; climate change; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; human; meat; milk; physiology; Poaceae; review; Adaptation, Biological; Agriculture; Animals; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Humans; Meat; Milk; Poaceae; Ruminants; Suidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868007823

The work presented deals with the development of efficient PEM water electrolyzers, employing high specific surface area Ir xPt 1-xO 2 electrocatalysts synthesized by the modified Adams fusion method. A typical three-electrode cell was used to evaluate the performance of the materials for water splitting. The performance of electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction was assessed by steady-state current-potential measurements while their electrochemical characteristics and stability were studied by cyclic voltammetry. It was found that Ir-Pt bimetallic oxide electrodes present a stable performance for oxygen evolution reaction.

Different electricity-to-thermal energy strategies to supply also heating and cooling demands were investigated to enable higher than usual RES shares through converting surplus renewable electricity into thermal energy which often constitute a major part of the end-use energy in a city. Case examples from a southern climate (Shanghai) with distributed PV schemes and a northern city (Helsinki) with off-shore seaside wind power were analyzed. The results from the Shanghai case indicate that when using thermal storage options, 2-folding of the PV capacity from the self-use limit of PV could be possible. With optimal electricity-to-thermal energy strategies and energy management, a 40-65% solar fraction of yearly electricity could be possible. In the Helsinki climate with wind power coinciding with the seasonal load peak, RES may satisfy beyond 30% of all energy and beyond 70% of all electricity demand annually. The size of thermal storage needed in the above cases is between 10 and 100 GW h. A higher RES use leads to higher spatial power flows and power variability in the city which requires more sophisticated control strategies and flexible auxiliary power options to handle transmission bottlenecks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Finally, it explores the stakeholder attitudes toward the role of CCS in Saudi Arabia, through a survey targeting oil and gas professionals mainly working in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. There is a widespread agreement by the stakeholders surveyed that CCS is one of the priorities for managing carbon emissions, and it holds the potential as a "" game-changer"" in Saudi Arabia. Stakeholders believe that "" high capital costs"" and "" technical uncertainty"" are primary barriers to CCS demonstration, and they generally do not regard the risks of CCS as particularly significant. Most of the stakeholders agree that the first large scale CCS demonstration project should be supported by Saudi Government subsidy, and that this is the most appropriate incentive for CCS demonstration in Saudi Arabia. There is substantial support for providing the same level of incentive for CCS as for renewables. There is also a common agreement that power generation, oil refining, and gas processing are the most suitable sectors in Saudi Arabia for capturing CO2.

The cooling energy consumption and the effect of energy-free nocturnal radiation application were simulated using the energy simulation code ACCURACY and MATLAB model based on hour-by-hour calculations in five typical cities across China. It can be concluded that MPCM slurry appears to be a good medium for the combined application of passive cooling technology in air conditioning system. The results showed the energy saving potential in Lanzhou and Urumqi can reach 77% and 62% for low-rise buildings, which exhibits strong attractions for building energy conservation and emission reduction.

Total and partial densities of states of the constituting atoms of Zr 3V 3O have been derived from the FP-LAPW calculations. These data indicate that, the O 2p-like states are the dominant contributors in the bottom of the valence band, whilst the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band of Zr 3V 3O are dominated by contributions of the V2 3d-like states, with slightly smaller contributions of the V1 3d-like states as well. Significant contributions of the Zr 4d-like states throughout the whole valence-band region and near the bottom of the conduction band are also characteristic of the electronic structure of Zr 3V 3O. The XPS valence-band spectra and the XES Zr Lβ 2,15, V L α and O K α bands have been derived and compared on a common energy scale for Zr 3V 3O and Zr 3V 3O 0.6 oxides. This comparison of the experimental spectra was found to be in excellent agreement with the results of the FP-LAPW calculations. In addition, the XPS Zr 3d, V 2p and O 1s core-level binding energies have been measured for Zr 3V 3O and Zr 3V 3O 0.6 oxides. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Alloys; A. Oxides; C.

We discuss a novel approach for trading credits for emission reductions across data centers to comply with their constraints.

Due to well-known technological constraints in ESSs, there has been a growing interest in combining various types of energy sources with complementary features. Among the many possible combinations, our interest here lies in the hybridization of batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) with an active parallel arrangement, i.e., the sources are connected to the direct current (dc) bus through two bidirectional dc-dc converters (step-up). Based on this ESS topology, a robust dc-link controller is employed to regulate the dc-bus voltage and track the SCs current in spite of uncertainties in the system. For this purpose, we start by showing that the converters' uncertainty, e.g., the powertrain load, can be modeled as a convex polytope. The dc-link controller is then posed as a robust linear-quadratic regulator problem and, by exploring the convex polytope, converted in a linear matrix inequalities framework, which can efficiently be solved by numerical means. Finally, the operation envelope of the controller is extended by scheduling the gains according to the energy sources' voltages, which is an important feature to cope with the voltage variations in the SCs. To analyze the performance of the control architecture, a reduced-scale prototype was built. The experimental results show that, compared with the nonrobust and non-gain-scheduled controllers, the proposed dc-link controller offers better transient response and robustness to disturbances. Furthermore, the global performance of the controller is evaluated during certain driving cycles. © 2012 IEEE.","Batteries; dc-dc power converters; electric vehicles (EVs); load flow control; robust control; supercapacitors (SCs)","Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Complementary features; Control architecture; Convex polytopes; DC-bus voltages; DC-DC power converter; Dc-link; Direct current; Driving cycle; Energy source; Energy storage systems; Global performance; Key factors; Linear quadratic regulator; Load flow control; Parallel arrangement; Supercapacitors; Technological constraints; Voltage variation; Capacitors; DC-DC converters; Electric vehicles; Linear matrix inequalities; Robust control; Solar cells; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867808419

Panels are already widely used in industry (insulation of the front doors and side walls of refrigerators and freezers for domestic appliances), for logistic purposes (transport containers, storage tanks, campers, refrigeration and other vehicles), for the insulation of laboratory and professional devices and insulation of various construction elements, such as elements for doors, furniture. Since the entry of atmospheric air gases into VIP panels represents the most harmful influence on their excellent thermal insulation properties, our research was focused on the analysis of accelerated ageing and determination of service life caused by this influence. The primary objective of the research was to define the theoretical base supporting measurements of accelerated testing and the connection between ageing and the service life of VIP panels. Arrhenius law of accelerated testing was used as a theoretical support to experimental testing of VIP panels at high temperatures and different exposure times.

Worldwide demand for maize crop, its production and land coverage are increasing despite many biological, physical and environmental constraints. Impact of two agro-ecologies, two traditional storage structures, storage periods and major insect pests on maize variety BH-660 were studied in two selected Zones of Jimma, South Western Ethiopia in 2010. Three factors, the first two each at two levels and the other at four levels were arranged in Completely Randomized Design replicated twice. Number of insects, insect damaged kernels and percentage germination showed significant differences (p<0.05) in Gombisa and Sacks over the storage periods under both agro-ecologies. Under intermediate agro-ecology number of insects in 1 kg of grain increased from 1.83 to 101 and 79.10; insect damage increased from 2.42 to 20.75% and 2.33 to 20.08%; germination percentage decreased from 98.00 and 97.5% to 68.5 and 80.5% for grains stored in Gombisa and Sacks respectively over six months of storage periods. Similar trend was observed under lowland agro-ecology. Maize weevil (Sitophilns zeamais M.) and Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella (O.)) were the two major insect pests identified from maize samples. Storage of maize grain for more than one moth demands eco-friendly maize weevil and grain moth management in both agro-ecologies and storage containers. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Gombisa; Insect pests; Intermediate and lowland agro-ecologies; Maize; Sack; Storage container",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867433708

Branco, 3972, São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil","Crutches have suffered few functional modifications over their long history, with improvements largely limited to aesthetics and weight reduction aspects. The large energetic cost of the gait with crutches and problems associated to their long-term use impose a heavy burden to the users. In order to mitigate some of the mentioned problems, alternative designs have been proposed over the past few decades. Among them, the idea of incorporating an elastic element to the crutches to reduce impact forces transmitted to the upper extremities and to promote energy storage and release has been indicated in the specialized literature as a potential solution, in particular for the crutch gait styles more similar to the normative human gait such as the two-point and the swing-through. In fact, tendon elasticity has been shown to reduce energy consumption during animal and human locomotion by means of energy storage in the initial and mid stance-phase and release in the push-off phase of the gait cycle. In spite of the great potential of this idea, appropriate stiffness curves for the elastic element are poorly studied in the literature. This study aims at investigating appropriate stiffness values for the elastic element of spring-loaded crutches by means of computational simulations using a model of the swing phase of the swing-through gait style. The findings show that the stiffness should be tuned carefully to ensure improved gait quality. Spring-loaded crutches undoubtedly reduce impact forces transmitted to upper limbs and shoulder at touch down but they can deteriorate performance with respect to foot clearance and effort at the shoulder when compared to stiff crutches if stiffness is not carefully selected. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Alternative designs; Computational simulation; Computational studies; Elastic element; Energetic costs; Functional modification; Gait cycles; Human gait; Human locomotions; Impact force; Potential solutions; Stiffness values; Swing phase; Touch downs; Two-point; Upper extremity; Upper limbs; Weight reduction; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Stiffness; Elasticity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867416745

For the adsorbed molecules, detailed calculations are performed by introducing the van der Waals interactions through the B97-D functional proposed by Grimme. The most stable configuration for the adsorbed oxygen atom is in the interstitial site binding with boron and carbon atoms (B-O-CI configuration), and for the substitutional doping, the most stable configuration occurs when the oxygen substitutes the nitrogen atom (ON). For these two defects, the calculated formation energies are -1.67 and 0.62 eV, respectively. The calculated electronic band structures show that the ON defect leads the system to exhibit a p-type semiconductor character, whereas the interstitial oxygen atom does not introduce any significant changes in the electronic states near the band gap region. The interaction between the nanotubes and the O 2 molecule is investigated by the adsorption of the molecule in the inner and outer surfaces of the nanotubes. The calculated binding energies show that the molecule in the triplet state is physically adsorbed in the inner surface with the molecular axis perpendicular to the nanotube axis. For the molecule in the singlet state, the most stable configuration occurs when the molecule interact with the outer surface and bind (weakly) with a boron atom.

R. China","The proper management of spent fuel arising from nuclear power production is a key issue for the sustainable development of nuclear energy. While conventional reprocessing process, PUREX process, was successful to recover uranium and plutonium, in recent years some countries have turned to focus on advanced reprocessing process, which features of partitioning of minor actinides (MA) and long-lived fission products(LLFP). Most advanced reprocessing processes under development involve new extractants and additional extraction cycles. In China, TRPO extraction process has been developed to partition MA/LLFP from high-level liquid waste(HLLW) since early 1980's. In parallel to R&D work on separation technologies, studies on concentration & denitration process have been evolved to prepare feed solutions to suit qualifications of extraction. Industrially, concentration & denitration is the internationally recognized standard to treat HLLW released from PUREX before vitrification. It enables to minimize the volume of interim storage, to restrain the corrosion of storage tank, to recover nitric acid in HLLW and to reduce the required evaporation duty of the vitrification process. Generally, the constitution of concentrated HLLW has little impact on the following vitrification process. But when concentration & denitration acts as pretreatment process of partitioning, the composition of actinides, fission products, and nitric acid in concentrated HLLW solution plays significant role in extraction process. A series of technical issues relevant to the connection between concentration & denitration and extractions should be solved. This paper describes current status of concentration & denitration technology utilized in industry and under reprocessing plants. The specific separation requirements in advanced reprocessing process and challenges to apply concentration & denitration process are addressed. Besides, concentration & denitration process was tested in laboratory to adjust feed solutions for TRPO and Cyanex301 partitioning. Results demonstrate its promising prospect in advanced reprocessing process. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Concentration & denitration; TRPO Process","Application research; Current status; CYANEX-301; Extractants; Extraction process; Feed solution; High-level liquid waste; Long-Lived Fission Products; Minor actinide; Nuclear power production; Pretreatment process; PUREX process; Reprocessing plant; Separation technologies; Storage tank; TRPO process; Vitrification process; Fission products; Materials science; Nitric acid; Nitrogen removal; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Plutonium; Radioactive wastes; Spent fuels; Technology; Uranium; Vitrification; Concentration (process)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867280207

Their ability to separate oxygen from air is needed, more specifically, in oxy-fuel and pre-combustion technologies. In this work, the first detailed comparative analysis and new results are reported on four types of Ba 0.5Sr 0.5Co 0.8Fe 0.2O 3-δ (BSCF) capillary membranes: non-coated sulphur-containing; catalyst-coated sulphur-containing; non-coated sulphur-free and catalyst-coated sulphur-free. The fabrication of BSCF capillaries by a spinning technique based on phase inversion is further discussed and their oxygen separation performances are interpreted. The comparison of the performance of these different generations of BSCF capillaries of similar dimensions demonstrates a significant impact of the sulphur contamination on both the oxygen flux through the membrane and the activation energy of the overall oxygen transport mechanism. Careful attention is paid to the effect of activation layers on both sulphur-free and sulphur-containing types of capillaries. Additional long-term testing of the sulphur-free BSCF capillaries is presented, where partial decomposition of the membrane surface was observed due to kinetic demixing. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Ba 0.5Sr 0.5Co 0.8Fe 0.2O 3-δ (BSCF); Capillary; Macrovoid-free; Mixed conducting perovskite; Oxygen separation; Phase-inversion","Activation layer; Capillary; Capillary membranes; Carbon capture and storage; Comparative analysis; Conducting properties; High temperature gas; Kinetic demixing; Macrovoid-free; Membrane surface; New results; Oxy-fuels; Oxygen fluxes; Oxygen separation; Oxygen transport; Partial decomposition; Phase inversion; Significant impacts; Spinning technique; Activation energy; Capillarity; Carbon capture; Catalysts; Oxygen; Perovskite; Separation; Sulfur; Gas permeable membranes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866237703

The extraction yields of lipids from hepatopancreas (10.65-12.64%) were higher than those from cephalothorax (2.59-2.88%). However, no changes in the extraction yield were observed during the storage (p &gt; 0.05). The carotenoid contents of lipids from cephalothorax and hepatopancreas slightly increased within the first 2 and 4 days of iced storage (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, but decreased thereafter (p &lt; 0.05). With increasing storage time, a progressive formation of hydroperoxide was found as evidenced by the increase in the absorbance band at 3600-3200 cm-1 in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and increased peroxide values (PVs) (p &lt; 0.05). The increases in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), p-anisidine value (AnV) and free fatty acid (FFA) content of lipids were noticeable when iced storage time increased (p &lt; 0.05). Those changes indicated that lipid oxidation and hydrolysis occurred in both samples. Phospholipids (PL) were the major components in lipids from cephalothorax (82.51% of total lipids). Nevertheless, lipids from hepatopancreas contained triglyceride (TG) and PL as the dominant components (45.35% and 38.03% of total lipids, respectively). A decrease in the TG content with a concomitant increase in free fatty acid was observed at the end of storage (day 6) (p &lt; 0.05). Decreases in unsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5(n-3)) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6(n-3)) were noticeable at day 6 of storage (p &lt; 0.05).

Hence, this work aims at studying experimentally the effects of the presence of the water on the capacity of the crude oil recovery. For this purpose, two samples of synthetic crude oil, from the Algerian Sahara, were prepared. The experimental results, expressed in terms ofrevealed the Newtonian fluid character. The oil-water emulsions (30%, 50% and 70% in water), that are thermodynamically relatively stable, found to exhibit a Herschel-Bulkley and Bingham rheological models. Apart from this, the slow phase separation implied much larger energy and therefore constituted a major obstacle for the storage and the trading of the finished product. The release of the oil emulsion will result in the production of pollution that is required to be reduced to the minimum. The analysis of the stability of the emulsions was introduced by using the concept of interfacial dilatation module. It was found that emulsions were characterized by a plate region due to the formation of a network of pseudo-gel, in accordance with the physical and chemical bonds to oil-water interface.","Algerian crude oil; Emulsion; Non-newtonian; Temperature; Viscosity","Experimental studies; Finished products; Herschel-Bulkley; Newtonian fluids; Non-newtonian; Oil companies; Oil emulsions; Oil recoveries; Oil water interfaces; Oil-water emulsion; Rheological behaviour; Rheological models; Synthetic crude oil; Chemical bonds; Emulsification; Emulsions; Oil wells; Phase separation; Rheology; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Viscosity; Water injection; Crude oil",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867032751

The data, which were obtained from normal solar irradiance performed at GhardaÎa site for three years, have been filtered to select only those values corresponding to clear sky conditions. The modelled system consists of a parabolic trough collector with an aperture area of 4.22m 2 which absorbs direct solar radiation and a hot water storage tank with the use of a pump to circulate the heat transfer fluid. The values obtained of the considered turbidity coefficient have a minimum in December (2.6) and reaches a maximum in July (4.5).

In the hydrogen buffer system, the excess wind energy is stored in the form of hydrogen via conversion through the electrolyzer. The fuel cell is used to produce electrical power when the load demand exceeds that produced by the renewable energy sources.

This feature enhances the field of single-phase PV inverters once the energy storage is mainly inductive. The main features of the proposal are confirmed with some simulations and experimental results. © 2012 IEEE.","Inductive Power Decoupling; Integrated Inverters; Single-Stage Converters; Tri-State Modulation and Control","Buck-boost; Control schemes; Decoupling controls; Inductive Power Decoupling; Integrated inverter; Low costs; Output power; Photovoltaic; PV inverter; Renewable energy source; Renewable resource; Single stage converters; Single-phase inverters; Modulation; Renewable energy resources; Power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866923522

Uncertainty should be considered during design to enable optimum performance within constantly changing conditions. However, the resulting computational complexity and effort is high, especially in view of flowsheets integrating multiple subsystems. To address this challenge, the presented work proposes the partitioning of the space representing uncertain realizations to facilitate the development and continuous update of a surrogate model in the course of optimization. A wide exploration of this strategy reveals and addresses important issues in the implementation of the partitioning and model regression layers. Formal statistical associations are examined regarding the beneficial implications of partitioning to computational efficiency and surrogate model development. The proposed strategy is presented as part of a Simulated Annealing algorithm. This is tested in terms of computational efficiency and solution robustness against an adaptation of Stochastic Annealing, which addresses computational intensity through a different approach while depending entirely on a full system model.

The pumped storage hydro (PSH) units are seen as one solution for this issue, avoiding the need for wind power curtailments. However, the behavior of a PSH unit might differ considerably when it operates in a liberalized market with some degree of market power. In this regard, a new approach for the optimal daily scheduling of a PSH unit in the day-ahead electricity market was developed and presented in this paper, in which the market power is modeled by a residual inverse demand function with a variable elasticity. The results obtained show that increasing degrees of market power of the PSH unit correspond to decreasing levels of storage and, therefore, the capacity to integrate wind power is considerably reduced under these circumstances. © 2012 IEEE.","Day-ahead electricity market; market power; price-maker; pumped storage hydro unit; wind integration","Day-ahead electricity market; Market Power; price-maker; Pumped-storage hydro; Wind integration; Elasticity; Electric industry; Functions; Wind power; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866787790

The agile customers are those residential electricity customers who either have a capability to sell the so-called ""negawatts"" (demand reduction), or who operate small renewable generators such as wind mills or solar panels and use storage (battery) to generate, store and trade energy. We assume that agile customers use some local energy management system, e.g. a software tool running on a residential gateway, to forecast their demand and generation and to access the local market for trading energy. Forecasting accuracy of these systems is of special interest: while lower forecasting accuracy leads to greater differences between forecasted and real consumption/generation, and hence to higher total cost of balancing energy that must be consumed from or be fed into the global grid, the higher accuracy leads to higher cost of the system. We study the impact of accuracy in an agent-based simulation environment in which we implemented a hierarchic grid and market architecture and performed experiments to discover intervals of accuracies and prices at which the agile customers achieve economic benefits. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Agent based simulation; Balancing energy; Demand reduction; Economic benefits; Electrical energy; Energy markets; Forecasting accuracy; Local energy; Local markets; Renewable generators; Residential electricity; Residential gateways; Solar panels; Total costs; Wind mill; Agile manufacturing systems; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy management; Forecasting; Sales; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866786870

The latter produces thermal and electric power together and as such reinforces the interaction between the gas and electricity-distribution systems. Thermal storage makes up the key-source of flexibility that allows decoupling the electricity production from the heat demand. However, smart grids focus on electricity, often disregarding the role of gas and thermal storage in overall smart energy systems. We find that the technical impact of a massive introduction of CHP on the gas-distribution network is limited in most cases, even providing opportunities to free up capacity. Taking the consumer's viewpoint, we highlight the economic importance of the thermal storage tank, which requires a thermal capacity of two to three times the hourly thermal power output of the CHP to optimize electric power production and limit thermal losses. Further increasing the storage tank size can increase the gas-distribution capacity that can be marketed by the distribution system operator, but practical constraints in terms of dedicated land area have to be considered as well. © 2012 IEEE.","Cogeneration; Energy Storage; Natural Gas; Smart Grids","Building blockes; Cogeneration; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Economic importance; Electric power; Electric power production; Electricity production; Energy systems; Future energies; Gas-fired; Heat demands; Land areas; Smart grid; Storage tank; Thermal loss; Thermal power; Thermal storage; Commerce; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy resources; Energy storage; Gases; Heat storage; Local area networks; Natural gas; Power generation; Tanks (containers); Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866785574

Portugal has a high share of wind energy, and curtailment may occur, especially during the off-peak hours with high levels of hydro generation. In this context, the electric vehicles, seen as a distributed storage system, can help to reduce the potential wind curtailments and, therefore, increase the integration of wind power into the power system. In order to assess the energy and environmental benefits of this integration, a methodology based on a unit commitment and economic dispatch is adapted and implemented. From this methodology, the thermal generation costs, the CO 2 emissions and the potential wind generation curtailment are computed. Simulation results show that a 10% penetration of electric vehicles in the Portuguese fleet would increase electrical load by 3% and reduce wind curtailment by only 26%. This results from the fact that the additional generation required to supply the electric vehicles is mostly thermal. The computed CO 2 emissions of the EV are 92 g CO 2/kWh which become closer to those of some new ICE engines. © 2012 IEEE.","CO 2 emissions; Electric vehicle; Power generation dispatch; Power grids; Power systems simulation; Renewables; Wind energy","Distributed storage system; Economic Dispatch; Electrical load; Electricity generation; Environmental benefits; GHG emission; Hydro generation; New-ice; Plug-ins; Portugal; Power generation dispatch; Power grids; Power systems simulation; Renewable sources; Renewables; Thermal generation; Transportation sector; Wind generation; Wind power integrations; Commerce; Electric generators; Electric vehicles; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Multiprocessing systems; Scheduling; Wind power; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866782423

In experiment 1 (digestibility trial), 12 pigs were individually housed in metabolic crates, equipped with feeding and watering troughs which also allow for separate collection of faeces and urine. Data collection lasted for 7 days during which feed intake and faecal output were weighed, with daily storage of collected faeces at -4 °C. Four diets, a basal diet, basal plus malted sorghum sprout (B + MSP), basal plus fermented malted sorghum sprout (B + FMSP) and basal plus amino acids plus malted sorghum sprout (B + AA + MSP), were tested. Samples of test ingredients, feed and faeces were analysed for their gross energy and proximate compositions. In experiment 2, 18 weaner pigs were used in a completely randomised design for 63 days to determine the performance and cost analysis of feeding malted sorghum sprout at 0, 100 and 200 g/kg in pig's diet, six pigs per diet with each pig representing a replicate. Daily feed intake and weekly weight gain were determined. The prevailing cost of each feed ingredient was used to compute the feed cost and, subsequently, the feed cost analysis. Results of digestibility trial showed that there was no difference in the utilisation of the chemical constituents of B + MSP and B + AA + MSP diets, which were also similar to the basal diet, except the crude protein (CP) in amino acid-supplemented malted sorghum sprout diet, which was lower compared to the basal diet. B + FMSP was lower (P < 0. 05) in the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter and CP compared to the basal diet. The digestible energy (DE) and the fraction of gross energy utilised as DE of each diet also were not affected by fermentation and supplementation with AA. In experiment 2, the levels of MSP used did not affect (P > 0. 05) the performance and feed cost indices measured. It was concluded that MSP can be used in growing pig's diet, without the need for fermentation and AA supplementation, at 200 g/kg level with no adverse effect on the nutritive value of the diet. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Amino acids; Digestibility; Fermented; Malted sorghum sprout; Performance; Pigs","Suidae; amino acid; animal; animal disease; animal food; article; chemistry; diet; diet supplementation; digestion; energy metabolism; feces; fermentation; growth, development and aging; male; Nigeria; nutritional value; physiology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sorghum; swine; weaning; weight gain; Amino Acids; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Digestion; Energy Metabolism; Feces; Fermentation; Male; Nigeria; Nutritive Value; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sorghum; Sus scrofa; Weaning; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872783147

It uses on-board battery for energy storage. These batteries of EVs can be recharged by either plugging into electric outlets on shopping malls, offices, or at home. The charging of EVs generate extra burden for distribution system. These vehicles consume large amount of electrical energy and this increases the demand on the power system distribution. Under EV charging conditions could lead to problems such as transformer and feeder overload, unbalance load, voltage drop and under frequency. These abnormalities cause negative effects on power system distribution. This paper presents the design of an adaptive charging algorithm to decrease the impact of EV charging on distribution system. The conceptions of algorithms are normal charging in off-peak load hours and lower the charging or balance charging during the peak load hours. The algorithms are tested on hardware of adaptive charging controller cooperative with simulated battery model.

EPCA specifically authorizes the President to draw down the SPR upon a finding that there is a ""severe energy supply interruption."" The meaning of a ""severe energy supply interruption"" has been controversial. The authors of EPCA intended the SPR only to ameliorate discernible physical shortages of crude oil. Historically, increasing crude oil prices typically signal market concerns for supply availability. However, Congress deliberately kept price trigger considerations out of the President's SPR drawdown authority because of the question about what price level should trigger a drawdown, and the concern that a price threshold could influence market behavior and industry inventory practices. As a member of the International Energy Agency-a coalition of 28 countries-the United States agrees to support energy supply security through energy policy cooperation, commit to maintaining emergency reserves equal to 90 days of net petroleum oil imports, develop programs for demand restraint in the event of emergencies, and participate in allocation of oil deliveries among the signatory nations to balance a shortage. The Department of Energy (DOE) manages the SPR, which is comprised of 62 underground storage caverns that were solution-mined from naturally occurring salt domes located at four sites in Texas and Louisiana. The 2005 Energy Policy Act directed SPR expansion to its authorized capacity of 1 billion barrels, but the SPR's physical expansion has not proceeded beyond 727 million barrels. The SPR's maximum drawdown capability is 4.4 million barrels per day, based on the capacity of the pipelines and marine terminals that serve it. Legislation restricts SPR sales to no more than 30 million barrels over a 60-day period for anything less than a severe energy supply interruption. Congress initially appropriated funds to fill the SPR through crude oil purchases, but ended that practice in 1994. In 2000, the Department of Energy began acquiring oil to fill the SPR through the royalty-in-kind (RIK) program. In lieu of paying cash royalties on Gulf of Mexico leases, producers diverted a portion of their production volume to the SPR. The Secretary of the Interior administratively terminated the RIK program in 2009. The DOE has conducted sales and loans of crude oil from the SPR for several different reasons. The 1990 Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments expanded SPR drawdown authority to include responding to short-term supply interruptions stemming from situations internal to the United States. U.S. Presidents have authorized emergency sales of SPR crude to meet IEA obligations during the 1990 Persian Gulf War, in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, and after a prolonged disruption of Libyan crude in 2011. In addition to these emergency sales, the Department of Energy has released oil, from time-to-time, to test the SPR system, make loans to help refiners bridge temporary supply disruptions, and sold oil at the direction of Congress to generate revenue for budget deficit reduction. The 30.64 million barrel SPR sale in 2011 reduced the SPR's inventory from 726.6 million barrels to 695.9 million barrels. The SPR currently holds the equivalent of 80 days of import protection (based on 2012 data of 8.72 million barrels per day of net petroleum imports). © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Formaldehyde is one of the major indoor gaseous pollutants. Depending on its concentration, formaldehyde may cause minor disorder symptoms to a serious injury. Some of the successful applications of technology for the removal of formaldehyde have been reported. However, this paper presents an overview of several studies on the elimination of formaldehyde that has been done by adsorption method because of its simplicity. The adsorption method does not require high energy and the adsorbent used can be obtained from inexpensive materials. Most researchers used activated carbon as an adsorbent for removal of formaldehyde because of its high adsorption capacity. Activated carbons can be produced from many materials such as coals, woods, or agricultural waste. Some of them were prepared by specific activation methods to improve the surface area. Some researchers also used modified activated carbon by adding specific additive to improve its performance in attracting formaldehyde molecules. Proposed modification methods on activation and additive impregnated carbon are thus discussed in this paper for future development and improvement of formaldehyde adsorption on activated carbon. Specifically, a waste agricultural product is chosen for activated carbon raw material because it is renewable and gives an added value to the materials. The study indicates that the performance of the adsorption of formaldehyde might be improved by using modified activated carbon. Bamboo seems to be the most appropriate raw materials to produce activated carbon combined with applying chemical activation method and addition of metal oxidative catalysts such as Cu or Ag in nano size particles. Bamboo activated carbon can be developed in addition to the capture of formaldehyde as well as the storage of adsorptive hydrogen gas that supports renewable energy. © IJRED.","Adsorption; Bamboo; Formaldehyde; Modified activated carbon; Nano size particles",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901929144

However, the problem is that the energy produced must be directly consumed. This could be dealt with by the chemical storage of solar energy in the form of an energy carrier such as hydrogen (H2), which is transportable and can be used upon request. The available routes to produce solar hydrogen as well as different kinds of solar reactors known from the literature are presented. If solar thermochemical processes are used to decompose hydrocarbons (either biomass or fossil), the resulting mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) can be used as the feedstock for 'Fischer Tropsch'-based liquid fuel production, for diesel and gasoline replacements. In addition, the idea of combining solar H2 with an actual waste such as carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce renewable solar HC fuels is discussed. This is an attractive way to manage the problem of CO2 storage and, at the same time, to create an intermediate step which is essential for the development of the appropriate infrastructure that could support the H2 economy.

Incidence is even higher in the critically ill patient. Difficulties in the establishment of individual needs increase the risk of under or over-nutrition. Enhanced demands, fast changing needs, lack of adequate tools to determine specific nutritional needs, and inadequate supply could play a role in the inflammatory response, the systemic metabolic stress response (SMSR), speed of tissue repair and further complications. The magnitude of the SMSR depends on the releasing factors and is highest in clinical situations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, trauma, burning and after major surgery. As an adaptive response it facilitates energy for the metabolic processes. Provision of the required nutrients depends on preexistent individual storage of nutrients, which is age-dependent in an inverse related manner, and also from the external programmed pathology-specific supply. Oxidative stress (OS) may be a consequence of the previously related phenomena when non-stopped and prolonged over time. Antioxidants from different sources may be insufficient to counterbalance the oxidative process. Details of supplementation are still lacking in the literature to be applied with practical clinical purposes. Sepsis and septic shock is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early specific nutritional support may be crucial in stabilizing the patient and avoiding further derangement due to SMSR and OS. Surgery is a major insult to the organism, independent of the specific site also triggering a SMSR in a multifactorial way. Contributing factors are the perioperative stress, including the pre-, intra- and post-operative period. Greatly burned and trauma patients react similarly with peculiarities according to the accident and multiple factors including age, pre-existing disease and nutritional status. The inflammatory response, OS and cell destruction influence tissue repair and delay the healing process. This, together with insufficient goal-directed nutrition and eventually insufficient specific antioxidants, enhances the risk of a negative clinical outcome. A first approach for clinical purposes would be to determine the optimal amount of macro- and micronutrients, which could have a positive effect preventing or modulating the inflammatory, immunologic, and metabolic processes. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Mines all over the world are becoming deeper, and hence the increased cooling capacities that need to be installed, which in turn requires higher power consumptions. Much emphasis is being given to electrical load-shifting measures because of shortages in generated power forgetting that, if refrigeration machines are designed and operated properly, some substantial energy savings can be achieved. Refrigeration plants on mines are installed on surface and underground, which changes the criteria to be used. Surface mine refrigeration installations have an overallcoefficient-of-performance (OCOP), which includes auxiliaries, ranging between 3.75 and 4.25, with the refrigeration compressors having a coefficient-ofperformance (COP) of between 5.5 and 6.5. Underground mine cooling installations can have OCOPs as low as 2 while the refrigeration compressors have COPs of between 3 and 3.5. This indicates that the auxiliaries are high energy consumers and hence the potential to save energy not only in operating the refrigeration compressors, which are the main energy drawers, but also in operating the auxiliaries. Different strategies and methodologies are available to minimise energy use when operating mine surface refrigeration systems. These are a combination of optimum design, improved control philosophies and cost (both capital and operational).

DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods were used to determine total antioxidant activity in honey samples during the same period of time. Samples were stored in transparent glass containers at room temperature, on shelves exposed to natural light during daytime and in the dark during nighttime. Two types of honey from four different regions in Varazdin county, Croatia, were investigated: monofloral - acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and multifloral. Of the total of 40 samples, there were 20 of each type of honey (5 from each region). The goal of this study is primarily to demonstrate the changes in the antioxidant activity of the two investigated types of honey during one year of storage, and not to make comparisons between them. According to the obtained data, the rate of decrease in the content of total flavonoids and phenolics was determined and changes in the antioxidant activity in honey samples were measured. After one year of storage, total phenolic content decreased by 91.8 % in acacia honey, and by 88.6 % in multifloral honey. Total flavonoid content also decreased in both types of honey, by 45.6 % in acacia honey and by 43.8 % in multifloral honey. During the same period, an increase from 12.20 to 16.73 mg/mL (i.e. by 37.1 %) was recorded in the IC50 values in multifloral honey, while in acacia honey this increase was from 44.64 to 407.01 mg/mL (i.e. by 811.7 %). Decrease in the antioxidant activity measured by FRAP method was also bigger in acacia honey than in multifloral honey (by 428.0 and 72.5 %, respectively), which corresponds well with the results obtained by DPPH method. Simple correlations were made to determine how each of the investigated parameters affects the others. The analysis of variance was used in order to determine the influence of the region, honey type and storage time on different parameters of antioxidant activity as well as on the total phenolic and total flavonoid content in honey samples.","Antioxidant activity; Honey; Phenolic compounds; Storage","Anti-oxidant activities; Ferric reducing antioxidant power; Honey; Phenolic compounds; Robinia pseudo-acacia; Total flavonoid contents; Total phenolic content; Transparent glass; Digital storage; Energy storage; Plants (botany); Food products; Acacia; Robinia pseudoacacia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873195537

A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wire-less network composed of a large number of sensor nodes. In WSNs the scarcest resource is energy which includes low power, less storage space, low computation ability and short communication range. For this reason, algorithmic research in WSN mostly focuses on the study and design of energy aware algorithms for data computation. This problem becomes harder in the case of security, as most of the security algorithms are quite heavy. Although symmetric cryptography may be one of the approaches to solve the problem due to their small computation requirement. In order to further reduce the computational cost of any protocol for WSN, Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been attractive to the researcher due to its smaller key size and its high strength of security. Scalar multiplication is most important cryptographic operation in elliptical curve cryptography. This paper proposes the efficient scalar multiplication algorithms for WSNs which are resistant of side channel at-tack.","ECDLP; Scalar multiplication; Side channel attack","Algorithmic research; Communication range; Computation ability; Computational costs; Cryptographic operations; Data computation; ECDLP; Elliptic curve cryptography; Elliptical curve cryptographies; Energy aware algorithms; High strength; Hostile environments; Key sizes; Low Power; Malicious attack; Scalar multiplication; Security algorithm; Side channel attack; Side-channel; Storage spaces; Symmetric cryptography; Wireless network systems; Cryptography; Digital storage; Network security; Sensor nodes; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870310039

In the present work, the dielectric permittivity and the effects of temperature and frequency on the electrical transport properties of polycrystalline NdFeO 3, prepared by solid state reaction method, are discussed. Room temperature Mossbauer spectrum confirms the phase purity, octahedral environment for Fe ion, and high spin state of Fe 3+ ion. From the impedance spectroscopic measurements, three relaxation processes are observed, which are related to grains, grain boundaries (gbs), and electrode-semiconductor contact in the measured temperature and frequency ranges. Decrease in resistances and relaxation times of the grains and grain boundaries with temperature confirms the involvement of thermally activated conduction mechanisms. Same type of charge carriers (i.e., small polaron hole hopping) have been found responsible for conduction and relaxation processes through the grain and grain boundaries. The huge value of the dielectric constant (∼8 × 10 3) at high temperature and low frequency is correlated to the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation due to electrode-sample contact. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",,"Capacitive energy storage; Conduction Mechanism; Dielectric permittivities; Effects of temperature; Electrical transport properties; Frequency ranges; High spin state; High temperature; Hopping mechanism; Low frequency; Maxwell-Wagner relaxation; Mossbauer spectra; Octahedral environment; Phase purity; Polaronic holes; Polycrystalline; Room temperature; Small polarons; Solid state reaction method; Spectroscopic measurements; Thermally activated; Transition-metal oxides; Electric properties; Grain boundaries; Maxwell equations; Permittivity; Relaxation processes; Solid state reactions; Transition metals; Transport properties; Virtual storage; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867537585

Starch slurries (10%, dwb) were autoclaved at 121 °C for 30, 60, and 120 min. The gels obtained were subsequently stored at different temperatures (4 °C, 30 °C, and 100 °C) and times (0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days). Analyses of the RS content in gelatinized starch samples in comparison with that in granular starch showed that the RS fraction in granular starch was very high (97.3% w/w); however, nearly all of the RS was thermally unstable, as indicated by a great reduction in RS content (to 1.9% w/w) after cooking at 100 °C for 20 min. The RS contents in gelatinized starch samples were 12.0-15.9% w/w, which were reduced to 7.9-10.8% w/w after cooking. Storage of gels resulted in a significant increase in the amount of the thermally stable RS fraction, e. g., a thermally stable RS content of 16.8% w/w was found in the gel sample gelatinized for 120 min and stored at 4 °C for 3 days. This indicated that the ordered structures of the RS portion were tightened under the storage conditions. The gelatinization temperature of canna starch was 72.2 °C, whereas the RS products exhibited two melting temperature ranges, 51.1-76.3 °C and 163.1-165.1 °C, indicating that the newly formed crystals were very strong. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Canna starch; Gelatinization; Resistant starch; Retrogradation; Storage","Energy storage; Gelation; Gels; Starch; Thermodynamic stability; Canna starch; Gelatinization; Gelatinization temperature; Gelatinized starch; Ordered structures; Resistant starch; Retrogradation; Thermally unstable; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867520870

Calcium bodies, organs containing large amounts of calcium, have been reported in some terrestrial isopod crustaceans, but have not yet been extensively studied. We analyzed the architecture of these organs during the molt cycle in the isopod Titanethes albus. Two pairs of calcium bodies are positioned ventrolaterally in posterior pereonites of T. albus. Individual organs are epithelial sacs that contain material arranged in concentric layers delimited by thin laminae. As demonstrated by electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, abundant bacteria are present within the calcium bodies. Regardless of the molt cycle stage, crystalline concretions are present in the central areas of the calcium bodies. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry of the concretions demonstrated that they are composed predominantly of calcium and phosphorus and selected area electron diffraction indicated the presence of hydroxyapatite. In molting animals, a glassy layer of mineralized matrix is formed between the envelope and the outermost lamina of the calcium body. This layer consists of an amorphous calcium mineral which contains less phosphorus than the central concretions and is resorbed after molt. Since changes in the mineralized matrix are synchronized with the molt cycle, the calcium bodies likely function as a storage compartment that complements sternal deposits as a source of calcium for the mineralization of the exoskeleton. Bacteria associated with the mineralized matrix of calcium bodies are evidently involved in calcium dynamics. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Apatite; Biocalcification; Epithelium ultrastructure; Trichoniscidae","calcium; hydroxyapatite; phosphorus; article; bone mineralization; calcification; controlled study; Crustacea; electron diffraction; electron microscopy; exoskeleton; fluorescence in situ hybridization; molting; nonhuman; priority journal; Titanethes albus; X ray spectrometry; Animals; Bacteria; Calcification, Physiologic; Calcium; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Isopoda; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Molting; Phosphorus; Animalia; Crustacea; Isopoda; Titanethes albus; Trichoniscidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867024280

Here we addressed the effects of a CLA-supplemented murine diet (∼2 % CLA mixture, cis-9, trans-10 and trans-10, cis-12 isomers; 45 % of each isomer on alternating days) on mitochondrial energetics, UCP2 expression/activity in the liver and other associated morphological and functional parameters, in C57BL/6 mice. Diet supplementation with CLA reduced both lipid accumulation in adipose tissues and triacylglycerol plasma levels, but did not augment hepatic lipid storage. Livers of mice fed a diet supplemented with CLA showed high UCP2 mRNA levels and the isolated hepatic mitochondria showed indications of UCP activity: in the presence of guanosine diphosphate, the higher stimulation of respiration promoted by linoleic acid in mitochondria from the CLA mice was almost completely reduced to the level of the stimulation from the control mice. Despite the increased generation of reactive oxygen species through oxi-reduction reactions involving NAD+/NADH in the Krebs cycle, no oxidative stress was observed in the liver. In addition, in the absence of free fatty acids, basal respiration rates and the phosphorylating efficiency of mitochondria were preserved. These results indicate a beneficial and secure dose of CLA for diet supplementation in mice, which induces UCP2 overexpression and UCP activity in mitochondria while preserving the lipid composition and redox state of the liver. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","CLA; Energy metabolism; Liver; Mitochondria; Obesity; UCP","conjugated linoleic acid; guanosine diphosphate; messenger RNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 2; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; citric acid cycle; controlled study; diet supplementation; energy metabolism; fat intake; lipid composition; lipid storage; liver metabolism; liver mitochondrion; male; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; protein expression; triacylglycerol blood level; Animals; Dietary Supplements; Endopeptidases; Gene Expression Regulation; Linoleic Acids, Conjugated; Liver; Male; Mice; Mitochondria, Liver; NAD; Reactive Oxygen Species; Murinae; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866732687

The storage system is interfaced through a STATCOM voltage source converter (VSC) which can supply the requisite reactive power. The PMSG system behaviour was studied for various disturbances.

Because of these fluctuations, a wave farm may have a negative impact on the power quality of the local grid to which it is connected. Hence, the impact of these devices on both distribution and transmission networks needs to be well understood, before large scale wave farms can be allowed to connect to the grid. This paper details a case study on the impact of a wave farm on the distribution grid around the national wave test site of Ireland with respect to voltage and power fluctuations, as well as regarding flicker levels.

Although all composites with Ni addition showed significantly improved hydrogen storage kinetics compared with the pure MgH2, the fastest hydrogen sorption kinetics is obtained for Ni-doped MgH2. The formation of Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 in Ni-doped MgH 2 composite and its microstructure allows to uptake 5.0 wt% of hydrogen in 25 s and to release it in 8 min at 275 °C. In the MgH 2-Ni-LiBH4 composite, decomposition of LiBH4 occurs during the first dehydriding leading to the formation of diborane, which has a Ni catalyst poison effect via the formation of a passivating boron layer. A combination of FTIR, XRD and volumetric measurements demonstrate that the formation of MgNi3B2 in the MgH2-Ni-LiBH 4 composite happens in the subsequent hydriding cycle from the reaction between Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 and B. Activation energy analysis demonstrates that the presence of Ni particles has a catalytic effect in MgH2-Ni and MgH2-Ni-LiH systems, but it is practically nullified by the addition of LiBH4. The beneficial role of LiBH4 on the hydrogen storage capacity of the MgH 2-Ni-LiBH4 composite is discussed. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These destabilized hydrides would present then sorption kinetics more favorable for their use as hydrogen reservoirs. In order to check if these relevant properties extend to massive samples we attempted an investigation on mechanically alloyed powder mixtures Mg 1-x-zNi xTi z of similar composition and also on mixtures Mg 1-x-zFe xTi z, with Fe instead of Ni. Thus, powder mixtures of nominal composition: Mg 69M 26Ti 5, Mg 64M 26Ti 10 and Mg 64M 31Ti 5 (M = Ni, Fe) were milled in a H 2 ambient till a steady state, with no further H 2 absorption, was attained and the hydriding kinetics was determined from the H 2 intake. Each hydrided sample was discharged by increasing the temperature at a given starting H 2 pressure and recharged by decreasing the temperature under the same conditions. The resulting P vs T curves were analyzed to extract approximate values of the equilibrium (T,P) data for H 2 desorption and absorption. Before and after their cycling in H 2 the samples were characterized by X ray diffraction and those containing Fe, by Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results are analyzed in connection with possible mechanisms for the transition metals catalytic action and the influence of the sample microstructure. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The development of WEHC, both for drawing energy from sea waves and for converting it into electrical energy, is based on keeping constant a pressure level within the hyperbaric accumulator (HA), which implies designing a large-size hyperbaric chamber (HC). Main objectives of this research are to reduce the size of the HC, and to obtain a high-quality level of the electrical output and a high flexibility degree for the WEHC. In this respect, power electronics, energy storage with super capacitors (SC) and their associated control play an important role to integrate the WEHC system to the electrical grid. The dynamics of the power conditioning system (PCS) influences on the validity of the WEHC system which acts, in turn, upon the dynamic control of the electrical power system, since it allows controlling the adequate power exchange between both systems.

It was observed that hydrogen desorption kinetics from hydrided Mg/Mg2Ni was improved considerably after ageing at room temperature for several days. The ageing was interpreted in terms of phase changes. Even after almost complete hydridation, besides two main phases - MgH2 and Mg 2NiH4 - a certain amount of Mg2NiH 0.3 was always present. Similar as Mg2NiH4 phase, Mg2NiH0.3 islands were located on the surface of MgH2 grains. Mg2NiH0.3 transformed into Mg 2NiH4 at the expense of hydrogen from an adjoining MgH2 grain. In such a way, a clean double layer (Mg)-Mg 2NiH4 was formed, acting as a gate for easy hydrogen desorption from MgH2. It was found that the Mg2NiH 4 phase was slightly enriched on non-twinned modification LT1 during the ageing. As a result, both the creation of (Mg)-Mg2NiH4 desorption bridges and enrichment of Mg2NiH4 on LT1 during the ageing facilitated onset of rapid hydrogen desorption. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Traditionally batteries are the most common storage technology for photovoltaic systems. Photovoltaic batteries can encounter extended periods of low State of Charge (SOC), resulting in sulphation and stratification, reducing battery lifetime. Standalone photovoltaic systems are often used in remote areas away from the national grid for water irrigation system, requiring dc motor starting resulting in high inrush current, cathodic protection systems for oil and gas pipelines, emergency phones, warning signs, and telecommunication repeater stations, resulting in pulse discharging of the battery. A combination of depleted battery SOC and high burst current can result in premature loss of load due to stringent battery Low Voltage Disconnect (LVD) limits implemented by the battery management system.A combination of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries and ultracapacitors in a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS), which increases the power density of the overall system, is examined. Operating the ultracapacitor bank under high power conditions reduces the strain of large current extraction from the battery bank. The addition of the ultracapacitor bank presents the need for a methodology to optimise the photovoltaic system to prevent excess battery storage.

To understand the performance of a distribution network in the face of supply disruptions, it would be helpful for policy makers to quantitatively evaluate the robustness of the network, i.e., its ability of maintaining a supply-demand balance on individual nodes. In this paper, we first define a notion of network entropy to macroscopically characterize distribution robustness with respect to the dynamics of energy flows. Further, we look into how microscopic evaluation based on a failure spreading model helps us determine the extent to which disruptions on one node may affect the others. We take the natural gas distribution network in the USA as an example to demonstrate the introduced concepts and methods.

Inadequate dietary Lys availability may limit protein synthesis, accretion and growth of fish. This experiment aimed to further elucidate the role of Lys imbalance on growth by examining the myotomal muscle proteome of juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio). Quadruplicate groups of 8 fish were fed either a low-Lys [Lys(-), 1.34 g kg-1], medium/control (Lys, 2.47 g kg-1) or high-Lys [Lys(+), 4.63 g kg-1] diet. Fish growth was monitored from 33 to 49 days post-fertilization (dpf) and trunk myotomal muscle proteome of Lys(-) and Lys(+) treatments were screened by 2D-DIGE and MALDI ToF tandem mass spectrometry. Growth rate was negatively affected by diet Lys(-). Out of 527 ± 11 (mean ± S. E. M.) protein spots detected (~10-150 kDa and 4-7 pI value), 30 were over-expressed and 22 under-expressed in Lys(-) fish ({pipe}fold-change{pipe} &gt;1.2, p value &lt;0.05). Higher myosin light chains abundance and other myofibrillar proteins in Lys(-) fish pointed to increased sarcomeric degradation, indicating a higher protein turnover for supplying basal energy-saving metabolism rather than growth and muscle protein accretion. The Lys deficiency also possibly induced a higher feeding activity, reflected in the over-expression of beta enolase and mitochondrial ATP synthase. Contrarily, in the faster growing fish [Lys(+)], over-expression of apolipoprotein A-I, F-actin capping protein and Pdlim7 point to increased energy storage as fat and enhanced muscle growth, particularly by mosaic hyperplasia. Thus using an exploratory approach, this study pinpoints interesting candidates for further elucidating the role of dietary Lys on growth of juvenile fish. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Growth; Lysine; Myosin chain isoforms; Pdlim7; Skeletal muscle; Zebrafish","Isoforms; Lysine; Pdlim7; Skeletal muscle; Zebrafish; Amino acids; Degradation; Growth (materials); Mass spectrometry; Muscle; Nutrition; Proteins; Fish; amino acid; lysine; proteome; accretion; amino acid; biotechnology; comparative study; cyprinid; diet; electrokinesis; gene expression; growth rate; metabolism; muscle; protein; TanDEM-X; animal; animal disease; animal food; article; comparative study; diet supplementation; drug effect; image processing; mass spectrometry; metabolism; methodology; skeletal muscle; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; zebra fish; Amino Acids; Animal Feed; Animals; Dietary Supplements; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lysine; Muscle, Skeletal; Proteome; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Zebrafish; Danio rerio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865431642

The objective of this work was to study the effect of the microstructure (two droplet size distributions) and stability (with or without surfactant) of HPMC oil-in-water emulsions over physical properties of HPMC emulsion-based edible films. HPMC was used to prepare sunflower oil-in-water emulsions containing 0.3 or 1.0% (w/w) of oil with or without SDS, as surfactant, using an ultrasonic homogenizer. Microstructure, rheological properties and stability of emulsions (creaming) were measured. In addition, microstructure, coalescence of oil droplets, surface free energy, optical and mechanical properties and water vapor transfer of HPMC films were evaluated. Image analysis did not show differences among droplet size distributions of emulsions prepared at different oil contents; however, by using SDS the droplet size distributions were shifted to lower values. Volume mean diameters were 3.79 and 3.77 μm for emulsions containing 0.3 and 1.0% without surfactant, respectively, and 2.72 and 2.71 μm for emulsions with SDS. Emulsions formulated with 1.0% of oil presented higher stability, with almost no change during 5 and 3 days of storage, for emulsions with and without SDS, respectively. Internal and surface microstructure of emulsion-based films was influenced by the degree of coalescence and creaming of the oil droplets. No effect of microstructure over the surface free energy of films was found. The incorporation of oil impaired the optical properties of films due to light scattering of light. Addition of oil and SDS decreased the stress at break of the emulsion-based films. The replace of HPMC by oil and SDS produce a lower ""amount"" of network structure in the films, leading to a weakening of their structure. The oil content and SDS addition had an effect over the microstructure and physical properties of HPMC-based emulsions which lead to different microstructures during film formation. The way that oil droplets were structured into the film had an enormous influence over the physical properties of HPMC films. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of progesterone on rat body and fat mass and on expression of genes encoding adipokines involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The results presented here indicate that progesterone administration to females caused increase in body and inguinal white adipose tissue mass. The increase of inguinal white adipose tissue mass is associated with the hypertrophy of adipocyte. The same dose of progesterone caused increase of its circulating concentration in males, however it barely reached the value observed in non-treated control females and did not have any effect on body and fat mass. The elevated circulating progesterone concentration was associated with an approximately 6- and 2-fold increase of leptin and resistin mRNA level respectively, and 2-fold decrease of adiponectin mRNA level only in inguinal white adipose tissue of females. RU 486, specific antagonist of progesterone receptor, abolished the effect of progesterone on the adipokine mRNA level in inguinal adipose tissue. In males, the elevated circulating progesterone concentration showed no effects on leptin, resistin or adiponectin mRNA level in inguinal, retroperitoneal or epididymal adipose tissue. Moreover, the results presented in this paper demonstrate a relatively high level of progesterone receptor mRNA in inguinal white adipose tissue of females, which was down-regulated in response to progesterone administration. In retroperitoneal adipose tissue of control females progesterone receptor mRNA level was approximately 3-fold lower as compared to inguinal adipose tissue. In inguinal, epididymal and retroperitoneal white adipose tissue of males progesterone receptor mRNA was hardly detected. Our results suggest that depot- and sex-dependent responsiveness of adipose tissue to the pharmacological dose of progesterone is controlled by both circulating concentration of progesterone and the white adipose tissue progesterone receptor level. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

During a CAES plant operation, the cyclical air injection and withdrawal produce temperature and pressure fluctuations within the storage cavern. Predictions of these fluctuations are required for proper cavern design and for the selection of appropriate turbo-machinery. Based on the mass and energy conservation equations, numerical and approximate analytical solutions were derived for the air cavern temperature and pressure variations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the dominant parameters that affect the storage temperature and pressure fluctuations and the required storage volume. The heat transfer at the cavern walls was found to highly affect the air temperature and pressure variations as compared to adiabatic conditions. In essence, heat transfer reduces the temperature and pressure fluctuations during cavern charge and discharge and effectively leads to a higher storage capacity. Additionally, for realistic conditions, in each cycle, few percents of the injected energy are lost by conduction into the rocks. The principal thermal property that governs the heat transfer process is the rock effusivity. To reduce the required storage volume preference must be given to sites of rocks that have the largest thermal effusivity. Lower injected air temperatures also reduce the required storage volume, but increase the cooling costs. The injected temperature can also be used to control the cycle temperature extreme limits. It is evident from the results that the storage pressure ratio has a dominant effect on the required storage volume and should preferably range between 1.2 and 1.8. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose that this grid could utilize a complex multifunctional control unit capable of optimizing the working point and charging current of the system, while also implementing active power factor correction, lowering extant harmonic distortion and controlling the voltage level in the low-voltage power lines. The complex controller structure proposed in this paper contains the following novel components: an upper harmonic controller which (together with the connection voltage controller) minimizes the amplitudes of the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th high order components in the output voltage; and a connection voltage controller which controls the energy flow between the low-voltage network, its renewable energy sources and the electrical vehicle batteries. Unlike other similar approaches, the harmonic controller proposed in this paper does not rely on a measured current signal but rather optimizes the voltage shape, the latter of which depends on the nonlinear distortion of the whole low-voltage transformer area and determines additional power losses. We analyzed the proposed controller via simulations in a Matlab environment and as a result, achieved substantial improvements to the output voltage, current waveform and energy flow of the system's low-voltage conditions. Our calculations show that the implementation of substantial reductions in CO 2 emissions could be achieved for an average household. The robustness of the method against nonlinear loads and fluctuations in overloads and overproductions was also tested. Copyright © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The most important feature of WSN is that the sensor nodes are small size, limited processing and low power. Recent research has been focused on developing routing protocol for WSNs with thorough design addressing these features such as simplicity, energy efficiency and energy balance. Those approaches include various hierarchical clustering routing protocols such as LEACH, TEEN, PEGASIS, HEED and their variants. Our research investigates a novel routing protocol in a confined, less solved area of hierarchical clustering routing protocols: hierarchical clustering routing driven by events. We propose a cluster forming algorithm involving multiple rotational cluster heads (CHs) with different number of turns acting as the cluster head. We then investigate a routing mechanism for these multiple CHs to send data to the base station (BS) using common optimal route. Furthermore, in order to increase fault tolerance of WSNs, in our routing protocol, a sensor node needs satisfying required energy to become or remain as a CH. Simulation results in Omnet++ show that our protocol is better improved in energy efficiency, network lifetime, and overall network energy balance than existing protocols of the same type: OEDSR, ARPEES and HPEQ.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effects of heme oxidation states on spectral development in salmon fillets and to investigate the origin of a shoulder peak representing important spectral variations during storage. Hyperspectral images of fresh salmon fillets and mince with various water contents were collected during storage under different atmospheres. In addition, the absorption spectra of extracted salmon hemoglobin and its derivatives (methemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) were obtained. Air storage resulted in an increased similarity between spectra of methemoglobin and salmon fillets in principal component analysis. Results from the mince storage demonstrated that absorption features at the shoulder peak could be related to water content in the salmon muscle. This study established that the formation of oxidized heme is the primary source of spectral variations that occur during air storage of fresh salmon. Changes in the status of heme due to storage and packaging can influence the appearance of the underlying water absorption at the shoulder peak and create variations in the salmon spectra. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","heme; imaging; oxidation; packaging; salmon; spectroscopy; storage","Air storage; Atlantic salmon; Deoxyhemoglobin; heme; Heme oxidation; Hyper-spectral images; Oxidation state; Primary sources; Salmo salar; salmon; Salmon fillet; Salmon muscles; Shoulder peaks; Spectral change; Spectral variation; Cold storage; Energy storage; Imaging techniques; Muscle; Oxidation; Packaging; Principal component analysis; Spectroscopy; Water content; Porphyrins; heme; hemoglobin; methemoglobin; water; animal; article; Atlantic salmon; chemistry; cold; food packaging; food storage; methodology; muscle; oxidation reduction reaction; sea food; spectrophotometry; Animals; Cold Temperature; Fish Products; Food Packaging; Food Storage; Heme; Hemoglobins; Methemoglobin; Muscles; Oxidation-Reduction; Salmo salar; Spectrophotometry; Water; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866695360

Several papers have recently reported its synthesis from the stoichiometric precursors 2Mg-Fe or 2MgH 2-Fe through sintering process and ball milling under argon or hydrogen atmosphere. However, regardless of processing conditions, a remaining iron always was identified by X-rays diffraction, which resulted in a lower hydrogen storage capacity. In the present paper, the Mg 2FeH 6-MgH 2 nanocomposite was successfully synthesized through high-energy ball milling from 3Mg-Fe mixture under hydrogen atmosphere at room temperature. After the ball milling, X-rays diffraction patterns showed that the iron was kept to a minimum, which was also confirmed by simultaneous thermal analysis of differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry. The gravimetric density of the ball milled 3Mg-Fe is more than 5 wt.% of hydrogen. In the case of 2Mg-Fe, processed in the same condition, the measured hydrogen capacity was 3.5 wt.%. The hydrogen sorption kinetics analyses were performed in a Sievert's apparatus in temperatures ranging from 250 °C to 350 °C. Enhanced hydrogen sorption kinetics was observed for these 3Mg-Fe milled powders in comparison with the 2Mg-Fe ones. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One of the modules uses a Telos-inspired architecture, with new processing, communication, sensing, storage and energy subsystems, and executing TinyOS. The other module is designed around a PIC 24F MCU, also supporting communication, sensing, storage, and executing a custom operating system. Both modules have expansion capabilities.

However, the reported solutions feature different tradeoffs in the area overhead and the fault latency.

It is also employed as charge storage in nonvolatile memory devices thanks to its high concentration of charge traps. However, in the case of memories, it is still unclear which defects are responsible for charge trapping and what is the impact of defect concentration on the structural and electronic properties of SiN x. Indeed, for the amorphous phase the band gap was measured in the range 5.1-5.5 eV, with long tails in the density of states penetrating the gap region. It is still not clear which defects are responsible for the tails. On the other hand, the K-center defects have been associated with charge trapping, though its origin is assigned to one Si back bond. To investigate the contribution of defect states to the band edge tails and band gap states, we adopted the β phase of stoichiometric silicon nitride (β-Si 3N 4) as our model material and calculated its electronic properties employing ab initio DFT/LDA simulations with self-energy correction to improve the location of defect states in the SiN x band gap through the correction of the band gap underestimation typical of DFT/LDA. We considered some important defects in SiN x, as the Si anti-site and the N vacancy with H saturation, in two defect concentrations. The location of our calculated defect levels in the band gap correlates well with the available experimental data, offering a structural explanation to the measured band edge tails and charge trapping characteristics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Charge trapping; Computational materials; LDA-1/2; Self energy correction; Silicon nitride; SONOS","Ab initio; Amorphous phase; Band edge; Bandgap state; Charge storage; Charge trap; Charge trapping characteristics; Computational materials; Defect concentrations; Defect levels; Defect state; Density of state; Experimental data; Gap regions; High concentration; High-k materials; Insulating layers; K-center; LDA-1/2; Long tail; Model materials; N vacancy; Nonvolatile memory devices; Self-energy corrections; Side effect; SONOS; Structural explanation; Theoretical study; Charge trapping; Computer simulation; Dielectric materials; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Hafnium oxides; Microelectronics; Nonvolatile storage; Silicon; Silicon nitride",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866035860

Blends of PP/PS:wax were prepared without and with polystyrene-block- poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) as a modifier. The influence of PS:wax microcapsules on the morphology, as well as thermal and mechanical properties of the PP was investigated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the microencapsulated PCM show that the capsules were grouped in irregular spherical agglomerates of size 16-24 μm. However, after melt-blending with PP smaller, perfectly spherical microcapsules were well dispersed in the PP matrix. There was fairly good interaction between the microcapsules and the matrix, even in the absence of SEBS modification. The FTIR spectrum of the microcapsules is almost exactly the same as that of polystyrene, which indicates that the microcapsules were mostly intact and that the FTIR only detected the polystyrene shell. The amount of wax in the PS:wax microcapsules was determined as 20-30% by weight. An increase in PS:wax content resulted in a decrease in the melting peak temperatures of PP. The thermal stability of the blends decreased with an increase in PS:wax microcapsules content as a consequence of the lower thermal stability of both the wax and PS. There was a drop in storage modulus with increasing PS:wax microcapsules content. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Neural and peripheral circuits controlling energy balance may be modulated during such a critical period. Since type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) have recently emerged as targets for modulating energy balance, their premature chronic activation during early life may result in longterm metabolic consequences associated to overweight/obesity. Endogenous activation of CB1R mainly occurs after binding to the endocannabinoid Anandamide (AEA). Objective: To evaluate long-term effects of AEA treatment during lactation on body weight, epididymal fat accumulation and related metabolic parameters during adulthood. Design: Male mice pups were orally treated with a solution of AEA (20 μg/g body weight in soy oil) or vehicle during the whole lactation period. After weaning, food intake and body weight were recorded every 10 days. Adult animals were subjected to glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Subsequently, animals were sacrificed and epididymal fat pads were extracted. Circulating levels of plasma insulin, leptin, non-sterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglyceride and cholesterol were also evaluated. Results: AEA-treated mice during lactation showed a significant increase in accumulated food intake, body weight and epididymal fat during adulthood when compared to control mice. When evaluating CB1R protein expression in epididymal fat, the AEA-treated group showed a 150 % increase in expression compared to the control mice. This group also displayed significantly higher levels of circulating glucose, insulin, leptin, triglycerides, cholesterol and NEFA. Moreover, a marked state of insulin resistance was an important finding in the AEA-treated group. Conclusion: This study showed that overweight, accumulation of visceral fat and associated metabolic disturbances, such as a higher lipid profile and insulin resistance, can be programmed by a treatment with the endocannabinoid AEA during lactation in adult mice. © 2012 Aguirre et al.","Adipose tissue; Anandamide; Endocannabinoid system; Insulin resistance; Overweight","anandamide; cholesterol; insulin; leptin; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; article; body weight; controlled study; epididymis fat; female; food intake; glucose tolerance test; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin tolerance test; lactation; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; weaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866178530

Due to its power density, its storage is of main concern when considering a broad use in practical applications. Carbon nanotubes constitute promising candidates for the design and construction of hydrogen storage devices. This work explores the use of some procedures involving electrochemistry, aimed to bond atomic Ti on the outer surface of MWNTs. Each titanium atom has the potential of hosting two hydrogen molecules and relinquishing them by heating. Nevertheless, nanotubes are difficult to handle due to electrostatic charge and agglomeration, and in this context, two routes were tested as procedures to spread and stick nanotubes on an electrode: (1) a functionalization capable of attaching gold was tested in two forms, as either using 4 nm particles or a flat gold electrode. The fixation of Au particles was confirmed by HRTEM. (2) A simpler route that consisted on drying a CHlnanotubes solution previously spread on a glassy carbon flat electrode. CHlwas selected as the medium and TiClas the precursor for attaching atomic Ti to the nanotubes. The results revealed that hydrogen adsorption, estimated from voltamperometry, was five times higher on Ti-MWNTs than on bare nanotubes. © 2012 J. J.

The robust optimization is used to deal with the data uncertainty. It does not seek to achieve global optimal but instead it looks for more consistent results by minimizing the variance of the optimal robust solution and thus leading to fewer programming issues due to data uncertainty. The robust optimization model applied to the hydropower production consists of a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem with two main objectives: minimize the quadratic difference between installed capacity and energy generated, and its corresponding variance. The model was written using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The model was applied to the hydropower plant of SINOP, which will be built in Sinop city, state of Mato Grosso in Brazil, with an installed capacity of 400 MW and maximum storage capacity of 3,100 hm 3, whose design is still in development. One special constraint to operate this reservoir is related to a variable maximum forebay water level, required to preserve seasonal ponds upstream of the dam. The ponds must be separated from the main reservoir during young fishes growing.

This incorporation can bring problems onto the power quality and dynamics of the electrical grid due to the lack of controllability over the wind. In this work, a flywheel energy storage (FES) is used to mitigate problems introduced by wind generation into MGs. A dynamic model of the FES device is briefly presented and a technique to control the power exchanged between the device and the power system is proposed. The control technique has three modes, namely: voltage control (VC), frequency control (FC), and active power stabilization (APS). Simulation tests on the behavior of the FES device are analyzed when it works in combination with wind generation in the electrical microgrid. Results show an acceptable performance of the proposed control techniques along with a high effectiveness to smooth the active power fluctuations of wind generation. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Distributed generation (DG); flywheel energy storage (FES); frequency control; fuzzy logic controller (FLC); microgrid (MG); voltage control; wind power generation","Active power; Control techniques; Electrical grids; Flywheel energy storage; Fuzzy logic controllers; Micro grid; Simulation tests; Wind generation; Distributed power generation; Electric frequency control; Fuzzy logic; Power quality; Voltage control; Wind power; Flywheel propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872078825

But considering sensor networks, there is a need for an approach that allows stream models to reach also computation-capable constrained embedded devices and to implement storage, exchange and computation on those. We propose a stream model that implements sensor-device data handling. The stream processing abstraction and interface allows small motes to store and process the data locally and to route processed data to consumer streams on-demand. This eliminates the need to code motes operation in lower-level languages, allows easy configuration of operations of different types and saves communication energy. The approach is quite useful in diverse contexts, including wireless sensor networks.

With the new Brazilian energy matrix, it becomes increasingly necessary to know the behavior of metallic materials used in transport and storage systems of new fuels, in particular, of biodiesel. The corrosivity of traditional fuels against the structural metallic materials is well known both in the pipeline and storage tank systems, which still does not occur with biodiesel. In this study, the corrosivity of biodiesel obtained from bovine fat, soybean and castor oil against carbon steel SAE 1020 and austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 was evaluated, through gravimetric corrosion tests at different temperatures, at three different moisture levels and in closed and open environments. Stainless steel was also studied after sensitization heat treatment to simulate possible changes in microstructure due to welding operations. As the number of variables involved in the study was very large, a statistical design of experiments was adopted which reduced by 50% the amount of tests. This paper describes the adopted test methodologies, the obtained results and the discussion of the influence of the tested variables on the corrosion processes. The corrosivity of the three types of biodiesel was also verified after aging for 60 days and 120 days. The results showed no significant change in the corrosivity of either biodiesel as a function of aging time. Testing was also performed according to the NACE TM 0172 standard test method which indicates a corrosion inhibition effect of biodiesel from castor beans.","Biodiesel; Carbon steel; Corrosivity; Stainless steel","Aging time; AISI 316; Biodiesel production; Castor beans; Castor oil; Corrosion inhibition; Corrosion process; Corrosion tests; Corrosivity; Energy matrix; Metallic material; Moisture level; Open environment; Standard test method; Statistical design of experiments; Storage systems; Storage tank; Test methodology; Traditional fuels; Welding operations; Austenitic stainless steel; Biodiesel; Carbon steel; Corrosion; Design of experiments; Stainless steel; Vegetable oils; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865539980

Power towers will likely play an essential role in the future development of CSP due to their potential to provide dispatchable solar electricity at a low cost. This Power Tower Technology Roadmap has been developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to describe the current technology, the improvement opportunities that exist for the technology, and the specific activities needed to reach the DOE programmatic target of providing competitively-priced electricity in the intermediate and baseload power markets by 2020. As a first step in developing this roadmap, a Power Tower Roadmap Workshop that included the tower industry, national laboratories, and DOE was held in March 2010. A number of technology improvement opportunities (TIOs) were identified at this workshop and separated into four categories associated with power tower subsystems: solar collector field, solar receiver, thermal energy storage, and power block / balance of plant. In this roadmap, the TIOs associated with power tower technologies are identified along with their respective impacts on the cost of delivered electricity. In addition, development timelines and estimated budgets to achieve cost reduction goals are presented. The roadmap does not present a single path for achieving these goals, but rather provides a process for evaluating a set of options from which DOE and industry can select to accelerate power tower R&D, cost reductions, and commercial deployment. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892103930

The beers were analysed immediately after purchase and then at the end of the best-before period (storage temperature 8±1° C). The concentrations of histamine, phenylethylamine and tryptamine in the studied samples were very low (mostly under 30mgL-1). The studied PA spermine and spermidine also occurred in small amounts. Nevertheless, the levels of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine reached significant values, especially in alcoholic beers. In almost 25% of thetested samples of alcoholic beers (at the end of the best-before period), the total amount of all the monitored BA and PA exceeded the 'healthy' level of 100mgL-1, which is considered toxicologically significant, especially in alcoholic beverages. © 2012 The Institute of Brewing &amp; Distilling.","Beer; Biogenic amines; Health risk; Storage","Beer; Energy storage; Health risks; Biogenic amines; Bottled beers; Czech Republic; Phenylethylamines; Polyamines; Spermidine; Storage temperatures; Tryptamines; Amines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870886035

Thermal energy storage plays a key role in the application of renewable energy sources and it thus contributes to the reduction of global CO 2 emissions. Thermal energy storage is commonly based on the sensible- or latent-heat-storage techniques. Latent-heat thermal storage is based on the absorption or release of heat when a storage material is changing phase. The thermal-storage materials suitable for latent-heat storage are called Phase-Change Materials (PCMs). PCMs have considerably higher thermal-energy-storage densities than the sensible-heat-storage materials and they are able to absorb large quantities of energy in a small range of temperatures during the phase change. Nowadays, micro-encapsulation of phase-change materials is one of the promising approaches in the integration of latent-heat storage in various applications. The most important properties of a latent-heat-storage medium are the heat of the fusion and the temperature range of the phase change. The correct determination of the physical and chemical properties is essential for a practical use of phase-change materials. The paper deals with the results of a laboratory assessment of the selected micro-encapsulated PCMs and shows a practical example of a possible integration in the building structures.","Differential scanning calorimetry; Latent heat; Micro-encapsulation; Phase-Change Materials",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870196866

This was made possible by the emergence of wireless sensor networks. The main characteristic of such networks is nodes with scarce resources. Given the stringent resource constraints, nodes are limited in energy, memory and computational power. These resource constraints pose serious difficulties for image processing and transmission to the destination. Therefore, image transfer in wireless sensor networks presents major challenge which raises issues related to its representation, its storage and its transmission. Based on wavelet transform an Adaptive Energy Efficient Wavelet Image Compression Algorithm is proposed in order to be suitable for wireless sensor network. In addition, an identification of the wavelet image compression parameters is investigated to analyze the trade-offs between the energy saving, and the image quality. Performance studies indicate that the proposed scheme enabling significant reductions in computation as well as communication energy needed, with minimal degradation in image quality. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Adaptive Energy Efficient Wavelet Image Compression Algorithm; Distributed image compression; Energy conservation; Wireless sensor network","Communication energy; Computational power; Distributed image compression; Energy efficient; Image transfer; Multihop wireless; Performance study; Physical phenomena; Resource Constraint; Scarce resources; Trade-off analysis; Wavelet image; Algorithms; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Flow measurement; Health care; Image compression; Image quality; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Sensor nodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869495768

It is expensive, because it needs more air treatment equipments. This increases capital cost of installation and results in recurring energy cost as well as a certain amount of pressure loss. Main causes of contamination in compressed air are ambient condition of compressor, type of operation of compressor and compressed air storage treatment and distribution pipes. There are several types of compressed air contaminations in the compressed air system, which include atmospheric dirt, water vapors, condensate water, water aerosols, rust and pipe oil and scales and liquid oil aerosols. The cost of the compressor includes the operating cost which is in the form of electric bills, maintenance and replacement of equipments. Approximately 20% of air is wasted in the form of leaks which can be reduced to approximately 5% by air audit. Air audit should not just look for the leaks in the compressed air system but it should be an air quality audit to check the quality of air being delivered to the particular tool. Other than leakages, there are other inappropriate uses of compressed air which can incur additional expenses. There are tools and methods which are cheaper for those applications. Quality of air may be different for every machine and equipment which is given by the manufacturer of the machine. These inappropriate uses of compressed air can be avoided if there is a relationship between the compressor user and compressor supplier company. The compressor suppliers should not be just the supplier of compressor but should be a compressed air system expert which helps the compressor user company to train the end user staff and give guideline tutorials to the compressor user company. Staff training will help to reduce the inappropriate use of compressed air which will definitely lead to reduction in the cost of compressed air.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869077971

A conventional refrigerator ENIEM 160 l was chosen and some changes were introduced on it to reduce the cooling load and consequently the power it required. Three prototypes were designed and tested; AC (alternative current) electrical power drives the first one using a converter, the Danfoss compressor that works with DC (direct current) was set up in the second, and BDF35 with Eutectic evaporator AC15 were used in the third refrigerator. The hermetic compressor was switched on and off to maintain an average inside air temperature between a maximum and minimum air temperature established by the thermostat. Many tests were carried out over 1 yr to study the performance of each of the refrigerators components and especially the compressor, the eutectic evaporator, as well as the system as a whole. These prototypes were installed and tested in Algeria, in two different climate types: mild, along the Mediterranean coast, and arid, in the Sahara. The data gathered as well as the analysis processes enabled our team to evaluate pertinent system components and optimize the equipment to specific environments and load requirements.

It is due to its high energy density, easy transportability and relative abundance. However, along extraction, storage or transportation of oil, spill accidents may happen. This kind of accident causes severe impacts on the environment, being directly responsible for the destruction of the marine life, which affects the fishing and even tourism industries. Main goal of this work is related to the use of renewable sources aiming to obtain ""absorbent green materials"". These materials were synthesized by a typical phenolic resin polycondensation route using cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) as main phenolic compound. Focused on keep the green characteristic of the materials, furfuraldehyde from hemicellulose was used as aldehyde and the reaction was catalyzed using a small amount of sulfuric acid. Resins were characterized using Optical Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Infrared Spectroscopy with Fourier Transformed (FTIR) and density tests. In addition, contraction of the oil spilled was studied in presence of resins. Obtained results demonstrated that synthesized resins present a good chemical similarity with oil, which produces a good interaction among resins and oil, making easy the contraction of the oil spot on the water and, consequently, the removal process of oil spilled on water.

In parallel, the disposal of non-biodegradable wastes, especially plastic packaging and plastic bottles, has also shown a steady rise. Improper disposal of used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles constitutes an eyesore to the environmental landscape and is a threat to the flourishing tourism industry. It is of utmost importance, therefore, to determine a suitable disposal method for used PET bottles which is not only environmentally efficient but is also cost effective. This study investigated the environmental impacts and the cost effectiveness of four selected disposal alternatives for used PET bottles in Mauritius. The four disposal routes investigated were: 100% landfilling; 75% incineration with energy recovery and 25% landfilling; 40% flake production (partial recycling) and 60% landfilling; and 75% flake production and 25% landfilling. Environmental impacts of the disposal alternatives were determined using ISO standardized life cycle assessment (LCA) and with the support of SimaPro 7.1 software. Cost effectiveness was determined using life cycle costing (LCC). Collected data were entered into a constructed Excel-based model to calculate the different cost categories, Net present values, damage costs and payback periods.

The impact of considering biogenic carbon on the results is also presented. Design/methodology/approach: The material and energy balances of the integrated ethanol production were simulated for the study with a mill-wide simulation model. Data for the simulation were obtained from prehydrolysis and cooking experiments. The life cycle model for greenhouse gas calculation was created based on the simulation results. In this paper, the change of forest carbon stock caused by residue removal from forest soil and carbon delay of forest growth after stand felling were also taken into consideration, to discuss the true greenhouse gas emissions of forest biomass utilisation. Findings: The emission reduction levels achieved with these ethanol fuels derived from forest biomass ranged from 80 to 90 per cent when biogenic carbon emissions were neglected. Originality/value: The findings indicate that in both cases a significant percentage of the side flows containing energy can be utilised to produce excess electricity when the ethanol plant is integrated into the pulp mill.

The choice of data provider and method for measuring the solar irradiance data in W/m 2 for a specific geographical location is therefore a critical determinant to ensure maintenance of the desired level of accuracy for the system design. The use of a data set which either over predicts or under predicts the amount of available solar irradiation at a specific location will therefore affect the electrical performance of the system, as the real world conditions may differ considerably to the data set used in the modelling of the system design. This paper specifically deals with the modelling of an off-grid photovoltaic power supply system using three different sources of solar irradiance data for two specific geographical locations within South Africa.

This system exploits the reversible calcination-carbonation reaction of limestone and lime. Concentrated solar heat is used to calcine CaCO 3, which is then released as required by carbonating the resulting CaO. The CaO/CaCO 3 system has a high energy density and its high temperature operation allows the use of a gas turbine for power production. This paper presents a first order evaluation of the potential of this application of calcium looping, with particular consideration given to carbonation activity of the sorbent. A model including a solar calciner and a pressurised fluidised bed carbonator feeding a gas turbine in an open Brayton cycle has been developed. Results from the model indicate that electric efficiencies of 40-50% could be achieved with sorbent carbonation activities between 15% and 40%. Higher sorbent activity levels do not affect efficiency but would lead to lower capital costs. According to the model, CaO activity levels above 17% lead to significant reductions in the required storage volume over existing systems, such as molten salts. In principle, high efficiency and smaller footprint solar thermal power plants are possible with calcium looping. Such plants would have no process use of water and could be used as baseload, variable demand load or microgrid systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Calcium looping; Calcium looping thermal storage; CaO/CaCO 3; Model; Solar thermal power plant","Activity levels; Baseload; Calciners; CaO/CaCO 3; Capital costs; Concentrated solar power; Electric efficiency; Existing systems; First order; Fluidised bed; High energy densities; Micro grid; Molten salt; Power generation plants; Power production; Solar heat; Solar thermal power plants; Storage volumes; Thermal storage; Transportation system; Variable demands; Calcination; Calcium; Carbonation; Efficiency; Fluidized beds; Fused salts; Gas turbines; Heat storage; High temperature operations; Models; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Sorption; Calcium carbonate; calcification; calcium; calcium carbonate; numerical model; power generation; power plant; salt; solar power; temperature effect; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865586000

Samples were taken seven times altogether over a period of 582 days. At the end of the storage period, the resulting differences in the wines were studied by LC/MS. It was found that storing rosé wine at room temperature caused a reduction of 50% in the levels of anthocyanins compared to storing them at 3°C. Increasing the storage temperature to 45°C caused the total decomposition of all anthocyanins. Furthermore, during the maturation of the wine, a loss of sugar moiety, hydration of aglycone, and the formation of the corresponding chalcone or diketone were observed. Levels of pyranoanthocyanins in the wines were studied as well.

The results show that syngas-based chemical looping systems ensure lower carbon capture energy penalties and higher overall plant energy efficiencies than more technologically mature capture methods (e.g. pre- and post-combustion capture based on gas-liquid absorption).

The hybrid system that is simulated comprises various combinations of wind turbines and/or photovoltaic (PV) supplemented with diesel generators and short-term battery storage. It was found from the analysis that the PV-wind-diesel hybrid system, with battery unit, has the lowest cost values as compared to solar-only or wind-diesel hybrid systems. Furthermore, the study illustrates that for a given hybrid system the presence of battery storage will reduce diesel consumption. The decrease in carbon emission, the percentage of fuel savings, the cost of energy production and the effect of wind and PV penetration are also addressed in this paper.

However, currently available commercial processes to remove CO 2 from flue gas streams, mainly from N 2 are costly and energy intensive. A silicalite-1 membrane was prepared on a porous alumina support using hydrothermal synthesis. The resulting silicalite-1 membranes were modified using Li solutions in order to achieve better CO 2 separation. SEM micrographs exhibited a thin, uniform and compact silicalite-1 film well adhered to the alumina support. Crystallinity of the membrane was confirmed by XRD. CO 2 and N 2 permeation experiments were carried out in a stainless steel module. CO 2 single gas permeation was measured through a silicalite-1 membrane from room temperature to 400°C, having a 25psi pressure on the feed side. The resulting CO 2 permeance measurements indicated molecular sieving as the principal transport mechanism for the unmodified silicalite-1 membrane, whereas surface diffusion is the principal transport mechanism for lithium-modified silicalite-1 membranes. The separation between CO 2 and N 2 takes place due to preferential CO 2 adsorption and diffusion, which in turn hinders N 2 permeation through the silicalite-1 pore network. A CO 2/N 2 separation factor up to 6 at 25psi and 400°C was obtained using the silicalite-1 modified membrane, whereas this was 1.46 using the unmodified silicalite-1 membrane. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","CO 2 separation; Lithium; Silicalite-1; Zeolitic membranes","Alumina support; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Commercial process; Crystallinities; Feed side; Gas permeation; Gas streams; Modified membranes; Molecular sieving; Permeation experiments; Pore networks; Porous alumina supports; Room temperature; SEM micrographs; Separation factors; Silicalite-1; Silicalite-1 membrane; Transport mechanism; XRD; Zeolite membrane; Adsorption; Alumina; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Flue gases; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrothermal synthesis; Lithium; Permeation; Separation; Silicate minerals; Gas permeable membranes; adsorption; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; diffusion; lithium; membrane; separation; zeolite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864564495

The share of inulin reduced the values of consistency coefficient, as well as storage and loss moduli, and increased creep compliance. Inulin preparation with the highest average degree of polymerization had the strongest impact on viscoelastic properties of the obtained dough. The presence of inulin also caused a significant decrease of viscosity upon pasting, and an increase of gelatinization temperatures T Og, T P1g, T P2g, and T Eg. Addition of inulin had no effect on gelatinization enthalpy (ΔH g), while it strongly reduced the enthalpies of retrograded amylopectin after storage.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), tensile tests and single edge notch 3-point bending tests were performed on unfilled, 0.5 and 1 wt.% carbon nanotube (CNT)-filled epoxy to identify the effect of loading on the aforementioned properties. The effect of the dispersion conditions has been thoroughly investigated with regard to the CNT content, the sonication time and the total sonication energy input. The CNT dispersion conditions were of key importance for both the thermo-mechanical and toughness properties of the modified systems. Sonication duration of 1 h was the most effective for the storage modulus and glass transition temperature (T g) enhancement for both 0.5 and 1 wt.% CNT loadings. The significant increase of the storage modulus and T g under specific sonication conditions was associated with the improved dispersion and interfacial bonding between the CNTs and the epoxy matrix. Sonication energy was the influencing parameter for the toughness properties. Best results were obtained for 2 h of sonication and 50% sonication amplitude. It was suggested that this level of sonication allowed appropriate dispersion of the CNTs to the epoxy matrices without destroying the CNT's structure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A.

The design is implemented in a logic 90 nm technology and achieves a low static power consumption of 130 μW and an access time of 2 ns. It has a worst case retention time of 175 μs. This performance is achieved by introducing an optimised hierarchical organisation and peripheral circuits for the read, the write and the refresh operations. A novel writing mechanism for 2T cells using a double phase approach is demonstrated. The area penalty of using short read bitlines is alleviated using a charge transfer sense amplifier (SA). A novel local write sense amplifier (WSA) that can operate as a latch makes it possible to perform the refresh operation at the local level, improving the energy efficiency of the refresh operation. The memory includes an integrated automatic refresh mechanism. Most read and write operations can still be performed during refresh cycles. In cases where the accessed address conflicts with the refresh operation, the memory handles access recovery internally. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These time critical applications crave certain QoS requirements as though end-to-end delay guarantee and network bandwidth reservation. However, the severe resource constraints of the wireless sensor networks pose great challenges that hinder supporting these requirements. In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Multipath with Congestion Avoidance Routing protocol (GMCAR) as an efficient QoS routing protocol that is suited for grided sensor networks. We employ the idea of dividing the sensor network field into grids. Inside each grid, one of the sensor nodes is selected as a master node which is responsible for delivering the data generated by any node in that grid and for routing the data received from other master nodes in the neighbor grids. For each master node, multiple diagonal paths that connect the master node to the sink are stored as routing entries in the routing table of that node. The novelty of the proposed protocol lies behind the idea of incorporating the grids densities along with the hop count into the routing decisions. A congestion control mechanism is proposed in order to relieve the congested areas in case of congestion occurrence. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol has the potential to achieve up to 19.5% energy saving, 24.7% reduction in the delay and up to 8.5% enhancement in the network throughput when compared to another QoS routing protocol. However, when compared to the basic grid-based coordinated routing protocol, it achieves 23% energy saving. In addition, the proposed protocol shows its superiority in achieving better utilization to the available storage. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This is seen as a cost effective solution in contrast to extending the utility grid in remote areas. The types of upcoming renewable and low-carbon generation technologies are being preferred for such systems depending on their availability and economic viability in these countries. Moreover, HPSs are also being preferred in order to improve the overall energy efficiency of the system and to get a judicious generation mix which would minimise the operating cost of the system. Rural communities in South Africa endure poor access to electricity mostly due to the lack of grid connected power lines. It is therefore the ideal place to conduct a study on the economic feasibility of introducing HPSs for typical residential loads for the rural community in South Africa.

However in the next few decades, significant reductions in those costs are to be expected. Moreover, this combination may reduce the cost of plants implemented in low hydroelectric potential sites for which main system interconnection costs prove prohibitive. The study of hybrid hydro-PV generating plants allows the evaluation of the use of water reservoirs and battery banks as alternatives for energy storage within a system. It also allows the evaluation of the advantages of generation from complementary energy sources. The objectives of this paper is to propose the concept of a theoretical performance limit for the plants and propose a method for the determination of this performance limit using computer simulations with idealized energy availability functions. Using this method, the effect of different degrees of complementarity in time of the energy resources on the performance of hydro PV plants is studied. It has been observed that, as expected, the smallest failure indexes measuring the energy supply to the consumers are associated to the best complementarity in time indexes. The results of the simulations led to the synthesis of failure index curves, as functions of the different degrees of complementarity in time, with data obtained solely with the utilization of idealized functions describing the energy availabilities, as proposed in this work. The results so obtained are a preliminary set treating the influence of the complementarity characteristics on the performance of hybrid plants based on hydro and solar energies and show how the complementarity characteristics may be used to design hybrid power generation systems showing improved efficiency. The subsequent research work shall proceed to at least two different phases. In the first one, the method exposed in the present work shall be applied to real data and compared to the operation of existing hydro PV plants. In the second phase the obtained relations of the performance of the system to the different degrees of complementarity shall be confronted with design parameters of hydroelectric-photovoltaic plants based on complementary resources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Computational simulations; Energetic complementarity; Hybrid energy plants; Hybrid hydro PV plants; Performance analysis; Software Matlab","Computational simulation; Energetic complementarity; Hybrid energy plants; Performance analysis; PV plants; Software Matlab; Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Energy resources; Function evaluation; Harvesters; MATLAB; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Hydroelectric power plants; complementarity; computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; energy resource; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; software; solar power; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859573329

This design process includes the mini-grid power system with desalination plant and economic analysis for the whole project life cycle. The mini-grid power supply introduces solar power as the sole power supply after considering the geographical conditions of rural areas that make it not viable to build transmission line interconnection with the existing National Grid. Currently, these remote areas are highly depending on diesel generators which the transportation cost of fuel is often unaffordable. Furthermore, natural disasters such as tsunami, flood, earthquake, typhoon and volcanic eruption usually results in isolated areas which creates plenty of opportunities for renewable energy applications in emergency relief conditions where the massive destruction of infrastructures for power and clean water supply usually took place. The design scenario of mini-grid power system will be utilising solar and batteries as the energy storage system. This mini-grid power system will be supplying reliable power supply for desalination plant to provide clean water supply. The economic issues that will be considered are the initial capital cost invested, the total net present cost (NPC), the cost of electricity (COE) generated by the system per kWh and the simple payback time (SPBT) for the project. In addition, this project will support the renewable energy applications to reduce the green house gas (GHG) emission as following Malaysia's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 40% by 2020. The simulation studies will be based on an actual set of conditions in a remote area in Pulau Tuba, Langkawi using HOMER.

Currently, the control principles in smart grids are mainly market-oriented (e.g. agent-based control and event based control), which do not really take into account the constrains of electric power networks. Moreover, the response time of coordination and control via ICT infrastructure might be significant (few seconds to several minutes). Therefore, the architecture and control principles of smart grids have been enhanced and presented. Particularly the concept of virtual agent has been introduced, which interacts the business model of smart grids (e.g. agent based control) to optimize the power flow. Additionally the time shift-able sources/loads of office buildings (e.g. plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) are treated as another means of grid control. The evaluation results verify the architecture and control principles which are presented in this paper.","Agent based control; Auction based market and tariff based market; Demand side management; Distributed power generation; Power converters; Smart grids; Super capacitors","Agent-based control; Auction-based market; Demand side managements; Smart grid; Super capacitor; Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric network analysis; Electricity; Office buildings; Optimization; Power converters; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Information technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864886681

The batteries charging process is controlled by an appropriate control algorithm, aiming to preserve the batteries lifespan. The main features of the equipment are the mitigation of the power quality degradation and the bidirectional operation, as Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) and as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). During the charging process (G2V), the consumed current is sinusoidal and the power factor is unitary. Along the discharging process (V2G), when the equipment allows delivering back to the electrical power grid a small amount of the energy stored in the batteries, the current is also sinusoidal. The V2G mode of operation will be one of the main features of the Smart Grids, both to collaborate with the electrical power grid to increase stability, and to function as a distributed Energy Storage System (ESS).

Three physiologic components are involved, namely, the neuron (individual and circuit), the surrounding neural extracellular matrix, and the various trace metals distributed within the matrix. The binding of a metal cation affects a corresponding nanostructure (shrinking, twisting, expansion) and dielectric sensibility of the chelating node (address) within the matrix lattice, sensed by the neuron. The neural extracellular matrix serves as an electro-elastic lattice, wherein neurons manipulate multiple trace metals (n &gt; 10) to encode, store, and decode coginive information. The proposed mechanism explains brains low energy requirements and high rates of storage capacity described in multiples of Avogadro number (NA = 6 × 1023). Supportive evidence correlates memory loss to trace metal toxicity or deficiency, or breakdown in the delivery/transport of metals to the matrix, or its degradation. Inherited diseases revolving around dysfunctional trace metal metabolism and memory dysfunction, include Alzheimer's disease (Al, Zn, Fe), Wilson's disease (Cu), thalassemia (Fe), and autism (metallothionein).

Although several previous works had dealt with the DVFS technique, our proposed method offers two main improvements. First, it can be applied to multiple preemptable real-time tasks. Second, in our method, energy consumption optimization may be carried out even when the worst case execution path is followed. The proposed method takes into account the limited set of available frequencies, and consider both the timing and energy overheads for changing the frequency/voltage. Our simulation results indicate clearly the practical usability, efficiency, and the advantages of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Energy consumption optimization; Low energy consumption; Real-time application; Real-time tasks; Worst-case execution; Buffer storage; Energy utilization; Industrial electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864855960

METHODS A synthesis of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) worldwide proficiency test for analytical laboratories conducting routine analysis of δ 2H and δ 18O values in water (WICO2011) by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) technology has been carried out. RESULTS This test revealed that &gt;96% of the 160 laboratory submissions provided acceptable results within ±2%° for δ 2H values and ±0.2%° for δ 18O values of the established reference values for four test waters, and no difference in outcomes based on IRMS vs. LAS technology was found for good performing laboratories. CONCLUSIONS The leading cause of outliers appeared to be improper calibration or compromised storage of laboratory standard and primary reference waters; hence the importance of judicious storage of lab standards cannot be understated. The deprecated practice of single standard normalization was identified as a problem for some laboratories. We further recommend that laboratories strive to report parsimonious long-term precisions based upon control standards, and to improve quantification and correction for LAS instrumental drift and inter-sample carryover effects. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862749716

It has been promoted as a challenging storage system for power system applications such as grid frequency support/control, power conditioning, and voltage sag mitigation. This paper presents a power control strategy to charge/discharge a flywheel doubly-fed induction machine storage system (FW-DFIM) to obtain a constant power delivered to the grid. The proposed controller is based on conventional vector control, where an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to develop the required rotor current component based on the required grid power level and the flywheel instantaneous speed. This technique is proposed for power levelling and frequency support to improve the quality of the electric power delivered by wind generators, where a constant power level can be delivered to the grid for a predetermined time depending on the required power level and the storage system inertia. The controller is designed to avoid overloading stator as well as rotor circuits while the flywheel charges/discharges. The validity of the developed concept in this paper, along with the effectiveness and viability of the control strategy, is confirmed by computer simulation using Matlab/Simulink for a medium voltage 10MJ/1000hp FW-DFIM example.","Ac machines; Doubly-fed induction machine; Flywheel storage system; Neural network; Vector control","AC machine; Back-to-back converter; Charge/discharge; Charging/discharging; Constant power; Control strategies; Doubly fed induction machines; Electric power; Flywheel energy storage system; Grid frequency; Grid power; Instantaneous speed; MATLAB /simulink; Medium voltage; Power conditioning; Power control strategies; Power levels; Power system applications; Rotor circuits; Rotor current; Rotor excitations; Storage systems; Vector controls; Voltage sag mitigation; Wind generator systems; Wound-rotor induction machines; Computer simulation; Controllers; Electric utilities; Flywheels; Neural networks; Power electronics; Power quality; Wheels; Wind power; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864669677

Coalbed Methane (CBM) has become an important resource given that Colombia holds the largest coal reserves in Latin America. Exploration of CBM began in 2008 with characterization of coal reservoirs, gas content, and storage capacity of four coal bearing formations in the main Colombian basins. In addition, the coals were assessed using techniques such as proximal and ultimate analysis, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, organic petrography, gas chromatography, isotopic analysis and desorption tests. From the four basins evaluated, this article will be focused in ""Los Cuervos"" Formation where four stratigraphic wells were drilled. Based on ultimate analysis and gas desorption measurements of cores, a mathematical model for estimating gas content was developed. The gas content showed excellent correlation and statistical significance with depth, total carbon and moisture percentage. 53 samples, classified as High Volatile Bituminous C using heating value from proximate analysis, were included in this study. Non parametric regression techniques based on statistical and optimization theory were applied to find the best correlation for predicting gas content. The equation set was generated with Grace98® software applying the ACE method. The non parametric model obtained explains the 92.5% variability of gas content and makes predictions with exactitude of 91.8%. The average percent deviation between experimental and calculated gas content was 7%, indicating good fitting between data and the proposed model. Based on the Anderson Darling test and residual plots, the errors generated from prediction were found to be randomly dispersed without any pattern. The obtained results showed that non parametric techniques were more efficient to predict gas content than conventional multiple regression. It was also found that there is not a kind of ""universal correlation"" but specific basin correlations since the gas content depends on geologic characteristics.

The methodology is applied to the Portuguese power system, in which the wind energy is expected to represent more than 25% of the installed capacity in a near future. The results show that the pumped-hydro units will not provide enough energy storage capacity and, therefore, wind curtailments are expected to occur in the Portuguese system.

The voltammogram exhibits two reduction waves that have been assigned to the U VI/V redox couple at -0.74 V and to the U V/IV redox couple at -1.10 V. This potential shows some dependence upon the identity of the cation of the supporting electrolyte, where cations with larger ionic radii exhibit more cathodic reduction potentials. Raman spectroelectrochemistry indicated that exhaustive reduction at either potential result in a product that does not contain peroxide linkers and is likely to be UO 2. On the basis of the reduction potentials, the unusual behavior of neptunium in the presence of studtite can be rationalized. Furthermore, the oxidation of other species relevant to the long-term storage of nuclear fuel, namely, iodine and iodide, has been explored. The phase altered product should therefore be considered as electrochemically noninnocent.

Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal glycosphingolipid storage disorder resulting from a deficiency of lysosomal enzyme acid β-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase). This partial enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of glycosphingolipid-laden macrophages (Gaucher cells) throughout the liver, spleen, bone marrow, skeleton, lungs and brain (only in types 2 and 3). Objective. These guidelines aim to provide a standard of care for patients with Gaucher disease in keeping with international standards, but also realistic for South Africa, and to provide a shared-care model for treating physicians and funders regarding care for these patients. Recommendations. All healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and management of Gaucher disease should take note of and implement these guidelines in clinical practice as far as possible. Validation. These guidelines were developed through consensus by the Lysosomal Storage Disorder Medical Advisory Board. They are largely based on the UK 2005 National Guidelines for Gaucher Disease, but include new treatment recommendations for enzyme replacement therapy based on subsequent publications. The Southern African Society for Human Genetics (SASHG) (who have endorsed the guidelines) and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of South Africa (NOFSA) provided valuable input. Guidelines sponsor. Genzyme initiated the project and sponsored the meetings of the Advisory Board and all costs generated by these meetings. Conclusion. It is intended that these guidelines will enable all patients suffering from Gaucher disease to be diagnosed and offered the best possible care available.",,"acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; bisphosphonic acid derivative; blood clotting factor 11; C reactive protein; chitotriosidase; cyanocobalamin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; ferritin; fibrinogen; folic acid; glucosylceramidase; homocystine; imiglucerase; iron; lactate dehydrogenase; lipoprotein A; parathyroid hormone; thyrotropin; adjuvant therapy; anaphylaxis; anemia; article; bone disease; bone marrow transplantation; cardiopulmonary function; clinical assessment; disease severity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; echography; enzyme replacement; experimental therapy; follow up; Gaucher disease; genetic counseling; hepatomegaly; human; hypersensitivity; laboratory diagnosis; lung disease; lysosome storage disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient care; patient monitoring; practice guideline; radiology; recommended drug dose; side effect; South Africa; splenomegaly; thrombocytopenia; wellbeing; Gaucher Disease; Humans; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864407725

Electric energy storage systems (ESSs) can be used to store excess electricity generated during off-peak periods for discharging it at peak hours and thus substituting the generation reserve when it is more required. This application could yield significant benefits including a reduced need for peak generation (particularly from expensive peaking plants) and reduced strain on transmission and distribution networks. ESSs can also provide critically important ancillary services such as grid frequency control, voltage support, and operating reserve, thereby enhancing the grid stability, power quality and reliability of supply. There are numerous candidate emerging technologies available in the market for short-term and long-term energy storage with high potential of being applied in electric power systems. Such modern devices include superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), supercapacitor energy storage (SCES) also called ultracapacitors, flywheel energy storage (FES) and advanced batteries (ABESS), among others. Although several of these technologies were initially envisioned for large-scale load-leveling applications, energy storage is presently seen mostly as a solution for solving many of the challenges regarding the increasing use of renewable energy sources, and improving the operation and control of modern power systems. The purpose of this chapter is to provide major insights and projections regarding the future of emerging energy storage technologies in utility power systems around the world. The document provides both the comprehensive analysis and extensive data of leading emerging ESS applications. It includes a broad analysis of the new market for energy storage technologies applied in the global utility power sector.

Electric power systems (EPS), mostly based on RES, where solar and wind energy prevail, cannot provide continuous energy supply to consumers without energy storage. In this way electric energy storage (EES) has a key role in more productive use of these energy sources. Numerous energy storage technologies are known today (batteries, flywheel, pressure vessels, etc.), which differ in size, energy storage costs, efficiency, lifetime, costs per cycle, etc. It is well known that none of the present-day technologies could in terms of ratings be compared to water storage by pump storage hydro (PSH). Precisely for this reason, PSH is the most significant EES, and is a mature technology with large volume, a long storage period, and high efficiency and reliability, while its capital cost per unit of energy stored is low. Water storage is able to reduce volatility and increase reliability, and so the value of the RES energy.

Hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and aging are important risk factors for the dysfunction of endothelial cells (EC). Circulating lipoproteins (Lp) synthesized and secreted from the intestine or liver have an important role in supplying peripheral tissues with fatty acids from triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TGRLp) for energy production or storage, and cholesterol from low density lipoproteins (LDL) or high density lipoproteins (HDL) for the synthesis of cellular membranes and steroid hormones. Under pathological conditions, Lp may suffer alterations in concentration and composition and become aggressors for EC. Modified LDL, remnant Lp, TGRLp lipolysis products, dysfunctional HDL are involved in the changes induced in EC morphology (reduced glycocalyx, overdeveloped endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and basement membrane), loose intercellular junctions, increased oxidative and inflammatory stress, nitric oxide/redox imbalance, excess Lp transport and storage, as well as loss of anti-thrombotic properties, all of these being characteristics of endothelial dysfunction. Normal HDL are able to counteract the harmful effects of atherogenic Lp in EC but under persistent pathological conditions they lose the protective properties and become pro-atherogenic. This review summarises recent advances in understanding the role of Lp in the induction of endothelial dysfunction and the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Its main focus is the antagonistic role of atherogenic Lp (LDL, VLDL, dysfunctional HDL) versus anti-atherogenic Lp (HDL), also pointing out the potential targets for arresting or reversing this process. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Endothelial dysfunction; HDL; Inflammation; LDL; Oxidative stress","amlodipine; chemokine; dysfunctional high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; nicotinic acid; nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; scavenger receptor; transcription factor; unclassified drug; very low density lipoprotein; cytokine; lipoprotein; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; cell damage; cell junction; cell migration; cytokine release; disease course; drug mechanism; endoplasmic reticulum stress; endothelium cell; enzyme activity; extracellular matrix; foam cell; glycocalyx; human; hyperlipidemia; nonhuman; oxidation; postprandial state; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein glycosylation; protein modification; protein transport; review; thrombosis; upregulation; animal; atherosclerosis; blood; immunology; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathology; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Cytokines; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Lipoproteins; Oxidative Stress",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871891225

It is demonstrated that whilst the global warming potential (GWP) decreases, the other environmental impact category potentials often increase in a life cycle perspective. Despite this, only a few studies clearly address this trade-off or use weighting to compare the positive and negative effects of CCS. The present life cycle assessment (LCA) study focuses, therefore, on presenting several environmental indicators and on weighting the inventory results in order to ascertain which of the analysed systems is to be preferred. Method The case studied is a projected gas power plant at Tjeldbergodden (Norway), where it is proposed to include post-combustion CCS. Four main scenarios have been analysed, one without and three with CCS. The principal variation between the CCS scenarios is that the steam required for amine regeneration is produced in three different ways: In a separate gas fuelled steam boiler; in a separate biomass fuelled steam boiler; and delivered from the low-pressure steam turbine in the power plant. Design information and technical specifications have been available. The study has used LCA methodology based on the ISO standard 14044, SimaPro 7.3.2.4 software and the Ecoinvent 2.0 database. The functional unit is 1 TWh electricity delivered to the grid. The following environmental impact categories have been included: GWP, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) and cumulative energy demand (CED). Three weighting methods have been used to ascertain the robustness of the weighting results: ReCiPe, EPS 2000 and IMPACT 2002+. Results and discussion The characterisation results show that the CCS scenarios have reduced impacts only in the case of GWP. The weighting demonstrates that in the ReCiPe model, climate change is strongly in focus, whilst in EPS 2000, human health and depletion of reserves are dominant. Climate change is also an important factor in IMPACT 2002+, together with effects on human health (respiratory inorganics). The process integration scenario has, however, the best result for all three weighting models. This contrasts with the results from the impact analysis where four of the five analysed impact categories rated the CCS-3 scenario as worse than the reference scenario. One possible option for improving the biofuel boiler scenario is to capture the CO2 from the combustion of biomass in the external steam boiler. This would not, in all probability, affect the acidification, eutrophication, POCP and CED to any significant degree, but the GWP, and hence the ReCiPe and the IMPACT 2002+, weighting results could be expected to improve. Conclusions The weighting exercise has identified toxicity as a concern with regard to the biofuel boiler scenarios (CCS-2) and human health issues as having importance for the CCS-3 scenario. It would seem that process integration is a better CCS option than that of CCS providing steam from a separate steam boiler (without CCS), even where this boiler is biomass-fuelled. Any future analysis should focus both on the process integration scenario and the biofuel boiler scenario with CCS of biological CO2. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Environmental impacts; Human health; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Toxicity; Trade-offs; Weighting","amine; biofuel; carbon dioxide; ozone; acidification; article; bioenergy; biomass energy; boiler; carbon storage; case study; climate change; combustion; computer program; data base; Ecoinvent 2.0; electric power plant; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; fossil energy; gas turbine power; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; Norway; photooxidation; priority journal; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868213689

In the past two decades, lithium-ion technology has proven itself a most robust technology, which delivers high energy and power capabilities. At the same time, current technology requires that the energy and power capabilities of Li-ion batteries be 'beefed up' beyond the existing state of the art. Increasing the battery voltage is one of the ways to improve battery energy density; in Li-ion cells, the objective of current research is to develop a 5-volt cell, and at the same time to maintain high specific charge capacity, excellent cycling, and safety. Since current anode materials possess working potentials fairly close to the potential of a lithium metal, the focus is on the development of cathode materials. This work reviews and analyzes the current state of the art, achievements, and challenges in the field of high-voltage cathode materials for Li-ion cells.

An FRAM memory cell consists of a capacitor connected to a plate and bit line and The orientation of the dipole within the capacitor determines whether a 1 or 0 is stored. FRAM is non-volatile because of the special dielectric material used in the storage capacitor, a ceramic that allows use of the so-called ferroelectric effect. The energy consumed by a FRAM MCU becomes substantially lower when FRAM's lower power consumption is multiplied by its much faster write speed. FRAM can write data much faster primarily because, unlike EEPROM where you must have two steps to write data. FRAM's write memory function happens in the same process as read memory. Its memory can function equally as program memory or data memory storage, while in other non-volatile memory types data and programs are kept in separate memories.",,"A-ceramics; Bit-line ands; Data memory; Ferroelectric effects; Lower-power consumption; Memory cell; Memory functions; Non-volatile; Non-volatile memories; Program memory; Storage capacitor; Write speed; Capacitors; Dielectric materials; Ferroelectric devices",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865728208

In plants, changes in lipid composition have been observed in diverse responses ranging from abiotic and biotic stress to organogenesis. Knowledge of the lipid composition is an important first step towards understanding the function of lipids in any given biological system. As Brachypodium distachyon is emerging as the model species for temperate grass research, it is therefore fundamentally important to gain insights of its lipid composition. We used HPLC-coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to profile and quantify levels of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids in shoots and undifferentiated cells in suspension cultures of B. distachyon. A total of 123 lipids belonging to 10 classes were identified and quantified. Our results showed that there are differences in lipid profiles and levels of individual lipid species between shoots and undifferentiated cells in suspension cultures. Additionally, we showed that 4-sphingenine (d18:1 Δ4) is the main unsaturated dihydroxy-long chain base (LCB) in B. distachyon, and we were unable to detect d18:1 Δ8, which is the main unsaturated dihydroxy-LCB in the model dicotyledonous species, Arabidopsis thaliana. This work serves as the first step towards a comprehensive characterization of the B. distachyon lipidome that will complement future biochemical studies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Brachypodium distachyon; Glycerophospholipids; LC-MS/MS; Lipidome; Sphingolipids","glycerophospholipid; lipidome; phytosphingosine; sphingolipid; sphingosine; unsaturated fatty acid; Arabidopsis; article; biological model; Brachypodium; controlled study; high performance liquid chromatography; lipid analysis; lipid composition; nonhuman; plant cell culture; plant seed; quantitative analysis; shoot; suspension cell culture; tandem mass spectrometry; Arabidopsis thaliana; Brachypodium distachyon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864074602

Hierarchically structured hybrids of ZnO with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an example of this co-operative behavior. ZnO is characterized by a wide band gap and large exciton binding energy and CNTs ensure very high electrical conductivity. In the present work, a 3-D construction based on an array of 1-D vertically aligned (VA) CNTs constitute the conductive substrate for the growth of ZnO semiconductor nanoparticles using a laser-assisted flow deposition method. The functional interaction at the nanoscale between both materials is demonstrated by the enhancement of the high resolved near band edge recombination which accounts for an almost three orders of magnitude increase when compared with the green spectral band.

A starting point for system design when increasing load or local power production could be to limit the voltage fluctuations to ±5% from nominal voltage. Strategies to regulate voltage include cable improvement, transformer management, Demand side management, storage, and line interconnection. We present a mathematical model applicable for both a static and dynamic analysis to quantify effects from these measures, though the best solution will depend on local conditions and needs to be determined case by case. Combining several voltage control options simultaneously may lead to further positive effects. Strategies when doubling the load and increasing DEGS production to twice the electricity demand were analyzed here in detail. It also needs to be pointed out that other factors related to power quality besides voltage may need consideration when large amounts of DEGS are integrated to distribution networks. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Decentralized electricity production; Distributed energy systems; Smart grid; Voltage control","Decentralized electricity; Demand side managements; Distributed electricity generation; Distributed energy systems; Electricity demands; Local conditions; Nominal voltage; Power production; Smart grid; Static and dynamic analysis; Voltage fluctuations; Electric generators; Mathematical models; Smart power grids; Voltage control; Power quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863851998

Methods: Zirconia samples were silica-coated by air abrasion and each of the five coupling agents was then applied to give five test groups. Resin composite stubs were bonded onto the conditioned zirconia surfaces. The samples were stored: dry storage, 30 days in water and thermocycled to give a total of fifteen test groups. The shear bond strengths were determined using a universal testing machine and data analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD (p &lt; 0.05) with shear bond strength as dependent variable and storage condition and primers as independent variables. The bond formation of the five coupling agents to zirconia was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results: Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that there was a significant difference for different primers (p &lt; 0.05) and different storage conditions (p &lt; 0.05) on the shear bond strength values measured. XPS analysis showed a shift in binding energy for O 1s after priming with the five coupling agents which revealed different bond formations related to the functional groups of the coupling agents. Significance: The shear bond strength values measured for all coupling agents after water storage and thermocycling exceed the minimum shear bond strength value of 5 MPa set by ISO. The silane coupling agent, 3-acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, showed the highest bond strength of the three storage conditions. © 2012 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, the main target of the specific work is to estimate the appropriate size of a similar system, so as to meet the energy demand of typical remote consumers under the criterion of minimum first installation cost. Representative case studies of the Greek territory with different quality of wind and solar potential are currently investigated, with the results obtained designating the advantages of the proposed solution, especially for locations of low wind potential. Furthermore, according to the results, the critical role of the local wind potential on the optimum size of such configurations is reflected, while variation of the local solar potential in the Greek territory seems to only slightly influence the minimum first installation cost solutions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery storage; Energy autonomy; First installation cost; Greece; Remote consumer; Remote islands; Renewable energy","Battery storage; Energy autonomies; Greece; Installation costs; Remote consumers; Remote islands; Renewable energies; Cost benefit analysis; Electric utilities; Energy management; Hybrid systems; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power generation; Virtual storage; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863493885

This corresponded with significantly elevated potential energy and concentrations of ATP, ADP and glycogen. Depletion of these metabolites occurred by 24. h at both temperatures and was mirrored by rises in lactate and inosine monophosphate (IMP). At 24. h snapper stored at 4.15 °C remained in partial rigor, whereas animals at 0.3 °C were in firm rigor. After 72. h significantly higher inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations were present in the 4.15 °C group, demonstrating temperature related mass action. Tissue biochemistry significantly correlated with changes in fillet colour, particularly redness and yellowness, and we propose that fillet colour can be used as a non-destructive indicator of muscle biochemistry.

Beside this, large quantities of paper are rapidly damaged by biological attacks following natural disasters and improper storage conditions. The treatment of paper documents with ionizing radiation can be used for mass decontamination of cultural heritage items but conservators and restaurators are still reserved because of the radiation induced degradation. We conducted a study for establishing the dose needed for the effective treatment of paper documents, taking into account the biological burden and the irradiation effects on paper structure. We used physical testing specific to paper industry and less destructive analytical methods (thermal analysis).Our results show that an effective treatment can be performed with doses lower than 10. kGy. Old paper appears to be less affected by gamma radiation than recent paper but the sampling is highly affected by the non-uniform degree of the initial degradation status. The extent of testing for degradation and the magnitude of acceptable degradation should take into account the biological threat and the expected life time of the paper documents. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cellulose degradation; Mechanical testing; Microbiological testing.; Paper conservation; Radiation processing; Thermal analysis","Analytical method; Biological attack; Biological threat; Cellulose degradation; Cellulose substrates; Cultural heritages; Expected life; Iron gall ink; Irradiation dose; Irradiation effect; Microbiological testing; Natural disasters; Paper conservation; Paper documents; Paper industries; Paper structure; Physical testing; Radiation processing; Radiation-induced degradation; Storage condition; Cellulose; Degradation; Electron beam pumping; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Mechanical testing; Paper and pulp industry; Thermoanalysis; Radiation decontamination; article; decomposition; degradation kinetics; ionizing radiation; low energy radiation; microbial contamination; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; paper; paper industry; pathogen load; physical chemistry; radiation absorption; radiation dose; radiation sterilization; radiolysis; radiosensitivity; shelf life; thermal analysis; Cellulose Degradation; Conservation; Electron Beams; Microbiology; Paper; Pulp Industry; Radiation; Testing; Thermal Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861931192

So far, no international consensus has been achieved regarding the optimal radiation dose. Many authors suggest that bone sterilization deteriorates bone mechanical properties. However, no data on the influence of ionizing radiation on bone dynamic mechanical properties are available. Bovine femurs from 2-year old animal were machine cut and irradiated with the doses 10, 15, 25, 35, 45 and 50 kGy. Dynamic mechanical analysis was performed at 1-10 Hz at the temperature range of 0-350°C in 3-point bending configuration. No statistically significant differences in storage modulus were observed. However, there were significant decreased values of loss modulus between the samples irradiated with doses of 10 (↓14.3%), 15, 45 and 50 kGy (↓33.2%) and controls. It was stated that increased irradiation dose decreases the temperature where collagen denaturation process starts and increases the temperature where the collagen denaturation process finishes. It was shown that activation energy of denaturation process is significantly higher for the samples irradiated with the dose of 50 kGy (615 kJ/mol) in comparison with control samples and irradiation with other doses (100-135 kJ/mol). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Activation energy; Bone; Denaturation temperature; DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis); Irradiation","3-point bending; Bone graft; Bone mechanical properties; Bone response; Collagen denaturation; Control samples; Denaturation temperatures; Dynamic loadings; Dynamic mechanical property; Energy of denaturation; Infectious disease; Irradiation dose; Loss moduli; Statistically significant difference; Temperature range; Activation energy; Bone; Collagen; Denaturation; Dynamic loads; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Mechanical properties; Loading; animal; article; biomechanics; bone; bone transplantation; cattle; femur; instrument sterilization; methodology; physiology; radiation; radiation dose; radiation exposure; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone and Bones; Bone Transplantation; Cattle; Femur; Radiation; Radiation Dosage; Sterilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861850087

To this aim, the electrodes were stored in an electrolyte solution (0.5 M KI, 0.05 M I 2 in 90%/10% PC/EG) or in air, within a closed vessel, for up to 70 days. A drop of up to 40% in the current density for triiodide reduction was caused by storage in the electrolyte solution and of about 15%-20% when the electrodes were stored in air. Electrolyte storage was found to cause a 40% increase in the activation energy of both kinds of electrodes. XPS measurements have shown that the main degradation mechanism in the case of electrolyte storage is the dissolution of Pt from the substrate.

Besides the solar energy conversion in electrical or thermal energy, a possible way for solar energy conversion and storage is the development of new phosphorescent compounds able to provide long-term phosphorescence with reasonable delivered light intensity. These phosphorescent compounds could be used in various applications like highway traffic lights, signs, emergency guidance in buildings in case of power failures, etc. Given the targeted applications, the phosphorescent compounds should meet some specific characteristics, among them the most important are: longterm, constant behaviour in harsh environmental conditions, more than 5 h phosphorescence decay time, constant luminescence over a long period of time and low production costs. In this paper a new developed phosphorescent composite will be presented, based on poly-ethyleneterephthalate (PET) as polymer matrix and copper-doped zinc sulphide nanocrystals as luminescent compound. The described preparation method could stay on the basis of a scaled up procedure for large quantities production and the composite characteristics should recommend it for the above-mentioned applications.","Long-persistence phosphorescent compounds; Phosphorescent composites; Poly-ethyleneterphthalate; Polymer matrix","composite; fluorescence; light; light intensity; luminescence; polymer; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864227491

Drying seed grains, with the purpose of storage for long periods, is a method used in food industry on large scale, but one should take into account the parameters of drying process, in order to reduce the depreciation of the grain quality. The research is conducted towards a drying technology based on flue gases heat energy input. One purpose consists of solving the question if any pollutants from the flue gases affect or attempt to reach the grains, through the proposed technology. Thus one focuses on pollutants measurement resulting from the burning process of propane, at entrance and exit from the dryer. Complementary the necessary air quantity that is used in the drying process is controlled and indicated as an important parameter of the success of the process. It is also attested that the resulted combustion compounds resulted from the moisture extraction process of the grain, by using the proposed type of dryer, through convection, do not affect the food safety. The pollutants analysed are SO2, CO, CmH n, O2, NO and NO2. The coefficient of air excess was also determined, through a computational operation, as well as the concentration of CO2, flow, speed and the mass flow of the flue gases, for all the analysed situations. Not at least, a phytologic analysis of the grains studied is presented which indicates that finally the grains are totally not contaminated by the drying process. The humidity reduction of the grain is thus reached that is very useful for the long-term deposit of quality grains.","Air pollution; Drying process; Drying technology for food products; Grain quality; Humidity; Temperature","air temperature; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); European Union; food industry; food processing; humidity; maize; quantitative analysis; Romania; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864195242

One motivation behind this work is that RPL is the first prospective candidate routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks, which are a main component in the next generation Internet-of-Things. RPL is still under development, although having gained maturity, and is open to improvements. Indeed, there is a need to understand well its behavior, and investigate its relevance. Our analysis is based on the ContikiRPL accurate and realistic simulation model developed under Contiki operating system. The performance of RPL is evaluated and analyzed for different network settings to understand the impact of the protocol attributes on the network formation performance, namely in terms energy, storage overhead, communication overhead, network convergence time and the maximum hop count. We argue through simulation that RPL provides several features that make it suitable to large scale networks. © 2012 IEEE.","IPv6 networks; Low power and lossy networks (LLN); Performance evaluation; Routing; Simulation; Wireless Sensor Networks","IPv6 networks; Lossy networks; Performance evaluation; Routing; Simulation; Computer network performance evaluation; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863645320

The design of these systems requires efficient methodologies aggregating partitioning and mapping. In these sense, this paper explores partitioning and mapping influence on energy consumption of homogeneous NoC-Based MPSoC. In addition, it compares two strategies to achieve efficient dynamic mappings: one that map tasks directly onto processors and another one that applies a previous static task-partitioning and uses this information to choose the dynamic task mapping. Experiments with various synthetic and four embedded applications show the efficiency of the second strategy that minimizes an average of 23.5% on energy consumption. © 2012 IEEE.","Mapping; MPSoC; NoC; Partitioning","Dynamic mapping; Dynamic task mappings; Embedded application; Energy Consumption Minimization; Map task; MPSoC; NoC; Partitioning; Software complexity; Target architectures; Design; Energy utilization; Multiprocessing systems; Mapping",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863638135

Stable, for more than three months, under room conditions, ZV-Bi NP colloids are obtained when using sodium citrate and a deficit of the reducing agent respect to the bismuth salt. This reaction mixture yields small, well-faceted, and also quasi-spherical crystalline particles, with an average size of 3.3 nm, SD of 1.0 nm, determined by HR-TEM. These are the smallest ZV-Bi NPs, synthesized by a fast and straightforward colloidal method, found in the literature. Indirect and direct energy gaps were discovered in the near-infrared spectral range (1400-1600 nm) of the ZV-Bi NPs, indicating the displacement of the conduction and valence bands due to the strong quantum confinement; bulk bismuth itself is a semimetal.

Divided bit lines improve dynamic cell stability while at the same time decreasing active energy consumption. To limit unnecessary activity, word lines are divided on a word-by-word basis. Local write sense amplifiers make it possible to use low swing signaling on the global bit lines. To control this architecture, a distributed decoder is used. The use of dual swing data links on the global bit lines limits the impact of local write sense amplifier offset on the overall energy consumption. Using high threshold transistors in the memory cells reduces static power consumption and improves the cell's read stability. A partly dynamic decoder structure increases memory speed at a very low energy cost. The timing of this memory is made configurable to be able to cope with PVT variations without increasing design margins.The designed 256 kbit memory was fabricated in a 65 nm triple-V T process. It operates up to a speed of 850 MHz while only consuming 4.3 pJ/access for a word length of 32 bit. Standby leakage power is 25.2 μW.

Temperature dependent measurements show that charge carrier transport has activation energy of 70 meV suggesting that tunneling is the operating mechanism in both resistive states. The change in resistance is caused by a large increase in charge carrier density.

Another trend has been the increasing concentration of these industries in the hands of the Russian government. This latter phenomenon has been accompanied by an increasingly authoritarian political system, in which former intelligence officers play key roles. Russian firms have tried to purchase a controlling stake in pipelines, ports, storage facilities, and other key energy assets of the countries of central and eastern Europe. They need these assets to transport energy supplies to lucrative western European markets, as well as to secure greater control over the domestic markets of the countries of the region. In several cases where assets were sold to non-Russian firms, Russian firms cut off energy supplies to the facilities. Russia has also tried to build new pipelines to circumvent infrastructure that it does not control. Another objective Russia has pursued has been to eliminate the energy subsidies former Soviet republics have received since the fall of the Soviet Union, including by raising the price these countries pay for natural gas to world market prices. It is not completely clear whether the pursuit of Russian foreign policy objectives is the primary explanation for the actions of its energy firms. Few would disagree in principle that the elimination of subsidies to post-Soviet countries is a sound business decision, even if questions have been raised about the timing of such moves. Even the pursuit of multiple pipelines can be portrayed as a business decision. On the other hand, many countries of the region are concerned that Russia may use their energy dependency to interfere in their domestic affairs or to force them to make foreign policy concessions. Countries of the region also fear that by controlling energy infrastructure in their countries, Russian energy firms are able to manipulate the internal political situation by favoring certain local businessmen and politicians. However, the current global economic crisis has hurt Russia's energy firms and Russia's international clout, as energy prices have tumbled. Bush Administration officials repeatedly criticized what they view as Russian efforts to use itsenergy supplies as a political weapon. The Obama Administration, like its predecessor, has urged European countries to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. The United States has strongly advocated the building of multiple pipelines from Central Asia and Azerbaijan to Europe. Members of Congress have also expressed concern about the impact on European countries of their dependence on Russian energy. In the 111th Congress, committees have held hearings that have touched on the issue. Congress has also passed resolutions that refer to worrisome aspects of Russian energy policy.

The annual program has grown from $400 million in the DOD budget over $1 billion per year across three agencies-DOD, DOE, and the State Department. It has also evolved from an emergency response to impending chaos in the Soviet Union, to a more comprehensive threat reduction and nonproliferation effort, to a broader program seeking to keep nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons from leaking out of the former Soviet Union and into the hands of rogue nations or terrorist groups. The Department of Defense manages the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, which provides Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan with assistance in transporting, storing, and dismantling nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. U.S. assistance has helped these nations eliminate the delivery systems for nuclear weapons under the START Treaty, secure weapons storage areas, construct a storage facility for nuclear materials removed from weapons, construct a destruction facility for chemical weapons, and secure biological weapons materials. The State Department manages the International Science and Technology Centers in Moscow and Kiev. These centers provide research grants to scientists and engineers so that they will not sell their knowledge to other nations or terrorist groups. The State Department has also provided assistance with export and border control programs in the former Soviet states. The Department of Energy manages programs that seek to improve the security of nuclear materials at civilian, naval, and nuclear weapons complex facilities. It also funds programs that help nuclear scientists and engineers find employment in commercial enterprises. DOE is also helping Russia dispose of plutonium removed from nuclear weapons and shut-down its remaining plutonium-producing reactors by replacing them with fossil-fuel plants. Analysts have debated numerous issues related to U.S. nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance. These include questions about the coordination of and priority given to these programs in the U.S. government, questions about Russia's willingness to provide the United States with access to its weapons facilities, questions about the President's ability to waive certification requirements so that the programs can go forward, and questions about the need to expand the efforts into a global program that receives funding from numerous nations and possibly extends assistance to others outside the former Soviet Union.

He recommends approaching the energy debate from three different perspectives - economic, national security, and environmental - and focusing less narrowly on climate change. Richter presents himself as a pragmatic moderate, trailblazing a path between climate ""deniers"" and ""exaggerators."" He advocates replacing all coal-burning power plants with natural gas, adopting stricter fuel-efficiency standards, electrifying vehicles, building grid-scale storage for renewable energy, instituting a revenue-neutral carbon tax, and expanding nuclear power - all measures on which he sees potential for widespread agreement across political lines in the United States. Richter discusses ways to make nuclear power safer in countries that are new to it, such as requiring these countries to hire expert operators from more experienced countries for the first few years. He also shares his concerns about regulatory shortcomings in some countries. Richter remains optimistic about solving the challenges of climate change and recommends limiting future climate talks to a smaller group of nations as a way of making faster progress. © 2012 The Author(s).","Burton Richter; climate change; energy efficiency; natural gas; nuclear power; renewable energy; revenue neutral carbon tax",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871788448

B-072 was carried out at in a glucose-monosodium glutamate mineral medium at different C/N-ratios (30-165) with glucose fixed at 90 g/L. With increasing C/N-ratio, a modest increase in lipid content (60 to 73 % w/w) was observed whereas fat-free biomass decreased but overall biomass showed little variation. FA-profiles were not affected to a large extent by C/N-ratio and absolute docosahexaenoic (DHA)-levels fell in narrow range (5-6 g/L). However at C/N > 64 a rapid decrease in lipid synthetic rate and/or incomplete glucose utilization occurred. Glucose and FAfluxes based on fat-free biomass peaked at a C/N ratio of 56. This condition was chosen for calculation of the redox balance (NAD(P)H) and energy (ATP) requirement and to estimate the in vivo P/O ratio during the main period of fatty acid biosynthesis. Several models with different routes for NADPH, acetyl-CoA formation and re-oxidation of OAA formed via ATP-citrate lyase were considered as these influence the redox- and energy balance. As an example, using a commonly shown scheme whereby NADPH is supplied by a cytosolic ""transhydrogenase cycle"" (pyruvate-OAA-malate-pyruvate) and OAA formed by ATP-citrate lyase is recycled via import into the mitochondria as malate, the calculated NADPH-requirement amounted to 5.5 with an ATP-demand of 10.5 mmol/(g fat-free biomass x h) and an in vivo P/O-ratio (not including non-growth associated maintenance) of 1.6. The lowest ATP requirement is found when acetyl-CoA would be transported directly from the mitochondria to the cytosol by carnitine acetyltransferase. Assay of some enzymes critical for NADPH supply indicates that activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the HMP pathway, is far insufficient for the required NADPH-flux and malic enzyme must be a major source. Activity of the latter (ca. 300 mU/mg protein) far exceeds that in oleaginous fungi and yeast.","Aurantiochytrium; C/N-ratio; Docosahexaenoic acid; Fatty acid flux; P/O ratio","Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870660066

The main principle of PCMs is the utilization of the latent heat of a phase change for energy storage. Though many pure chemical elements can be used as PCMs, a PCM very often consists of a number of substances. The main reason for creating a PCM as a mixture of various substances is to achieve a desirable melting temperature for a particular application. However, these mixed PCMs require accurate and reliable methods for determining their physical properties, since for numerical modeling the thermal properties of materials and their proper determination represent a significant issue that considerably affects the accuracy and credibility of numerical simulations and their outcomes. The thermal properties of PCMs are usually obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), based on temperature and heat measurements of the investigated and reference materials. There are several approaches to modeling materials with phase changes. In this paper, the focus is on the enthalpy approach and the effective heat capacity method. Both techniques, which utilize the results from a particular DSC measurement, allow a treatment with the latent heat, and as a result the desired heat or cold storage may be effectively simulated. The presented methods were implemented using the results from DSC measurements in order to simulate a solar air collector with a PCM. The obtained results are presented and discussed. The paper also concerns the problems associated with the uncertainty of material properties and their influence on numerical simulations.","Effective heat capacity method; Enthalpy method; Phase change material (PCM); Solar air collector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865470577

Box - 800, Riyadh 11421, Saudi Arabia","Direct alcohol fuel cells have been attracting enormous research interest as power sources for vehicles and portable electronic devices because alcohols are readily available, their storage and transport can be easily handled with the existing fuel infrastructure, and they commonly have high mass-specific and volumetric energy densities. Methanol is the most studied fuel for direct alcohol fuel cells because methanol is readily available, it is structurally simple, and has a promising electrochemical activity. However, several research groups have also reported the use of 2-propanol as a promising fuel. The potential advantages of utilizing 2-propanol as fuel are many such as it is relatively less toxic compared to other alcohols, at low potentials it is less prone to anode poisoning, and it has better resistance to crossover and cathode poisoning. The performance of the fuel cell for a particular catalyst system is related to the cell conditions such as 2-propanol concentration, anode and cathode fuel flow rates, cell temperature and oxidant back pressure. This study was designed to study the effect of the different cell operation conditions at three different levels and the interactions between these components by response surface methodology (RSM). We observed that the power density of the cell increased with increase in molar concentration of 2-propanol and cell operation temperature, the optimized conditions for the highest power density of 45 mW/cm 2 by the RSM was found to be 1.5 M 2-propanol concentration, 80 °C cell temperature, 9.22 ml/min 2-propanol flow rate, 596 ml/min oxygen flow rate and no back pressure for the oxidant, this is from amongst one of the best results reported in literature for direct 2-propanol fuel cell performance. © 2012 by ESG.","2-propanol fuel cell; Direct alcohol fuel cell; Fuel cell optimization; Statistical analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864003624

The results showed that pH along the digestive tract changed according to the postprandial time following the food transit. At the beginning, the pH on crop (St) was 5, changing to 6 when the food arrived. Similar changes were observed on the caecum (Ce) and DG. Glycogen from DG is used as a source of energy during digestion and recovered 8h after feeding. Maximum activities of digestive gland GJ enzymes were observed 6h after feeding, indicating that chyme enzymes are still active when they arrive at the DG's lumen.

The hydrogen storage properties of Ni-activated carbon nanocomposites (Ni/AC) were investigated at room temperature and under moderate pressure. The chemical composition, morphology and textural parameters are characterized using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and N 2 adsorption isotherms. Fine and well-dispersed Ni nanoparticles were obtained by ED that had spherical shape with an average size of 5 nm. The hydrogen storage capacity of the AC can be improved through Ni loading; which results in a hydrogen storage enhancement factor of two compared with the Ni-free AC. This enhancement factor is due to the greater interactions between the Ni and the AC, which facilitate the hydrogen spillover mechanism. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The synthesized alloy exhibited good hydrogenation kinetics and reversibly absorbed about 2.8 wt. % of hydrogen. The temperature dependence of hydrogenation kinetics of the alloy measured in the range of temperatures covering the order-disorder phase transformations in the Mg 3Cd and MgCd phases did not exhibit any anomalies and could be fitted with a single Arrhenius line. The measured apparent activation energy (69 ± 2 kJ/mol) hinted that hydrogenation process was controlled by diffusion of Cd in metallic phase. The pressure-composition isotherms exhibited negligible pressure hysteresis and sloping pressure plateau. Based on microstructural evidence obtained with the aid of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, we built a thermodynamic model predicting the plateau hydrogen pressure for partially hydrogenated alloy. The predictions of the model were in a good agreement with the experimental data.

The timeline is considered in a global perspective on the basis of available prognoses for fossil fuels - especially coal. Relevant research questions are: (1) what generating capacity is required to meet the global demands, and (2) which capture rate would be realistic and sufficient. In answering these questions, the study employs two empirical "" laws"" that apply to new energy technology options in the transition and the stabilisation phase. This approach is used to determine the required scale-up rates and to compare efforts and impacts associated with prior experience from successful energy technologies implemented over the past century. Criteria are also suggested for coining CCS technology available and material with regard to commercial power generation.The study reveals some inherent limitations based on the perception that the energy system itself is so huge that it takes time to build the required human and industrial capacity, and to fill the knowledge gap. History suggests that 30. years or more are needed for a new energy technology to materialise. In order for CCS to have the desired impact on greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the process of materialising CCS must take place within just one decade. Hence, the implication is that broaching CCS into society within this short time span is - if practicable - an unprecedented challenge which requires war-like actions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity building; CCS; Deployment ""laws""; Energy technology adoption; Timeline; Transition strategies for large-scale deployment","Capacity building; CCS; Deployment laws; Energy technologies; Large-scale deployment; Timeline; Carbon dioxide; Diagnosis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Technology; Broaching; capacity building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860542208

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO 2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO 2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO 2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon balance in forestry; Carbon neutrality; Energy carbon balance; Forest biomass; Intensive management; Substitution","Annual mean; Bio-energy; Bio-energy systems; Biomass productions; Carbon balance; Carbon stocks; Carbon storage; Central Finland; Ecosystem model; Energy productions; Fertile sites; Finnish; Forest biomass; Forest ecosystem; Intensive management; Life cycle analysis; Management scenarios; Nitrogen fertilization; Norway spruce; Norway spruce stands; Per unit; Timber production; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Management; Rotation; Substitution reactions; Timber; Carbon; bioenergy; biological production; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coniferous forest; ecosystem modeling; energy use; fertilizer application; forest ecosystem; forest management; forestry production; life cycle analysis; management practice; nitrogen; phytomass; power generation; sustainable forestry; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Forests; Norway; Picea Abies; Rotation; Finland; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859496091

Since organisms' age modifies how energy resources are allocated and modifies the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the response to toxic agents could be altered with age. Seven age groups of Daphnia schoedleri (0, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28-day-old) were exposed for 24h to two sublethal concentrations of Cr(VI): 1/25 and 1/5 of the 48h EC 50 of each age group, to determine the age at which susceptibility to Cr(VI) is highest. To evaluate energy content, carbohydrate, protein and lipid reserves were quantified and antioxidant enzymes activity was assessed (SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR). Furthermore, an integrative approach was applied to evaluate both sets of responses and interpret them as a whole in a simply visual way, achieved by the integrated biomarker response approach. Results indicate that Cr(VI) induced significant differences in all age groups. Seven and 14-day-old organisms were exposed to the highest concentrations (based on their EC50) and showed greater tolerance to this metal. Susceptibility to the toxicant was highest in younger specimens in which energy requirements are greater due to high growth rates (basal metabolism), as a result of which more energy reserves are expended to satisfy demands in terms of growth and response to toxicants. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecotoxicology; Cladoceran; Energy reserves; Integrated biomarker response; Oxidative stress","carbohydrate; catalase; chromium; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; lipid; protein; superoxide dismutase; article; bioenergy; carbohydrate analysis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; Daphnia; Daphnia schoedleri; energy metabolism; energy resource; enzyme activity; groups by age; growth rate; lipid storage; nonhuman; priority journal; protein content; Age Factors; Animals; Biological Markers; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Catalase; Chromium; Daphnia; Energy Metabolism; Female; Glutathione Peroxidase; Glutathione Reductase; Lipid Metabolism; Proteins; Superoxide Dismutase; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Anomopoda; Daphnia schoedleri; Daphniidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859190437

Drying process can be helpful to conserve the castor oil seed during long storage periods, for this reason in this research, the drying kinetics of castor oil seeds during fluidized bed drying at a constant air velocity of 7m/s and high air temperatures (80, 90, 100, 110°C) were studied. Six empirical mathematical models were selected to describe and compare the drying characteristic of R. communis seeds at previous described conditions. Drying rate constants, coefficients and statistical parameters were determined by non-linear regression analysis. Among the tested models used to describe the drying kinetics of castor oil seeds, the diffusion approach model was selected as the best one. The moisture loss from the seeds was described by the Fick's diffusion equation, and based on the obtained results the effective moisture diffusivity was estimated, getting a value in the range from 8.21×10 -10 to 2.61×10 -9m 2/s. The relationship between the temperature and the effective moisture diffusivity was described adequately by means of Arrhenius-type equation. An activation energy value of 41.41kJ/mol was obtained. The findings allow the successful simulation of R. communis seeds fluidized bed drying between 80 and 110°C.

To alleviate power fluctuation, the superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) can be applied. Nevertheless, the installation of SMES is quite costly. Especially, the superconducting coil size which is the vital part of SMES, must be carefully specified. This paper proposes a new optimization technique of power controller parameters and coil sizes of multiple SMES units for alleviation of tie-line power fluctuation in interconnected power systems with wind farms. The structure of active and reactive power controllers of SMES is the proportional-integral (PI). Based on the minimization of the variance of tie-line power fluctuation and the initial stored energy of a SMES unit, the optimal PI parameters and coil size can be automatically tuned by a particle swarm optimization. Simulation study in the West Japan interconnected systems confirms that the proposed SMES with optimal coil size is able to effectively and robustly suppress power fluctuation against various wind power patterns and heavy power flow levels. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Particle swarm optimization; power fluctuation; superconducting magnetic energy storage; wind power","Coil sizes; Large penetrations; Optimization techniques; Power controllers; Power flows; Power fluctuations; Power pattern; Proportional-integral; Reactive power controllers; Simulation studies; Stored energy; Super-conducting coils; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Tie-line; Wind farm; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power control; Superconducting devices; Wind power; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862587559

Nevertheless, if the SMES is also applied for transient stability improvement, a large power capacity of SMES is required. Additionally, the SMES is not able to absorb enough energy during faults since the bus voltage where the SMES is installed, drops considerably. To enhance the SMES control effect and transient stability, this paper proposes the coordinated control of the optimized resistive type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) and SMES. When the fault occurs, the SFCL rapidly suppresses the transient power swing by limiting the fault current. Subsequently, the SMES damps out the remaining power swing. The optimization problem of SFCL resistance and power controller parameters of SMES with optimal coil size is formulated based on an augmentation of transient stability margin and damping performance. Solving the problem by the particle swarm optimization, the optimal parameters of SFCL and SMES can be automatically obtained. Simulation study confirms the superior stabilizing effect of the coordinated SFCL and SMES over the individual device. The SFCL not only solves the voltage drop problem at the SMES bus, but also assists the SMES to stabilize the system. Besides, the MW and MJ capacities of the SMES operated with SFCL are significantly reduced. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Power system stability; superconducting fault current limiter; superconducting magnetic energy storage","Bus voltage; Co-ordinated control; Coil sizes; Damping performance; Large power; Optimal parameter; Optimization problems; Power controllers; Power swings; Power system stability; Power system transient stability; Remaining Power; Resistive type superconducting fault current limiter; Simulation studies; Stabilizing effects; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Transient stability improvement; Transient stability margins; Voltage drop; Electric energy storage; Optimization; Problem solving; Superconducting devices; Superconducting electric lines; System stability; Superconducting fault current limiters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862514533

Calculations of hydrate phase transitions based on a modified statistical-mechanical model for hydrate (Kvamme, B.; Tanaka, H. J. Phys. Chem.1995, 99, 7114-7119) are used to illustrate differences in properties of hydrates formed from different phases. In more general terms, hydrates in porous media are discussed in terms of the Gibbs phase rule. It is argued that phase transitions involving hydrates in porous media can rarely reach any state of equilibrium due to situations of over specified systems with reference to requirements for equilibrium. As a consequence of this, a strategy for nonequilibrium description of hydrates in reservoirs is proposed. This involves the formulation of kinetic expressions for all possible hydrate formations and dissociations as competing pseudoreactions. This involves hydrate formation on a water/carbon dioxide interface, from water solution and from carbon dioxide adsorbed on mineral surfaces, as well as all different possible hydrate dissociation possibilities. The basic idea is that the direction of free energy minimum, under constraints of mass and heat transport, will control the progress of phase transitions in nonequilibrium systems. A new hydrate reservoir simulator based on this concept is introduced in this study. The reservoir simulator is developed from a platform previously developed for carbon dioxide storage in aquifers, RetrasoCodeBright (RCB). The main tools for generating kinetic models have been phase field theory simulations, with thermodynamic properties derived from molecular modeling. The detailed results from these types of simulations provides information on the relative impact of mass transport, heat transport, and thermodynamics of the phase transition, which enable qualified simplifications for implementation into RCB. The primary step was to study the effect of hydrate growth or dissociation with a single kinetic rate on the mechanical properties of the reservoir. Details of the simulator and numerical algorithms are discussed, and relevant examples are shown. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide storage; Energy minima; Gibbs phase rules; Heat transport; Hydrate dissociation; Hydrate formation; Hydrate growth; Hydrate phase; Kinetic expression; Kinetic models; Kinetic rates; Mass and heat transport; Mineral surfaces; Non equilibrium; Non-equilibrium modeling; Nonequilibrium system; Numerical algorithms; Phase field theory; Relative impact; Reservoir simulator; Thermodynamic equilibria; Water solutions; Algorithms; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Dissociation; Heat transfer; Hydration; Hydrogeology; Kinetics; Mechanical properties; Phase interfaces; Porous materials; Simulators; Gas hydrates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862654140

The identification of thermally and electrically conductive graphitic carbon host formation is important for the further development of this general ligand-free synthetic approach for inorganic nanocrystal growth in the solid state, and can be extended to form a range of transition metals pyrophosphates.

In U.S., majority of hydrogen production plants implement steam methane reforming (SMR) for centralized hydrogen production. However, there is a wide lack of agreement on the nascent stage of using hydrogen as fuel in vehicles industry because of the difficulty in delivery and storage. By performing technological and economic analysis, this work aims to establish the most feasible hydrogen production pathway for automotives in near future. From the evaluation, processes such as thermal cracking of ammonia and centralized hydrogen production followed by bulk delivery are eliminated while on-site steam reforming of methanol and natural gas are the most technologically feasible options. These two processes are further evaluated by comprehensive economic analysis. The results showed that the steam reforming (SR) of natural gas has a shorter payback time and a higher return on investment (ROI) and internal rate of return (IRR). Sensitivity analysis has also been constructed to evaluate the impact of variables like NG feedstock price, capital of investment and operating capacity factor on the overall production cost of hydrogen. Based on this study, natural gas is prompted to be the most economically and technologically available raw material for short-term hydrogen production before the transition to renewable energy source such as solar energy, biomass and wind power. © 2012 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).","ammonia cracking; cost analysis; gas station; steam reforming","Automotives; Cost analysis; Feedstock prices; Gas stations; Hydrogen production plant; In-vehicle; Internal rate of return; Operating capacity; Payback time; Production cost; Renewable energy source; Return on investments; Steam reforming of methanol; Techno-Economic analysis; Thermal cracking; World energies; Ammonia; Cost accounting; Cracking (chemical); Earnings; Economic analysis; Fuel storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Methanol; Natural gas; Profitability; Steam reforming; Wind power; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864253006

This paper investigated the AC load profiles of three typical local commercial buildings, i.e. office, hotel and retail, and examined the energy consumption of liquid desiccant cooling system (LDCS) for these buildings. Simulation results showed that the cooling load contributed to more than 98% of total annual load, with high latent load proportion from March to September. The high reheating ratio, i.e. from 60% to 90%, is found to be the main reason for the poor thermal comfort. Therefore, the LDCS which could handle sensible and latent loads separately was proposed. However, the electricity-driven LDCS was found not suitable for local commercial buildings. significant energy saving could be achieved by the solar-assisted LDCS system with thermal storage, when the installation area for solar collectors is larger than the minimum required one, i.e. 9.7 m 2/(kW m -2) for office and 12.7 m 2/(kW m -2) for hotel buildings. Energy saving of different system types with different installation areas was also studied. The solar-assisted LDCS shows more energy saving in winter but less in summer.

This incorporation can bring problems onto the dynamics of power systems owing to the lack of controllability over the wind and the type of generation used. In this work, a distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM) coupled with a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is used to mitigate problems introduced by wind generation in the electrical systems. A dynamic model of the DSTATCOM/FESS device is briefly presented and a technique to control the active power exchanged between the device and the power system is proposed. The control technique has two control modes. One control mode mitigates the power fluctuations of wind generators, and it is based on fuzzy logic and a special filter. The other control mode contributes to recover the frequency when significant faults arise in the system. Simulation tests on the behaviour of the device are analysed when it works in combination with wind generation in the electrical system. Results show a satisfactory performance of the proposed control techniques along with a high effectiveness to smooth the active power fluctuations of wind generation and to contribute to the recovery of the frequency. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Active power; Combined control; Control modes; Control techniques; Distribution static synchronous compensators; DSTATCOM; Electrical systems; Energy applications; Energy storage systems; Flywheel energy storage system; Power fluctuations; Simulation tests; Wind generation; Wind generator systems; Electric power factor correction; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Fuzzy logic; Wind power; Electric generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862128959

Pulverized coal (PC), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants are assessed for carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture, pipeline transport, and storage in a geological formation. Results show that the CCS systems reduce the climate change-related damages but increase the damages from toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, and resource consumption. Based on the currently available damage calculation methods, it is concluded that the benefit of reducing damage from climate change is larger than the increases in other damage categories, such as health effects from particulates or toxic chemicals. CCS significantly reduces the overall environmental damage, with a net reduction of 60% to 70% in human health damage and 65% to 75% in ecosystem damage. Most of the damage is due to fuel production and combustion processes.

Phase change materials (PCMs) may store latent heat energy in addition to the typical sensible energy capacity of current building materials, allowing to store significantly more energy during the phase change process (solid to liquid and vice versa). The incorporation of PCMs into building envelope solutions takes advantage of solar energy, contributing to the overall reduction of energy consumption associated to use of the air conditioning systems. This paper presents and discusses research developed in two main components: experimental testing and numerical simulation of a building component with PCM incorporation.

It is evaluated the influence of the phase change process of the PCM over the attenuation and time delay of the temperature fluctuations for indoor spaces.

A key attraction to ongoing efforts aimed at evaluating prospectivity for long term CO2 sequestration is the presence of basalt flows and diabase sills that could potentially serve as caprocks to the underlying deep saline formations. Unlike shale-capped CO2 reservoirs, very little is known about the ability of these unconventional mafic igneous deposits to act as viable seals for CO2 storage. This is due to the lack of physical data on properties of these rocks that are important for the evaluation of seal integrity. To date, our petrophysical and geological understanding of these rocks has come primarily from limited well data and examination of core samples. Therefore, with this study, we designed and carried out a series of physics-based laboratory experiments on selected samples considered strategic to the goals of the overall project.",,,Abstract Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861559458

A typical data-center workload, characterized by short idle periods, prevents traditional disk power management (DPM) from saving energy. This paper starts with an analysis of DPM's traditional timer-based disk spin-down policy. Next, we examine how a multispeed disk adapts DPM to data-center workloads. Finally, we determine how to shape the workload to enable DPM on conventional server disks. All analysis is based on an analytical model for the energy consumed by a disk during an idle period. In addition, we assume standby power to be non-negligible. The results are that (1) the competitive ratio of a threshold-based disk spin-down policy depends on the ratio of standby power to idle power, (2) the notion of break-even time can be generalized for multispeed disks, and (3) DPM saves most energy when mean idle time and idle-time variance are maximized. With this analysis, the authors intend to stimulate the design of new data-center file and storage systems that optimally exploit DPM to save energy. © 2012 ACM.","Cloud storage; Data center; Disk drive; Energy efficiency; Power reduction","Competitive ratio; Data centers; Disk drive; Idle time; Multispeed; Power managements; Power reductions; Save energy; Saving energy; Spin-down policy; Standby power; Storage subsystems; Storage systems; Timer-based; Energy efficiency; Energy management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861539452

Diet intervention has been proposed as one of the strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance. Traditionally, the pomegranate, including its roots, tree bark, fruit juice, leaves, and flowers, has been used to treat some conditions such as diarrhea, hemorrhage, acidosis, and microbial infections. Pomegranate extracts have been found to have strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and even antitumor properties in vivo and in vitro. More recently, positive effects on fat reduction have been shown using the pomegranate and its extracts. Many of the beneficial effects are related to the presence of anthocyanins, tannins, and very high levels of antioxidants, including polyphenols and flavonoids. Many studies have explored the effects of the pomegranate in obesity, and various mechanisms have been proposed as to how these different extracts help in fat reduction. This article provides an overview of the work done addressing the potential benefits of the pomegranate on obesity and assesses the efficacy of intervention by means of the pomegranate and its extracts.

In this study, we investigated the role of calorie consumption in the development of insulin resistance in OVX rats. In addition, we examined the cellular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle insulin resistance in OVX rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated (SHAM). OVX rats either had free access to food, pair feeding (PF) with SHAM or received a 35% reduction in food intake (calorie restriction; CR) for 12weeks. Compared with SHAM, ovariectomy induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance, which was associated with decreases (32-70%) in tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), IRS-1 associated p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), and Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation whereas insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser 307, SAPK/JNK Thr 183/Tyr 185, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Thr 180/Tyr 182 was increased (24-62%). PF improved the serum lipid profile but did not restore insulin-stimulated glucose transport, indicating that insulin resistance in OVX rats is a consequence of ovarian hormone deprivation. In contrast, impaired insulin sensitivity and defective insulin signaling were not observed in the skeletal muscle of OVX+CR rats. Therefore, we provide evidence for the first time that CR effectively prevents the development of insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle of OVX rats. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Calorie restriction; Insulin resistance; Insulin signaling; MAPK; Ovariectomy; Skeletal muscle","fatty acid; insulin; insulin receptor; insulin receptor substrate 1; lipid; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein p85; serine; stress activated protein kinase; threonine; triacylglycerol; tyrosine; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; caloric intake; caloric restriction; controlled study; female; glucose tolerance; glucose transport; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intraabdominal fat; lipid blood level; lipid storage; nonhuman; ovariectomy; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; rat; skeletal muscle; uterus weight; Animals; Biological Transport; Blood Glucose; Caloric Restriction; Energy Intake; Female; Insulin; Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins; Insulin Resistance; Lipids; Muscle, Skeletal; Ovariectomy; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptor, Insulin; Signal Transduction; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859056344

CO 2 concentrations are increasing in the last decades mainly due to the increase of anthropogenic emissions. To reduce the effects caused by this environmental problem, several technologies were studied to capture CO 2 from large emission source points: (i) absorption; (ii) adsorption; (iii) gas-separation membranes; and (iv) cryogenic distillation. The resulting streams with high CO 2 concentrations are transported and stored in geological formations. However, these methodologies, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, are considered as short-term solutions, as there are still concerns about the environmental sustainability of these processes. A promising technology is the biological capture of CO 2 using microalgae. These microorganisms can fix CO 2 using solar energy with efficiency ten times greater than terrestrial plants. Moreover, the capture process using microalgae has the following advantages: (i) being an environmental sustainable method; (ii) using directly the solar energy; and (iii) co-producing high added value materials based on biomass, such as human food, animal feed mainly for aquaculture, cosmetics, medical drugs, fertilizers, biomolecules for specific applications and biofuels. Approaches for making CO 2 fixation by microalgae economically competitive in comparison with CCS methodologies are discussed, which includes the type of bioreactors, the key process parameters, the gaseous effluents and wastewater treatment, the harvesting methods and the products extracted by microalgal biomass. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the possibility of improving the color of harvested 'Brown Turkey' figs through the use of pulsed light (PL) emitted by a high-energy xenon flash lamp. The exposure of poorly colored figs to PL for just 10-90. s enhanced their red coloration in a dose-dependent manner, but extending the treatment to 300. s did not provide additional benefit. After 5 days of storage in the dark at 20. °C, the anthocyanin content of the skin of fruit exposed to 90-300. s PL was 20 times higher than that observed for the untreated control and approached the level typical of the cultivar.

However, added phosphates are gradually degraded during processing and storage, leading to changes in functional properties of phosphates. The objective of the study was to monitor the quantitative and qualitative changes in added phosphates in cod during salting, storage and rehydration using ion chromatography (IC) and spectrophotometric analysis. The phosphates diffused into the fish muscle during brining but the phosphate content (mg P 2O 5/g sample) decreased again as liquid drained away from the muscle in the following dry salting step. Changes during six months storage of the dry salted products were minor. Further losses were observed during rehydration where the phosphates were washed out to levels lower than in the raw material.The advantage of the IC method was the ability to separate and determine different soluble phosphate species in the fish muscle. The IC results showed that pyrophosphate (P 2O 7) and triphosphate (P 3O 10) were partly degraded into orthophosphate (PO 4) during the storage period. Lower values were obtained for the total phosphate content by IC than with the spectrophotometric method, which explained by difference is sample preparation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Orthophosphate; Phosphate determination; Pyrophosphate; Salted cod; Storage; Triphosphate","Orthophosphate; Phosphate determination; Pyrophosphate; Salted cod; Triphosphate; Energy storage; Food preservation; Muscle; Spectrophotometry; Phosphates; Gadus morhua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857114693

The quality of ready meals deteriorates with storage time, and food loses its freshness condition. The same behavior was observed for all analyzed characteristics: as the storage temperature increases, reaction rate (measured by the kinetic constant and activation energy) also increases, confirming the influence of temperature in quality loss. Besides, overall acceptability was the more sensitive attribute to temperature changes, with Q 10 equal to 4, indicating an indirect but strong dependence of consumers' opinion on storage temperature. Finally, shelf life models, based on sensory analysis and on microbial spoilage, were compared, showing that the adopted sensory score determines which criterion is more restrictive.

Following 21-days pre-chilling, GE was 34% and 14% after three and four years of storage, respectively. Pre-chilling periods of 40 and 60 days increased GE to 62% and 59% for seeds stored for three and four years, respectively.

The actors aggregate the sensors' data, thereby saving the power of the sensors to transmit directly to the service center. Otherwise, the data transmission to a service center at a longer distance by the individual sensors consumes a lot of power. In this paper, we have extended our previous work on automatic placement and binding of actors to the sensors to examine the impact of the presence of obstacles within WSAN. We have proposed a redesign algorithm to the obstacle insertion problem within WSAN, which examines the position of the obstacles in view of actor-sensor line-of-sight (LOS) to identify the blocked sensors, and then the redesign algorithm relocates the actors to reestablish the communication with the blocked sensors. We have defined the redesign problem as an optimization problem, where the objective function is to minimize the energy consumption, while maximizing the actor-sensor binding ratio. We have utilized Simulated Annealing to search for the best possible position for the actors to be relocated within the network to cover all the sensors, which go out-of-sight after the insertion of obstacles. The simulation results demonstrate that our redesign algorithm maintains the actor-sensor binding ratio at 100% with the presence of obstacles. © 2012 Springer India Pvt.

While MOSFET scaling has advanced tremendously, traditional DRAM cell scaling is hampered by the presence of a capacitor which is difficult to reduce in size. Recently, an interesting concept of a DRAM memory cell based on a transistor alone was introduced. The ultimate advantage of this new concept is that it does not require a capacitor, and, in contrast to traditional 1T/1C DRAM cells, it represents a 1T/0C cell named Z(for zero)-RAM. The advanced Z-RAM bitcells built on a multiple-gate MOSFET (MuGFET) utilizes the bipolar transistor usually considered as parasitic [1]. The advantage is that the current flows through the body of the structure. The majority carriers are generated by impact ionization and stored under the gates. The charge stored opens the bipolar transistor guaranteeing high current (state 1). The stored charge can be flashed out by applying the voltage pulse to the gates returning the bipolar transistor into the low current state 0. The stored charge for the bipolar transistor in the high current and low current states is shown in Fig.1. The results [2] of current calculations as function of the gate voltage for a double-gate structure with 10nm thin body are shown in Fig.2. In a forward scan direction of the gate voltage, the current stays low until a certain critical value is reached. After that the source-drain current rapidly increases by several orders of magnitude. In a reverse gate voltage scan, the current first slowly decreases, however, due to the charge stored under the gates, the relatively large current value is maintained down to the negative gate voltages, where it abruptly decreases by several orders of magnitude completing the hysteresis loop [2]. The use of vertical gate-all around transistors extends the Z-RAM roadmap to future generations. One disadvantage of the Z-RAM cell is the relatively high operating voltage needed to ignite impact ionization. To reduce the operating voltage, a new concept of a 1T/0C cell was recently proposed [3]. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Critical value; Current flows; Double-gate structures; DRAM cells; DRAM memories; Future generations; Gate voltages; High currents; Large current; Low currents; Majority carriers; MOSFET scaling; Multiple-gate MOSFET; Negative gate voltages; Operating voltage; Orders of magnitude; Reverse gate; Roadmap; Scan direction; Source-drain current; Stored charge; Thin body; Voltage pulse; Bipolar transistors; Capacitors; Cells; Electric potential; High energy physics; Impact ionization; Leakage currents; Microelectronics; MOSFET devices; Static random access storage; Transistors; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861009803

The technique uses a pair of source-connected n- and p-MOSFETs, implementing an auto-bias of the stand-by gate-to-source voltage of the nMOS transistor at a negative voltage and that of the p-device at a positive level, thereby reducing the off current towards its physical limits. Changing the gate and drain connections, we propose a series of ultra-low-power basic blocks : a 2-terminal diode, a 3-terminal transistor and a voltage follower. These blocks can be combined to yield a 7-transistor SRAM cell and an MTCMOS latch with record low stand-by leakage but still high-speed performance, as well as high-efficiency power-management units for RF and PV energy harvesting and a microwatt interface for implanted capacitive sensors. © 2012 IEEE.","analog and digital CMOS circuits; energy harvesting; logic; power management; SOI technology; SRAM; Ultra low leakage; Ultra low power; voltage reference","Digital CMOS; logic; Low leakage; Power managements; SOI technology; Ultra low power; Voltage reference; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital circuits; Electric converters; Energy harvesting; Energy management; Microsystems; Static random access storage; Low power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860994071

The effect of spray-drying inlet and outlet air temperatures, and the activation energy (E a) of the biopolymers on the survival of T. harzianum conidia was evaluated. The highest conidia survival after spray-drying (86%) and after 8 weeks of storage at 4 °C (40%), were obtained with the MD10-GA biopolymer matrix (with the highest E a = 31.6 kJ mol -1). Such survivals were 11 and 330-fold times higher than those of non-encapsulated conidia, respectively.

The salt specimens with a nominal dimension of 5.4×5.4×5.4cm 3 are compressed to failure using a polyaxial load frame. The lateral confining pressures are maintained constant at 0, 3, 7, 12, 20 and 28MPa while the axial stresses are increased at constant rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10MPa/s until failure occurs. The salt elasticity and strength increase with the loading rates. The elastic (tangent) modulus determined at about 40% of the failure stress varies from 15 to 25GPa, and the Poisson's ratio from 0.23 to 0.43. The elastic parameters tend to be independent of the confining pressures. The strains induced at failure decrease as the loading rate increases. Various multiaxial formulations of loading rate dependent strength and deformability are derived. The variation of the octahedral shear stresses and strains induced at dilation and at failure with the applied shear stress rates can be best described by power relations. The distortional strain energy at dilation and at failure from various loading rates varies linearly with the mean normal stress. The proposed empirical criteria are applied to determine the safe maximum withdrawal rate of a compressed-air energy storage cavern in the Maha Sarakham salt formation. The strain energy criterion that considers both distortional and mean stress-strains at dilation tends to give the most conservative results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Creep; Loading rate; Rock salt; Strain energy; Withdrawal rate","Axial stress; Confining pressures; Constant rate; Elastic parameters; Energy criterion; Failure stress; Lateral confining pressure; Load frames; Loading rate; Multiaxial; Normal stress; Octahedral shear stress; Poisson's ratio; Power relations; Rock salt; Salt formation; Triaxial compression tests; Withdrawal rate; Compression testing; Creep; Deformation; Elasticity; Rock pressure; Shear stress; Strain energy; Stress analysis; Loading; compression; compressive strength; confining pressure; deformation; elastic modulus; loading; rock salt; shear stress; stress-strain relationship; triaxial test; uniaxial test",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860272915

Because the vanadium flow battery employs the same metal ion in both electrolytes, albeit in different oxidation states, there is no cumulative loss in performance, just an effective reversible self-discharge current. The self discharge that occurs in the vanadium flow batteries is limited to the electrolyte volume in the cells. However it can become substantial under low load conditions. The pumps also use power from the battery and may be considered as another source of self discharge. Taking these and maintenance considerations into account the layout of a 10 kW, 100 kWh, 48 V vanadium flow battery was designed as a ""Multi-Stage-Operation"" system to provide maximum performance at all levels of load, ease of use and optimum maintenance conditions. Experimental: A complete energy storage system with 10 kW in power and 100 kWh in energy was designed. It consists of a vanadium flow battery with smart controller and configurable power electronics housed in a weatherproof housing. The battery can be charged and discharged at up to 10 kW and provides up to 100 kWh of energy. The smart controller ensures that the battery operates at maximum efficiency at all times and allows remote observation of various battery parameters, including a reliable state of charge (SOC) measurement. The option of different arrangements of power electronics gives almost complete freedom in specification of electrical output (dc, single or three-phase ac). The battery can also be connected to photovoltaic, wind turbine, diesel/petrol/gas/biogas generators, fuel cells and water turbines to form discrete autonomous power supplies or to be part of a micro-, mini- or smart-grid. The FB10/100 battery for ""Multi-Stage-Operation"" is comprised of 5 strings of 36-40 cells each in 3 separate fluid circuits. The first fluid circuit, containing a single string, is always actively pumped with electrolyte and electrically connected to the charger and load. The second and third fluid circuits contain 2 strings each and are only actively pumped and electrically connected when the voltage reaches preset limits. When the circuits are in ""standby"", i.e. not actively pumped and electrically connected, the self discharge is limited to the small volume of electrolyte in the cells. There is also a significant saving of pumping energy, because 3 pairs of small pumps are used in place of 1 pair of more powerful pumps. Results: In ""Multi-Stage-Operation"" mode, the overall battery performance is improved significantly. This is very important in off-grid installations, where loads are typically small compared to the power levels necessary for charging; i.e. a solar powered telemetric station may use 500 W continuous power but requires fast charging due to the narrow time window when solar energy is available. In example, at a 1 kW load the battery provides 25% more energy when operated in ""Multi-Stage-Operation"" mode compared to all stacks in operation. Since 2008, several power station have been equipped with FB10/100 storage units and put into operation. Within the presentation a report on the latest results including technical performance and cost issues will be given. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Energy storage at the edge of the grid; Energy storage system for renewable resources; Stationary battery; Vanadium flow battery","Battery performance; Configurable; Cross contamination; Ease of use; Electrical output; Energy storage systems; Fast charging; Flow batteries; Low load; Maximum Efficiency; Off-grids; Oxidation state; Photovoltaic; Power levels; Power station; Power supply; Pumping energies; Remote observation; Self-discharge current; Self-discharges; Solar-powered; State of charge; Stationary batteries; Storage units; Technical performance; Time windows; Water turbines; DC power transmission; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Maintenance; Metal ions; Power electronics; Pumps; Vanadium; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857921383

The mixed oxides were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. XRD analysis revealed the formation of Ni xMg 1-xO (x = 0-1), α-Al 2O 3 and traces of MgAl 2O 4 (NiAl 2O 4) phases. The diffraction peak positions for MgO or NiO oxides were shifted towards 2θ values higher than simulated for pure bulk oxides that can be attributed to the possible presence of lattice vacancies or surface compressive stress. The evaluated grain size by XRD technique was about 8-10 nm. It was also detected the presence of microstrains that can be associated with the presence of extended defects in the grains. SEM observations showed that the particles of oxides are formed as agglomerates with the particle sizes of 50 nm up to 200 nm. EDS detected the presence of Mg 2+, Ni 2+, and Al 3+ cations and oxygen in all particles independently on their size. The obtained results revealed the presence of mixture of Ni/Mg/Al oxides in each particle obtained. The oxides calcined at temperatures of 400° and 600°C were unstable and under air storage they revert to the precursor. The incorporation of Ni 2+ in Mg-Al mixed oxides leads to stability of the compounds calcined at 800°C. © 2012 Materials Research Society.","Co-precipitation; Hydrotalcite; Microstructure; Mixed oxides; X-ray diffraction","Air storage; Bulk oxides; Coprecipitation method; Diffraction peaks; Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy; Extended defect; Grain size; Hydrotalcites; Lattice vacancy; Mg-Al mixed oxide; MgO; Microstrains; Mixed oxide; SEM observation; Surface compressive stress; XRD analysis; XRD technique; Aluminum; Calcination; Decomposition; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Structural metals; X ray diffraction; Chemical compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860741704

Laboratory measurements included total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions, triglycerides, glucose, total serum testosterone, serum insulin, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and SHBG. Energy intake was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. Classic PCOS patients had higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, testosterone and lipid accumulation product values than ovulatory PCOS and controls. Energy consumption, homeostasis model assessment index, SHBG, free androgen index and triglycerides, total and trunk lean mass were higher only in classic PCOS women vs. controls. Arm, leg, trunk, total or limb lean masses were not correlated with hormone levels in any of the groups. However, in PCOS women lipid accumulation product was positively correlated with total (r=0.56, p=0.001), trunk (r=0.59, p=0.001), arm (r=0.54, p=0.001), leg (r=0.44, p=0.03) and limb (r=0.48, p=0.001) lean masses. BMI was positively correlated with all lean mass segments and independently associated with total lean mass. Lipid accumulation product and BMI were independently associated with trunk lean mass variation. The increase in lean mass in classic PCOS appears to be associated with insulin resistance and central obesity rather than with energy intake, physical activity or androgens. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","hyperandrogenemia; metabolic features; obesity; polycystic ovary syndrome","cholesterol; estradiol; glucose; insulin; luteinizing hormone; testosterone; triacylglycerol; adult; anthropometry; article; body mass; caloric intake; cholesterol blood level; clinical evaluation; controlled study; disease association; female; human; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lipid storage; muscle mass; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; physical activity; priority journal; testosterone blood level; waist circumference; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adolescent; Adult; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Bone Density; Brazil; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Muscle Development; Obesity, Abdominal; Overweight; Ovulation; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Severity of Illness Index; Waist Circumference; Whole Body Imaging; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867684827

However, DMFCs performance is strongly affected by methanol crossover that significantly degrades the energy efficiency at low output power, and is characterized by an increasing efficiency at increasing output power. The maximum efficiency point (MEP) is inherently difficult to track due to the commonly unknown methanol crossover rate, but since it is experimentally found to be located very close to the maximum power point (MPP), it is suggested that the MPP can be practically viewed as the quasi-MEP and an alternative tracking approach based on the MPP is proposed for the purpose of MEP tracking. In this paper, a fuel-cell-oriented MPP tracking algorithm based on resistance matching is developed, implemented, and tested in the context of a DMFC/supercapacitor hybrid energy system. To account for the generally slow fuel cell dynamics, the DMFC is constantly tracked at the MPP, while any surplus or deficit power is absorbed or delivered by the supercapacitor bank. The detailed formulation of the algorithm and the power flow design and realization are also discussed. © 2012 IEEE.","Bidirectional converter; direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC); energy management; fuel cell; maximum power point tracking (MPPT)","Bidirectional converter (BDC); Fuel-cell dynamics; Gaseous hydrogen; Hybrid energy system; Maximum Efficiency; Maximum power point; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Methanol crossover; Methanol crossover rates; On-resistance; Output power; Point tracking; Portable electronics; Power flows; Super capacitor; Tracking algorithm; Algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864582156

By contrast, Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) produces electricity by reflecting sunlight via solar collectors to heat a receiver to high temperatures. This heat is transformed first into mechanical energy, by turbines or Stirling engines, and then to electricity. CSP has several advantages over PV by having higher efficiencies, lower investment costs, an inherent thermal storage capacity that enables power generation during cloud cover or after sunset and a better hybrid operation capability with other fuels to meet base-load demand at night. Establishing a CSP plant creates jobs and helps develop existing local industries. This together with the potential for niche applications such as absorption chilling make CSP a rational choice in tackling Bangladesh's energy crisis and fulfilling its renewable energy goals. © 2012 ICDRET.","Concentrating Solar Power; CSP over PV for power generation in Bangladesh","Bangladesh; Cloud cover; Concentrating solar power; Energy crisis; High temperature; Higher efficiency; Investment costs; Mechanical energies; Niche applications; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaics; Thermal storage; Electricity; Energy policy; Heat storage; Investments; Photovoltaic effects; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Stirling engines; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860600357

The objective of the proposed SMES control strategy is to smooth the wind farm output by absorbing or providing real power. Moreover, its reactive power output can also be controlled to keep the wind farm terminal voltage constant. The control methodology of SMES system is suitable for the two objectives stated above. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by dynamic simulations using a test power system.

These irregularities in power output affect the power quality and thus an energy storage system is needed. In this work, the STATCOM/SMES system with a voltage-source IGBT converter is proposed as a controllable energy storage system. The proposed STATCOM/SMES system is used to provide both active and reactive power, which can significantly decrease the voltage and output power fluctuations of grid connected fixed speed wind generator. For wind generator output power smoothing, constant output power reference is not a good choice, because sufficient power cannot be obtained when wind speed is very low. Energy storage device can solve the problem but large energy storage capacity may be needed. Therefore, a low pass filter approach is adopted to generate the line power reference in the proposed system, in which the time constant corresponds to the energy storage capacity. Thus the energy storage capacity of SMES can be made comparatively small. Real wind speed data is used in the simulation analyses, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed STATCOM/SMES system can smooth well the wind generator output power and also maintain the terminal voltage at rated level with reduced energy storage capacity. © 2012 ICDRET.","DC-DC chopper; Fixed speed wind generator; low pass filter (LPF); STATCOM/SMES; voltage source converter (VSC)","Constant output power; Control strategies; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage systems; Fixed speed-wind generator; Grid-connected; IGBT converters; Output power; Output power fluctuations; Power out put; Random variation; Reduced energy; Simulation analysis; Statcom; Terminal voltage regulation; Terminal voltages; Time constants; Voltage source; Voltage source converters; Wind generator systems; Wind speed; Wind speed data; Energy storage; Low pass filters; Power converters; Virtual storage; Voltage regulators; Wind effects; Wind power; Electric utilities",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860548411

The required power for the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed wind turbine and energy storage systems, subject to an appropriate control method. Energy storage devices are required for power balance and power quality in stand alone wind energy systems. The main purpose is to supply 230 V / 50 Hz domestic appliances through a single-phase inverter.

We also carried out a metabolic study to explore whether the beneficial effects observed of 22SHC on glucose and lipid metabolism in vitro could be seen in vivo in rats. In the pharmacokinetic study, rats were given 50 mg/kg of [3H]22-S-hydroxycholesterol before absorption, distribution and excretion were monitored. In the metabolic study, the effect of 22SHC (30 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) in rats on body weight gain [chow and high-fat diet (HFD)], serum lipids triacylglycerol (TAG) content and gene expression in liver and skeletal muscle were examined. Results showed that 22SHC was well absorbed after oral administration and distributed to most organs and mainly excreted in feces. Rats receiving 22SHC gained less body weight than their controls regardless whether the animals received chow diet or HFD. Moreover, we observed that animals receiving HFD had elevated levelsofserum TAG while this was not observed for animals on HFD supplemented with 22SHC. The amount of TAG in liver was reduced after 22SHC treatment in animals receiving either chow diet or HFD. Gene expression analysis revealed that two genes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2and uncoupling protein 3) involved in fatty acid oxidation and energy dissipation were increased in liver. Ucp3 expression (both protein and mRNA level) was increased in skeletal muscle, but insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and TAG content were unchanged. In conclusion, 22SHC seems to be an interesting model substance in the search of treatments for disorders involving aberrations in lipid metabolism. © AOCS 2012.","22-S-hydroxycholesterol; In vivo; LXR; Ucp3","22 hydroxycholesterol; glucose; messenger RNA; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 3; animal experiment; animal tissue; area under the curve; article; blood sampling; carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 gene; controlled study; diet supplementation; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug effect; drug excretion; drug feces level; drug half life; drug mechanism; enzyme activity; fatty acid oxidation; gene; gene expression profiling; genetic analysis; glucose metabolism; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; maximum plasma concentration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein expression; rat; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; time to maximum plasma concentration; triacylglycerol blood level; uncoupling protein 3 gene; weight reduction; Administration, Oral; Animals; Dietary Supplements; Fatty Acids; Hydroxycholesterols; Liver; Male; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Triglycerides; Weight Gain; Animalia; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863436894

All carotenoid diets were split into two groups with one group containing BHT (acting as an antioxidant) at 250 ppm and the other without BHT. The experiment was divided into two parts. First, all diets were evaluated in total carotenoid (TC) loss during feed processing, in dry mixed feeds after being processed and dried. In the final part, the completed dietary carotenoids were stored in an aluminum foil bag, the top of which was sealed with a bag sealer and kept under different storage conditions at 26-28 °C and 4 °C. The stability of the TC was observed during an 8-week trial period. The results showed that the diet pelleting process did not affect the carotenoid content of the diets, and the best storage temperature for the formulated carotenoid diet was at 4 °C. However, an antioxidant was added to assist in energy saving before feed processing. Thus, the addition of BHT at 250 ppm can be done at normal room temperature in order to reduce oxidation that might cause a loss of TC quantities in diets. © 2012 by the authors.","Carotenoid; Feed processing; Stability; Storage","antioxidant; butylcresol; carotenoid; animal; animal food; article; chemistry; elemental diet; fish; food preservation; food storage; methodology; oxidation reduction reaction; temperature; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Antioxidants; Butylated Hydroxytoluene; Carotenoids; Fishes; Food Preservation; Food Storage; Food, Formulated; Oxidation-Reduction; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861498520

A case series of patients from 34 families attending the metabolic clinic at Tawam Hospital were clinically evaluated, and molecular testing was carried out to determine their causative mutations. The mutation analysis was carried out at molecular genetics diagnostic laboratories. Thirty-eight mutations have been identified as responsible for twenty IEM disorders, including in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, steroids, metal transport and mitochondrial energy metabolism, and lysosomal storage disorders. Nine of the identified mutations are novel, including two missense mutations, three premature stop codons and four splice site mutations.

Background data: Long considered an innocuous medium, water has increasingly been found to be a key player in numerous mechanisms, including first-contact events in which cells decide between survival and apoptosis. Consequently, externally applied electromagnetic energy (light) may selectively target the organization of water to steer biological function. Methods: We survey light-water research with particular emphasis on the quasi-crystalline exclusion zone (EZ), part of the cell's aqueous interface that is just now beginning to be decoded. The current state of research, the technical challenges involved in obtaining evidence in biological systems, and some potential uses and implications of EZ water in medicine are presented. Results: Though existing data have not yet proven the role of EZ water in photobiomodulation, research shows that EZ water can store charge and can later return it in the form of current flow, with as much as 70% of the input charge being readily obtainable. Macroscopic separation of charges can be stable for days to weeks and has unusual electric potential. Water is, thus, an unexpectedly effective charge separation and storage medium. Conclusions: We propose that the EZ may be selectively targeted in photobiomodulation as an efficient energy reservoir, which cells can use expeditiously to fuel cellular work, triggering signaling pathways and gene expression in the presence of injury-induced redox potentials. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Aqueous interfaces; Biological functions; Complex disease; Current flows; Effective charge; Energy reservoirs; Photobiomodulation; Redox potentials; Signaling pathways; State of research; Storage medium; Technical challenges; Biological systems; Cell death; Electric potential; Electromagnetic waves; Gene expression; Redox reactions; Research; Reservoirs (water); Phase interfaces; water; animal; apoptosis; article; bioenergy; cell survival; chemistry; electromagnetic radiation; electrophysiology; human; photobiology; physiology; Animals; Apoptosis; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Cell Survival; Electromagnetic Radiation; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Humans; Photobiology; Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860519730

Metal-hydrogen interactions were characterised by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) and in situ Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD). All initial alloys crystallise with body-centred cubic (BCC) crystal structures formed as solid solutions of V and Cr in Ti. Upon hydrogenation, the dihydrides (Ti,V,Cr)H2 with face-centred cubic (FCC) structures are formed. An increase in the Cr content leads to systematic changes in the structure and hydrogenation behaviours. The changes include (a) contraction of the unit cells for the initial alloys and for the corresponding dihydrides; (b) slower hydrogen absorption kinetics and an increase in the incubation period for hydrogenation; (c) a decrease in the thermal stability of the saturated hydrides; and (d) a reduction in the apparent activation energy of hydrogen desorption. In situ SR-XRD and TDS studies of the FCC Ti-V-Cr hydrides indicated that their decomposition consists of five individual desorption events. Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The absence of programs and methods that carry out this task in a clear and precise manner constitutes a barrier to the dissemination of these systems, although some tools have been developed that present other possible limitations. The exclusion of the environmental dimension in the design and evaluation process of hybrid systems means that the true benefits are not evaluated in terms of quality and quantity. In an attempt to overcome such deficiencies, this work presents a new method of design; approached from the multi-objective optimization of systems. The multi-objective optimization by means of enumerative search implemented by the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable program is used to generate a set of solutions optimized economically by the value of the net present cost (NPC). The analysis of greenhouse gas emissions (in tCO 2-eq.) in the life cycle of each one of the system components is carried out and a set of solutions with the values of the two objective functions is generated, namely NPC and NAE SLC (net avoided emissions in the system life cycle). The method is applied to a case study in a Cuban rural community. The compromise solution obtained by means of the proposed algorithm includes a wind turbine (WT) of 25.4 and 8kW of photovoltaic panels, while that of the HOGA includes a WT of 76 and 21kW of photovoltaic panels. Both commitment solutions consider hydrogen storage instead of storage in batteries, as a better option for the energy storage. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd..","Electrolyzers; Fuel cells; Life cycle analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Stand-alone wind energy system","Autonomous systems; Avoided emissions; Complex task; Compromise solutions; Electrolyzers; Evaluation process; Hybrid optimization; Life cycle analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi objective optimizations (MOO); Net present cost; Objective functions; Photovoltaic panels; Rural community; Rural electrification; System components; System life cycle; Wind energy systems; Algorithms; Design; Electrolytic cells; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaic effects; Quality control; Rural areas; Wind power; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859869926

Although two-stage and one-stage processes each have their advantages, the one-stage configuration is mostly applied, termed here as oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND), and is the focus of this review. The OLAND application domain is gradually expanding, with technical-scale plants on source-separated domestic wastewater, pre-treated manure and sewage, and liquors from organic waste bioenergy plants. A 'microbial resource management' (MRM) OLAND framework was elaborated, showing how the OLAND engineer/operator (1: input) can design/steer the microbial community (2: biocatalyst) to obtain optimal functionality (3: output). In the physicochemical toolbox (1), design guidelines are provided, as well as advantages of different reactor technologies. Particularly the desirable aeration regime, feeding regime and shear forces are not clear yet. The development of OLAND trickling filters, membrane bioreactors and systems with immobilized biomass is awaited. The biocatalyst box (2) considers 'Who': biodiversity and its dynamic patterns, 'What': physiology, and 'Where': architecture creating substrate gradients. Particularly community dynamics and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) still require insights. Performant OLAND (3) comprises fast start-up (storage possibility; fast growth of anammox bacteria), process stability (endured biomass retention; stress resilience), reasonable overall costs, high nitrogen removal efficiency and a low environmental footprint. Three important OLAND challenges are elaborated in detailed frameworks, demonstrating how to maximize nitrogen removal efficiency, minimize NO and N2O emissions and obtain through OLAND a plant-wide net energy gain from sewage treatment. © 2012 The Authors.

The purification procedure consisted of fractionation with urea and a combination of size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 32kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Using a specific LOX substrate (1,5-diaminopentane), its optimum activity was determined at pH 8.2 and 65°C. Activation energy (E a) of the enzyme was 69.94kJK -1mol -1. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by β-aminopropionitrile fumarate (BAPN), a specific LOX inhibitor. Moreover, purified LOX was able to work at different temperatures (20-90°C) at pH 8.2. Although further research is needed, the results from this work suggest that based on LOX activity, this enzyme may be of practical use in preventing textural changes in jumbo squid during storage or processing. © 2012 The Authors.

A wide range of instruments has been suggested and implemented in various countries of the EU. A prominent policy promoting investment in renewable technologies is the use of feed-in tariffs, which has worked well at large scale in, e.g. Germany, but which has only been implemented in a very limited way in countries such as the UK. Being subject to environmental uncertainties, however, renewables cannot be seen in isolation: while renewables-based technologies such as wind and solar energy, for example, suffer from uncertain loads depending on environmental conditions, hydropower allows for the storage of water for release at peak prices, which can be treated as a premium (partially) offsetting higher upfront investment costs. In addition, electricity prices will respond to changes in electric capacity in the market, which is often neglected in standard investment models of the electricity sector. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways: it provides a review of a renewables-based technology in a specific policy context and provides additional insight by employing a real options approach to investigate the specific characteristics of renewables and their associated uncertainties in a stylized setting taking explicitly into account market effects of investment decisions. The prices of the model are determined endogenously by the supply of electricity in the market and by exogenous electricity price uncertainty. The inclusion of market effects allows us to capture the full impact of public incentives for companies to invest into wind power and hydro pumped storage installations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But nowadays, that new applications need data processing with temporal constraints in their tasks; then one of the new challenges faced by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is handling real-time storage and querying the data they process. Two main approaches to storage and querying data are generally considered warehousing and distributed. The warehousing approach stores data in a central database and then queries may be performed to it. In a distributed approach, sensor devices are considered as local databases and data are managed locally. The data collected by sensors must represent the current state of the environment; for this reason they are subject to logic and time constraints. Then, this paper identifies the main specifications of real-time data management and presents the available real-time data management solutions for WSNs, in order to discuss them and identify some open issues and provide guidelines for further contributions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

When these methods are applied to longer time horizons, the computational time becomes intractable, hence the focus of this paper. This paper presents a methodology for simultaneous optimisation of production schedule and wastewater minimisation in a multipurpose batch facility. The key feature of the presented methodology is the adaption of cyclic scheduling concepts to wastewater minimisation. The methodology is developed based on continuous-time formulation and the state sequence network (SSN) representation. The methodology is successfully applied to two common literature examples and an industrial case study to demonstrate its effectiveness. None of the currently published wastewater minimisation techniques could solve the case study for a time horizon of 168. h. However, through the application of the presented methodology, a time horizon of 168. h for the case study was reduced to eight cycles with the cycle length of 23. h, for which the CPU time for the optimum cycle is 64.53. s. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Batch; Minimisation; Multipurpose; Scheduling; Storage; Wastewater","Batch; Batch process; Computational time; Continuous-time formulation; CPU time; Cycle length; Cyclic scheduling; Industrial case study; Key feature; Minimisation; Multi-purpose batch process; Multipurpose; Optimisations; Optimum cycle; Production schedule; Scheduling techniques; Short-term scheduling; State sequences; Time horizons; Batch data processing; Energy storage; Industrial applications; Research; Sanitary sewers; Scheduling; Wastewater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855836091

These objectives have been considered in recent modifications to the electricity generation laws by establishing that generation companies must reach a quota of up to a 10% from renewable energy sources by 2024. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is an interesting alternative to help achieve those objectives, as it is estimated that northern Chile has high radiation levels, coupled with the high values of the local clearness index and flat land availability. However, from the sustainability point of view it seems necessary to assess if a CSP plant is effectively an energy source. Here we propose a hybrid solar power plant lifecycle model which through a net energy analysis obtains and analyzes the plant energy sustainability attributes such as net energy, energy return over investment and energy payback time. The stages of construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning are considered in the lifecycle analysis. The model is then applied in order to determine good locations where to install a CSP plant in the Chilean Atacama Desert. Monthly means of solar radiation are used in order to estimate the solar fraction for a 100MW direct steam generation parabolic trough collector plant. The results indicate that solar power plants are effectively a net energy source for the analyzed locations, and that higher energy costs are related to the fossil fuel backup lifecycle. A relation is established between yearly radiation, energy return over investment and energy payback time. It is estimated that the net energy analysis is a useful tool for determining under which conditions a power plant becomes a net energy source and therefore a more convenient option from the sustainability point of view, and thus can be utilized in order to define best geographical locations and operation conditions for different renewable energy sources. The sustainability attributes are greatly enhanced when considering a solar-only operation mode, which highlights the advantages of using that configuration, and presents a case for the use of thermal energy storage systems rather than fossil fuel hybridization if a constant or dispatchable energy profile is required. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrated solar power; Energy return on investment; Net energy analysis; Solar power plant","Atacama Desert; Clearness indices; Concentrated solar power; Direct steam generation; Electricity generation; Energy cost; Energy pay back time; Energy profile; Energy source; Energy sustainability; Energy systems; Generation companies; Geographical locations; Land availability; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle model; Net energy; Northern Chile; Operation conditions; Operation mode; Over-investment; Parabolic trough collectors; Radiation levels; Renewable energy source; Return on investments; Solar fraction; Thermal energy storage systems; Electric generators; Energy management; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Heat storage; Investments; Life cycle; Natural resources; Profitability; Solar power plants; Sun; Sustainable development; Solar energy; electricity generation; energy policy; fossil fuel; life cycle; power plant; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; sustainable development; Atacama Desert; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84155170757

Djelfa, Algeria","A potential solution for stand-alone power generation is to use a hybrid energy system in parallel with some hydrogen energy storage. Renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc) are attracting more attention as alternative energy sources to conventional fossil fuel energy sources. This is being used widely for substitution of oil-produced energy and will help to minimize atmospheric degradation. One third of the world population does not have access to clean water sources and most of these people are not connected to the electrical grid at the same time. In this paper, a hybrid Photovoltaic (PV)-fuel cell generation system employing an electrolyzer for hydrogen generation is designed and simulated. The system is applicable for a desalination plant loads. Reverse osmosis (RO) is an electrically driven technology characterized by significantly low specific power requirements. In the meantime, coastal arid areas are blessed with exceptionally high solar radiation most of the year. Normally, those areas have no access to municipal water network and the local power grid. Thus, the water problem can also be seen as an energy problem since seawater, brackish water or freshwater of unknown quality are abundantly available but significant amounts of energy are required in order to make it suitable for drinking. Photovoltaic (PV) powered water purification is an opportunity to solve this issue. It can provide potable water and on top, small independent minigrids that supply people with electricity, too. The proposed configuration, even if it is not entirely autonomous still requires a smaller area of solar panel to operate. By cons, there remains the problem of the source of hydrogen. If hydrogen is not produced by electrolysis but by reforming hydrocarbons, this means CO2 emissions, with resources that are not inexhaustible. Moreover, 95% of the hydrogen currently produced using this method. For a massive use of hydrogen consumption, it will consider new production methods, such as the construction of nuclear power plants dedicated to hydrogen production with such high-temperature electrolysis. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Desalination plants; Fuel cell; Generation unit; Hybrid system; Modeling; Photovoltaic; Reverse osmosis","Alternative energy source; Arid area; Atmospheric degradation; Brackish water; Clean waters; CO2 emissions; Desalination plant; Design and simulation; Electrical grids; Electrolyzers; Energy problem; Energy systems; Fossil fuel energy; Fuel cell generations; Generation units; High temperature electrolysis; Hybrid energy system; Hydrogen consumption; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen generations; Mini grids; Municipal water networks; New production; Photovoltaic; Potential solutions; Power grids; Renewable energy source; Solar panels; Specific power; Water problems; Water purification; World population; Arid regions; Carbon dioxide; Desalination; Electric power generation; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Hybrid systems; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Models; Nuclear power plants; Photovoltaic effects; Reverse osmosis; Seawater; Solar energy; Sun; Water filtration; Water supply; Potable water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859969731

Okolna 2, PL-50-422 Wroclaw, Poland","Most of the synthesis routes of lanthanide-doped phosphors involve thermal processing which results in nanocrystallite growth, stabilization of the crystal structure and augmentation of luminescence intensity. It is of great interest to be able to transform the sample in a spatially localized manner, which may lead to many applications like 2D and 3D data storage, anti-counterfeiting protection, novel design bio-sensors and, potentially, to fabrication of metamaterials, 3D photonic crystals or plasmonic devices. Here we demonstrate irreversible spatially confined infrared-laser-induced annealing (LIA) achieved in a thin layer of dried colloidal solution of ultra-small 8nm NaYF 4 nanocrystals (NCs) co-doped with 2% Er 3+ and 20% Yb 3+ ions under a localized tightly focused beam from a continuous wave 976 nm medium power laser diode excitation. The LIA results from self-heating due to non-radiative relaxation accompanying the NIR laser energy upconversion in lanthanide ions. We notice that localized LIA appears at optical power densities as low as 15.5kWcm 2 (35429mW) threshold in spots of 543νm diameter obtained with a 10× microscope objective. In the course of detailed studies, a complete recrystallization to different phases and giant 23 order enhancement in luminescence yield is found. Our results are highly encouraging and let us conclude that the upconverting ultra-small lanthanide-doped nanophosphors are particularly promising for direct laser writing applications. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"3D data; 3D photonic crystals; Anti-counterfeiting protection; Co-doped; Colloidal solutions; Continuous Wave; Direct laser writing; Focused beams; Lanthanide ion; Laser annealing; Laser energies; Luminescence intensity; Microscope objective; Nanocrystallite growth; Nanophosphors; Non-radiative relaxation; Novel design; Optical power density; Plasmonic devices; Power lasers; Self-heating; Synthesis route; Thin layers; Ultra-small; Up-conversion; Biosensors; Crystal structure; Erbium; Luminescence; Metamaterials; Photonic crystals; Three dimensional; Ytterbium; erbium; fluoride; lanthanide; nanoparticle; sodium yttriumtetrafluoride; ytterbium; yttrium; article; chemistry; fluorescence; genetic procedures; laser; luminescence; methodology; microarray analysis; nanotechnology; Biosensing Techniques; Erbium; Fluorescence; Fluorides; Lanthanoid Series Elements; Lasers; Luminescent Measurements; Microarray Analysis; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Ytterbium; Yttrium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858819167

The internal seed morphology of three seed lots of the 'IAC 2028' cultivar (from the first, second and third raceme, respectively) and two seed lots of the 'Guarani' cultivar (commercial seed lots with the three racemes mixed) was evaluated with the X-ray test, at a radiation intensity of 20 kV and an exposure time of 60 seconds. Radiographed seeds were submitted to a germination test to determine any relationship between internal morphology and the quantity of normal and abnormal seedlings, and dead seeds. After six months of storage in paper bags, with no control of temperature or air relative humidity, seed samples were once more evaluated by the X-ray test.

The proposed sensing scheme employs selective precharge which performs partial comparison on the TCAM words to eliminate most of the mismatched words from further comparison. Use of positive feedback in the sense amplifiers engaged in this phase speeds up search operation and reduces energy consumption. In the next phase, remaining portions of those words which were matched in the first phase are scanned to find the fully matched words. Lower resistance in the charging path of the sense amplifier in the second phase causes fast match detection. The proposed technique is simulated using 130nm 1.2V CMOS logic. Compared to conventional current-race (CR) sensing scheme the proposed scheme shows 26.5% speed enhancement and at least 31% energy reduction at the cost of insignificant area overhead and small voltage margin degradation. Unlike many CR type schemes, no analog control voltage has been used in the proposed scheme. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Content-addressable memory; Energy consumption; Feedback; Selective precharge; Sense amplifier; Sensing scheme; Ternary","Analog controls; Area overhead; CMOS logic; Energy reduction; Energy-efficient design; Fast-match; High-speed; Low energies; Match line; Phase speed; Resistive feedback; Search operations; Second phase; Selective precharge; Sense amplifier; Sensing schemes; Speed enhancement; Ternary; Ternary CAM; Ternary content addressable memories; Voltage margin; Associative storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Feedback; Ternary content adressable memory; Amplifiers (electronic)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859192939

The waste is often packaged in large containers, such as 220 l drums, because process operators find drums more economical to handle than small containers. Based on regulations, the radioactivity and the radionuclide composition of the waste should be characterized before moving, shipping offsite, burying, or placing in a storage area. The most important step of the characterization process, establishing radionuclide content, is often achieved by nondestructive assay (NDA). In this work calculation techniques useful for the calibration and evaluation of measurements of radioactive waste drums by gamma-ray spectrometry were developed. To this end, a simulation program based on GEANT 3.21 toolkit was developed to simulate the response function of ISOCART gamma-ray spectrometry system for a geometry measurement with the drum volume divided in 40 volume elements. The Monte Carlo method was applied to obtain the expected spectra in the energy range from 50 to 2000 keV, the full energy peak efficiencies and the total efficiencies for sources uniformly distributed in each of the volume elements defined within the drum as well as for the source uniformly distributed in the entire drum.","Detection efficiency; Gamma-ray spectrometry; GEANT 3.21; HPGE detectors; Waste drums",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859066351

It is essential to develop catalysts and technologies for storing and transporting energy produced from various renewable sources. Storage in batteries or in chemical forms, for example in hydrogen, is under investigations. Due to robustness of the present infrastructure built for the exploitation of fossil resources, a part of the studies is devoted to develop catalytic processes for production of liquid fuels of biomass origin or using CO2 as carbon source.

They can exchange reactive power with the power system, but they have limited ability to exchange real power because they don’t include energy storage devices. STATCOMs coupled with energy storage devices such as batteries have been introduced to improve their ability to exchange real power. However, batteries have a limitation in their maximum deliverable power because of the slow chemical process required to release their energy. The trend now is to use supercapacitor energy storage systems ""SCESS"" as energy storage for STATCOMS. Supercapacitors have lower energy storage but higher power exchanging capability compared to batteries. This paper presents the analysis, design, and control of a supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) for a STATCOM. A peak current mode controller is used to control the SCESS system.

However, the country is well endowed with solar, wind and oil shale resources, in addition to large and small-scale hydropower projects. Based on available data and the current analysis, it is believed that there are at least 6-10 candidate sites in the western part of Jordan and 2-3 locations in the eastern plateau, which could be developed as small hydro plants, with a combined potential of more than 33 MW. At present, only two sites, namely King Talal Dam and Aqaba Thermal Power Plant, have been developed to be operational from 1980's. A major barrier to starting small scale hydro power projects is an understanding of how much the scheme will cost. This paper provides also an overview of the setbacks that inhibit the smooth investment and operation of small hydropower plants in Jordan. It is estimated that installing small hydropower schemes on the most promising existing dams will generate more than 200 GWh/year of electric energy without effecting the natural environment. In addition, there are another few sites, still under study, that may be developed in the future as small hydro plants. © 2012 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.","GHG emission; Jordan; Power generation; Pumped storage; Renewable energy; Small hydropower","GHG emission; Jordan; Pumped Storage; Renewable energies; Small hydro power; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic structures; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Power generation; Thermoelectric power plants; Hydroelectric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862304653

Adipose tissue is not simply an energy storage organ but also a secretory organ, producing a variety of bioactive molecules known as adipokines, including adiponectin and leptin. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an extracellular matrix protein, often associated with a variety of human cancers. Our retrospective study determines serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, and HA in HCC of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients and compares these levels to patients with cirrhosis and normal subjects. Noncirrhotic HCC (n = 19), cirrhotic HCC (n = 50), cirrhosis (n = 36) patients and twenty one age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched normal healthy controls were subjected in the present study. Serum adiponectin, leptin, and HA levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Levels of serum adiponectin were significantly higher in the cirrhosis and cirrhotic HCC groups than in the normal subjects, whereas serum HA levels were found to significantly increase in all three patients groups. The elevation of serum leptin in our HCC patients, regardless of being cirrhotic or noncirrhotic, but not in the patients with cirrhosis, may shed some light on the significance of serum leptin level in HCC. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the prognostic value of serum leptin level in HCC. © SAGE Publications 2012.","adiponectin; Hepatocellular carcinoma; hyaluronic acid; leptin","adipocytokine; adiponectin; hyaluronic acid; leptin; scleroprotein; adipose tissue; adult; article; blood level; cancer patient; chronic hepatitis; controlled study; disease course; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; Adiponectin; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Leptin; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860453490

Our results show that a (PdH)2 ring without an H-H bond and not dissociative Pd 2(H2) complexes are stable adsorbed systems with more elongated Pd-Pd and Pd-H bonds compared to the unsupported configurations caused by C-Pd interactions. In contrast, individual Pd atoms supported on graphene react with H2 to form only a Pd(H2) complex with a relaxed but not dissociated H-H bond. We also performed the Mulliken analysis to study the bonding mechanism during the adsorption process. In most cases, we found donor-acceptor C-Pd and Pd-H interactions in which C 2p, Pd 5s, and H 1s orbitals played an important role. We also found that the adsorption of a second Pd atom close to a PdH2 system destabilizes the H-H bond. In this work we contribute to shed more light on the relation between Pd clustering and the possibility of hydrogen storage in graphene-based materials.

The difference is possibly related to the concentration and good dispersion of defects in near-surface region in the samples. Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Based on a proposed plant concept that generates 400-500 MW net electricity with a flexible output of 0-200 MW th hydrogen and a carbon capture rate of at least 90%, the paper develops fuel selection criteria for coal blending with various alternative fuels for optimizing plant performance e.g. oxygen consumption, cold gas efficiency, hydrogen production and overall energy efficiency.

In metal hydrides is possible, since many metals react readily with hydrogen forming a stable metal hydride. Thus, saline hydrides such as lithium hydride have appeared as new alternatives to this, because of their high reactivity and reversibility. The first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used to study the physical properties of several Li-H compounds. The crystal structure, electronic properties and internal optimization parameters are treated by the LAPW method implemented in the WIEN2k code. In the present study we show the comparison of three different phases of lithium hydride compounds, in six different crystal structures, with the purpose of comparing the formation energies in all cases, and determine which is the structure, with the best structural properties for applications as hydrogen reservoir.

A key challenge is to understand how different activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production, influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migration? Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii) predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of seasonal resolution, state-dependent processes and individual variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies. © 2012 The Author.

Chemical changes in the surface composition after the plasma treatments were studied using a high resolution XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy). The water contact angle was reduced from an initial value of 79°to values of 31°and 20°for the ambient air and nitrogen plasma treatments. After 3 days of storage in ambient air the contact angles were still about 50°and 40°, respectively. The polar component of surface energy was changed by the aging significantly less than the total surface energy. Despite the marked increase in the surface energy, the plasma treatment had no significant influence on the surface morphology. The surface modification in air plasma resulted in significant reduction the O=C bond formation on the treated surface. The concentration of oxygen on PEN surface was increased from an initial value of 22 at.% up to 45 at.% already after 5 s air plasma exposure, and this oxygen concentration remained constant for longer plasma treatments. A small presence of nitrogen under 1.5 at.% from the air was also found after the treatments. The nitrogen plasma modified surface composition only by implanted nitrogen up to 5 at.% when the ratio of C=O and C-O was not significantly changed. But some new bonds are also expected to be formed in a very low number only. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Within these studies the Mesoscale Monte Carlo model has been constructed in order to investigate kinetics of antiphase interfaces motion. The motion of the interfaces is realized by local FePt domains reorientation due to energy minimalization. The data of energy barriers for all the transformation types were taken from previously performed atomistic simulations. The results show that the thin layer of energetically preferred domains forms at the free surface. The thickness of such a layer is controlled by temperature. The results obtained here present also kinetics of FePt domains growth at free surface. It can be observed that the growth of the domains is driven by the curvature of interfaces related to domains size. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although large amounts of agricultural residues are produced in Greece each year, their contribution towards meeting national energy demand has remained rather low due to inefficient and unplanned use. These residues have low heating value per unit volume and high transportation and storage costs when used in as received condition; these difficulties can be largely overcome through densification which is an effective approach for using residues efficiently. Densification offers an opportunity to make biomass easier to handle and transport. The cost of the endeavor is a challenge. However, there is a need to consider a system that operates year around with several biomass materials. The investigation in the Greek and the international market shows that mixed biomass pellets are promising fuels and with the appropriate support these fuels have many prospects for the future. The use of biomass pellets would not only create new market opportunities for agricultural industries, it would also reduce dependence on coal, as well as the greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal use. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AMPK signaling is involved in the regulation of all these characteristics via an integrated signaling network. Many studies with lower organisms have revealed that increased AMPK activity can extend the lifespan. Experiments in mammals have demonstrated that AMPK controls autophagy through mTOR and ULK1 signaling which augment the quality of cellular housekeeping. Moreover, AMPK-induced stimulation of FoxO/DAF-16, Nrf2/SKN-1, and SIRT1 signaling pathways improves cellular stress resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-κB signaling by AMPK suppresses inflammatory responses. Emerging studies indicate that the responsiveness of AMPK signaling clearly declines with aging. The loss of sensitivity of AMPK activation to cellular stress impairs metabolic regulation, increases oxidative stress and reduces autophagic clearance. These age-related changes activate innate immunity defence, triggering a low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. We will review in detail the signaling pathways of this integrated network through which AMPK controls energy metabolism, autophagic degradation and stress resistance and ultimately the aging process. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Aging; AMPK; Autophagy; Longevity; NF-κB; SIRT1","5 amino 4 imidazolecarboxamide riboside; calcineurin; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; fibroblast growth factor 21; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; I kappa B kinase beta; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mammalian target of rapamycin; metformin; protein p53; rapamycin; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; S6 kinase; sirtuin 1; somatomedin; thioredoxin; transcription factor DAF 16; transcription factor FKHR; transcription factor FKHRL1; transcription factor FOXO; transcription factor Nrf1; transcription factor Nrf2; aging; autophagy; Caenorhabditis elegans; caloric restriction; cell stress; cellular stress response; chronic inflammation; Drosophila; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; gene expression; heat stress; homeostasis; human; inflammation; innate immunity; intracellular signaling; life extension; lipid storage; longevity; metabolic regulation; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein phosphorylation; review; Aging; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Autophagy; Cell Aging; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme Activation; Humans; Signal Transduction; Stress, Physiological; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855182851

Principal component analysis was applied to study spectral development of samples during storage and K nearest-neighbour classifier was used for the classification of fillets by packaging type. Partial least squares regression was run to reduce the number of wavelengths included in the classification model. The results demonstrated that spectral variations could be observed in the different packaging atmospheres primarily at the wavelengths 606 and 636 nm.

Nevertheless, the conversion of such compounds for hydrogen production poses great technical challenges. In this paper, we report that hydrogen purity and yield can be significantly improved by integrating in situ CO2 capture into the steam reforming reaction of the model compounds-glucose and sorbitol. The experimental assessment was conducted at a steam-to-carbon ratio of 1.8 for sorbitol and 6 for glucose from 450-625 °C. As predicted by thermodynamic analysis, combining CO2 capture and reforming reactions at favorable operating conditions yielded very high purity hydrogen, for instance, 98.8 mol % from sorbitol and 99.9 mol % from glucose. However, there are trade-offs between hydrogen purity and yield in practice. The lower operating temperatures in the examined range helped to increase the hydrogen purity and reduce the CO content in the gas product, whereas a high hydrogen yield was more likely to be obtained at higher temperatures. Coupling CO2 capture lowered the risk of coke formation during the steam reforming of glucose. Coke accumulated in the reactor for the sorption-enhanced steam reforming of glucose was mostly from the slow pyrolysis of glucose before it came into contact with the catalyst-acceptor bed. This problem may be solved by improving heat transfer or reconstructing the reactor, for instance, by using a fluidized-bed reactor. One-pot stew of sugars: The steam reforming of sugars, such as sorbitol and glucose, with an integrated CO2 capture using a calcium-based acceptor is demonstrated to give hydrogen of very high purity and improved yield in a single step, while the risk of coke formation compared to conventional steam reforming is reduced. However, there is a trade-off between hydrogen selectivity and yield. High temperatures lead to high hydrogen yields with relatively low purity. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

However, the test-beds were constructed primarily from custom components often one-off prototypes and were plagued with reliability issues. Energy self sufficiency was for the most part not obtained due to the limited energy generated from the renewable sources coupled with poor component efficiencies and large parasitic system loads.

Therefore, a shift towards more sustainable washing habits has great potential to reduce the consumption of energy, water and detergent. This paper discusses the change in laundering practices during the past 10 years in Norway and suggests strategies to help consumers change their laundry habits to more sustainable ones. Quantitative information of consumers' experiences, habits and opinions concerning clothing maintenance was collected through three surveys in Norway in 2002, 2010 and 2011. The 2010 study was supplemented with qualitative in-depth interviews of a strategic sample of households. The average washing temperature has decreased slightly during the studied time periods. Some products' washing frequencies remained the same, whereas other products such as jeans were used a few more days before washing. The cotton programme is the most used washing programme, but short programmes are gaining popularity. The laundry sorting processes vary greatly and are influenced by several factors such as washing temperature, colours, fibre type and use area. For some consumers, the use of several different sorting categories made it more difficult to collect a sufficient amount of clothing to fill the machine. They were also afraid that overfilling the machine would result in clothes that were not clean enough or had detergent residues. Detergent dosing practices are far from optimal. In 2010, although the majority of respondents only used eye measure and did not know the water hardness of their area, they still tried to vary detergent dosage based on the amount of laundry and the level of soiling. Different design for sustainable behaviour strategies could be used within detergent dosage systems, care labelling, machine programme selection (such as suggesting lower temperature and eco-programme), machine filling grade indicators, storage systems for slightly used clothing and textile material choice. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Clothing care; Consumer behaviour; Design for sustainable behaviour; Laundry; Textile maintenance; Washing habits",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867342696

It is characterized by multiple symmetrical non-encapsulated fat accumulations mainly located around the neck, shoulders, upper extremities and upper parts of the trunk. The disorder predominantly affects middle-aged men of Mediterranean origin with a history of ethanol intake. Reports of this uncommon disorder in women are very rare. The aim of this article is to report the endocrine and metabolic workup leading to the diagnosis of this uncommon disorder. A 55-year-old woman with osteoporosis was referred to our outpatient clinic with a suspected diagnosis of Cushing's disease. The patient complained of undesired weight gain with atypical fat accumulations predominantly in the upper trunk region during the previous 10 weeks. She presented with the characteristic physical features of Madelung's disease and underwent a thorough examination with endocrine and metabolic evaluation of this rare condition and was finally diagnosed with Madelung's disease. This report demonstrates how a diagnosis of this rare disorder can be reached efficiently. A history of osteoporosis in combination with weight gain and atypical fat accumulations ultimately led to the diagnosis of Madelung's diseases, a rather unknown disorder likely to be under-diagnosed.

The use of powdered iron as starting material promoted conversion to complex hydride at shorter milling times than when granulated iron was used, nevertheless, after 24 hours of milling the 2Mg-Fe (powdered or granulated) mixtures presented similar dehydrogenation behavior. The hydrogen absorption during milling was on average 3.2 wt. (%), however, changing the proportions of the reagents to 3Mg-Fe a Mg 2FeH 6-MgH 2 based nanocomposite with higher density of hydrogen (5.2 wt. (%)) was obtained.","Hydrogen storage materials; Magnesium complex hydrides; Mechanochemical synthesis","Complex hydrides; High capacity; High-energy ball milling; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen atmosphere; Hydrogen storage materials; Magnesium complexes; Mechanochemical synthesis; Milling time; Phase evolutions; Planetary mills; Powdered iron; Reactive milling; Room temperature; Simultaneous thermal analysis; Single process; X-rays diffraction; Ball milling; Dehydrogenation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium; Nanocomposites; Thermoanalysis; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Milling (machining)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862572966

The paper proposes a detailed study and optimization of plant design (column height and packed dimensions) with CO 2 capture process using different solvents as: aqueous solutions of alkanolamine, dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol, chilled methanol and N-Methyl-2-pyrolidone. By developing simulations in Aspen Plus, the following performance results of these physical and chemical solvents, mentioned above, are discussed: overall energy consumption (power consumption, heating and cooling agent consumption), CO 2 specific emissions, net electric power output and plant efficiency.

The rapid technological development of electrical vehicles opens new opportunities from the electricity distribution point of view. Efficiency can be improved by implementing energy storages to the grid and cutting the load peaks by feeding power on peak hours from the energy storages to the grid. Electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) properties provide an opportunity to meet this challenge. In this paper, the challenge is approached from the economic perspective of an electricity distribution company. The key target of the paper is to determine whether there is economic potential for energy storages in networks in general. To this end, a generic model is introduced to analyze the feasibility of electric vehicles as energy storages in distribution networks. The methodological framework presented in the paper provides an opportunity for distribution system planners to estimate the preliminary feasibility of energy storages. The focus is on the discharging (vehicle to grid) perspective. The paper answers, for instance, the question of how to define the feasible level of energy storages (batteries) in the distribution system.

To reach the desired goal, some metal hydride from groups AB 5 and AB 2 were synthesized and characterized using elements substitution for tailoring their properties: reversible hydrogen absorption capacity between the hydrogen absorption and desorption pressures at equilibrium at small temperature differences. For the designed hydrogen storage reactors, a new technical solution which combines the effective increase of the thermal conductivity of MH bed and good permeability to hydrogen gas circulation, was implemented and tested.

Degradation processes depend on the type of plastic and conditions of storage. Knowledge of the chemical composition of plastic artifacts is thus very important and facilitates conservation work. The capabilities of energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with monochromatic excitation were investigated for possible characterization of the plastic materials used in artifacts from museum collections. For this purpose, a simple and suitable nondestructive analytical protocol was developed on the basis of the intensity of the coherent and the incoherent scattered excitation radiation from artifacts, compared with scattering from typical plastic materials such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polypropylene.

Mg-based composites absorb up to 5 wt.% of hydrogen during milling. It was found that reactive ball milling of magnesium with the different carbon allotropes (graphite, ultrafine diamonds, carbon nanotubes and amorphous carbon powder produced by electric breakdown of organic liquids) leads to a significant increase of hydrogen sorption rate. Morphology and phase composition of the synthesized Mg-C composites have been studied by TEM and XRD. Special attention was focused on the study of structural changes in the carbon additives. The hydrogenation rate of magnesium-carbon composites during reactive ball milling is strongly affected by the nature of carbon additives and their dispersion in an initial state.

Recovery of astaxanthin was evaluated by extracting pigments from the dried powders and analysing extracts by HPLC. The powders obtained were stored under different conditions of temperature and oxygen level and the effects on the degradation of astaxanthin were examined. Under the experimental conditions conducted in this study, the drying temperature that yielded the highest content of astaxanthin was 220°C, as the inlet, and 120°C, as the outlet temperature of the drying chamber. The best results were obtained for biomass dried at 180/110°C and stored at -21°C under nitrogen, with astaxanthin degradation lower than 10% after 9 weeks of storage. A reasonable preservation of astaxanthin can be achieved by conditions 180/80°C, -21°C nitrogen, 180/110°C, 21°C nitrogen, and 220/80°C, 21°C vacuum: the ratio of astaxanthin degradation is equal or inferior to 40%.

This creates a new type of sustainable hybrid power plant which can work continuously, using solar energy as primary energy source and water for energy storage. The characteristics of the solution as an open thermodynamic system are presented, as well as the basic theoretical settings for its application, i.e. key relationships between power and collector field area of PV power plant and working volume of upper storage. The paper introduces hydrological and hydro-energetic indicators for the hybrid plant description, ""artificial rainfall"", as the relationship between the water pumped into the upper water storage of the PSH (artificial water inflow) and collector field area of the PV power plant, as well as hydroenergy potential. The proposed hybrid electric power plant does not emit greenhouse gases, produce waste or significantly exploit water resources while the risks to humans and the environment are far smaller than when using conventional technology. This solution is flexible for implementation and can be applied in various climates, hydrological and physical conditions.

However, such systems usually imply the need for oversizing and considerable energy storage requirements leading to relatively high costs. On the other hand, hybrid configurations that may exploit both wind and solar potential of a given area may considerably reduce energy storage capacity and improve the economic performance of the system. In this context, an integrated techno-economic methodology for the evaluation of hybrid wind-photovoltaic stand-alone power systems is currently developed, aiming at the designation of optimum configurations for a typical remote consumer, using economic performance criteria. For the problem investigation, the developed evaluation model is applied to four representative areas of the Greek territory with different wind potential characteristics in order to obtain optimum configurations on the basis of minimum initial investment, 10-year and 20-year total cost. According to the results obtained, the proposed solution is favorably compared with all other stand-alone energy alternatives, reflecting the ability of hybrid systems to adjust even in areas where the local RES potential is not necessarily of high quality. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery energy storage; Hybrid system; Wind and solar potential","Battery energy storage; Economic performance; Energy storage capacity; Evaluation models; Generator sets; High costs; High quality; Hybrid configurations; Minimum cost; Optimum configurations; Over-sizing; Reliable energy; Remote consumers; Renewable energy source; Solar potential; Stand alone power systems; Standalone systems; Storage requirements; Techno-economics; Total costs; Wind potential; Electric generators; Energy policy; Energy storage; Hybrid systems; Investments; Photovoltaic effects; Power transmission; Solar power generation; Solar energy; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; reliability analysis; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856240788

Empirical models of both mechanical actuation of industrial PAM and chemical reaction of the metal hydride-LaNi 5 are derived systematically where their interactions comply with the continuity principle and energy balance in describing actual dynamic behaviors of the PAM actuator (PAM and hydriding/dehydriding-reaction bed). Simulation studies of mechanical actuation under various loads are conducted so as to present dynamic responses of the PAM actuators. From the promising results, it is intriguing that the heat input for the PAM actuator can be supplied to, or pumped from the reaction bed, in such a way that absorption and desorption of hydrogen gas take place, respectively, in controlling the pressure of hydrogen gas within the PAM actuator. Accordingly, this manipulation results in desired mechanical actuation of the PAM actuator in practical uses. © 2012 Jilin University.","Mathematical model; Metal hydride storage; Pneumatic artificial muscle","Desorption of hydrogen; Dynamic behaviors; Empirical model; Heat input; Hydriding; Hydrogen gas; In-control; Mathematical modeling; Mechanical actuations; Metal hydride storage; Metal hydrides; Pneumatic artificial muscle; Real-time implementations; Simulation studies; Actuators; Computer simulation; Desorption; Dynamic response; Dynamics; Gas absorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lanthanum alloys; Mathematical models; Metals; Muscle; Pneumatic drives; Pneumatics; Real time control; Systems analysis; Associative storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855992528

Growth measurements were carried out by using light microscopy to enumerate bacterial cells. Growth phases of the bacterial cell cycle were determined under different experimental conditions and rate constants were calculated for the growth phase from the slopes of the graphical representations of ln(cells/ml) vs. time, assuming that bacterial growth follows a first order process. JP-8 fuel was found to support microbial growth, with increasing temperature and water content having a positive impact on the growth profiles of the bacterial strains. Biocidal activity of an isothiazolone biocide (Kathon FP 1.5) was also examined. The results indicate that the biocide can suppress the growth of S. epidermidis by 73%, A. tumefaciens by 77% and R. picketii by 81%, when used at the appropriate concentration.

The aim of this study was to develop an LCA model to compare contrasting milk production systems, a seasonal pasture-based dairy farm and a confinement dairy farm. The environmental impacts considered were global warming, eutrophication, acidification, land use and non-renewable energy use. The LCA estimated on-farm, off-farm (pollutants and resources associated with the production and supply of purchased farm inputs) and total (on-farm and off-farm) environmental impacts. Environmental impacts were quantified per unit of milk and per unit area. The study only considered two research farms, because high quality data were unavailable for a large number of farms. Thus, this was not a representative LCA comparison. The genetic merit of cows modelled was similar for each system. A total mixed ration was fed in the confinement system and grazed grass was mainly fed in the grass-based system. Research data were used to confirm simulated dry matter intake (DMI) and predicted enteric CH 4 output from simulated DMI. The study found that when expressed per unit of milk and per on-farm area, all total environmental impacts were greater for the confinement system compared to the grass-based system. Per total farm area (on-farm and off-farm area), all environmental impacts except global warming were lower for the grass-based system. The greater environmental impact of the confinement dairy system was due to the greater use of concentrate feed and the longer manure storage period. Scenario modelling demonstrated that there is potential to decrease the environmental impact of dairy systems, particularly the confinement system, by reducing the use of concentrate ingredients with a high environmental impact and by storing manure in solid systems. Scenario modelling also showed that assumptions regarding the carbon cycle should be clearly outlined when assessing milk production systems and that standardisation of LCA allocation procedures is required. This LCA study is one of the few to directly compare the environmental impact of a grass-based and a confinement dairy system. However direct comparisons are needed, using an LCA methodology such as described in this paper, and using data from a greater number of farms so that each system is better represented thereby ensuring a robust comparison of the two systems on a regional or national basis. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrate; Confinement; Environmental impact; Grass-based; Life cycle assessment; Milk","acidification; assessment method; carbon cycle; dairy farming; dry matter; energy use; environmental impact; eutrophication; global warming; grass; life cycle analysis; methane; milk production; nonrenewable resource; numerical model; pollutant; resource use; seasonal variation; standardization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855769376

The objective of this study was to conduct an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of multiple biogas production and utilization pathways in order to identify areas where further mitigation of potential environmental impacts could be realized to enhance environmental sustainability of biogas deployment. The LCA of pre-defined small (&lt;500 kW el) and large-scale (≥500 kW el) biogas systems was conducted in accordance with the ISO 14040 standards, using SimaPro 7.2 computer software. The functional unit was the anaerobic digestion of 1 tonne of feedstock mixture to produce biogas with the digestate as process end product with multiple utilization options. The analyses quantified the impacts of feedstock type (both single feedstock and co-digestion), biogas utilization pathways, and the digestate processing and handling unit processes. Analyses also considered the replacement of fossil fuels and chemical fertilizer with equivalent energy value of the biogas and nutrient content of the digestate, respectively. The recorded variations in life-cycle impact categories for the scenarios compared indicated the importance of judicious selection of biogas pathways for environmental impact mitigation. The LCA and life-cycle energy analyses for single feedstock scenarios considered indicated that straw and corn silage as most efficient feedstocks for biogas. For example, straw mixture improved the environmental performance by almost 830% compared to the base scenario of cattle manure feedstock. This was mainly ascribed to the higher energy density, which exceeded the primary energy inputs for feedstock supply logistics. In order to minimize the environmental damage associated with feedstock type in all impact categories considered, and simultaneously maintain a positive energy balance, the analyses suggest that co-digestion of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) with agricultural and food industry residues are most appropriate for both small and large-scale biogas plants; co-digestion of waste and residues accounted for just 1% of the estimated impacts on agricultural land occupation, compared to the co-digestion of predominantly energy crop feedstock, and also reduced the climate change impacts by up to 30%. The results also indicated for the small-scale plants, the most promising pathway for sustainable biogas utilization would be in tri-generation; compared to electricity only generation in Combined Heat and Power (CHP), tri-generation could reduce the overall environmental impact by almost 200%. For the scenarios that included purification and upgrading biogas to biomethane for gas grid injection (arguably the most promising technology that could support rapid utilization expansion), it was noted that only the scenario with coupled small-scale CHP unit covering internal heat demands was capable of reducing the overall impact on fossil fuel depletion, compared to electricity generation alone. This was explained by the higher potential for fossil fuel substitution with biomethane, due to higher conversion efficiency (ca. 100%). It was also found that, the recovery of residual biogas from digestate storage reduced the environmental impacts of digestate management process by ca. tenfold, due to combined reduction of the potential biogas leakage to the atmosphere and subsequent use of the extra yield for energy generation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The systems investigated included single feedstock digestion and multiple feedstock co-digestion, small (&lt;500 kW el) and large-scale (≥500 kW el) biogas plants, and selected biogas utilization pathways and digestate management options. Analysis was performed in accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044 standards, using SimaPro 7.2 software and Ecoinvent ® v2.1 database. The analysis is based on published data considering primarily conditions for Germany. Results indicated significant variation of emission levels for all unit processes related to biogas production and utilization. Emissions from the feedstock supply logistics were highly influenced by the origin of feedstock used. For example, the fossil fuel related carbon dioxide (CO 2,fossil) emissions associated with feedstock supply were over 50 times higher for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) compared to cattle manure. The higher value for MSW was associated with the requisite collection, transport and pre-treatment, whereas only transportation was required for cattle manure. Emissions from unit processes in biogas plant operation and biogas utilization depended on combined efficiency of energy generation (electricity and thermal), potential substitution of fossil fuels with biogas and utilization of the heat by-product of electricity generation. For example, the results indicated that upgrading of biogas to biomethane, with almost 100% conversion efficiency, caused 6 times less non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) emissions if plant heating was supplied from coupled small-scale CHP unit as opposed to heating with natural gas. Harnessing of the residual biogas from digestate storage areas was estimated to reduce methane emission by a factor up to 14. Overall, this study provides basic data required for identification and mitigation of emission 'hot-spots' in biogas production and utilization, including the evaluation of environmental and public health impacts of biogas technology options by attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a great emphasis on electrification in the transport sector replacing part of motor powered engines with battery powered applications. There are plans both to increase energy efficiency and to reduce the overall need for consumption of non-renewable liquid fuels. Even more significant applications are dependent on energy storage. Materials needed for battery applications require specially made high quality products. Diminishing amounts of easily minable metal ores increase the consumption of separation and purification energy and chemicals. The metals are likely to be increasingly difficult to process. Iron, manganese, lead, zinc, lithium, aluminium, and nickel are still relatively abundant but many metals like cobalt and rare earths are becoming limited resources more rapidly. The global capacity of industrial-scale production of larger lithium ion battery cells may become a limiting factor in the near future if plans for even partial electrification of vehicles or energy storage visions are realized. The energy capacity needed is huge and one has to be reminded that in terms of cars for example production of 100 MWh equals the need of 3000 full-electric cars. Consequently annual production capacity of 10 6 cars requires 100 factories each with a 300 MWh capacity. Present day lithium ion batteries have limitations but significant improvements have been achieved recently [1-8]. The main challenges of lithium ion batteries are related to material deterioration, operating temperatures, energy and power output, and lifetime.

To understand the contribution of selective factors in maintaining polymorphism, we investigated large-scale (&1000 km) geographic variation in morph frequencies and fitness-related physiological traits in the damselfly Nehalennia irene. As fitness-related physiological traits, we investigated investment in immune function (phenoloxidase activity), energy storage and fecundity (abdomen protein and lipid content), and flight muscles (thorax protein content). In the first part of the study, our aim was to identify selective agents maintaining the large-scale spatial variation in morph frequencies. Morph frequencies varied considerably among populations, but, in contrast to expectation, in a geographically unstructured way. Furthermore, frequencies co-varied only weakly with the numerous investigated ecological parameters. This suggests that spatial frequency patterns are driven by stochastic processes, or alternatively, are consequence of highly variable and currently unidentified ecological conditions. In line with this, the investigated ecological parameters did not affect the fitness-related physiological traits differently in both morphs. In the second part of the study, we aimed at identifying trade-offs between fitness-related physiological traits that may contribute to the local maintenance of both colour morphs by defining alternative phenotypic optima, and test the spatial consistency of such trade-off patterns. The female morph with higher levels of phenoloxidase activity had a lower thorax protein content, and vice versa, suggesting a trade-off between investments in immune function and in flight muscles.

They are used, for example, as catalysts, fuel-cell electrodes, magnetic memories, etc. When a nanocomposite is composed of both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) nanoparticles, interesting physical properties can occur, such as the phenomenon of exchange bias (EB). A Ni/NiO nanocomposite obtained by the thermal decomposition of nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate, Ni(CH 3COO) 2·4H 2O, at 300 °C is composed of NiO (62%) and Ni (38%) with crystallite sizes of 11 and 278 nm, respectively. We observed an increase in the crystallite size for NiO and decrease of crystallite size for Ni, a decrease in the microstrain for both and an increase in the NiO phase content with thermal annealing in air, while high-energy ball milling leads to a decrease of the crystallite size, an increase in the size of the agglomerates, and microstrain as well as reduction, NiO → Ni. The lattice parameters of the nanosized NiO and Ni show a deviation from the value for the bulk counterparts as a consequence of crystallite size reduction and the grain-surface relaxation effect. The exchange bias found in a milled sample with particles of 10 nm (NiO) and 11 nm (Ni) disappears for larger particles as a consequence of a coupling-area decrease between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic particles. Due to reduction/oxidation (NiO ↔ Ni) and size as well as surface-relaxation effects the saturation magnetization value increases/decreases with milling/annealing, respectively. Having in mind the effect of size on the exchange bias, coercivity, and magnetization values, it is possible, by annealing/milling, to tailor the composition and particle size and then control the exchange bias and improve the other magnetic properties of the Ni/NiO. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Antiferromagnetics; Bulk counterpart; Exchange bias; Ferromagnetic particles; High-energy ball milling; Magnetic memories; Magnetization values; Micro-strain; Model system; Nano scale; Nano-sized; Nano-structured; Nickel acetate; Particle size reduction; Phase content; Potential applications; Reduction/oxidation; Relaxation effect; Thermal-annealing; Antiferromagnetic materials; Antiferromagnetism; Ball milling; Cobalt compounds; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Magnetic properties; Magnetic storage; Nanocomposites; Nickel compounds; Pyrolysis; Saturation magnetization; Size determination; Surface relaxation; Transition metals; Crystallite size",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857395733

Besides intrinsic factors (not studied here), our work showed that may have various causes. Firstly, different methods are used to measure antioxidant capacity. Secondly, the results obtained for a single matrix by one method (such as ORAC) can vary with the extraction conditions. Parameters having a great impact on the amount and composition of antioxidants in extracts, and thus on the measured antioxidant capacity, notably include the extraction solvent composition, temperature, extraction time (duration), solvent-to-solid ratio, and storage conditions. Standardisation of the extraction procedure is thus necessary for accurate and reproducible determination of the antioxidant capacity and phenolics in different food matrices by different laboratories. In this study we optimised such a procedure for four fresh plant matrices (orange, apple, leek, and broccoli). The optimised procedure requires extraction in a mixture of acetone/water/acetic acid (70/28/2, v/v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C, with a solvent-to-solid ratio of 20 mL per 1 g.

This is of course in the light of the new climate and energy policy of the EU and shall consider the most important energy sources currently used in Europe. Neither a single current nor future energy source - be it nuclear, fossil, renewable or hydrogen - nor a single support technology, such as carbon capture and storage, can alone represent the remedy to cope with the challenges of increasing energy demand, increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions and increasing dependence on fuel supply from outside Europe. However, the different sources and related technologies can effectively complement each other. Nuclear power should thus be seen in combination with its alternatives. How the mixture is done in order to achieve an appropriate, ?sustainable? energy mix depends on the resources and local conditions of each country or region. There are, nevertheless, some basic commonalities and inevitable limiting conditions related to the specificities of the use of the various sources which should form the basis of any such decision-making and which will be introduced in this article. Getting eventually to a decarbonised, non-fossil world will demand great determination, huge financial burden and true patience. But there is hope on the short- and mid-term horizons by means of effectively complementing and synchronising existing technologies, such as nuclear baseload electricity generation with other low CO2-intensive sources, e.g. some of the renewables.On the long-term horizon, only large-scale technological innovation will help, including advanced nuclear technologies in combination with significantly improved renewables and technologies to store energy, to largely replace fossil fuels also as power source for non-electrical applications © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This has the advantage of maintaining constant terminal voltage and frequency irrespective of wind speed and load variations. Two NARMA L2 controllers are used. The first one is dedicated for regulating the terminal voltage of the induction generator to a set point by controlling the thyristor firing angle of a static reactive power compensator (SVAR). The second one is designed to control the mechanical input power to the generator via adjusting the blade pitch angle of the wind turbine. In this application, an indirect data-based technique is taken, where a model of the plant is identified on the basis of input-output data and then used in the model-based design of a neural network controller. The proposed system has the advantages of robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances. The robustness of the wind-energy scheme has been certified through step change in wind speed. Moreover, the system is tested also during a step change in load impedance. Simulation results show that high dynamic performance of the proposed wind energy scheme has been achieved.","Induction generator; NARNA-L2 controller; Neural networks; Wind turbine","Blade pitch; Energy schemes; External disturbances; High dynamic performance; Input-output data; Load impedance; Load variations; Mechanical input power; Model uncertainties; Model-based design; Narma-L2; Neural control; Neural network controllers; Nonlinear auto-regressive moving averages; Reactive power compensator; Self excited induction generators; Setpoints; Step changes; Terminal voltages; Thyristor firing angles; Voltage and frequency control; Wind generation system; Wind speed; Asynchronous generators; Digital storage; Neural networks; Robustness (control systems); Uncertainty analysis; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866984628

Investigations were made into the breast and leg muscle energy metabolism, and the quality of breast meat of turkeys after controlled atmosphere stunning or stun-killing (CAS) with various gas mixtures. In addition, the effect on meat quality of an increase in the chilling rate of turkey breast meat after hypercapnic or anoxic stun-killing was studied.2. A total of 35 turkey toms within two replicate pens were individually stunned during consecutive weeks using one of 4 CAS methods. The stunning gases tested were high CO2 concentration (60% CO2 in air), high N2 concentration (98% N2, &lt; 2% O2), a mixture of 76% N2 and 24% CO2, and a biphasic method (first minute in mixture containing 40% CO2, 30% N2, and 30% O2 followed by two minutes in a mixture containing 60% CO2 in air).3. The birds stunned with N2 displayed the highest initial reduction in muscle pH, but after 4 h post mortem there were no differences in pH values associated with the various CAS methods.4. The CAS method alone had no statistically significant effect on the quality of turkey breast muscle when the chilling speed was rapid (0°C for 4 h, followed by storage at 4°C). When the chilling rate was slowed (20°C for 4 h followed by storage at 4°C), a significant decrease in cooking loss and in Warner-Bratzler shear force was recorded for birds stun-killed with CO2.5. This study shows that anoxic stun-killing with N2 had no adverse effects on meat quality despite the rapid post mortem pH decrease. The CAS with N2 allows rapid cooling of carcases without the risk of cold shortening, whereas with CO2-stun-killing of turkeys, the rate of chilling should be slower. Concerning meat quality, all the CAS methods tested were suitable for stunning turkeys. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859166774

Studies reveal that there have been both a decline in species diversity and a decrease in Neotropical bat population size because of habitat loss. The aim of this study was to investigate whether human action has been affecting the food availability to wildlife species, which could impact the storage of body energy reserves. For this purpose, fruit-eating bats (Artibeus lituratus) were collected in two areas in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The concentrations of plasma glucose, as well as glycogen, lipids and protein in liver in muscles were performed, in addition to adipose tissue weight and carcass fatty acids. Our results indicate that fat reserves were significantly lower in most tested tissues (muscle of the hindlimbs, breast muscles, adipose tissue and carcass) in animals collected in the region with a higher degree of human disturbance. The other parameters showed no significant differences in the groups collected at different locations. In conclusion, we suggest that human action on the environment may be affecting the storage of body fat energy reserves of this species during the autumn, particularly in metropolitan region areas of Belo Horizonte, MG - Brazil, requiring special attention to the species conservation.","Bats; Forest fragmentation; Glucose; Metabolism","glucose; glycogen; lipid; protein; animal; article; bat; Brazil; chemistry; diet restriction; ecosystem; energy metabolism; environmental protection; female; liver; male; metabolism; muscle; physiology; tree; Animals; Brazil; Chiroptera; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Female; Glucose; Glycogen; Lipids; Liver; Male; Muscles; Proteins; Trees; Animalia; Artibeus; Artibeus lituratus; Chiroptera; Phyllostomidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858953745

Multi-bank memory architecture is commonly applied in 8-bit microcontrollers to increase the size of memory without extending address buses. To switch among different memory banks, a special instruction, Bank Selection, is used. How to minimize the number of bank selection instructions inserted is important to reduce code size for embedded systems. In this paper, we consider how to insert the minimum number of bank selection instructions in a program to achieve feasibility. A program can be represented by a control flow graph (CFG). We prove that it is NP-hard to insert the minimum number of bank selection instructions if all the variables are pre-assigned to memory banks. Therefore, we introduce a 2-approximation algorithm using a rounding method. When the CFG is a tree or the out-degree of each node in the CFG is at most two, we show that we can insert the bank selection instructions optimally in polynomial time. We then consider the case when there are some nodes that do not access any memory bank and design a dynamic programming method to compute the optimal insertion strategy when the CFG is a tree. Finally, if the variables are not yet assigned, we show that it is NP-hard to decide the variable assignment with the minimum number of insertions needed even if the input CFG is a tree. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Approximation algorithms; Bank selection instruction minimization; NP-hardness; Partitioned memory architecture; Rounding","8-bit microcontrollers; Address bus; Code size; Control flow graphs; Dynamic programming methods; Low costs; Memory banks; NP-hard; NP-hardness; Optimal insertion; Polynomial-time; Rounding; Rounding method; Variable assignment; Approximation algorithms; Computational complexity; Data flow analysis; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Microcontrollers; Polynomial approximation; Random access storage; Algorithms; Controllers; Energy; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858864648

The electrode's durability derives from the atomic structure of the crystalline copper hexacyanoferrate used to make it. To maximize the benefit of the open structure, the researchers needed to use the right size ions. The right-sized ion turned out to be hydrated potassium, a much better fit than other hydrated ions, e.g., Na and Li. The speed of the electrode is further enhanced because the particles of electrode material that the researchers synthesized are tiny even by nanoparticle standards - a mere 100 atoms across. The research seeks to overcome cost concerns associated with grid energy storage as opposed to energy density.

Both brown and white adipose tissues are finely regulated endocrine organs that modulate energy balance and temperature homeostasis. In a recent issue of Gerontology, Saely and Drexel dissected the different morphology and the prime functions of brown and white adipose tissue. They impressively showed that adipose tissues are not inert deposits, but instead highly plastic tissues in close interface with guts, liver, and brain. Brown and white adipose tissues are essentially complementary organs that serve different teleological purposes. The molecular understanding of their physiological pathways opens the door to the development of a rational pharmacotherapy of obesity and associated disorders. Thus, the targeting of energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue may be an attractive alternative strategy to combat obesity. However, every intervention in cellular bioenergetics to treat obesity or cachexia will have to face principal safety considerations, as the thermodynamic implications of such interventions are largely unknown and potentially dangerous.

Solar cells typically come in the form of a thin semiconductor wafer. When the solar cells are combined, they form solar modules, also referred to as solar panels. These panels consist of a series of solar cells wired together and enclosed in a self-contained glass unit. On the sunward side, the solar cells are protected by a highly transparent solar glass pane. The underside is generally an insulating film or second pane of glass. This is why most solar systems include a battery storage system as a backup power source. With grid-connected applications, a solar energy system actually works in conjunction with the local utility power grid. If electrical needs ever exceed solar power output, the utility grid will make up for the shortfall. In terms of the environment, there are no pollutants produced with solar energy. In fact, a typical system cuts greenhouse gas emissions as effectively as planting a couple of dozen trees.",,"Alternative energy; Back-up power; Battery storage system; Energy technologies; Glass panes; Grid-connected; Insulating film; Solar energy systems; Solar module; Solar panels; Thin semiconductor; Utility grids; Utility power; Gas emissions; Glass; Greenhouse gases; Solar energy; Solar concentrators",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856997903

The soybean DLF was stored at room temperature over a period of six months in three different tanks. The tanks were made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and stainless steel 304, with and without an epoxy resin protection. Samples were collected at various times, and their physical-chemical parameters (viscosity, density, distillation curve, etc.) were obtained according to ASTM methods, as recommended for diesel fuel evaluation. Increases in the viscosity and density during storage were attributed to polymerisation reactions, which often lead to the formation of more viscous and dense materials. Additionally, gas chromatographic analyses showed a decrease in the content of light fractions during storage. The Rancimat method could not be applied to evaluate the oxidation stabilities for the samples. Instead, oxidation stabilities were evaluated by the consumption of O 2 at high pressures at 100°C in comparison to a soybean biodiesel sample. Although changes in the physical-chemical parameters occurred during storage, the majority of the results remained within the limits specified by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) for diesel fuel. Overall, the results showed that the differences in the materials for the tanks used for DLF storage did not interfere with the biofuel parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemical stability; Diesel-like fuel; Pyrolysis; Soybean oil; Storage","Dense materials; Diesel-like fuel; Distillation curves; High pressure; Light fraction; Oxidation stability; Physical-chemical parameters; Rancimat; Room temperature; Soybean oil; Stainless steel-304; Chemical stability; Chromatographic analysis; Diesel fuels; Distillation; Energy storage; Epoxy resins; Fuels; Gallium; Gas chromatography; High density polyethylenes; Pyrolysis; Stainless steel; Steel tanks; Viscosity; Fuel storage; diesel; distillation; ethylene; gas chromatography; physicochemical property; polymerization; pyrolysis; resin; soybean; stabilization; temperature effect; vegetable oil; viscosity; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856235217

Therefore certain metals can be used as gas purification and hydrogen storage material. Storage and transport of metals are basic operations, free from safety issues and hydrogen is produced on demand whenever it is needed by passing steam over the solid reactant. Metal is commonly generated by the reduction of the corresponding metal oxide. Different routes like thermal reduction, carbothermic reduction or fused salt electrolysis are possible. In this paper metals are evaluated with regard to their applicability in the metal steam process upon thermodynamics and experimental investigations. Light metals with high oxygen bonding capacity were found to be promising materials for hydrogen storage due to their high storage density. Ge, Mo, W and Fe were found as potential candidates for the separation process with high hydrogen concentration in the product gas and excellent reduction and oxidation capability. However, reduction and oxidation at elevated temperatures cause the solid metals to reduce their surface area due to sintering. As a result the reaction rates decrease significantly after one redox cycle. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, environmental conditions, such as water activity and temperature, were evaluated during storage of the spores. T. harzianum spores produced in liquid culture are highly sensitive to thermal stress, but dehydration does not seem to be a factor that influences spore death during desiccation. An inverse correlation between spore survival and the specific concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was observed during storage, especially when the conidia moisture levels were lower than the monolayer moisture levels. We prepared spore suspensions without additives and spray-dried the samples.

This paper presents a model of a forced circulation solar water heating system for supplying a hot water at a certain temperature for an aquaculture system. The main components of the system are flat plate collector, storage tank, and a biogas auxiliary heater. The optimization problem is carried out using a genetic algorithm, which is one of the modern optimization techniques because of its evolutionary nature; it can handle any kind of objective function and constraint. Genetic algorithms don't have mathematical requirements about the optimization problem; Also genetic algorithms are very effective in performing a global search (in probability), and provide a great flexibility. The optimal design of flat plate collector area using genetic algorithm is used to optimize the objective function considering the constraints required for the system. As the genetic algorithm is a discrete optimization tool, the number of variables in principle is unlimited. The economic analysis of such system is evaluated with the life cycle cost method. The collector area is equal to 63m 2, at this value the solar fraction reached 98% which is a very high value. Also, sensitivity analysis to solar radiation variation, air temperature variation, and interest rate has been carried out. © 2011.","Aquaculture system; Economic; Genetic algorithm; Optimal sizing; Optimization; Solar thermal energy","Air temperature variations; Aquaculture systems; Auxiliary heater; Discrete optimization; Flat-plate collector; Global search; Hot water; Interest rates; Lifecycle costs; Main component; Mathematical requirements; Objective functions; Optimal design; Optimal sizing; Optimization problems; Optimization techniques; Radiation variations; Solar fraction; Solar thermal energy; Solar water heating systems; Storage tank; Thermal solar; Water heating systems; Aquaculture; Biogas; Economic analysis; Economics; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Optimization; Probabilistic logics; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Sun; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855187864

It covers about 40 acres, with 5-m depth. The RRT wastewater pond functions at a repair factory and is the collection site of the direct-polluted waste of homeless people living around the pond rim and also for temporary reservoir of two influent canals. The water hyacinth aquatic plants were grown well and covered almost the entire surface area of the pond. An experimental design was laid by making a floating bamboo frame 5. m × 10. m in size and spreading systematical distribution through all parts of the pond with the coverage area 30 percent of pond surface. Data collection and analysis were conducted on plant nutrients, heavy metals and toxic chemicals in wastewater (influent, storage, and effluent) sediment, leaves and roots of water hyacinth (in fresh and compost). Also, the water hyacinth growth rate in various periods of time in relation to chemical concentration in wastewater were determined from the beginning through harvesting time. The results found that water hyacinth would be the high-absorbing plants to extract the heavy metals (such as Mn, Cd, Fe, Zn, Cu, and Pb) and plant nutrients (such as N, P, K, Ca, Mg). The floating aquatic vegetables contaminated via high concentration of heavy metals were not eaten under the regulations of Ministry of Public Health. Consequently, the compost that was made by water hyacinth showed a high concentration of heavy metals. An application of such compost would only be for flowering-plants growth, with no possibility of application to edible vegetables.

Their topologies are based on unipolar PWM AC matrix-reactance choppers (MRCs). In the discussed MRFCs the voltage matrix converter (MC) or current MC is used for electrical energy transfer instead of the source or load synchronous connected switches. As a result both a frequency change and the buck-boost voltage conversion are possible. It is important that electrical energy storage in the passive elements used in MRFCs is equal to zero in an AC voltage period; therefore these converters can be treated as ones without DC storage. The main purpose of this paper is to carry out a comprehensive comparison of basic properties of MRFCs using an low frequency (LF) transfer matrix modulation method, which are the FCs with the voltage gain greater than one. Presented in this paper are the results of steady and transient states analysis of the MRFCs using an low frequency (LF) transfer matrix. A two-frequency complex function method is applied for solving non-stationary averaged state space equations. Furthermore, theoretical results are verified against some simulation and experimental test results of a c.a. 1 kVA laboratory model of the MRFC based on MRC with buck-boost topology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the feasibility of bypassing a number of reservoirs and pumping stations in a small transmission system in AlAin City of United Arab Emirates. The system has a major transmission pumping station (AlAin Reception Pumping Station, or 'AARS') that hosts four fixed-speed pumps, a main 1200mm line, storage reservoirs and boosting pumps at three zones (Dahma, Markhania and Maqam), besides few other connection pipes. The system also has three surge vessels and air valves. The objective of the study has been achieved by conducting a comprehensive transient analysis to evaluate the potential of pressure rises associated with various operating scenarios. Such scenarios were divided into normal and abnormal operating conditions. The normal operating conditions are related to the typical water supply changes occurring during any typical day. The abnormal operating conditions represent rare and odd operating scenarios such as sudden valve closures/openings and pump trips. Limiting pressure heads of 160 m for the pipe pressure rating and 60 m for the pump shutoff head were considered to identify safe performance of the proposed bypass setting. British Standards (BS), International Standard Organization (ISO) and Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA) Standards were adapted for the design of pipes and fittings. Simulation results associated with the normal operating conditions indicated that the proposed setting is safely performing in such conditions and has yielded safe closure times for different valves. Results of the abnormal operating conditions indicated unsafe performance in the case of sudden valve closures. To protect the system against severe transient pressures under these conditions, a number of pressure-relief valves were proposed to be installed on the upstream side of the distribution network. The proposed valves were sized and evaluated when the system pressure is maintained below 100 m. The savings in energy cost associated with the proposed bypass setting is estimated at about $850,000 per year. Such savings are found to be available after a payback period of one year and one month to cover the capital cost of the needed bypasses and pressure relief valves. © 2012 ASCE.","AlAin; bypass; energy saving; transient; transmission; United Arab Emirates; Water distribution system","Abu Dhabi; Air valves; AlAin; Booster pumping stations; British Standards; bypass; Capital costs; Distribution network; Distribution systems; Energy cost; International standard organizations; Normal operating conditions; Operating condition; Payback periods; Pipe pressures; Pressure heads; Pressure rise; Pump trips; Pumping stations; Residual pressures; Storage reservoirs; Supply change; System pressure; Three zones; Transient conditions; Transient pressures; Transmission systems; Typical day; United Arab Emirates; Valve closure; Water distributions; Water transmission pipelines; Energy conservation; Investments; Local area networks; Pipe; Pumping plants; Pumps; Rating; Reservoirs (water); Systems analysis; Transient analysis; Transients; Transmissions; Water distribution systems; Water pipelines; Water supply; Pressure relief valves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856156647

We consider the central diffractive contribution mediated by Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges as well as a completely new mechanism of emission of kaons from the proton lines. We include absorption effects due to proton-proton interaction and kaon-kaon rescattering. We compare our results with measured cross sections for the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings experiment. We make predictions for future experiments at RHIC, Tevatron, and LHC. Differential distributions in invariant two-kaon mass, kaon rapidities, and transverse momenta of kaons are presented. Two-dimensional distribution in (yK +,yK -) is particularly interesting. The higher the incident energy, the higher preference for the same-hemisphere emission of kaons. We find that the kaons from the new mechanism of emission directly from proton lines are produced rather forward and backward but the corresponding cross section is rather small. The processes considered here constitute a sizeable contribution to the total proton-proton cross section as well as to the kaon inclusive cross section. We consider a measurement of exclusive production of a scalar χ c0 meson in the proton-proton collisions via χ c0→K +K - decay. The corresponding amplitude for exclusive central diffractive χ c0 meson production is calculated within the k t-factorization approach.

Using a proteomic approach we aimed to determine early changes in arterial protein expression in transgenic mice containing both human LDL and lipoprotein(a) in circulation. Methods and Results: Plasma lipid analyses showed the lipoprotein(a) transgenic mice had significantly higher lipid levels than wildtype, including a much increased LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Analysis of aortae from lipoprotein(a) mice showed lipoprotein(a) accumulation but no lipid accumulation or foam cells, leaving the arteries essentially atherosclerosis free. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we identified 34 arterial proteins with significantly altered abundance (P<0.05) in lipoprotein(a) transgenic mice compared to wildtype including 17 that showed a ≥2 fold difference. Some proteins of interest showed a similarly altered abundance at the transcript level. These changes collectively indicated an initial metabolic response that included a down regulation in energy, redox and lipid metabolism proteins and changes in structural proteins at a stage when atherosclerosis had not yet developed. Conclusions: Our study shows that human LDL and lipoprotein(a) promote changes in the expression of a unique set of arterial proteins which may be early indicators of the metabolic disturbances preceding atherosclerosis. © 2012 Rodger et al.",,"high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; structural protein; lipoprotein A; low density lipoprotein; animal experiment; animal tissue; aorta atherosclerosis; article; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; down regulation; energy metabolism; female; foam cell; functional proteomics; lipid analysis; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoprotein metabolism; mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; transgenic mouse; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; wild type; animal; aorta; atherosclerosis; biology; blood; C57BL mouse; genetics; human; male; metabolism; methodology; proteomics; Mus; Mus musculus; Animals; Aorta; Atherosclerosis; Computational Biology; Female; Humans; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, LDL; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Proteomics; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855998419

Through isothermal DMA curves studied, it is noted an increase in the Kauzmann temperature and the fragility concept proposed by Angell upon POSS addiction, suggesting a formation of a kinetically weaker system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Angell fragility; Nanocomposites; POSS; Viscoelasticity","Angell fragility; Cohesive energy density; Cross-link densities; Dynamic mechanical; Epoxy matrices; Kauzmann temperature; Loss moduli; Nanofiller; Nonisothermal; Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes; POSS; Activation energy; Dynamic analysis; Dynamics; Glass transition; Nanocomposites; Oligomers; Viscoelasticity; Dynamic mechanical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83855165654

The microstructure of raw and cooked beans observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the presence of hexagonal or angular shaped cotyledon cells (50-100 μm size) containing starch granules with a size ranging between 10 and 50 μm. The extent of starch hydrolysis (%) after 120 min of in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion differed between whole navy beans (∼60%) and milled bean flour and bean starch (85-90%) after they were cooked under similar conditions. Starch hydrolysis (%) increased significantly when the cotyledon cells in the cooked whole navy beans were disrupted using high pressure treatment (French press). The storage of freshly cooked whole beans resulted in a lower (40-45%) starch hydrolysis whereas re-heating increased the same to 70-80% during in vitro small intestinal digestion. The SEM pictures of cooked navy bean digesta after different intervals of in vitro gastric and small intestinal digestion showed that the cotyledon cell structure is maintained well throughout the digestion period.

Such compounds, comprising wax to polyethylene in a 3:2 proportion, were prepared by twin screw compounding. Two types of graphite were used in an attempt to improve the thermal conductivity of the compounds. Expanded graphite enhanced the thermal conductivity by more than 200% at a loading of 10 wt.%, compared to a ca. 60% improvement with natural graphite flakes at the same loading. The TGA results showed that all the compounds underwent a two-step degradation. In all cases the mass % ratios of the two degradation steps were roughly 3:2 for wax:LDPE, which confirms that the wax evaporated completely before the degradation of LDPE started. The DSC results suggest that the heat energy storing capacity of the wax is not influenced by the other components as long as heating is restricted to temperatures just above the melting point of the wax. It is also apparent that the presence of both forms of graphite enhanced the rate of heat transfer to the PCMs. The DMA results show that the presence of wax had a softening effect, while the presence of graphite opposed this softening effect by reinforcing the PCM composites. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The metabolome encompasses the entity of small molecules- Most often end products of a catalytic process regulated by genes and proteins-with the lipidome being its fat soluble subdivision. Within recent years, lipids are more and more regarded not only as energy storage compounds but also as interactive players in various cellular regulation cycles and thus attain rising interest in the bio-medical community. The field of lipidomics is, on one hand, fuelled by analytical technology advances, particularly mass spectrometry and chromatography, but on the other hand new biological questions also drive analytical technology developments. Compared to fairly standardized genomic or proteomic high-throughput protocols, the high degree of molecular heterogeneity adds a special analytical challenge to lipidomic analysis. In this review, we will take a closer look at various mass spectrometric platforms for lipidomic analysis. We will focus on the advantages and limitations of various experimental setups like 'shotgun lipidomics', liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) based approaches. We will also examine available software packages for data analysis, which nowadays is in fact the rate limiting step for most 'omics' workflows. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","ESI; LC-MS; Lipidomics; MALDI-TOF; Mass spectrometry; Shotgun","2 mercaptobenzothiazole; aminoacridine; beta resorcylic acid; cardiolipin; cholesterol ester; glycerolipid; glycerophospholipid; icosanoid; sphingolipid; sterol; high performance liquid chromatography; human; hydrophobicity; immunodetection; infusion; ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; ion trap mass spectrometry; lipidomics; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; review; sensitivity analysis; ultra performance liquid chromatography",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878518571

Primary energy of the wind, and the classic model of the energy path of the wind farm, determine the effectiveness of the plant. From the theory of wind energy we know that from the area encompassed by the spinning turbine blades a maximum of 38% of total wind energy may be recovered. Five different types of turbines were discussed. The best performance is exhibited by triple-blade turbine with horizontal axis. The turbine shaft is coupled with electric generator through a mechanical gearbox. Seven types of electric generators were also characterized, according to the criteria such as investment costs, rated power, reliability, operating and maintenance costs. This comparison favors two solutions: asynchronous generator with squirrel cage rotor, connected directly to the grid, and synchronous generator excited by permanent magnets. Finally, two solutions of the power collection from the wind farm were proposed, based on its cooperation with the pumped-storage power plant.","Economics of wind turbine; Energy collection; Wind turbine; Wind turbine generator wtg",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855282482

Ascorbic acid treatment resulted in a relatively high degree of carbonyl content and extensive degradation of β-glucan, even in concentrations typically found in foods. The thermal oxidation of the β-glucan was considerable at 120 °C in a β-glucan solution with co-extracted compounds from oat ingredient, and in the highly purified solutions in presence of ferrous ions. Oxidation also probably contributed to the molecular properties during high pressure homogenisation, even thou the main degradation mechanism is the hydrolysis caused by mechanical energy.

It makes comparisons and generalisations through processing a wide range of data quoted from the literature. As the first step, the topicality of the issue is justified by illustrating the role of fossil fuels in the energy supply of the more remote future with forecast data. During the technological development of power plants in the last 50 years, block capacity has increased considerably, 5-8 times, with thermal capacity increasing by 50-60%, as a result of which specific carbon dioxide release has decreased by 30-40%. The paper briefly refers to the theoretical possibility of the sequestration of the carbon dioxide captured from flue gases in geological formations. The enhancing effects of the implementation of CO2 capture on investment costs and its reducing effect on net power plant output and utilization (thermal) efficiency are also analysed in the paper. The efficiency of CO2 capture and the parameters of atmospheric carbon dioxide emission are also given attached to fuel types and technological solutions.

State-of-the-art tools that schedule software tasks to hardware resources face limitations: (1) either they do not take into account the interdependancies among processing, memory and communica- tion constraints (2) or they decouple the problem of spatial assignment from temporal scheduling. As a result existing tools make sub-optimal spatio-temporal scheduling decisions. This paper presents a technique to find globally optimized solutions by co-exploring spatio-temporal schedules for computation, data storage and communication simultaneously, considering the inter-dependencies between them. Experiments on mapping exploration of an image processing application on a heterogeneous MPSoC platform show that this co-exploration methodology finds schedules that are more energy efficient, when compared to decoupled exploration techniques for the particular application and target platform. ©2012 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Image processing; Multiprocessing systems; Scheduling; System-on-chip; Systems analysis; Exploration techniques; Hardware resources; Heterogeneous mpsoc; Image processing applications; Inter-dependencies; Memory hierarchy; Optimized solutions; Scheduling decisions; Multitasking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088182964

During the last years, there have been many growing interests towards the development of small satellites. Using these miniaturized systems as a cooperating network allows cost saving and a short development period. However, these systems present the drawback of energy management which is the most important problem to care about. Therefore, the optimization of the processing time and the efficient implementation of the information flow and storage on board must be discussed with respect to the quick topology changes. In this paper, we discuss the use of a network of Pico-satellites with distributed tasks instead of one big satellite to get a fault-tolerant and a robust system, this will be helpful for cost saves and development time reducing. Thus, we have to consider an intelligent system able to achieve several space missions such as attitude control, telemetry and communication. So, we present as a first step different routing algorithms used in small satellites and terrestrial networks. In addition, we present the proposed simulation system which is based on satellite position prediction, satellites tracking software and the use of a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) as an intelligent technique for information assignment. As a result, the simulation shows the importance of the use of intelligent techniques in space application due to the complicated environment and the lack of energy sources compared to the earth networks. In deed, The PSO solution avoids the use of one satellite in a critical state and generates a good quality of service when big data traffic in the network occurs, that is because of sharing and distributing the whole traffic process. This solution allows the sustainability of the network and a better Quality of service.","Data routing; Pico satellites network; Position track and determination; PSO; Satellites ground stations networks; Small satellite; Space communication system","Attitude control; Bit error rate; Communication satellites; Computer software; Critical current density (superconductivity); Digital storage; Earth (planet); Intelligent systems; Network routing; Orbits; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quality of service; Sustainable development; Tracking (position); Bit error rate (BER) performance; Data routing; Efficient implementation; Intelligent techniques; Low earth orbit satellites; Position track and determination; Space communication systems; Wireless connectivities; Small satellites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088181490

Due to the high variability present in the applications workload executed by these devices, this management should be executed dynamically. The use of traditional dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques proved to be useful in several scenarios to save energy. Nonetheless, due to technology scaling that limits the voltage variation and slow response of the DVFS schemes, the use of such technique may become inadequate. As alternative, the use of dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) may provide a good trade-off between power savings and power overhead. This paper proposes a distributed DFS scheme for NoC-based MPSoCs. Both NoC and PEs have an individual controlling scheme. The DFS scheme for PEs takes into account its computation and communication load to dynamically change the operating frequency. In the NoC, the DFS controller uses packet information to decide the router operating frequency. Real and synthetic applications were used to evaluate the proposed scheme. Results show that the number of executed instructions is reduced up to 41%, with an execution time overhead up to 18%. The power dissipation is reduced in PEs up to 26% and in the NoC up to 76%. ©2012 IEEE.","DFS; MPSoC; NoC; Power management","Buffer storage; Dynamic frequency scaling; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Multiprocessing systems; Power management; Routers; Systems analysis; Voltage scaling; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Executed instructions; Low energy consumption; MPSoC; Operating frequency; Power consumption reduction; Power management techniques; Synthetic application; Network-on-chip",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087246018

In this scenario, hybrid bus, that combines two or more distinct propulsion systems (generally combustion engine and electric motor), has been seen as a choice that balances both the need for better environmental and efficiency performance and capital expenditures for introducing new technology based transit bus fleets. The source of better performance of hybrid buses is the ability to i) optimize the operating point of combustion engine to achieve best fuel economy; ii) store energy generated during braking at storage devices (batteries, supercapacitors or flywheels), to be used to power the vehicle when needed, and, hence, iii) downsizing engine due to reduced average power requirements. Most significant gains in efficiency and environmental performance of hybrid vehicles are achieved during starting and stopping regimes, what makes them suitable to be used in congested areas, typical of transit routes. Regarding system design, three main architectures can be used for commercial vehicles: i) serial hybrid, in which combustion engine has no mechanical connection to the driving gear, with the vehicle being driven solely by an electric motor; ii) parallel hybrid, in which the combustion engine and electric motor are both mechanically connected to the wheels, a configuration suitable to less congested regimes, where combustion engine can be tuned to work in its most efficient range; and iii) dual hybrid, in which an engine and two electric motors, with complex planetary gear arrangements, make possible a continuously variable transmission through two parallel routes: electrical and mechanical. This complex design provides freedom in managing engine speed and torque versus vehicle speed and power demand. On a cost perspective, the ""Achilles Heel"" of hybrid technology, much has to be done, since costs of energy storage devices and electronic components still remain an issue in near and medium term. In transit application, however, since intensive use maximizes hybrid benefits over traditional bus configuration, the expectation is that regulatory measures, like correctly pricing diesel fuel and incentives to hybrid fleets at early market introduction, can make the technology competitive and economically viable. Brazil, one of the largest transit bus markets, is debuting this technology, with some on going field trials and an announcement of a hybrid bus fleet in the city of Curitiba, State of Paraná, with an order of 60 local made hybrid buses for delivery expected from 2012. This study presents the state of art hybrid bus technologies available worldwide, and, whenever possible, their operational results, with a special focus on Brazilian market, its structure and policies available to make this technology come true.

In Europe, the manufactures have the compromise to reduce their fleet consumption steadily and, in Brazil, a still voluntary but growing labeling program makes the vehicular energetic efficiency one of the main concerns during the concept phase. Different from the full hybrid technology, where the car can be driven purely by the electric motor, the mild hybrid has been mentioned in literature as cost-effective route to reduce CO2 emissions through the combination of a highly responsive low power electric motor, which acts supporting the internal combustion engine in special driving situations, with energy recovery and storage system composed of advanced batteries. Therefore the mild hybrid system can be understood as one type of downsizing strategy. In Brazil the tax reduction policy for 1.0 vehicle makes this strategy attractive to improve vehicular performance and reduce fuel consumption. The objective of this work was therefore the evaluation via simulation software of the potential of this technology applied on a typical popular vehicle in terms of performance and fuel consumption and CO2 emission reduction.

The phase change material is a eutectic solution. The PCM permits to keep the refrigerator compartment temperature quasi constant during the extended shutdown of the compressor. We use the finite volume method (FVM) as a numerical approach to address the conservation equations. The Phase change is simulated using the enthalpy method. Our goal is to simulate-through a mathematical modeling of the phase change Kinetics phenomena in the PCM-the operating regime of the refrigerator. The model validity will be provided by the consistency of the numerical solution of the solidification phenomena, with the experimental results obtained in the laboratory. This comparison is made according to the start and the switch off sequences of the compressor, controlled by the temperature at the thermostat, which is located on the lateral side of the aluminum shell containing the PCM. The use of a PCM is a way of decreasing the cost of the photovoltaic systems by opting for a thermal storage cooling instead of electric storage batteries. It is also a way of minimizing the electrical consumption by reducing the operating time of the compressor. © 2012, Begell House Inc.

This means that to avoid catastrophic global warming and maintain the habitability of Earth by protecting essential soil and water resources, we will need to not only reduce emissions, but also increase carbon storage in the land system. Biosequestration and Ecological Diversity: Mitigating and Adapting to Climate Change and Environmental Degradation discusses ways to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and build soil by changing the way people use and manage land. Principles and Practices for Better Land Management Examining biosequestration in social, economic, and political context, the book reviews recent scientific evidence on climate change and global ecological degradation and explains how the carbon cycle has been transformed by destructive land use practices, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. It describes the principles of biosequestration and restorative land management practices and discusses the potential of carbon storage. The author offers specific examples of inexpensive, proven practices that build soil, protect scarce water resources, and enhance ecological diversity. He also identifies conservation policies that provide technical assistance and financial resources for ecological protection and restoration.

Mainly of the energy is in the form of heat and light, which can be collected and used for generating electricity, as well as for heating, cooling and lighting building. Electric utility companies are using mirrors to concentrate heat from the sun to produce environmentally friendly electricity for cities. This abundance of solar energy makes Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants an attractive alternative to traditional power plants, which burn polluting fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Unlike traditional power plants, CSP systems provide an environmentally kind source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight.

It is found that the combined effect of the angular distribution of the radiation from the containers and their arrangement scheme makes it possible to replace massive transport gates with a sluice system.

The scientific methodology of the presented knowledge relies on simulation models validated by real-world tank-to-wheel emission and energy measurements performed in urban and extra urban areas as well as on freeways. Furthermore, an overview of the recent development of energy storage systems, energy converters, and powertrains in developed regions is given. Based on a statistically average European passenger car, fuel and energy consumption of conventional diesel, gasoline hybrid, fuel cell, and battery electric powertrains are compared. Special focus is given to the real-world energy consumption of the vehicles. This means auxiliary power units of the car such as onboard electronics, safety systems, heating, and air conditioning have significant influence on the fuel consumption, especially in driving conditions with lower speeds. The results show that for typical real-world operational conditions during the seasons of a whole year the hybrid vehicle and, with some limitations in the range of operation, fuel cell vehicle are comparable to the usability of a conventional vehicle. Battery electric vehicles (BEV) have very limited range. For the consistent comparison of propulsion systems with such different energy carriers, like liquid fuels, gaseous hydrogen, and electric power, the energy consumption with respect to primary energy supply was carried out. Based on this approach, the distance related energy consumption of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles is somewhat favorable compared to the conventional vehicle. Battery electric vehicles consume significantly more energy due to inefficiencies in power production and transmission as well as charging and discharging losses. Nevertheless, cars with fuel cell and battery electric propulsion systems have the considerable benefit of local emissions-free driving. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd. 2012.

Perhaps the most familiar and the earliest commercial application of surface texturing is that of cylinder liner honing. For many years, the landing zone of thin-film magnetic storage disks was laser textured, and surface texturing is also being considered as a means for overcoming adhesion and stiction in micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Fundamental research work on various forms and shapes of surface texturing for tribological applications is carried out worldwide and various texturing techniques are employed in these studies, including abrasive blasting, ultrasonic machining, electrical discharge machining, ion beam texturing, vibrorolling, various etching techniques, and laser texturing. Of all the practical microsurface patterning methods, it seems that laser surface texturing (LST) offers the most promising concept. This is because the laser is extremely fast and allows short processing times; it is clean to the environment and provides excellent control of the shape and size of the texture, which allows realization of optimum designs. By controlling energy density, the laser can safely process hardened steels, ceramics, and polymers as well as crystalline structures. Indeed, LST is gaining more and more attention in the tribology community as is evident from the growing number of publications on this subject. LST produces a very large number of microdimples on the surface (see Figure 53.1), and each of these microdimples can serve either as a microhydrodynamic bearing in cases of full or mixed lubrication, a microreservoir for lubricant in cases of starved lubrication conditions, or a microtrap for wear debris in either lubricated or dry sliding. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Electric discharges; Ion beams; Magnetic film storage; Magnetic storage; MEMS; Tribology; Ultrasonic cutting; Commercial applications; Crystalline structure; Electrical discharge machining; Laser surface texturing; Mechanical components; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Tribological applications; Tribological properties; Laser beam machining",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976441993

This is also a requirement from the new paradigm of Quality by Design. For this increase in process understanding demand, the industry has started to collect increasingly amounts of new data from the process and the data itself is now of different types, particularly with the introduction of PAT tools. These tools that are able to collect complex data (NIRS, 2D-Fluorescence, dielectric spectroscopy, etc.) pose challenges for the data organization, structuring, accessibility, prioritization and knowledge extraction. In fact, without these challenges solved, the amount and type of data collected can reveal to be a considerable investment and irrelevant for practical use. If data is not systematically and automatically organized (presuming that it is being automatically gathered), making sense of it can become an unreasonably time-consuming activity. Diagnostic and troubleshooting efforts are lost in the data matrix complexity and energy is spent in the organization of the data in the context of the production process. Also, this lack of structure and organization also poses barriers to the implementation of prediction and MSPC models across the entire cascade of process steps (from raw-materials to end product). To perform true whole-process analysis across the entire process and process life-cycle in the lights of the new guidelines and regulatory demands, this issue needs to be solve with new tools that enable the shift of energy from data organization to the more useful process understanding and process knowledge sphere with a true system engineering environment. Therefore a new tool that provides a solution to the industry to tackle these problems is needed. This tool should allow the organization and storage (with proper structure) of different types of data: Process data (temperatures, pressures, flow rates, etc.), PAT fingerprint data (NIR. MIR, 2D-Fluorescence, etc.), LIMS data and in-line monitoring data. These data have to be added in real-time or be a part of an historical database of the process enabling fast monitoring and diagnosis of the process or historical analysis of previous runs. The necessary graphical instruments are also required in this tool to enable quick and intuitive visualization of the data according to its type (single plots, landscapes, etc.). Comparison of data should also be possible in this graphical interface that takes the previous automatic organization of data and allows easy evaluation of different data types, from different process steps (ex: unit operations) at different time steps or from different runs. This should prove very useful when performing root-cause analysis and assessing cause & effect on the process. Many of the data being gathered from pharmaceutical production process is used (or could be used) to predict production quality, control the process, diagnose performance, assist in real time release, etc. This is especially true since the introduction of PAT tools that can extract increasingly more informative data from the process. By applying modeling techniques to these data (PAT data, process data, etc.) more process understanding and control can be implemented. For these reasons, this tool should support an easy integration of inline prediction models, calibrations, MSPC, etc. from third-party software. In fact, by having this feature, the user has the chance to improve its models in accuracy and robustness by taking advantage of the organization and accessibility of all the data that ultimately leads to a greater process understanding. The importance of fast sharing of information and findings is an increasing necessity in the industry when knowledge-based decisions often have to be taken with haste but also truthful. In this context, a new tool has to support mechanisms to share the information found (through normal channels such as email, PDF, etc.) and also to store it (with systems like dropbox, database storage or similar). In order to exemplify the above-mentioned needs and the advantages of such tool in the pharmaceutical industry, it is intended to present iSEE™ (Systems Engineering Environment interface) in the context of a case study with data from a bio-production pharmaceutical process.",,"Competition; Data visualization; Digital storage; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Information dissemination; Investments; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Life cycle; Monitoring; Packaging; Quality control; Sustainable development; Systems engineering; Transportation; Different time steps; Engineering environment; Monitoring and diagnosis; Organization of datum; Pharmaceutical industry; Pharmaceutical process; Pharmaceutical production; Process understanding; Process control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968752844

Complete feed meals for animal feeding have to fully meet the nutritional needs of certain types and categories of animals. The energy level of a feed meal can be achieved by adding appropriate amounts of fat and grains. In the production of feed, in relation to other cereals, corn is the leader due to its high energy (about 16 MJ/kg) and starch and low fiber content. In comparison to other cereals, corn is attributed with the best digestibility and taste. Before drying and storage, in the technological process of either trade or seed corn cleaning, significant quantity of broken grains is separated.

The NWPA requires DOE to remove spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants, in exchange for a fee, and transport it to a permanent geologic repository or an interim storage facility before permanent disposal. Defense-related high-level waste is to go into the same repository. In order to achieve this goal, and in an effort to mitigate the political difficulties of imposing a federal nuclear waste facility on a single community, Congress attempted to establish an objective, scientifically based multi-stage statutory process for selecting the eventual site of the nation's new permanent geologic repository. Congress amended the NWPA's site selection process in 1987, however, and designated Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as the sole candidate site for the repository by terminating site specific activities at all other candidate sites. The Obama Administration, in conjunction with DOE, has taken three important steps directed toward terminating the Yucca Mountain project. First, the Administration's FY2011 budget proposal eliminated all funding for the Yucca Mountain project. Second, the President and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu established a Blue Ribbon Commission to consider alternative solutions to the nation's nuclear waste challenge. Third, and most controversial, DOE has attempted to terminate the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding by seeking to withdraw the license application for the Yucca Mountain facility. DOE's withdrawal motion triggered strong opposition from a number of concerned parties. The states of Washington and South Carolina-each awaiting cleanup and removal of defense-related nuclear waste at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites, respectively-have played significant roles in the legal challenge to the license withdrawal. Claims challenging the Secretary's authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application were filed with both the NRC and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit). Controversy over the Yucca Mountain license application intensified in October 2010, when NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko directed NRC staff to use funds appropriated under the FY2011 continuing resolution to close down the agency's review of the Yucca Mountain license application. While the result of the ongoing dispute over the legality of the attempted termination of the Yucca Mountain program remains uncertain, the change of control in the House of Representatives could have a significant impact on the fate of the Yucca Mountain facility. A number of leading House Republicans have voiced strong opposition to shutting down the Yucca Mountain facility. Consequently, the Yucca Mountain dispute may not only be played out before the NRC and the D.C. Circuit, but also in the House of Representatives, in the form of appropriations disputes and oversight hearings. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Significant incentives for new commercial reactors were included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05, P.L. 109-58). These include production tax credits, loan guarantees, insurance against regulatory delays, and extension of the Price-Anderson Act nuclear liability system. Together with volatile fossil fuel prices and the possibility of greenhouse gas controls, the federal incentives for nuclear power helped spur renewed interest by utilities and other potential reactor developers. Plans for as many as 31 reactor license applications have been announced, although only a handful of those projects currently appear to be moving toward construction. The earthquake and resulting tsunami that severely damaged Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on March 11, 2011, raised questions in Congress about the accident's possible implications for nuclear safety regulation, U.S. nuclear energy expansion, and radioactive waste policy. The tsunami blacked out all electric power at the six-reactor plant, resulting in the overheating of several reactor cores and spent fuel storage pools, major hydrogen explosions, and releases of radioactive material to the environment. Several House and Senate hearings have been held on the accident, and several bills on nuclear safety have been introduced. In his January 2011 State of the Union Address, President Obama called for nuclear power to be included in a national goal of generating 80% of U.S. electricity ""from clean energy sources"" by 2035. Financing for new reactors is widely considered to depend on the loan guarantees authorized by EPACT05 Title XVII, administered by the Department of Energy (DOE). The total amount of loan guarantees to be provided to nuclear power projects has been a continuing congressional issue. Nuclear power plants are currently allocated $18.5 billion in loan guarantees, enough for three or four reactors. President Obama's FY2012 budget request would nearly triple the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants, to $54.5 billion. However, opponents of nuclear power contend that the Administration's proposed increases in nuclear loan guarantees would provide an unjustifiable subsidy to a mature industry and shift investment away from renewable energy and efficiency technologies. DOE's nuclear energy research and development program includes advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology and facilities, and infrastructure support. The Obama Administration requested $824.1 million in FY2011 and received $732.1 million. The Administration requested $754 million for FY2012. Congress has not yet taken final action on the FY2012 nuclear energy budget. Disposal of highly radioactive waste has been one of the most controversial aspects of nuclear power. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-425), as amended in 1987, required DOE to conduct a detailed physical characterization of Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a permanent underground repository for high-level waste. The Obama Administration decided to ""terminate the Yucca Mountain program while developing nuclear waste disposal alternatives,"" according to the DOE FY2010 budget justification. Alternatives to Yucca Mountain are being evaluated by a ""blue ribbon"" panel of experts convened by the Administration. No funding was provided for the Yucca Mountain project in FY2011, and DOE filed a motion with NRC to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010. However, the motion to withdraw has prompted substantial opposition, including lawsuits in federal court. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

At issue for Congress is the federal role in desalination research, demonstration and full-scale facilities, and regulatory requirements. Constraints on wider adoption include financial, environmental, regulatory issues and concerns. Desalination processes generally treat seawater or brackish water to produce a stream of freshwater, and a separate, saltier stream of water that has to be disposed (often called waste concentrate). Its attractions include creation of a new freshwater source from otherwise unusable waters, and its independence from precipitation, runoff, storage, and recharge. Many states (most notably Florida, California, and Texas) and cities are actively researching and investigating the feasibility of large-scale desalination plants for municipal water supplies. Coastal communities are increasingly considering desalinating seawater or estuarine water, while interior communities are looking to brackish aquifers. Some communities and industries are opting to treat contaminated water supplies with desalination technologies (e.g., membrane separation) to meet disposal requirements or to reuse the water (e.g., saline waters from oil and gas development). Desalination also is used for obtaining high-quality water for industrial processes. Desalination and its applications, however, come with risks and concerns. Although the costs of desalination dropped steadily in recent decades, making desalinated water more competitive with other supply augmentation options, the declining trend may not continue if energy costs rise. This creates a cost uncertainty for those contemplating desalination investments. Electricity expenses vary from one-third to one-half of the operating cost of many desalination facilities, and the energy intensity of desalination raises concerns about the greenhouse gas emissions emitted. Current desalination processes are already operating close to the theoretical minimum energy required. Therefore, significant improvements in facility-level energy efficiency are more likely to come from more energy efficient pretreatment of water before entering the desalination process and co-location with other facilities, such as power plants. Substantial uncertainty also remains about the technology's environmental impacts, in particular management of the saline waste concentrate and the effect of surface water intake facilities on aquatic organisms. Moreover, there are few federal health and environmental guidelines, regulations, and policies specific to desalination as a municipal water supply source. This creates uncertainty regarding the cost and time required for regulatory compliance. Research and public education may help to resolve some uncertainties, mitigate impacts, reduce the costs, and improve public understanding. To date, the federal government has been involved primarily in desalination research and development (including for military applications), some demonstration projects, and select full-scale facilities. For the most part, local governments, sometimes with state-level involvement, are responsible for planning, testing, building, and operating desalination facilities, similar to their responsibility for freshwater treatment for municipal drinking water supplies. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 2664, Reauthorization of Water Desalination Act of 2011, would reauthorize a Department of the Interior program (expiring in 2011) carried out by the Bureau of Reclamation for desalination demonstration and outreach. Bills in the 111th Congress (e.g., H.R. 88, H.R. 469, H.R. 1145, S. 1462, S. 1731, S. 1733, and P.L. 111-11) represented a range of federal authorizations for desalination research and its coordination, demonstration and full-scale facilities, and planning and financing. While interest in desalination persists among some Members, efforts to expand federal activities and investment may face greater challenges in the near term due to the domestic fiscal climate and differing views on federal roles and priorities. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946838181

Hospitals in Scandinavia also have a building envelope with large facades and glass for daylight and outside views. These factors, combined with high ventilation airflow rates and long occupancy schedules, make hospitals the most energy intensive of all building types. Ground source heat pumps can deliver both heating and cooling to such buildings, but their cold-climate performance will be much reduced without a well-designed energy collection and storage strategy. Improper dimensioning can lead to permafrost and much reduced ground source effectiveness. The timing of heating and cooling demands can also lead to reduced effectiveness due to higher return temperatures and increased compressor work. The authors show how these challenges can be converted into a cold climate advantage through the use of a seasonal energy balancing technique and integrating hybrid heat sources into the storage strategy. The authors also define a new metric for quantifying the overall energy performance of investing in increased storage capacity at different timescales. This metric is then used in case studies of actual buildings in Norway to compare several cold-climate thermal storage and free-cooling strategies. The energy balance method allows the HVAC designer to quickly evaluate different hybridization strategies to leverage both ""free-heating"" from the internal heat gains and free-cooling from the target climate without the need for a detailed thermal model. This approach will help to determine the cost-effectiveness of various hybrid heat sources and storage mass, and to reduce the number of costly ground source boreholes. The approach described in this paper may have cold-climate applications to other building types with large internal process heat gains. © 2012 ASHRAE.",,"Air conditioning; Buildings; Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Energy balance; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Hospitals; Medical imaging; Permafrost; Building envelopes; Diagnostic imaging; Energy balance method; Energy collection; Energy performance; Energy-balancing; Heating and cooling; Storage capacity; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938833811

Phenolic compounds, natural vitamins A, E and β-carotene materials have been used as antioxidants. Samples were subjected to accelerated oxidation. There are defined organoleptic properties, as well as acid and peroxide numbers and malonic dialdehyde content in the samples. It has been shown that antioxidants exercise an inhibitory effect on the formation of peroxides. The effect of antioxidant action depends on the number of introduced additives.

Concerning the origin of fungi contamination the following sources exist: contamination from the warehouse or silo dispersion, the predominant fungi is Aspergilius and Penicillium, contamination remaining from the field before harvest with: Clamidosporium, Fusarium, Mucor, Rizopus and advanced alteration, which associates more rare types in remanent contamination. In this paper, the influence of storage conditions on the fungi growth and mycotoxins production in cereals was studied. Cereal samples (wheat, maize, barley and oats) collected from warehouse, individual silos and storage cells from the west side of Romania were analysed. The cereals were sampled from private producers, who reported the information regarding storage conditions. The storage period ranged between 6 months and over 1 year. The main measures of conditioning applied to samples before storage were related to: drying, pest removal, aeration and cleaning. Also, the main parameters (temperature, humidity, ventilation) during the storage were monitored in order to preventthe toxins production. The method used for fungal species with mycotoxigen potential identification was microbiological assay. The experimental results indicated that the fungus species isolated and identified were Aspergillus (flavus and terreus, Fusarium roseum, Penicillium sp., Chaetomium sp. and Cladosporium sp. The most frequent Fusarium fungal species in cereal samples were identified F. culmorum, DON mycotoxin producers, F. subglutinans, fumonisin producers and F. acuminatum, non mycotoxin producer. Fusarium species was identified in 45 % maize samples, 25% wheat samples, 100% triticale and barley samples and 0% in oats samples. In order to avoid the production of mycotoxins after harvest, it is advisable to dry the grain and bring to optimum moisture retention, less than 14%. Also, post-harvest contamination can be avoided by monitoring and keeping optimal grain storage conditions.","Cereals; Fungi; Harvest; Storage","Contamination; Energy storage; Fungi; Grain (agricultural product); Harvesting; Warehouses; Cereals; Fungal contamination; Fungi production; Fusarium species; Microbiological assays; Moisture retention; Storage condition; Storage periods; Food storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926059906

A shortcoming of this method is a reduction of SV during postharvest wheat storage. We studied the dynamics of SV reduction in 15 NS wheat cultivars differing in technological quality. A series of experiments was performed to establish changes in SV depending on the length of wheat storage at room temperature in laboratory. Wheat samples, taken at one-month intervals, were tested for SV (Zeleny test) for one year. The average SV ranged from 20 to 40 mL. The samples with high initial SV generally had a high intensity of SV decline, especially during the last three months of storage. Linear regression showed a significant linear decrease in SV of 0.7 mL per month during the one-year storage period.","Sedimentation value; Storage; Wheat; Zeleny test","Energy storage; Sedimentation; High intensity; Linear decrease; Room temperature; Storage periods; Technological qualities; Wheat; Wheat cultivars; Wheat quality; Food storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926050644

One of postharvest treatments used for reducing of chilling injuries is the heat treatment in water or in the air flow. In order to investigate influence of heat treatment in water on properties of tomato stored at low temperature (4°C) during three weeks, commercia l tomato was harvested at mature green and red-ripe stages. Tomato harvested in mature green stage was treated in water at 42°C for 1 h. Samples of treated and non treated to mato harvested in mature green stage, as well as sample of non treated tomato harvested in red-ripe stage were stored at 4°C. Tomato ripening was monitored once a week by instrumental measurement of fruit color using Minolta Chroma Meter CR-400. After three weeks of cold storage, all tomato samples were evaluated by sensory panel consisting of 10 trained assessors. Differences between treated and non treated tomato samples were observed and compared with properties of red-ripe harvested tomato. It was concluded that heat treatment in water of 42°C for 1 h results in less chilling injuries, delayed but more uniform development of red color, less presence of vessels, and lower intensity of non-characteristic odor and taste.","Color; Heat treatment; Ripening; Sensory evaluation; Storage; Tomato","Cold storage; Color; Energy storage; Fruits; Harvesting; Heat treatment; Low temperature engineering; Low temperature operations; Temperature; Water quality; Water treatment; Chilling injury; Instrumental measurements; Low temperatures; Post-harvest storage; Post-harvest treatments; Ripening; Sensory evaluation; Tomato; Food storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926016856

The principal components of this system are a serpentine pipe, a storage tank and an auxiliary heating source, e.g. a gas burner or an electric resistance heater. The serpentine pipe can be placed inside roof slabs, concrete pavements or walls. A numerical code based on the finite volume method has been developed in order to solve transient three-dimensional heat conduction in the concrete element with the serpentine pipe inside. Heat transfer at the exposed surface of the concrete element is described with a mixed convection-radiation boundary condition. The numerical simulations gave the following results: water temperatures throughout the serpentine pipe, storage tank temperatures and efficiency of the solar concrete collector heating system. It has been seen that the serpentine pipe can heat water up to 40-50 °C while the heat storage tank reaches temperatures of 30-40 °C during the summer period. The average May to September efficiency (i.e. solar fraction) is 50-70% in Rijeka (Croatia), meaning that less than half the energy demand is supplied by the auxiliary heating source. Several parameters influencing the efficiency of solar concrete collector systems are studied: pipe spacing, pipe length, pipe depth, solar absorptance and tilt angle of the concrete element. For example, the spacing between pipe bends should be at least 15 cm to avoid pipe-to-pipe thermal influence.","Domestic hot water; Finite volume method; Solar concrete collector; Solar energy","Concretes; Finite volume method; Heat conduction; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Hot water heating; Numerical methods; Serpentine; Solar energy; Tanks (containers); Water; Domestic hot water; Domestic-hot water heating systems; Electric resistance heaters; Heat storage tanks; Principal Components; Radiation boundary condition; Solar concrete collector; Storage tank temperature; Collector efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919417779

Neuropeptides show a more protracted transmission than classic neurotransmitters, are highly plastic and responsive to circumstance, modulate classic neurotransmitter systems, and exert trophic effects (Hökfelt et al. 2000). Neuropeptides are ubiquitously distributed and most often associated with one or more classic neurotransmitters, sustaining the notion of their modulatory functions. They control our mood, energy levels, pain and pleasure reception, body weight, and ability to solve problems; they also form memories and regulate our immune system.

Although the option which offers higher values of IRR and NPV was renting a FSRU, this option was rejected, due to the value of the discounted payback period, which is > 3 yr, and it is supposed that after 2015, the Rafael Urdaneta project will be operating, supplying NG that Zulia needs.

The experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN are facing the challenge to record, process and give access to tens of PetaBytes (PB) of data produced during the proton-proton and heavy ion collisions at the LHC (15PetaBytes/year of raw data alone). To accomplish this task and to enable early delivery of physics results, the LHC experiments are using the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) infrastructure of distributed computational and storage facilities provided by more than 140 centers. Since the first centers joined WLCG in 2002, the infrastructure had been gradually built up, upgraded and stress-tested. As a result, when the LHC started delivering beams in late 2009, the WLCG was fully ready and capable to store, process and allow the physicists to analyze this data. The architecture of WLCG follows a hierarchical system of sites classified according to a ""Tier"" taxonomy. There is 1 Tier-0 (CERN), 11 Tier-1s and about 130 Tier-2s spread over 5 continents. We will briefly summarize the experience and performance of the WLCG distributed data management system during the first two years of data taking. We will demonstrate the irreplaceable role of the WLCG Tier-2 sites as concerns providing the compute and storage resources and operation services. As an example, we will present the contribution of the WLCG Tier-2 site in Prague, Czech Republic to the overall WLCG Tier-2s operations. © Copyright owned by the author(s).",,"Colliding beam accelerators; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Heavy ions; Hierarchical systems; Data management system; Distributed data managements; Heavy ion collision; Large Hadron collider LHC; LHC computing grids; Operation services; Prague , Czech Republic; Storage facilities; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902582955

The synthesis, characterization and study of materials with a very high or giant dielectric constant are in particular important and have been studied by many investigators. Then the search for high dielectric materials has been driven, which must requires some special properties such as to keep dielectric constant almost independent of temperature and frequency and low dielectric loss. In recent years many material systems have been searched, including perovskite and others, aiming to achieve a reliable material for practical applications. In this chapter we review many classes of materials including titanates, nickeletes, cuprates, multiferroics and composites such as cermets, ceramic/polymer and ceramic/ceramic. To the end of this work is presented the most important models in the literature to explain mechanism for giant dielectric constant.

There is a strong worldwide effort to use the high temperature superconductors in these applications. The aim of our work is to build a self-contained coil without coil frame by resin impregnation. In addition, impregnation is necessary for conduction-cooled systems. In this article, we present the properties of three superconducting coils made from YBCO coated conductor. These coils have identical inner diameter and number of turns while the thicknesses of windings are slightly different. Their inner diameter is 60 mm and they have 10 turns. The coils were impregnated using different resins and technologies of impregnation. Coils were characterized in the liquid nitrogen bath and their parameters like the critical currents, E(I) characteristics, inductances and AC losses at frequencies 36 Hz, 72 Hz and 144 Hz were compared. In conclusion, none of the impregnation techniques disqualifies the coils for AC applications.

An internal or external cooling system for enormous heat release must be used in the event of emergency situations associated with loss of coolant outside the primary cooling circuit (the loss-of-coolant accident - LOCA). Steam produced from the cooling water on the basis of pressure changes between the primary circuit and open space close to the pipeline defect (or another part of the primary circuit) fills up empty surroundings. The raising volume of produced steam may cause the pressure increase in the containment which means the risk of its failure. One of the used passive cooling systems applied directly in the containment is an ice condenser. The ice condenser is designed for melting of contained ice when produced steam flows through it and condenses. The ice phase change from solid to liquid state provides a storage capacity for the released heat and also decrease of the pressure from produced steam. Worldwide, 13 such ice condensers within nuclear power plants operate (two in Japan, two in Finland and nine in the U.S.). Application of ice as the condensing material allows reducing the overall size of the containment, which means smaller built-up area and lower investment costs for construction. However, keeping water in the solid state is associated with demands for higher operating costs and overall complexity of the cooling system. The possible ice replacement, as a heat storage material, would clearly reduce operating costs and simplify the reactor system required maintenance. Materials capable accumulating heat from the steam must be selected according to strict requirements for absolute stability and nuclear safety (i.e. without any risk of corrosion of structural materials, explosive reaction, toxicity, flammability or degradation). A simple model of the material replacement based on computational simulation was carried out. The model evaluates the ice replacement by two types of paraffin with the melting temperature markedly above the water freezing point. The model compares the rate of melting for water and paraffin on the time scale and analyzes the increase of the temperature during and after the melting within these phase changing materials.","Containment; Energy storage; Ice condenser; Nuclear safety; Phase change","Coolants; Cooling systems; Electrical engineering; Energy storage; Heat storage; Loss of coolant accidents; Melting; Nuclear power plants; Operating costs; Paraffins; Pressurized water reactors; Safety engineering; Steam; Thermoelectric equipment; Computational simulation; Containment; External cooling systems; Heat storage materials; Nuclear safety; Phase Change; Phase changing materials; Radioactive substances; Ice",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899024787

It was clear that FES-cycling efficiency increases when the spring constant increases, then the pedal, spring and the overall powers were calculated, and it appears that by leaning the spring position the overall power will be always positive, and the spring absorbs the exceeded pedal energy and releases it when the pedal power is negative.

Radiant-floor heat is commonly designed for residential applications, where ventilation requirements are often met by operable windows, and cooling is not mandatory. Other applications include large open buildings, such as airplane hangars, where providing heat at the floor is much more cost-effective than heating the entire volume of air in the space. Water in the radiant-floor loop is often around [45C°], depending on the floor finish. This is a lower temperature than forced hot-air systems, and reduces the energy required to heat the building. Buildings that have high ceilings, large windows, or high infiltration rates or that require high air change rates can save additional energy by using radiant-floor heat. This research deals with the problems arising from the floor heating solar systems execution in concern with (large size of the storage tank and high cost of Constituent .etc) The studied room exists in renewable energy lab in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Faculty-Damascus University.

Such electrochemical systems represent a prospective alternative to fossil fuel dependence since the photovoltaic technology may be combined with an electrolysis system to produce hydrogen. The major advantage of this approach is that energy capture, conversion and storage are combined in a single system. The working principle of PEC cells consists of two electrodes, a photoactive semiconductor material and a Pt-wire counter-electrode, both immersed in an electrolyte solution. Nowadays, much of the research efforts are focused on solving the two main issues related to the photoelectrode materials, i.e. efficiency and stability, giving less attention to the technological problems.

Non-oxidant processes pyrolysis based were conducted both at laboratory and pilot scale aiming for product complete neutralization with respect to pathogen germs, bio-degradation and medium-long term storage risk. The results of the study represent alternatives to currently used disposal solutions mainly based on incineration. For the experimental analysis three main waste types were considered: primary stage processing meat industry (feathers), second stage processing meat industry (bones). Noticeable quantities of organic residues such as feather, bone meal, blood and offal waste are generated by poultry processing industries. These residues making up about 25% to 37% of initial product body weight are a considerable waste of the meat processing industry, due to high specific volume, being produced about million tons per year world-wide. Disposal of chicken meat processing industry is a major concern and accumulation of important waste quantities results in environmental pollution of soil, water and air with direct impact on human health. Depending on processing costs the industry sector uses the incineration (usually provided by specialized companies) or the production of meat and bone meal. To limit the risk of disease transmission via feed and food chain the recovery of organic materials for animal feed is banned. The incineration presents the major disadvantage of important energy consumption due high water content of the product together with polluting emissions and low efficiency if energy recovery is used. For the incineration process support fuel is required due to low combustibility properties of the product. With respect to landfiling the products are considered as difficult substrates for anaerobic digestion because of their high protein and lipid content which are inhibitory for the process. The research focused on the influence of thermal treatment process parameters on product neutralization efficiency and pyrolysis by-products physical-chemical characteristics with respect to energy potential recovery. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897050566

Among all emission reduction methods CCS (carbon dioxide capture and geological sequestration) is the only available tool that can immediately produce dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, without drastically restructuring energy production. A major disadvantage however is the high cost of the activity. Therefore, all cost reducing opportunities must be exploited. The most direct way to obtain physical and geometric information about subsurface formations is using well bores.

However, the recovery of the total H2 content is not feasible and a part of it remains in the retentate side. The requirement for upstream high pressure operation of the necessary reforming step has a drawback: complete reforming of the CH4 is not allowed; thus small but significant amounts of it remain in the rich CO2 stream. These CH4 amounts not only affect the efficiency of the process but also are against regulations for the allowed composition of carbon dioxide for storage. Therefore an efficient purification step before its compression is of high importance. This work models a cryogenic method for combustibles separation from a rich-CO2 stream and evaluates its effects on pre-combustion carbon capture systems' efficiency. The modeling study is performed in AspenPlusTM. An investigation of the operating parameters is presented as well as how other parameters of the Purification & Compression Unit (PCU) affect performance.","ATR; CO2 purification; Cryogenic separation; Hydrogen production; WGS membrane reactor","Bioreactors; Cryogenics; Efficiency; Energy conversion; Hydrogen production; Methane; Purification; Water gas shift; ATR; Cryogenic separation; High pressure operations; Membrane reactor; Methane reforming; Operating parameters; Technology-based; Water gas shift reactors; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896534693

Unfortunately it has not been embraced by the power sector, partly because the most suitable mineral resources are found in central and northern Finland while most fossil-fuel fired electricity production is located in southern Finland. One interesting source-sink combination, however, is formed by the magnesium silicate resources at Vammala, located ~ 85 km east of the 565 MWe coal-fired Meri-Pori power plant on the country's southwest coast, producing 2.5 Mt/y CO2. Between 2008 and 2010 the companies Fortum and TVO considered retrofitting the Meri-Pori power plant with CCS. Due to absence of geological storage options within Finland, the CO2 would be shipped to the North Sea for injection into saline aquifers. The project was, however, discontinued. This paper assesses sequestration of Meri-Pori power plant CO2 by mineralisation, using the Vammala mineral resources and the mineralisation process under development at Åbo Akademi University. That process implies Mg(OH)2 production from magnesium silicate-based rock, followed by gas/solid carbonation of the Mg(OH)2 in a pressurised fluidised bed. Included here are results on experimental work, i.e Mg(OH)2 production, with rock material from locations close to Meri-Pori. Results suggest a total CO2 fixation capacity ~ 50 Mt CO2 for the Vammala site, although production of Mg(OH)2 from rock from the site is challenging as a result of varying magnesium silicate mineral types (serpentine, amphibole, pyroxene). Finally, as carbon dioxide mineralisation without CO2 precapture could be directly applied to flue gases that contain sulphur oxides, we report from experimental work where carbonation of Mg(OH)2 with CO2 is compared with CO2-SO2-O2 gas mixtures. Results show that SO2 readily reacts with Mg(OH)2, providing an opportunity to simultaneously capture SO2 and CO2. Ideally, this could make separate flue gas desulphurisation redundant.","Coal-fired power plant; Desulphurisation; Large-scale application","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide process; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal fueled furnaces; Desulfurization; Energy conversion; Flue gases; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuel power plants; Hydrogeology; Magnesium; Mineral resources; Mineralogy; Serpentine; Silicates; Sulfur dioxide; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Coal-fired power plant; Desulphurisation; Electricity production; Flue gas desulphurisation; Large-scale applications; Magnesium silicate minerals; Mineral sequestration; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896522023

One of these CO2 sequestration routes involves as a first step the production of reactive Mg(OH)2 from Mg-silicates using recoverable ammonium sulfate (AS) salt. This route avoids the very slow kinetics of carbonating magnesium silicates. A recently identified Mg(OH)2 production process involves a closed loop, staged process of Mg extraction followed by Mg(OH)2 precipitation and reagent (AS) recovery. This process has been applied to different Mg-silicate (serpentinite and olivine rocks in particular) minerals from worldwide locations, having varying physical and chemical properties. Experimental results showed some dependence of Mg extraction and mass of the Mg(OH)2 product on the reaction parameters: mass ratio of Mg-silicate mineral (S) to AS salt reacted, reaction temperature (T) and time (t). This paper statistically evaluates the contribution of these effects and their interactions using a 2n-1 factorial experimental design. Both Mg(OH)2 production and carbonation were simulated using Aspen Plus® software while process heat integration was done by pinch analysis. Process energy evaluation, on an exergy basis, gives 3.88 GJ of energy requirement for 1t-CO2 sequestered (for Finnish serpentinite). This value is ~ 0.5 GJ/t-CO2 (10 % points) less than the energy requirement of the process in a previous model. The results of this analysis would be beneficial for optimization and pilot scale studies of this process.","Magnesium hydroxide; Mg-silicates; Process evaluation","Carbonation; Computer software; Energy conversion; Extraction; Sandwich structures; Silicate minerals; Weathering; Factorial experimental design; Magnesium hydroxide; Mg-silicates; Physical and chemical properties; Process Evaluation; Process heat integration; Reaction temperature; Technological process; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896518134

The accelerating development has been very substantial for techniques, methodologies and equipment for exploiting solar energy [1]. The integration of renewables into an energy system needs an approach that accounts for the variations in energy supply availability, as well as for those of the demands. Dynamic models could be used for modelling precisely is intermittency. They are usually employed to solve servo- and regulatory tasks in process control. Dynamic models have been used to model solar thermal plants [2-4], but only a few models have been dedicated to estimating available energy from solar sources [5] and they usually evaluate only a part of the whole capture system-e.g. the thermal storage [6]. However, dynamic models are unsuitable for design or long-horizon operational optimisation. In the present work, the Heat Integration [7] for batch processes based on Time Slices [8, 9] is extended to the integration of solar thermal energy with certain variations. The main steps involve partitioning the measured/forecasted heat availability profile using a large number of candidate time boundaries and then approximating it by a piecewise-constant profile using high-precision. The approximation profile is obtained by subjecting the candidate superset of time-boundaries to MILP optimisation thus minimising the integral inaccuracy. The integration of solar thermal energy can be performed for each Time Slice, after the optimal number of Time Slices has been selected with approximated constant load. Using heat storage, the heat can then be transferred between Time Slices.","Heat integration; Renewable availability curve; Solar thermal energy integration; Time slices; Variations of renewables","Batch data processing; Dynamic models; Energy conversion; Heat storage; Integer programming; Integration; Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermal energy; Heat integration; Renewable availability curve; Renewables; Solar thermal energy; Time slice; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896504738

This is due to the fact that those turbines are designed to operate in conditions where the mass flow rate directed to district heating heat exchangers varies from 0 to 90 percent. Such plants require an additional heat source to be installed to cover the heat consumption of the CO2 sorbent regeneration system. It is possible to build an additional power unit with a backpressure turbine to heat the sorbent up. However one must consider high costs of such an operation and must provide additional space for the installation. The paper presents an analysis of a CHP (Combined Heat and Power) plant with the increased steam flow rate by the amount needed for the sequestration process. Advantages of this solution would be an increased efficiency through increased blade length and higher heat power until integration with CO2 sequestration plant. Two variants are analyzed, one with a single lowpressure unit, second with two parallel connected LP units. In the second case, a possibility of removing one of the LP parts after integration with CO2 installation.

When food intake chronically exceeds the body's energy need, an efficient metabolism results in the storage of the excess energy as fat. Mitochondria are the main centre for energy production in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondrial proton cycling is responsible for a significant proportion of basal or standard metabolic rate, therefore, further uncoupling of mitochondria may be a good way to increase energy expenditure and hence represent a good pharmacological target for the treatment of obesity. This implies that, any chemical agent or photochemical compound that further uncouples the mitochondria in vivo without having any effect on mitochondria activity could be a potential target in finding treatment for obesity. In the past, uncoupling by 2, 4-dinitrophenol has been used this way with notable success.

Furthermore, the topside offloading process was modelled using HYSYS. The models were applied for case studies using parameters from the existing Snøhvit and Sleipner CO2 injection wells and reservoirs. The study quantified effects related to flow capacity (pump/compressor requirements and line sizing of the riser, pipeline and well), freezing, hydrate formation, phase change and heat transfer in the offloading and injection system. With an available injection pump discharge pressure of about 120 bar, the injection capacities were predicted to about 275 kg/s on Snøhvit and 400 kg/s on Sleipner when assuming 7' ' ID tubing size in the well and 700 m flowline length. In the base case scenario with a 700 m buried pipeline and injection temperature of -53°C (this storage temperature on the ship, at a pressure of 7-8 bar had been selected for optimum transport capacity) there is a high risk of unwanted hydrate formation and freezing in the formation and on the outer surface of the riser and pipeline. The bottomhole temperatures were predicted as low as -38 and -46°C on Snøhvit and Sleipner respectively when injecting at pump design rate, far beneath expected hydrate and freezing temperature of 10-12 °C and -1.9°C (in salt water) respectively. Thus heating, either by topside heat exchangers and/or by utilizing the warmer sea water (5°C) via a longer injection pipeline is required to avoid problems. An alternative storage condition at -20°C and 20 bar was proposed and simulated to reduce energy requirements due to heating and pressurization at the ship. The heating power was reduced by 18 MW while topside pumping power was reduced by 0.5 MW in this case. © 2012 The Authors.

However, it is very challenging to control the microgrid system that uses uncontrollable energy resources such as solar and wind for main generators of microgrid system because they have many advantages. From this point, the PV microgrid system is constructed and operated at School of Renewable Energy Technology (SERT), Naresuan University for research and development of the microgrid system that is supplying 50% of total electricity demand by PV main generator. By measuring the important parameters such as solar irradiance, PV array voltage, PV array current, and AC electrical power, these data were collected for a year from November 2008 to October 2009 to use in evaluation processes. The PV generator evaluation result is revealed that the average reference yield (Yr), array yield (YA), and final yield (Yf) are 5.21, 4.32, and 3.84 kWh/kWp day respectively. The average total loss of the PV generator is 26.27 % that comes from summing up the average capture losses (LC) 17.21 % and average system losses (LS) 9.06 %. The average overall PV plant efficiency (ηtot) is 10.41 %, and the average performance ratio (PR) is 73.45 %. For load analysis of the microgrid, the total load is 231673 kWh/year or 635 kWh/day that the main loads of the microgrid are the real load and the battery storage loss. For the real load, it varies from 9803 to 22506 kWh/month and the average real load is 15434 kWh/month. However, the battery storage loss is really constant at 3888 kWh/month. When consider the load profile, it shows that the peak load period is 8 A.M. to 7 P.M. and the off peak load periods are 0 A.M. to 8 A.M. and 7 P.M. to 0 A.M. Moreover, the load in peak load period of working day is higher than day off but the load in off peak load period is not different. When compare the load profile with PV generator production, the load is 100% supplied by PV generator during 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. in working day and 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. in day off.

The photostability is an important parameter to evaluate the demanded quality, security and effectiveness for the safe use of health products. Due to environmental conditions in which the product will be exposed, such as temperature, humidity and light during its marketing period, photostability tests are important to monitor the degradation reactions and to predict shelf life of the final product in normal storage conditions. The sun is the most important source of UV radiation, although visible and infrared light constitute the major fraction of the radiation reaching Earth's atmosphere. Artificial lights are also sources of UV radiation. Incandescent lamps, halogen lamps and fluorescent tubes are the most commonly used light sources in homes and work places. Incandescent lamps give practically no UV radiation, while halogen lamps operate at a higher temperature and give small fluence rates of UVA radiation. Fluorescent tubes contain mercury vapor which give a typical band spectrum showing two strong lines located at the UV region (λ = 254 and 313 nm) which are not completely filtered by the glass tube. Photochemical degradation can be an important factor in the stability of pharmaceuticals especially under exposure of high energy radiation such as the UV radiation. So, not only the drug photostability evaluation is an important step in this process, but also it is important to know and to quantify (i) the formed byproducts, (ii) the degradation kinetics and (iii) the influence of light on the original formulation. It is usually difficult to predict the light effect in the compounds and the consequences to the stability of the final preparation. So, to perform photostability testing, it is necessary to ensure that the radiation is homogeneously distributed on the surface area where the product will be exposed and to precisely determine the radiation dose received by the samples when placed in the exposure area. Thereby, it is necessary to design and to qualify a photostability chamber suitable to perform photostability testing and to guarantee the reliability of the results provided by it. Either a commercial or a homebuilt photostability chamber needs to ensure homogeneous light dose on the studied sample. There are two experimental ways to qualify the source of radiation: (i) by applying actinometer systems (chemical compounds with a linear photodegradation rate) or (ii) by using a physical device on which the number of photons applied can be fully determined. The main purpose of this Chapter is to discuss the procedures involved in the degradation induced by UV radiation and how to monitore and to determine the correct conditions for performing photostability testing in a photostability chamber. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Department of Energy (DOE) manages the SPR, which comprises five underground storage facilities, solution-mined from naturally occurring salt domes in Texas and Louisiana. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) authorized SPR expansion to a capacity of 1 billion barrels, but physical expansion of the SPR has not proceeded beyond 727 million barrels - its inventory at the end of 2010. In addition, a Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) holds 2 million barrels of heating oil in above-ground storage. EPCA authorized drawdown of the Reserve upon a finding by the President that there is a ""severe energy supply interruption."" Congress enacted additional authority in 1990 (Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of 1990, P.L. 101-383) to permit use of the SPR for short periods to resolve supply interruptions stemming from situations internal to the United States. The meaning of a ""severe energy supply interruption"" has been controversial. EPCA intended use of the SPR only to ameliorate discernible physical shortages of crude oil. The government had ended the practice of purchasing crude oil to fill the SPR in 1994. In 2000, the Department of Energy began acquiring SPR oil through royalty-in-kind (RIK) in lieu of cash royalties paid on production from federal offshore leases. In May 2008, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 110-232) ordering DOE to suspend RIK fill for the balance of the calendar year unless the price of crude oil dropped below $75/barrel. Crude oil prices spiked to $147/barrel in the summer of 2008 and then sharply declined, allowing a resumption of fill. These activities have brought the SPR essentially to its current 727 million barrel inventory. The current Secretary of the Interior recently announced his intention to terminate the RIK program. Congress approved $205 million for the SPR in FY2009, including $31.5 million to continue SPR physical expansion activities. DOE has evaluated a site in Richton, MS, as a possible location for an additional 160 million barrels of capacity, but set aside any further expansion plans. The FY2010 Energy and Water Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-85), which provides $243.8 million for the entire SPR program, included $25 million for expansion activities and $43.5 million for purchase of a cavern at Bayou Choctaw to replace a cavern posing environmental risks. The act also prohibits SPR appropriations from being expended to anyone engaged in providing refined product to Iran, or assisting Iran in developing additional internal capacity to refine oil. Historically, the use of the SPR has been tied to a physical supply shortage, which normally would manifest itself, in part, as a price increase. The original intention of the SPR was to create a reserve of crude oil stocks that could be tapped in the event of an interruption in crude supply. However, price was deliberately kept out of the President's SPR drawdown authority because of concerns about what price level would trigger a drawdown, and that any hint of a price threshold could influence private sector and industry inventory practices. The original intention of the SPR was to create a reserve of crude oil stocks that could be tapped in the event of an interruption in crude supply. The Government Accountability Office recently observed that the proportion of crude oil grades in the SPR has been growing less compatible with the heavier grades of crude oil that U.S. refineries have been upgrading to handle. This finding has raised questions about the SPR's effectiveness during a long-term oil disruption involving heavy oil. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The large scale use of LNG in the marine sector requires appropriate transport, storage and transfer facilities. The risks connected with the operation of these facilities are analyzed. Specific safety characteristics of the equipment involved are incorporated in the analysis. Safety distances are determined based upon a study of the effects of accidents during which LNG is released. It is found that the pressure at which LNG is released during an accident greatly influences the effect distances. At pressures near atmospheric, the hazards of LNG are comparable to those of conventional liquid fuels such as gasoline.

The semi- passive, or hybrid, approach for biped locomotion allows for the (1) maximiza- tion of energy efficiency and (2) significant improvement of adaptability to external disturbances. By exploring the dynamics of Energy Storage and Return (ESAR) elements, like springs or rubber bands, it is possible to power joints by releasing stored energy instead of only using torque provided by electrical mo- tors and to create gaits that minimize energy consumption.

Performed process simulations and cost estimations clearly point out the impact of CO2 concentration and steam supply when capturing CO2 from an atmospheric gas stream with MEA-based chemical absorption. An incremental increase in CO2 concentration reduces both operating and investment costs, mainly due to lower energy consumption and reduced equipment capacity. Reduced investment costs dominate the sharp decline in net present value of costs when increasing CO2 concentration from 2.5% to 10%, while a more moderate cost decline is present when going from 10% to 20% CO2. The impact of steam cost is evident for all studied CO2 concentrations. The cost sensitivity illustrate how important it is to understand the dynamics of cost components when selecting sources appropriate for CCS or struggle to improve performance of capture processes.

Therefore, the preliminary calculations of the approximate cycle took place, and a comparative analysis of cycles using only LWR and the cycle with a gradual replacement of LWR by fast breeder reactors was carried out as well. It is appropriate, because there is a sufficiently large number of spent nuclear fuel now is accumulated in temporary storage, but soon it has to be either converted into fresh fuel or disposed (that is unacceptable in all respects). The main problem of the closed fuel cycle is usage of MOX-fuel, but this type of fuel is elaborated now and will be improved upon.

The whole system including solar collectors, adsorption machine, recooling unit and hot storage is simulated. The models are then confronted to the measurements. Measurement period is shared between 2011 and 2012. Enhancements have been achieved during winter 2011 to have a more efficient system operation. The aim of this experimental work is to describe, for both measurement periods, the influence of operating conditions on the energy efficiency (thermal behavior and electrical consumption).

Adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, adipsin, and visfatin, are proteins secreted by the adipocytes and released into the circulation, participating in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, food intake, inflammation, immunity, and vascular sclerosis. The prevalence of obesity is dramatically increasing worldwide in both children and adults and, along with the increase of obesity, is a parallel increase in the prevalence of comorbid disorders such as hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes type 2. In obesity, adipocytes enlarge and macrophages infiltrate adipose tissue, resulting in the large-scale release of several adipokines and in an imbalance between molecules and peptides secreted by the adipose tissue. The proinflammatory cytokines contribute to the ""low-grade inflammatory state"" of obese individuals, especially those with the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), a clustering of metabolic abnormalities related to obesity, in both adults and children. Leptin and adiponectin are the two most studied adipokines in neonates, children, and adults and the majority of studies in obese individuals have shown hyperleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia compared to normal-weight individuals. Furthermore, levels of circulating leptin are negatively associated with insulin sensitivity and conversely, adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity by stimulating glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. However, anthropometric changes during growth and puberty as well as changes in endocrine and metabolic parameters may contribute to the varied effects of adipokines on insulin sensitivity and the metabolic profile. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

In the modern era, wind has been increasingly used for the production of electric power. In the first decade of the twenty-first century alone, the production of electricity from wind power worldwide has increased by a factor of eight. Similar to solar energy, wind is also a distributed, renewable source of energy. The energy density of the wind is low, but wind is available in all the geographical regions of the world and its geographical distribution is more uniform than that of solar energy. Wind turbines of different sizes and designs are currently used successfully for the production of electric power. The bigger and more efficient types of these engines have blades with lengths between 20 and 50 m, are located at the top of 50-140 m towers and are becoming ubiquitous in the landscape of several OECD countries. Wind is probably the most environmentally benign energy source. In theory, it has the capacity to satisfy the energy needs of entire countries and even that of the whole planet. However, it is also an intermittent source with availability and intensity much less predictable than any other source of alternative energy. This intermittency is a significant drawback and will limit the more widespread use of wind power, unless suitable energy storage systems are developed that would store part of the energy produced during windy periods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,"Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Geographical distribution; Geographical regions; Machinery; Sailing vessels; Ship propulsion; Solar energy; Wind power; Alternative energy; Different sizes; Electric power; Energy density; Energy storage systems; Environmentally benign; Mechanical work; Renewable sources; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884275143

Climatologists predict that this change will cause an increase of the average temperature of the planet as well as regional and global and climatic changes. Other significant environmental effects of energy consumption are: the several ecological problems caused by acid rain, which has threatened in the past the ecosystems of several lakes and rivers; lead contamination of the atmosphere; nuclear waste, which is produced by the more than 430 nuclear power plants in continuous operation worldwide; and, the waste heat rejection by all thermal power plants, which is accompanied by fresh-water consumption. Environmental threats are neutralized by public policy, either national policy or concerted international efforts and protocols that are ratified by several countries. Despite the efforts of the environmental community, there is not yet a global agreement for the mitigation of the effects of high carbon dioxide concentration, which poses the principal environmental threat of the twenty-first century. The problem of nuclear waste is being addressed at several national and regional levels and it appears that solutions for the long term storage of radionuclides will become available in the near future. National public policies and international collaboration has almost solved the acid rain and lead contamination problems. The two are viewed as success stories stemming from international collaboration and successful public policy.

When fossil-fuels are exhausted or when their use is curtailed because of environmental factors, such as the production of greenhouse gases, humans will have to rely more on alternative energy sources among which are nuclear, wind, and solar power. While the production of power by nuclear energy may be controlled, wind and solar power are intermittent or periodic sources, which may produce power when there is limited demand and may not produce power at all, when demand is high. For example, during the night hours of July 17th, when there is high demand for air-conditioning and electricity in the northern hemisphere, there is no Sun and the average wind power is significantly lower than average. If the society relies on alternative energy sources and stored energy is not available during this night, humans will experience a significant shortage of energy with the inconvenience this entails. As the human society moves more to the direction of alternative energy sources, the need for energy storage becomes apparent and more acute in order to satisfy the fluctuating energy demands. This chapter provides an exposition to the several energy storage methods that are currently used to smoothen the electric power demand and those that may become feasible and popular in the future. First, the electric energy demand patterns in a contemporary society that makes significant use of air-conditioning in the summer are explained. Secondly the various methods for energy storage, such as electromechanical, thermal-in both latent and sensible heat form-and chemical are explained with the devices/systems that make energy storage possible. The alternative method of storing ""coolness"" with materials that exhibit a temperature hysteresis in their melting/solidification processes is elucidated within the context of thermal storage methods.

The resulting hydrogen consumptions are compared with two references: the consumption of the pure fuel cell case, a vehicle without hybridization, and the optimal case with the minimum consumption. The optimal consumption for a given vehicle is determined through a methodology proposed that, unlike other previous methodologies, avoids the discretization of the state variables.

In this chapter, an operating policy is proposed for hybrid wind-hydro power stations (HPS) in island grids, in order to increase wind penetration levels, while at the same time minimizing the impact on the conventional generation system and ensuring the viability of the HPS investment. The proposed operating strategy is applied to different autonomous island systems using a dedicated logistic model, in order to evaluate the effect on the overall operation and economics of the island systems and to assess the feasibility of HPS investments.

The PCMs, which can change the phase within the range of operational conditions, allow for storage and consequent release of a large amount of energy due to the latent heat of the phase change. One of the possible applications of PCMs is the attenuation of temperature fluctuations in the applications with the demand on the temperature stability. The investigation of thermal behavior and optimal design of water-PCM attenuator is dealt with in the paper. A numerical model of heat and mass transfer in a circular attenuator was developed in MATLAB with the effective heat capacity method used to address the phase change.

The model is employed to generate a set of sizing curves that define the design space for hybrid systems using dimensionless generator component size variables, for a specified supply reliability and diesel energy dispatch strategy. The component size combination with the least unit cost of energy is selected among the many possible combinations satisfying a desired loss-of-load probability. Storage battery and diesel generator lifespan, as well as generator fuel efficiency, which depend on the operational loading stress of these components, are recognised as important variables in the economics of the system. The lifespan of the battery is premised to depend on the depth and rate of discharge of the operating cycles, while both the diesel generator lifespan and fuel efficiency are dependent on the degree and frequency of partial loading. The choice of diesel generator dispatch strategy was shown to be another important factor influencing the energy performance and economics of the system. The outputs of the model reveal several important sizing, operational and economic characteristics of the systems, and enables appraisal of comparative advantage of different types of designs and operational strategies.

Subject-specific aortic models, identified from measurements from a porcine study on septic shock, were used to calculate the hydraulic work associated with the excess and reservoir pressures (W ex, Wwk). Changes in these energies were compared to a metrics derived from left ventricular pressurevolume analysis. Total aortic work (Wao=Wex+Wwk) compared well to clinically assessed left ventricular work (R2=0.88). However, only a weak relationship of R2 = 0.24 was found between ventricular arterial coupling (Ees/Ea) and Wex/Wwk. Although a strong relationship (R2 = 0.76) was noticed between the inverse of afterload (1/Ea) and Wex. As septic shock progressed, a drop in Wwk was seen, indicating the arterial system loses its ability to store the stoke volume (SV) from the ventricle for release during diastole, resulting in a flattening of the diastolic pressure. These results indicate that one of the main reasons left ventricular afterload decreases during septic shock is because arterial system loses its ability to act as a storage reservoir. © 2012 IFAC.","Hemodynamic monitoring; Parameter identification; Physiological models; Septic shock","Blood vessels; Identification (control systems); Patient monitoring; Arterial systems; Diastolic pressure; Hemodynamic monitoring; Reservoir pressures; Septic shocks; Storage capacity; Storage reservoirs; Subject-specific; Physiological models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881038527

The electric motor, the fuel cell, the energy storage system (ESS), the braking rules, and the energy management strategy (EMS) heuristic rules are modelled. The role of the EMS and the ESS in the fuel consumption of a fuel cell hybrid vehicle is analysed, and the influence of the duty cycle on the results is examined. Simplified EMS if-then heuristic rules are used to describe powertrain behaviour. The developed simulator is used in an actual application, a fuel cell hybrid taxi, performing over a standard driving cycle, the NEDC, and over a specific duty cycle, the London DC, both with zero grade but with different dynamics. The results indicate that the EMS can have a significant impact on hydrogen consumption, leading to 7-10% less energy consumption because of the EMS improvements. Additionally, the EMS has less impact on the duty cycle when the vehicle is subjected to a more dynamic profile. The design of the EMS will depend on the particular ESS. The achieved 5% impact in the same duty cycle, especially with the hybrid ESS, clearly indicates the importance of optimizing the EMS according to the ESS components and vehicle usage. © 2012 IFAC.","Electric drive vehicle fuel cell hybrid vehicle; Energy management strategy; Hybrid electric energy storage; Regenerative braking; Simulation","Electric drives; Energy management; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Engines; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hybrid vehicles; Powertrains; Regenerative braking; Storage management; Taxicabs; Electric-drive vehicles; Energy management strategies; Energy management strategies (EMS); Energy storage systems; Fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV); Hydrogen consumption; Simulation; Vehicle dynamics; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881004200

With favorable water depths and environmental conditions, land reclamation is often a more economical option for the accommodation of offshore facilities than the construction of fixed steel jacket platforms. ADMA-OPCO is currently engaged in applying the technology to projects such as the Satah Al- Raaz Boot (SARB) field development, a 105,000-bpd development comprising 86 wells on two artificial islands. Simultaneously, ZADCO is making progress on expanding drilling from the Upper Zäkum field by constructing four artificial islands (UZAI) to increase field production to 750,000 bpd by 2015. While cost and schedule optimization will be realized with the selection of the artificial island option for these mega projects, designers and contractors are facing the challenge of securing or fabricating building materials in huge amounts for the construction of both the land masses and shore protection structures. Creative solutions to procuring these materials are tabled and investigated. Innovative engineering designs are tried and tested both numerically and using physical model tests. The presence of a soft soil layer within the foundation strata of one of the Upper Zäkum islands required special treatment to satisfy island performance criteria.

Habban field, south-western part of Yemen, produces from two different horizons: the Kuhlan sandstone overlaying the fractured basement. The fractured basement reservoir is characterized by two types of fracturing: background fractures with very low effective permeability of less than 0.001mD and fracture corridors with an effective permeability ranging from 0.01 up to 10 mD, and a total porosity of 1.3% only. Two sets of fracture corridors, with N-S and NW-SE mean orientation, contribute to production whereas background fractures act as storage feeding in those corridors. The large contrast in properties between Kuhlan and Basement adds-on further challenges: Kuhlan possesses good reservoir properties but moderate storage (∼10m thick), whereas fractured basement has extremely poor reservoir properties but significant storage (∼700m thick). Habban field has produced since end 2006 by depletion through 30 slanted wells. To optimally assess different production strategies, a simulation model was built. Dynamic data (MDT, PLT, BHP, production rates) were used to constrain the dynamic model on well by well basis. Due to this extremely challenging setting, a very high focus was put on a history matching process that integrates geology and reservoir simulation work to result into an enhanced understanding of field mechanisms. One main conclusion of this integrated history matching approach is that water comes to wells from neighborhood formations through main faults, explaining then the erratic water production (no crest to flank correlation). Second highlight concerns the major contribution of N-S main fractures. Finally understanding of the communication mechanism between basement and Kuhlan was enhanced, showing that despite basement poor properties, basement oil feeds in Kuhlan, as Kuhlan is produced. This synergized understanding of Habban mechanisms is a clear milestone for further well location planning and oil recovery optimization under uncertainty.

This is readily achieved by integrated workstation software that enables simultaneous interpretation and modelling of both data sets. Where 2D seismic control is sparse and highly ambiguous, Gravity and Magnetic data provide additional independent measurement of the subsurface; and a more reliable integrated interpretation of complex geologic structure, adding value and reducing risk. Further, continuous improvement in data resolution and sensitivity [from land, marine and airborne acquisition and processing systems] are making completely new applications possible, expanding Potential Fields methods from regional 'reconnaissance' tools into prospect scale and to some extent, reservoir scale, including both 3D full tensor gravity (3D-FTG) and magnetic gradiometry technology. Unfortunately, turmoil in the region has prevented their airborne survey deployment to date but this could readily change with improving political stability in Iraq-Kurdistan. Meanwhile, high quality public domain regional space mission 'satellite derived' gravity and magnetic data provides the focus for understanding and mapping the tectonic framework: basement architecture and distribution of igneous bodies. Structural information so derived can be combined with basement depth estimation to improve understanding of basin morphology, evolution and the petroleum system. It can also prove valuable in identifying continuity between well and seismic data. This paper demonstrates the utility and integration of regional scale public domain non seismic data to assist with the local scale structural model and prospectivity assessments of some high fold zone blocks of interest in NE Iraq/Kurdistan.

Nowadays HAM (Heat, Air and Moisture transport) models are widely used to simulate and predict the effect of these transport phenomena in detail. Recently these HAM models are being coupled to CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) to study the moisture exchange between air and porous materials on a local scale (microclimates). The objective of this research is to develop such a model to study drying phenomena. In this paper the emphasis lies on the modelling of convective drying of porous building materials. An important aspect for the correct modelling of convective drying is the way the air boundary is implemented. A short literature review reveals that different modelling approaches can be used. This paper gives a short overview of the state of the art in conjugate heat and mass transport modelling for convective drying. In this review shortcomings of currently applied modelling approaches are highlighted. Finally the newly developed model is used to simulate the convective drying of a sample of ceramic brick. These simulations were then compared with measurements from literature. A good agreement was found. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air; Building materials; Buildings; Computational fluid dynamics; Drying; Energy utilization; Moisture; Porous materials; Building envelopes; CFD (computational fluid dynamics); Heat and mass transports; Heat and moisture transports; Literature reviews; Moisture transport; Porous building material; Transport phenomena; Heat convection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875020110

Dynamic process simulations of the heat recovery plants were necessary to check the feasibility of the systems and consider the non-steady-state off-gas emissions of the steelmaking devices.

From extraction through transformation, storage, distribution, etc. to the use of energy efficiency is topic. Some of it is addressed by going local in feedstock and distributed in generation, also opening new opportunities for energy use of biomass, usually limited to logistic constraints. Hydrogen recently has taken a prominent position in contributing towards flexibility of Renewable Energy generation and could potentially save a part of the 80% crude oil energy loss for transformation into gasoline for the transportation sector. Splitting organic waste and biomass into Hydrogen and Carbon in a bio-refinery, flexible product outputs could be enabled, as demonstrated at the European Centre for Renewable Energies in Guessing, Austria. By applying our thermo catalytic splitting of Carbon Hydrate gases at 55% of the energy needs of SMR only, no scarce water needs to be used nor CO2 is generated. Bio refineries could uplift energy efficiency of biomass use, from today's limitation to electricity and heat to flexible synthetic fuels or electricity on demand, potentially providing economic back-up solutions for volatile renewable energy generation.

Besides, when the severe fault occurs in the system, it may cause the transient power fluctuation. If the power fluctuation cannot be maintained in the acceptable range, the system stability may be deteriorated. To compensate for fast power fluctuation, a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) can be applied. This paper proposes a new optimization technique of SMES power controller with optimal energy capacity. The power controller structure is the first-order lead-lag compensator. The optimization problem of power controller parameters, coil inductance and initial coil current is formulated based on an enhancement of system damping and a minimization of initial energy capacity of SMES. The genetic algorithm is applied to achieve all optimized parameters. Simulation results confirm the control effect of the SMES with optimized energy capacity against various disturbances. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Genetic algorithm; Microgrid; Power system stability; Superconducting magnetic energy storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873471458

Wind generators produce unpredictable output fluctuations which result in variations of the network frequency thereby affecting the power system. This results in a degraded power quality and restricts the penetration of wind energy, especially for microgrid or island network applications. This problem needs to be addressed to ensure the expansion of the wind energy component in the overall world energy mix.

A new data staging framework for the computing element has recently been developed to address issues with the present framework, which has essentially remained unchanged since its original implementation 10 years ago. This new framework consists of an intelligent data transfer scheduler which handles priorities and fair-share, a rapid caching system, and the ability to delegate data transfer over multiple nodes to increase network throughput. This paper uses data from real user jobs running on production ARC sites to present an evaluation of the new framework. It is shown to make more efficient use of the available resources, reduce the overall time to run jobs, and avoid the problems seen with the previous simplistic scheduling system. In addition, its simple design coupled with intelligent logic provides greatly increased flexibility for site administrators, end users and future development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computation theory; Data handling; Data transfer; Distributed computer systems; High energy physics; Middleware; Network function virtualization; Scheduling; Caching system; Computing element; Increased flexibility; Intelligent data; Multiple nodes; Network throughput; Remote storage service; Scheduling systems; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873310758

Lossless compression techniques on the level of the raw data can provide compression ratios up to a factor of two. Higher compression ratios can be reached by introducing an appropriate model for the raw data and storing relevant information for the event reconstruction with respect to that model. In ALICE, a data compression technique has been developed for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to reach an overall compression factor suited for data taking in Heavy Ion collisions. The ALICE High Level Trigger provides online calculation of the TPC clusters from the raw data, followed by tracking, thus producing a fully reconstructed event. Storing the reconstructed cluster data in an appropriate compressed format for utilization in the off-line reconstruction allows to discard the original raw data of the TPC. In the presented solution, compression factors of four to six are achieved without significantly affecting the physics performance. By associating space points to reconstructed tracks, all relevant parameters can be further transformed into a format suitable for Huffman compression. In a first conservative approach, all reconstructed clusters are kept in the data. Data compression has been implemented for the ALICE TPC in 2011 for usage in the Heavy Ion data-taking. In this contribution the results on 2011 real data are presented for the first time.",,"Colliding beam accelerators; Data acquisition; Data compression; Digital storage; Heavy ions; High energy physics; Conservative approaches; Data compression techniques; High energy nuclear physics; High resolution detector; Higher compression ratios; Lossless compression techniques; Time projection chambers; Track reconstruction; Data compression ratio",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873293878

Ensuring cybersecurity in the control infrastructure of an energy company may seem like a daunting task as it requires cooperation and commitment from the entire organization as well as support organizations. Upper management must recognize the numerous benefits of a secure ICS. These advantages include ensuring system uptime, reliability, availability, and safety to both the facility and surrounding area. To provide maximum protection for critical ICS data assets, IT teams at energy companies should deploy a ""defense-in-depth"" security approach that includes multiple layers of protection to recognize and thwart cyberattacks.

But in order to even begin this understanding, infrastructure must be deployed to capture raw acoustic signals for an extended period of time. This infrastructure is comprised of at least four distinct components. Firstly, a hydrophone, deployed underwater, which is capable of operating at a high sampling rate: 500,000 16&amp;#x2013;bit samples per second. Secondly, an analog/digital converter (ADC), to which the hydrophone transmits raw voltages. Thirdly, a communications infrastructure for bridging the gap from the ADC to shore. And finally, an onshore base-station for receiving the signals and presenting them to a remote analytic or simulation infrastructure for further processing. Attempting this signal capture in real-time poses many problems. On a practical level, deploying cabled infrastructure to deliver power and communications to the offshore components may be prohibitively expensive. However, reliance on solar power may result in interruptions to real-time wireless transmission. Additionally, a high sampling rate will require significant base-station memory/storage/processing capabilities as well as potentially high costs of delivery to a remote infrastructure, part of which could be alleviated by real-time signal compression.

This means that the power abilities of these batteries are limited. In order to enhance their performance, a hybrid Rechargeable Energy Storage System (RESS) architecture can be used combining batteries with electrical-double layer capacitors (EDLCs). Sucha hybridized architecture can be accomplished using passive or active systems. In this paper, the characteristics of these topologies have been analyzed and compared based on a newly developed hybridization simulation tool for association of lithium-ion batteries and EDLCs. The analysis shows that the beneficial impact of the EDLCs brings about enhanced battery performances in terms of energy efficiency and voltage drops, rather than extension of vehicle range. These issues have been particularly studied for the passive and active hybrid topologies. The classical passive and active topologies being expensive and lessbeneficial in term of cost, volume and weight, a new hybrid configuration based on the parallel combination of lithium-ion and EDLCs on cell level has been proposed in this article. This topology allows reducing cost, volume, and weight and system complexity in a significant way. Furthermore, a number of experimental setups have illustrated the power of the novel topology in terms of battery capacity increase and power capabilities during charging and discharging. Finally, a unique cycle life testcampaign demonstrated that the lifetime of highly optimized lithium-ion batteries can be extended up to 30%-40%. © 2012 by the authors.","Cycle life; EDLC; Hybrid topologies; Lithium-ion batteries; Power capabilities","Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Secondary batteries; Topology; Voltage measurement; Cycle lives; EDLC; Electrical double layer capacitor; Electrical double layer capacitor (EDLCs); Energy storage systems; Hybrid configurations; Hybrid topologies; Power capability; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870755661

Two heptoses, D-mannoheptulose and perseitol, occur in unusually high concentrations in avocado tissues and are thought to be important in fruit ripening. We determined changes in the concentrations and relationships between individual sugars, total soluble proteins, and oil during fruit ripening.'Hass' fruit were harvested from cool and warm sub-tropical areas in South Africa three-times during a single season. Dry matter increased during the season at both locations. For fruit from the cool sub-tropical climate, D-mannoheptulose and perseitol concentrations declined rapidly from 15.9 mg g-1 dry weight (DW) and 7.9 mg g-1 DW to 2.1 mg g-1 DW and 0.6 mg g-1 DW, respectively, 13 d after harvest. Overall concentrations of glucose and fructose were negligible at harvest and increased to 1.4 mg g-1 DW and 0.8 mg g-1 DW, respectively, during ripening.The concentration of glucose in fast-ripening fruit increased 3 d prior to increasing in slow-ripening fruit. The concentration of sucrose was intermediate (2.8 - 4.5 mg g-1 DW) and was variable during ripening. The concentration of total soluble proteins increased during ripening from 17.8 mg g-1 DW to 34.8 mg g-1 DW, whereas the concentration of oil was fairly stable during ripening, and varied from 24.8 - 36.7% DW, depending on fruit maturity. It is suggested that the heptose pool is an important source of carbon and/or energy in avocado fruit.The low concentrations of these sugars and the rapid decline in their levels, post-harvest, indicate that optimal post-harvest management, especially cold storage and ripening temperature regimes, is necessary to reduce the risk of post-harvest disorders and to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality avocado fruit.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870554845

Even though cooling needs do not contribute a large share to the overall energy demand in temperate climates, recent trends show a tendency of large growth. This growth is related to two main drivers: cheap and affordable air-conditioning units that have overrun the market and the more frequent occurrence of hot and extremely hot weather conditions. In combination with inadequate insulation and sealing in most old buildings, both drivers contributed to new cooling installations that are significantly increasing electricity demand and peak load, even at the national level. Consequently, the use of fossil fuels in power plants and electricity import has increased. The development of sustainable buildings and the use of renewable energy sources (RES) seem to be promising solutions. However, the problem of the integration of RES in the current energy system is related to their intermittent nature and uncontrollable occurrence.Cool Thermal Energy Storage (CTES) may play an important role in the management of peak loads and solve the intermittency problem of RES, especially when cooling storage is integrated into district cooling systems. A simple mathematical model of a system with integrated RES and CTES has been developed. Hourly system analyses have been conducted for one building, a group of buildings connected to the district cooling system and a region represented by a mixture of different demands for cool thermal energy.

In the proposed system, the kinetic energy of the FEES is utilized to smooth the output power fluctuations of wind farm. In addition, the stored energy of FESS is utilized in most efficient way by correcting the power reference using prediction base control.

However, the main point of this paper is to investigate other type of ceramic known as PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) normally used as piezoelectric sensors in industrial applications. The idea herein is to use the PZT ceramics as HV dielectrics for applications in high-energy storage systems by de-poling their piezoelectric properties in order to avoid dielectric damage and losses at high frequencies. For this, de-poled PZT-4 ceramic samples (30 mm × 2 mm) were submitted to HV tests, in which their dielectric breakdown strength and dielectric constant variation with the applied voltage were assessed. These results obtained confirmed the use of PZT in applications that require reasonable dielectric constant stability (< 15 %) with voltage and HV dielectric breakdown (40 kV/cm) for compact high-energy storage devices. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","BST; Capacitor; Ceramics; Energy storage; Nonlinear dielectrics; PZT","Barium strontium titanate; Capacitors; Ceramic materials; Electric breakdown; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Lead zirconate titanate; Piezoelectricity; Powder technology; Strontium titanates; Barium and strontium titanates; Ceramics; Dielectric breakdown strength; Energy storage systems; High dielectric constants; High-energy storage devices; Nonlinear dielectric; Piezoelectric property; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869446383

Such characteristics make them ideal in the coating of distributors, mufflers, heating ovens, among others, as highly demanded by the mining and metallurgical industries, among others.

This is due to their promising use as power sources for space and underwater applications, where air is not available and gas storage poses obvious problems. One key factor to improve the performance of DBFCs concerns the type of separator used. Both anion- and cation-exchange membranes may be considered as potential separators for DBFC. In the present paper, the effect of the membrane type on the performance of laboratory NaBH4/H2O2 fuel cells using Pt electrodes is studied at room temperature. Two commercial ion-exchange membranes from Membranes International Inc., an anion-exchange membrane (AMI-7001S) and a cation-exchange membrane (CMI-7000S), are tested as ionic separators for the DBFC. The membranes are compared directly by the observation and analysis of the corresponding DBFC's performance. Cell polarization, power density, stability, and durability tests are used in the membranes' evaluation. Energy densities and specific capacities are estimated. Most tests conducted, clearly indicate a superior performance of the cation-exchange membranes over the anion-exchange membrane. The two membranes are also compared with several other previously tested commercial membranes. For long term cell operation, these membranes seem to outperform the stability of the benchmark Nafion membranes but further studies are still required to improve their instantaneous power load. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Anion-exchange membrane; Cation-exchange membrane; Cell performance; Cell stability; Direct borohydride fuel cell","Direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFC); Durability; Electric load forecasting; Hydrogen peroxide; Ion exchange; Platinum; Positive ions; Separators; Anion exchange membrane; Cation exchange membranes; Cell operation; Cell performance; Cell polarization; Cell stability; Durability test; Energy density; Gas storage; Instantaneous power; Key factors; Membrane types; Nafion membrane; Power densities; Power sources; Pt electrode; Room temperature; Sodium borohydrides; Specific capacities; Underwater application; Ion exchange membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869139652

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the associations between adiponectin and visfatin levels, body fat (BF), abdominal and hip fat depots, blood lipid profile, insulin sensitivity surrogates, and AO. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 145 healthy, premenopausal (aged 20-40 years), normal-weight women. Using the cut values of 80 cm waist circumference (WC) and 0.8 waist-to-hip ratio, we identified 38 and 68 women with AO, respectively. We assessed visfatin, adiponectin, blood lipid, glucose, and insulin levels. The body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Regardless of the criteria used to diagnose AO, we found that women with AO were heavier (P = 0.01), had more deliveries (P = 0.03), and had lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (P = 0.01) than women without AO. Serum visfatin and adiponectin levels, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and indices of insulin sensitivity and resistance were comparable between the groups. AO was associated with higher diastolic blood pressure and higher total, abdominal (android), and hip (gynoid) fat as well as the android/BF ratio (all P <0.01). There was a positive correlation between glucose and WC (r = 0.206; P = 0.02). Adiponectin was positively associated with HDL cholesterol (r = 0.248; P = 0.008) and inversely with the android/BF ratio (r = -0.218; P = 0.009) and android/gynoid ratio (r = -0.201; P = 0.04). Visfatin inversely correlated with total (r = -0.251; P = 0.01) and LDL cholesterol (r = -0.181; P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Normal-weight women with AO have normal adiponectin and visfatin levels, higher diastolic blood pressure, and lower HDL cholesterol levels. The android/gynoid ratio and android/BF ratio are inversely correlated with adiponectin levels.

The body of the simulated pond is an enclosure of height H andlength L wherein an artificial salinity gradient is created in order to suppress convective motions induced by solar radiation absorption and to stabilize the solar pond duringthe period of operation. Here we show the distribution of velocity, temperature and salt concentration fields during energy collection and storage in a solar pond filled with waterand constituted by three different salinity zones. The bottom of the pond is blackenedandthe free-surface is subjected to heat losses by convection, evaporation and radiationwhile the vertical walls are adiabatic and impermeable. The governing equations of continuity, momentum, thermal energy and mass transfer are discretized by finite-volume method in transient regime. Velocity vector fields show the presence of thin convective cells inthe upper convective zone (UCZ) and large convective cells in the lower convective zone (LCZ). This study shows the importance of buoyancy ratio in the decrease of temperature inthe UCZ and in the preservation of high temperature in the LCZ. It shows also the importance of the thickness of Non-Convective Zone (NCZ) in the reduction of the upwards heat losses. © 2012 by the authors.","Computational study; Energy collection and storage; Heat and mass transfer; Salt gradient solar pond; Solar radiation absorption; Transient fluid flow","Computational fluid dynamics; Finite volume method; Flow of fluids; Fluid dynamics; Heat convection; Heat losses; Heat transfer; High temperature operations; Hydrodynamics; Lakes; Mass transfer; Solar radiation; Computational studies; Energy collection; Heat and mass transfer; Radiation absorption; Salt gradient solar pond; Transient fluid flow; Solar ponds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868218049

A multidisciplinary approach on this field aims at creating biologically functional tissues to be used as implants and prostheses. The freeze-drying process allows the fundamental properties of these materials to be preserved, making future manipulation and storage easier. Optimizing a freeze-drying cycle is of great importance since it aims at reducing process costs while increasing product quality of this time-and-energy-consuming process. Mathematical modeling comes as a tool to help a better understanding of the process variables behavior and consequently it helps optimization studies. Freeze-drying microscopy is a technique usually applied to determine critical temperatures of liquid formulations. It has been used in this work to determine the sublimation rates of a biological tissue freeze-drying. The sublimation rates were measured from the speed of the moving interface between the dried and the frozen layer under 21.33, 42.66 and 63.99 Pa. The studied variables were used in a theoretical model to simulate various temperature profiles of the freeze-drying process.

This work aims at investigating the molecular gas in the surroundings of the ultra-compact HII region G045.47+0.05 looking for evidence of molecular outflows. Methods. We carried out observations towards a region of 2′ × 2′ centered at RA = 19h14m25.6s, Dec = +11°09′27.6′′(J2000) using the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE; Chile) in the 12CO J = 3-2, 13CO J = 3-2, HCO+J = 4-3, and CS J = 7-6 lines with an angular resolution of 22′′. We complement these observations with public infrared data. Results. We characterize the physical parameters of the molecular clump where G045.47+0.0 is embedded. The detection of the CS J = 7-6 line emission in the region reveals that the ultra-compact HII region G045.47+0.0 has not completely disrupted the dense gas where it was born. The HCO+ abundance observed towards G045.47+0.0 suggests there is molecular outflow activity in the region. From the analysis of the 12CO J = 3-2 transition we report bipolar molecular outflows with a total mass of about 300 M·. We derive a dynamical time (flow's age) of about 105 yr for the outflow gas, in agreement with the presence of an ultra-compact HII region. We identify the source 2MASS 19142564+1109283 as the massive protostar candidate to drive the molecular outflows. Based on the analysis of its spectral energy distribution, we infer that it is an early B-type star of about 15 M·. The results of this work support the scenario where the formation of massive stars, at least up to early B-type stars, is similar to that of low-mass stars. © 2012 ESO.","ISM: jets and outflows; ISM: molecules; Stars: formation","Digital storage; Giant stars; Molecular mass; Angular resolution; ISM: jets and out flow; ISM: molecules; Molecular clumps; Molecular outflows; Physical parameters; Spectral energy distribution; Stars: formation; Fighter aircraft",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867383954

The longdistance waterway transportation of forest fuels should be thoroughly investigated, especially in areas where the transport distance is long and waterways could provide a feasible method of conveying forest fuel. In comparison to transport of forest chips by truck, barge-based waterway transport shows a competitive advantage due to the larger loads and higher bulk density of chips it allows. The cost-efficiency of waterway transportation operations related to forest chips in Finland's Lake Saimaa region was studied using practical demonstrations and discrete-event simulation. The varying demand for fuel wood in three separate bio-power plants on the Saimaa lakeside (near the cities of Varkaus, Mikkeli, and Savonlinna) was addressed in several barge transportation scenarios. Finally, the economy of barge transportation was compared to the economy of truck transportation as a function of transportation distance and in terms of the annual performance of the transportation methods examined. The waterway supply chain of forest chips was cost-competitive to road transport by truck after 100-150 km. According to the simulation study, the most economical waterway transport options were based on fixed barge system and shift-independent harbor logistics where loading and unloading of barges were carried-out with a wheeled loader and a belt conveyor. Total supply chain costs including the best waterway logistics from road side storage to power plant ranged from € 10.75 to € 11.64/MWh in distances of 100-150 km by waterways. The energy-density of forest chips in the barge load was found to be, on average, 25% higher than that in truck hauling, because of the better compaction of chips. Waterway transport is a viable option for long-distance transportation of forest chips in Eastern Finland.","Barges; Discrete-event simulation; Forest fuels; Logistics; Supply chains; Tugboats","Barges; Belt conveyors; Competition; Costs; Discrete event simulation; Forestry; Fuels; Inland waterways; Lakes; Logistics; Power plants; Roads and streets; Supply chains; Truck drivers; Trucks; Tugboats; Unloading; Competitive advantage; Forest fuel; Loading and unloading; Operational efficiencies; Transportation distance; Transportation method; Transportation operations; Transportation scenario; Truck transportation; alternative energy; biomass power; cost-benefit analysis; discrete choice analysis; European Union; fuelwood; logistics; power plant; renewable resource; transportation system; trucking; tug; waterway transport; Barges; Belt Conveyors; Competition; Costs; Forestry; Fuels; Lakes; Loading; Management; Materials Handling; Power Plants; Simulation; Supply Chain Management; Transport; Trucks; Unloading; Etela-Karjala; Finland; Lake Saimaa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866920152

Biogas technology provides distinctive advantages compared to other renewable energy technologies: it combines energy (gas) storage with generation; it provides valuable co-products such as nutrient-rich bioslurry; and it can easily co-digest a range of feedstocks thus providing an integrated waste management service. At the same time, the subtleties associated with the technology arise from a unique combination of factors including that: the feedstock source is often a waste or problem product, and hence its use for energetic utilization resolves waste management problems; the nutrients made more available through the anaerobic digestion process are extremely valuable (typically, the nutrients are at least five times as valuable as the biogas generated); and co-digestion of different substrates in one system improves returns on investment. The trend now is that of increasing numbers of biogas installations across Africa. This is largely apparent in the domestic energy sector, which has in recent years seen the start of a number of national domestic biogas programmes each with national targets of over 10,000 domestic systems to be installed in the next 5 years. National programmes in Africa are currently implemented in Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Benin and Burkina Faso. In many African countries, the sewerage infrastructure and waste management within the urban and peri-urban perimeters is often non-existent, or failing. Many major cities have an immediate opportunity through biogas technology implementation to reduce the serious, negative impact of the status quo on the aquatic environment, on human health and hygiene, and on pests and methane emissions from rotting organic solid waste, be it at the roadsides or at dump sites. The biogas solutions are additional and complementary to the existing infrastructure. The benefits of the technology, compared with other renewable energy technologies (RETs) are often subtle and hence more difficult to measure and realize, yet with the correct policies and financial tariffs/incentives in place, the use of the technology is most certainly viable. The levels and types of service offering and the associated business models are key elements to deepening the access to the technology across Africa. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Production of heavy oil from such reservoirs is thought to play an important role in the future of the ever-growing world's energy consumption in which Iran's recoverable heavy oil is more than 85 billion barrels. The offshore Ferdows field in Iran is reportedly on the order of 30 billion barrels of oil and holds perhaps the greatest promise to add significant future carbonate heavy oil production within the region. With depletion of conventional petroleum reserves and increase of hydrocarbon fuel demand, there is no doubt that there will be a tremendous demand on the development of heavy oil reservoirs in the coming decades. Despite its strategic importance, recovery of heavy crude from fractured carbonate reservoirs has found limited applications due to the complexity of such reservoirs. As most of the oil is stored in matrix due to its higher storage capacity than fracture network, reservoir development plans will aim at maximizing the matrix oil recovery. For reservoirs with high recovery factor, minimizing matrix residual oil saturation is a critical issue to extend the life of the reservoir. For reservoirs with low recovery factor, accelerating the production rate is more vital. For each of these reservoir types, different Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods should be considered and implemented accordingly. In this study, a comprehensive review is conducted to figure out the feasibility of heavy oil recovery from fractured carbonate reservoirs by use of Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS), Steam injection, In-Situ Combustion (ISC), Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), Vapor Extraction (VAPEX) and Expanding Solvent-Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (ES-SAGD).

Each group comprised 5 lambs with an average initial body weight of 25 ± 2 kg. For 35 days the sheep were fed the control or experimental diets enriched with 5% LO, SeVI, or LO and SeVI combined. The diets with LO, regardless of the presence of SeVI, increased BMG, FCE, and the mass of MBF, MLD, and the liver.

Dietary LO with or without SeVI resulted in negligible changes in the concentration of total CLA isomers in MBF. The diet enriched with LO, irrespective of the presence of SeVI, increased the concentrations of cis- monounsaturated fatty acids (cis-MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), as well as unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the liver, heart, and especially in SF and PF (i.e. energy storage tissues) compared with the control group and SeVI-fed sheep. Dietary SeVI more effectively increased the capacity of Δ9-desaturation in all adipose tissues as the concentration of cis9,trans11CLA increased in these tissues. The addition of SeVI to the diet decreased the yield of the catabolism of fatty acids in these adipose tissues and both muscles compared with the control sheep or other experimental groups. The diets enriched with LO with or without SeVI increased the nutritional value of MBF, MLD, and adipose tissues as the ratio of unsaturated FA/saturated FA increased.

The analysis has shown the beneficial properties of lithium-ion in the terms of energy density, power density and rate capabilities. Particularly, the nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode stands out with the high energy density up to 160 Wh/kg, compared to 70-110, 90 and 71 Wh/kg for lithium iron phosphate cathode, lithium nickel cobalt aluminum cathode and, lithium titanate oxide anode battery cells, respectively. These values are considerably higher than the lead-acid (23-28 Wh/kg) and nickel-metal hydride (44-53 Wh/kg) battery technologies. The dynamic discharge performance test shows that the energy efficiency of the lithium-ion batteries is significantly higher than the lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride technologies. The efficiency varies between 86% and 98%, with the best values obtained by pouch battery cells, ahead of cylindrical and prismatic battery design concepts. Also the power capacity of lithium-ion technology is superior compared to other technologies. The power density is in the range of 300-2400 W/kg against 200-400 and 90-120 W/kg for lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride, respectively. However, considering the influence of energy efficiency, the power density is in the range of 100-1150 W/kg. Lithium-ion batteries optimized for high energy are at the lower end of this range and are challenged to meet the United States Advanced Battery Consortium, SuperLIB and Massachusetts Institute of Technology goals. Their association with electric-double layer capacitors, which have low energy density (4-6 Wh/kg) but outstanding power capabilities, could be very interesting. The study of the rate capability of the lithium-ion batteries has allowed for a new state of charge estimation, encompassing all essential performance parameters. The rate capabilities tests are reflected by Peukert constants, which are significantly lower for lithium-ion batteries than for nickel-metal hydride and lead-acid. Furthermore, rate capabilities during charging have been investigated. Lithium-ion batteries are able to store about 80% of the capacity at current rate 2It, with high power cells accepting over 90%. At higher charging rates of 5It or more, the internal resistance impedes charge acceptance by high energy cells. The lithium titanate anode, due to its high surface area (100 m2/g compared to 3 m2/g for the graphite based anode) performs much better in this respect. The behavior of lithium-ion batteries has been investigated at different conditions. The analysis has leaded us to a new lithium ion battery model. This model will be compared to existing battery models in future research contributions. © 2012 by the authors.","Battery model; Energy density; HPPC-test; Lithium-ion batteries; Performance tests; Power density; Rate capabilities","Anodes; Battery management systems; Cathodes; Charging (batteries); Cobalt; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Hybrid vehicles; Hydrides; Ions; Lead acid batteries; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Manganese oxide; Metals; Nickel; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Rate constants; Secondary batteries; Titanium compounds; Tungsten; Battery modeling; Energy density; HPPC tests; Performance tests; Power densities; Rate capabilities; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865743438

Especially, the frequency fluctuation may be severe when the capacity of generators for load-frequency control (LFC) is insufficient in the nighttime. In general, the battery energy storage system (BESS) is used to alleviate the frequency fluctuation. Nevertheless, the installation cost of BESS with large capacity is very high. On the other hand, in the demand side, the installation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) tends to increase significantly. The PHEV is normally plugged into the home outlet in the nighttime. Based on the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control, the distributed batteries installed in PHEVs can be applied to LFC. As a result, the required capacity of BESS installed in the system can be reduced. This paper proposes the new contribution of the PHEV based on V2G control not only to alleviate frequency fluctuation in a smart grid with large wind farms, but also to reduce the BESS capacity. In the PHEV model, the charging schedule and battery state of charge are taken into account. To guarantee the well cooperative control of PHEV, BESS and conventional frequency controller, the proportionalintegral parameters of BESS and frequency controller are tuned by the particle swarm optimization while the V2G control of PHEV is performed.

Next, a pumping station powered by the rejected RES production and raising water from an adjacent downstream reservoir is modeled. Various scenarios concerning the pumping station power rate and feeding program are examined. The operation of the combined system is simulated in detail and the energy results are analyzed. Also, an economic evaluation is carried out based on current financial conditions in Greece.

At the same time, the contribution of wind energy is significantly restricted due to electrical grid limitations imposed to "" secure"" the stability of the local network and thus resulting in significant rejected wind energy amounts. On the basis of sensitivity analysis, the present study evaluates the techno-economic viability of a system that incorporates the simultaneous operation of existing and new wind farms (WFs) with pumped storage and hydro turbines, which are able to provide the electrical grid of a remote island with guaranteed energy amounts during the peak load demand hours on a daily basis. The performance of the system is simulated during a selected time period for various system configurations and an attempt is made to localize the optimum solution by calculating various financial indices. Emphasis is given on the conduction of an extensive sensitivity analysis considering three main variables (i.e. produced energy selling price, the percentage of state subsidization and the price of the wind energy surplus bought from the already existing WFs) taking also into account several constraints of the national legislation. Based on the most economically viable (payback period quite less than 10. years) configuration derived (24. MW WFs, 15. MW water pumping system, 13.5. MW hydro turbines), the contribution of renewable energy increases by almost 15% (in absolute terms) compared to current conditions, reaching about 25% of the island's energy consumption pattern.

In the presented work, the Heat Integration methodology for batch processes based on Time Slices has been extended to cover the integration of solar thermal energy, thus allowing for dealing with such variations. A procedure for identifying the number and durations of Time Slices for a problem featuring variable renewable energy supply has been formulated, and developed for solar energy utilisation. The main procedural steps involve partitioning of the measured/forecasted heat availability profile using a large number of candidate time boundaries, and then approximating it by a piecewise-constant profile using high-precision. The approximation profile is obtained by subjecting the candidate superset of time-boundaries to MILP optimisation, thus minimising integral inaccuracy compared to the forecasted availability profile. The Time Slice definitions are completed by approximating the heat loads within the Time Slices. The integration of solar thermal energy can be performed for the specified Time Slice, after the optimal number of Time Slices with approximated constant load has been selected. Using heat storage, the heat can be transferred between Time Slices. © 2011.","Heat integration; Integration of solar thermal energy; Renewable availability curve; Time slices; Variations of renewables","Batch data processing; Heat storage; Optimization; Solar energy; Sun; Heat integration; Renewable availability curve; Renewables; Solar thermal energy; Time slice; Integration; energy resource; heat source; optimization; precision; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; thermal power; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864365198

The penetration of these DG units into AC microgrids (MGs) is growing rapidly, enabling reaching high percentage of the installed generating capacity. However, the fluctuating and intermittent nature of this renewable generation causes variations of power flow that can bring both power quality and reliability issues to the electrical grid. To overcome these problems, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) arises as a potential alternative to compensate these power flow fluctuations and thus to significantly enhance the MG dynamic security. To this aim, the management of the energy stored in the SMES device is crucial for optimizing the storage capacity as well as for preventing the device from becoming overcharged or uncharged. This paper proposes the use of an improved SMES controller for the stabilization of the fluctuating active power injected into the microgrid by wind generators. In this sense, the design and implementation of a high performance active power controller of the SMES is described. The control is based on fuzzy logic techniques and uses an enhanced fuzzy inference system (FIS) combined with a unique filter block. Moreover, a detailed model of the SMES unit and its power conditioning system (PCS) for connecting to the electric grid is derived.

Its first LNG terminal, with a storage capacity of ∼ 540,000 cu m, is due online in the second quarter of 2013. The plant will have an initial throughput capacity of 3.5 million ton/yr and will increase to 6 million ton/yr by the end of 2013, far exceeding UK gas player BG Group's deal to supply Singapore with 3 million ton/yr for domestic use. Under an agreement with Singapore's Energy Market Authority, BG has contracted long-term supply of ∼ 2.65 million ton/yr for ≤ 20 yr out of its franchise 3 million ton/yr target. Further expansion is planned over the decade that will see throughput hit 9 million ton/yr with a storage capacity of > 700,000 cu m. Overall, SLNG's master plan envisages an eventual average throughput capacity of 15 million ton/yr and storage of some 1.5 million cu m. The country is ideally placed to balance expanding supply and demand, and, as new flows emerge bidirectionally between East and West, as the Americas and East Africa develop supply infrastructure, more trade will flow through Asia - and some of that will be via Singapore.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864003652

The proposed criterion agrees well with the test results obtained under temperatures ranging from 273-467 K.

This form of description of the voltage sags, produced in the stator, based on the multi-level decomposition, reduces the amount of variables to be analyzed and subsequently allows the classification of the disturbances using artificial intelligence techniques; storage is advantageous because the vectors of energy levels of approximation in databases used less amount of space required for a temporary signal, and employing a reversible DWT, it's also possible to reconstruct the state variable.","AC motors; Electric machines; Power quality; Voltage sags; Wavelet analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863703137

These discrepancies arise, because in most cases, electrodes are prepared with the powdered alloy supported within a porous matrix, constituted by carbon and additive binders such as PTFE. The main drawback, of this preparation technique, for the identification of kinetic parameters, is the uncertainty in the specific active area value, where the hydrogen evolution and absorption processes take place. To overcome the disadvantages described, a new type of electrode, was designed, using a single particle of AB5 and AB 2 hydride forming alloys. The data obtained from electrochemical impedance measurements were adjusted in terms of a physicochemical model that takes into account the processes of hydrogen evolution and absorption coupled to hydrogen diffusion. From the study it can be concluded that the differences in the behavior of the AB5 and AB2 alloys, presenting the first best performance during the activation and operation at high discharge currents, are mainly due to higher values of the exchange current density and the diffusion coefficient of H for the AB5 alloy.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of light-curing units, curing mode techniques and storage media on sorption, solubility and biaxial flexural strength (BFS) of a composite resin. Material and Methods: Two hundred and forty specimens were made of one composite resin (Esthet-X) in a stainless steel mold (2 mm x 8 mm Ø), and divided into 24 groups (n=10) established according to the 4 study factors: light-curing units: quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) lamp and light-emitting diodes (LED); energy densities: 16 J/cm2 and 20 J/cm2; curing modes: conventional (CM) and pulse-delay (PD); and permeants: deionized water and 75% ethanol for 28 days. Sorption and solubility tests were performed according to ISO 4049:2000 specifications. All specimens were then tested for BFS according to ASTM F394-78 specification. Data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA followed by Tukey, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (a=0.05). Results: In general, no significant differences were found regarding sorption, solubility or BFS means for the light-curing units and curing modes (p&gt;0.05). Only LED unit using 16 J/cm2 and PD using 10 s produced higher sorption and solubility values than QTH. Otherwise, using CM (16 J/cm2), LED produced lower values of BFS than QTH (p&lt;0.05). 75% ethanol permeant produced higher values of sorption and solubility and lower values of BFS than water (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Ethanol storage media produced more damage on composite resin than water. In general the LED and QTH curing units using 16 and 20 J/cm2 by CM and PD curing modes produced no influence on the sorption, solubility or BFS of the tested resin.","Composite resins; Mechanical phenomena; Solubility; Solvents",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863000472

The basic raw material for the beer production is the malting barley whose quality is of primary significance. Therefore, barley must be able to germinate vigorously and be post-harvest mature to meet these requirements. We find out to what extent barley physiological parameters influence the changes of malt technological parameters during post-harvest storage. The malt technological parameters investigated were the extract, relative extract at 45°C, Kolbach index, apparent final attenuation, friability, and wort β-glucan in relation to the germination energy and germination index. On the basis of the results obtained, it was found out that the germination index is the most suitable physiological parameter in view of the correlations with malt technological parameters, mainly the extract (r = 0.57) and relative extract at 45°C (r = 0.77). The germination index could be therefore used in the malting industry as a suitable indicator of the malting potential.","Barley; Germination; Malt; Technological parameters","Beer; Cultivation; Enzyme activity; Physiology; Barley; Germination; Germination energy; Germination index; Malt; Physiological parameters; Post-harvest storage; Technological parameters; Physiological models; Hordeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862571025

Karpathos and Kasos are two small islands, located in the South-East Aegean Sea (Dodecanese complex) that are not connected to the main power distribution network. Energy production is based exclusively on an autonomous thermal power plant and a small wind park, installed on the island of Karpathos. The maximum annual power demand has been estimated to exceed 12. MW by 2014. The mean specific annual energy production cost from the existing system has been calculated at 0.249 €/kW. h in 2008.The proposed system aims at the maximisation of wind energy penetration and the minimisation of imported fossil fuel use for the production of electricity. The proposed system consists of a wind park and a pumped storage system (PSS). The introduced power system aims to guarantee power production for certain hours per day. A thorough sitting of the system is accomplished. Three different sites for the PSS installation are examined before the optimum is selected. The available wind potential of the islands was evaluated using a wind mast installed within the frame of the examined project's feasibility study. The annual mean wind velocity at the wind park's installation site was measured to be higher than 11.5. m/s. The introduced system's set-up, and operation & maintenance cost parameters have been estimated. The dimensioning of the system aims mainly at optimising the project's economic indexes, following the existing legislative framework. The annual guaranteed energy production has also been maximised. An economic sensitivity analysis is performed. It is estimated that the proposed project can exhibit attractive economic indexes, regardless of the availability of a subsidy, on the condition that the selling price of energy should be configured at 0.3552 €/kW. h and the selling price of guaranteed power should be 127 €/kW. year. Under the above mentioned prerequisites, the project payback period is estimated at 5-6. years.

This actually results from the fact that despite the excellent wind potential of most of these islands, the wind energy contribution is significantly restricted from limits imposed to protect the remote electrical grids from possible instability problems, due to the stochastic wind speed behavior and the variable electricity consumption. On the basis of probability distribution of the load demand of a representative Greek island and the corresponding data related to the available wind potential, the present study estimates the maximum - acceptable by the local grid - wind energy contribution. For that reason, an integrated computational algorithm has been developed from first principles, based on a stochastic analysis. According to the results obtained, it becomes evident that with the current wind turbine technology, wind energy cannot play a key role in coping with the electrification problems encountered in many Greek island regions, excluding however the case of introducing bulk energy storage systems that may provide considerable recovery of the remarkable wind energy rejections expected. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Autonomous electrical grid; Computational algorithm; Technical minima; Thermal engine; Wind energy rejection; Wind potential","Algorithms; Electric generators; Electric utilities; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Bulk-energy storage systems; Computational algorithm; Electrical grids; Electrical networks; Electricity distribution networks; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Electricity-consumption; Energy contribution; Instability problems; Load demand; Local grids; Power station; Remote islands; Renewable energy source; Stochastic analysis; Stochastic winds; Technical minima; Wind potential; Wind turbine technology; Wind power; algorithm; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; electrification; energy conservation; estimation method; numerical model; stochasticity; wind power; wind turbine; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862328973

Increasing the reliability of the PV system requires higher installed peak power (Pm) and larger battery storage capacity (CL). This leads to increased costs, and makes PV technology less competitive. This research paper presents a new stochastic simulation model for stand-alone PV systems, developed to determine the minimum installed Pm and CL for the PV system to be energy independent. The stochastic simulation model developed, makes use of knowledge acquired from an in-depth statistical analysis of the solar radiation data for the site, and simulates the energy delivered, the excess energy burnt, the load profiles and the state of charge of the battery system for the month the sizing is applied, and the PV system performance for the entire year. The simulation model provides the user with values for the autonomy factor d, simulating PV performance in order to determine the minimum Pm and CL depending on the requirements of the application, i.e. operation with critical or non-critical loads. The model makes use of NASA's Surface meteorology and Solar Energy database for the years 1990-2004 for various cities in Europe with a different climate. The results obtained with this new methodology indicate a substantial reduction in installed peak power and battery capacity, both for critical and non-critical operation, when compared to conventional approaches applied in PV sizing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Stand-alone PV sizing; Statistical analysis of solar radiation data; Stochastic simulation","Climate models; Computer simulation; NASA; Solar radiation; Statistical methods; Stochastic models; Sun; Battery capacity; Battery storage; Battery systems; Conventional approach; Excess energy; Load profiles; Peak power; PV performance; PV system; PV system sizing; Radiation fluctuations; Research papers; Simulation model; Solar radiation data; Stand-alone PV sizing; Stand-alone PV systems; State of charge; Stochastic simulation model; Stochastic simulations; Substantial reduction; Photovoltaic effects; database; energy efficiency; numerical model; photovoltaic system; solar radiation; statistical analysis; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862327330

It is composed mainly of parabolic trough solar collectors, a 16kW LiBr double effect absorption chiller associated with a cooling tower, a backup heater, two tanks for storage and drain-back storage and a set of fan-coils installed in the building to be conditioned. The system was run in the summers 2008 and 2009 using a water solution as heat transfer medium (HTF) without storage. In summer 2010, thermal oil was used as a HTF instead of water and two tanks were added, one for temperatures stabilities and the other one as a backup tank for night storage. Two running strategies of the installation were adopted; starting with or without backup heater. The site specifications, the building loads, the chillier temperatures and heat flows, the parabolic trough solar collector efficiencies, the installation powers and performances were analyzed. It was found that the coefficient of performance COP was ranged between 0.8 and 0.91 during the installation running while the solar coefficient of performance SCOP was between 0.1 and 0.43. The maximum output of the absorption chiller was around 12kW. The drain backup night storage has improved the average solar fraction SF of the system which increased from 0.54 to 0.77. The avoided CO2 emission during a cooling season was estimated to be about 3000kg corresponding to an equivalent energy saving of 1154l of gasoil. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Backup night storage; Double-effect absorption chiller; Parabolic trough solar collector; Solar cooling","Absorption cooling; Carbon dioxide; Heat transfer; Oil tanks; Refrigerators; Solar collectors; Water tanks; Absorption chillers; Building load; Coefficient of Performance; Double effect absorption chillers; Energy technologies; Equivalent energy; Maximum output; Parabolic trough; Solar cooling; Solar fraction; Tunisia; Water solutions; Solar energy; absorption; building; carbon emission; cooling; energy conservation; installation; solar activity; temperature effect; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862218376

A study of the sorption isotherms provides the information necessary to fit the drying and packaging parameters. Thus, this trial aimed to collect sorption isotherm data for albumen dried in a spout fluidised bed, correlated by several classical mathematical models. Samples of albumen containing 3.1% moisture on a dry weight basis (d.b.), underwent adsorption at 5, 10, 15, 25, 40 and 70°C in environments with controlled water activity, ranging from 0.1 to 0.93, until reaching the equilibrium moisture content, and the experimental data was applied to the Sigma-Copace, Sabbah, Oswin, modified Henderson, modified Halsey, Copace and Smith models. It was concluded that the equations matched the experimental data well for the ranges of temperature and relative humidity studied. The Sigma-Copace model was the one that best represented the hygroscopicity of the product, with a magnitude of adjustment of 0.95, mean relative deviation of 22.98 and root mean square error of 2.41. The isosteric heat of sorption was evaluated by means of the Classius-Clapeyron equation. The Vivanco-Pezantes equation best described the behaviour of the net isosteric heat, which increased due to the lower water availability of the product. This equation presented a magnitude of adjustment of 0.98 and mean relative deviation of 4.53. The Vivanco-Pezantes model predicted the values for the isosteric heat of the albumen powder more accurately than the traditional models, and indicated that below 20% d.b., the water became more tightly bound, requiring larger amounts of energy to dry the egg white.","Egg white; Equilibrium moisture content; Isosteric heat; Mathematical modelling","albumin; water; absorption; adsorption; article; copace model; dry weight; fluidized bed; food packaging; freeze drying; halsey modified model; henderson modified model; humidity; isotherm; mathematical model; moisture; nonhuman; oswin model; sabbah model; sigma copace model; smith model; sorption isotherm; spout fluidized bed; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862165320

The basic MPC architecture is described in relation with the PFCV operating regimes. Two MPC architectures are derived from the basic MPC architecture: (1) the MPC1 architecture, which is the MPC architecture without reverse power flow during regenerative braking process, and (2) the MPC2 architecture - MPC architecture without charging mode of Energy Storage System (ESS) from the FC system. Taking in account the imposed window for the ESS state-of-charge, the MPC can be connected to Plug-in Charging Stations (PCS) to exchange power with the Electric Power (EP) system, which will include renewable Distributed Generation (DG) systems. The Energy Management Unit (EMU) of MPC can communicate with the EP system to determine the moments that match the energy demand of plug-in vehicle with the supply availability of the EP system, stabilizing the EP system.

First, Mg nanoparticles were synthesized by thermal desorption of bipyridyl complex of Mg and then MgH2 nanoparticles were obtained by hydriding the Mg nanoparticles. Composite mixtures (MgH2 + TiC) were prepared using high-energy ball milling.

Solid fuel grain, the most important part of any solid fuel system, responds viscoelastically to any loading condition. For the assessment of the service life of any solid fuel system, the solid fuel grain has to be structurally evaluated in applied storage conditions. Structural integrity of the grain is exceptionally significant to guarantee the successful operation of the solid fuel system. In this work, numerical simulations have been performed to assess the mechanical stresses and strains induced in an HTPB based solid fuel grain during service life employing ABAQUS standard FEA software using 4-node bilinear quadrilateral elements. For finite element analysis (FEA), typical 2-D and π/nth axisymmetric section of 5-point (n) star grain geometry is considered. Mechanical loads include the horizontal or vertical 1-g (solid fuel weight) storage condition. The simulation results are compared with the analytical results for the same grain geometry. Analytically measured slump deflections in grain segment at various storage times have been found in good relation with the FEA based simulation results.

The aim of our research is to provide the needed information to make a judgment or a decision of adopting the most preferred solar technology in terms of installation and development using fuzzy set methodology. The criteria of the evaluation were based on different parameters, i.e., power capacity, efficiency, availability, capacity factor, storage capability, cost, maturity, water usage, land usage, and safety.

Increased cholesterol is a causative factor in the etiology of atherosclerotic diseases. About 60% of plasma cholesterol is normally found in LDL fraction; 25% in the HDL fraction; while the rest of Cholesterol is present in VLDL variety. High density lipoproteins are also mainly Cholesterol esters. They are scavengers of Cholesterol and their function is to transport Cholesterol from the tissues to the Liver. HMG-co A reductase inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia due to their efficacy in reducing blood LDL-Cholesterol. Here we report the Cholesterol lowering effect of generic Simvastatin products in comparison with the Original brand Zocor.

The increase of new resources, such as storage systems and demand response programs, results in additional computational efforts for optimization problems. On the other hand, since natural resources, such as wind and sun, can only be precisely forecasted with small anticipation, short-term scheduling is especially relevant requiring a very good performance on large dimension problems. Traditional techniques such as Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) do not cope well with large scale problems. This type of problems can be appropriately addressed by metaheuristics approaches. This paper proposes a new methodology called Signaled Particle Swarm Optimization (SiPSO) to address the energy resources management problem in the scope of smart grids, with intensive use of DER. The proposed methodology's performance is illustrated by a case study with 99 distributed generators, 208 loads, and 27 storage units. The results are compared with those obtained in other methodologies, namely MINLP, Genetic Algorithm, original Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Evolutionary PSO, and New PSO. SiPSO performance is superior to the other tested PSO variants, demonstrating its adequacy to solve large dimension problems which require a decision in a short period of time. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed energy resource scheduling; Mixed integer non-linear programming; Particle swarm optimization; Short-term scheduling","Distributed power generation; Energy resources; Genetic algorithms; Nonlinear programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling; Smart power grids; Computational effort; Demand response programs; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed generators; Large dimensions; Large-scale problem; Meta heuristics; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Optimization problems; Original particle swarm optimization; Resources management; Short periods; Short-term scheduling; Smart grid; Storage systems; Storage units; System operator; Traditional techniques; Problem solving; energy resource; genetic algorithm; natural resource; nonlinearity; optimization; resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860841857

In a conventional IGCC design without carbon capture, the syngas is purified for dust and hydrogen sulphide removal and then it is sent to a CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) for power generation. CCS (Carbon capture and storage) technologies are expected to play a significant role in the coming decades for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. IGCC is one of the power generation technologies having the highest potential to capture CO2 with low penalties in term of plant energy efficiency, capital and operational costs.

The replacement of ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles with EV equivalents poses challenges for grid operators while simultaneously offering opportunities in terms of distributed energy storage and flexible load.

Computer simulation technique is a useful tool for predicting building thermal and energy performance. Simulation computer programs require weather data input to drive the mathematical models within the simulation tools for comparative studies and annual energy estimation. Typical weather year data representing the long-term climatic conditions are often used. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in incorporating daylight in the architectural and building designs to reduce building energy consumption. However, daylight parameters are not always available. In 2003, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) adopted a range of 15 standard skies covering probably the whole spectrum of the usual skies in the world. Once the skies have been identified, the basic solar irradiance and daylight illuminance at various inclined planes can be obtained. This paper presents the work on the development and evaluation of two typical weather datasets, namely Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) and Test Reference Year (TRY). Measured hourly weather data for the 30-year period from 1979 to 2008 were analysed. Building energy simulations were conducted to evaluate the two weather datasets. Daylight parameters were derived using luminous efficacy approach and the sky conditions were categorized based on common climatic variables. © 2012.","Daylight illuminance; Dry-bulb temperature; Solar radiation; Standard sky; Typical weather year","Digital storage; Energy utilization; Lighting; Meteorology; Solar radiation; Building energy consumption; Building energy simulations; Daylight illuminance; Dry bulb temperature; International Commission; Standard skies; Typical meteorological year; Typical weather years; Buildings; building; climate conditions; computer simulation; data set; energy use; solar radiation; standard (reference); weather; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860217038

In addition, they can operate like mobile energy storage units when idling to store energy and feed it back to the grid. When the vehicle is parked (at work or at home), the PHEV battery would be recharged from the power grid and would thus allow for a reduction in the overall fuel consumption. This paper proposes a novel integrated power electronics interface for PHEVs, which consists of a novel multi-device interleaved DC/DC converter (MDIC) and Eight-Switch Inverter (ESI), in order to reduce the cost, the mass and the size of the power electronics interface (PEI) used in PHEVs while yielding high performance at any operating mode. In the proposed topology, Eight-Switch Inverter (ESI) is able to function as a bidirectional single-phase AC/DC battery charger/ vehicle to grid (V2G) and to transfer electrical energy between the DC-link (connected to the battery) and the electric traction system as three-phase DC/AC inverter. In addition, a novel multi-device interleaved DC/DC converter is proposed for interfacing the ESI to a low-voltage input source (such as Fuel Cell and battery) in order to minimize the input current/output voltage ripples and to improve the efficiency of the DC system with lower passive components size. The proposed topology is designed and its dynamic performance is validated by using MATLAB/ Simulink The analytical and simulation results related to this research are presented. Finally, the proposed topology is experimentally verified with results obtained from the prototypes that have been built and tested in our laboratory. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Dual-loop controller; Eight-switch inverter (ESI); Indirect field oriented control (IFOC); Multi-Device interleaved converter (MDIC); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); PI controller; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860200408

However, the intermittence of most renewable resources when renewable energy provides a significant share of the energy mix can create problems to electricity grids, which can be minimized by energy storage systems that are usually not available or expensive. An alternative solution consists on the use of demand side management strategies, which can have the double effect of reducing electricity consumption and allowing greater efficiency and flexibility in the grid management, namely by enabling a better match between supply and demand.This work analyzes the impact of demand side management strategies in the evolution of the electricity mix of Flores Island in the Azores archipelago which is characterized by high shares of renewable energy and therefore the introduction of more renewable energy sources makes it an interesting case study for testing innovative solutions.The electricity generation system is modeled in TIMES, a software which optimizes the investment and operation of wind and hydro plants until 2020 based on scenarios for demand growth, deployment of demand response technologies in the domestic sector and promotion of behavioral changes to eliminate standby power.

The role of genetics has also been extensively studied. However, the substantial augmentation of obesity prevalence in the last 20 years cannot be justified only by genetic alterations that, theoretically, would have occurred in such a short time. Thus, the difference in obesity prevalence in various population groups is also related to environmental factors, especially diet and the reduction of physical activity. These aspects, interacting or not with genetic factors, could explain the excess of body fat in large proportions worldwide.

This question is leading to one of the most important debates these days. Even if oil resources are only decreasing slowly (but surely), other options to power the future are essential in consideration of climate changes due to greenhouse gas emissions. An obvious solution can be found looking at the perpetual solar energy supply, especially in regions with high availability of sun irradiation. Converting this renewable energy with wind turbines or photovoltaic or solar power plants is common by now. But storing and using the electric energy generated with these technologies is quite difficult because of low energy densities obtained from current battery technologies. By contrast, hydrogen energy storage has the advantage of its higher energy density. It can be used, for example, for auxiliary power units (APUs) in combination with fuel cell systems, for powering automotive fuel cell-based drivetrains, or for local energy supply in fuel cell power plants. Additionally, hydrogen can be transported easily by trucks or pipelines even over long distances and can be distributed and sold. From the economic perspective, with hydrogen and fuel cells some interesting business models can be developed. Investing in hydrogen production and storage equipment, fuel cell systems for APUs and vehicle drivetrains, or a hydrogen infrastructure, return on invest can be seen some years ahead by selling hydrogen or fuel cell systems to national and international customers with increased ecologic responsibility. Finally, in spite of the longer energy conversion chain for hydrogen compared to pure electrical energy storage, hydrogen with the described advantages generated from renewable energies used in fuel cells is definitely an economic and ecologic chance for a greener future. © 2012 National Association of Environmental Professionals.",,"climate change; ecological impact; economic impact; energy use; fuel cell; greenhouse gas; photovoltaic system; power plant; renewable resource; solar power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859457995

The aim of the tool is to decrease the difference between forecasted and actual wind power production. After the introduction of today's forecasting methods, the rule-based simulation tool is detailed. The operation of the tool is demonstrated using data of the Hungarian wind farms.

Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles with specific size and structural phase is crucial, for solar sell application. Monodispersed spherical colloids with minimum size variation (5% or less) is essential for the fabrication of photonic crystals. When sensitized with organic dyes or inorganic narrow band gap semiconductors, TiO2 can absorb light into the visible light region and convert solar energy into electrical energy for solar cell applications. TiO2 nanomaterials also have been widely studied for water splitting and hydrogen production due to their suitable electronic band structure given the redox potential of water.

The major studied parameters are the size and material of the spherical capsule, the volume flow rate and temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The effects of these parameters on the time for complete charging/discharging, the solidified/melted mass fraction, the charging/discharging rate, the energy stored/regain, and the energy recovery ratio (ERR) are studied.

A new estimate for the net poleward total energy transport is given. Comparison to satellite-derived radiation data proves thatERA-Interimis better suited for investigation of interannual variations of the global energy budget than available satellite data since these either cover a relatively short period of time or are too inhomogeneous in time. While much improved compared to the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), regionally averaged energy budgets of ERA-Interim show that strong anomalies of forecasted vertical fluxes tend to be partly compensated by unrealistically large forecasted energy storage rates. Discrepancies between observed and forecasted monthly mean tendencies can be taken as rough measure for the uncertainties involved in the ERA-Interim energy budget. ElNiño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is shown to have large impact on regional energy budgets, but strong compensation occurs between the western and eastern Pacific, leading to only small net variations of the total poleward energy transports (similar magnitude as the uncertainty of the computations).

It is shown that the conditions imposed by electric field strength and temperature alter the transition temperature, and lower the dielectric constant, the storage modulus, and the actuation performance. In the deflection experiments, under applied DC electric field, the deflection distances of the gels linearly increase with increasing electric field strength along with the dielectrophoresis forces above the electrical yield strength of 100 V/mm. The back and forth swinging occurs under the constant electric field strength between 525 and 550 V/mm due to the competition between the anion and cation movements within the ionic liquid. Electrostatic force microscope (EFM) is then employed to investigate the gel topology and the cationic channel and aggregation that control the actuation behavior. The Phy gel is shown here to be promising for actuator applications over other existing dielectric elastomers studied at a room temperature in terms of the electrical yield strength, the bending angle, the generated dielectrophoresis force, the energy density, the force density, the mechanical power, the power density, G′ at 1 rad/s at 0.25% strain, and the relatively high ′r,20Hz. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The liver-gut axis is important in the regulation of energy homeostasis, appetite behaviour, and production efficiency. The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the effect of dairy cow genotype on the expression profiles of genes involved in energy homeostasis in duodenal and hepatic tissue, and 2) the association between the expression of these genes across both tissues and with economically important production efficiency traits. The expression of 27 candidate genes involved in energy homeostasis, feed intake, and energy storage was measured by qPCR. Duodenal expression of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) genes was highest in HF. In contrast, hepatic expression of the leptin receptor (LEPR), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), protein kinase, AMP-activated, beta 1 (AMPKB1), and POMC genes was highest in the F1 cross. In the duodenum, positive correlations were observed between mRNA expression of anorectic peptides (POMC and GLP1R), whereas a negative correlation was detected between orexigenic (ghrelin) and anorectic (peptide YY) gene expression. A negative correlation was observed between duodenal POMC gene expression and both residual feed intake and milk production efficiency traits, while GLP1R gene expression was negatively correlated with milk production efficiency traits. A het-erotic effect was observed in hepatic expression of AMKPB1, IGF1R, LEPR, POMC in the F1 genotype, possibly mediating improved feed efficiency in cross-bred cows. In conclusion, key genes involved in energy homeostasis and appetite behaviour are differentially expressed due to cow genotype in a tissue-dependent fashion. POMC and GLP1R are potential candidate genes for the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms regulating energetic efficiency in the dairy cow, which may be incorporated into future breeding programmes. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","Absorption; Cattle; Gene expression; Genotypes; Nutrients","ghrelin; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; leptin receptor; messenger RNA; peptide YY; proopiomelanocortin; protein kinase; somatomedin C; somatomedin C receptor; animal genetics; article; dairy cattle; duodenum; energy balance; food intake; gastrointestinal tract function; gene expression; liver; milk production; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; productivity; Animals; Cattle; Crosses, Genetic; Duodenum; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genotype; Ghrelin; Homeostasis; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Liver; Male; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Receptors, Glucagon; Bos; Friesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856658500

To achieve optimum results, multi-dimensional AE analysis has been performed, combining Time Driven Data (TDD), Hit Driven Data (HDD) and long waveform streams acquired simultaneously. High-frequency AE sensors proved to be adequately sensitive to flat defects, and the received AE signal level fluctuations were in agreement with the single defect rotational frequency. Combined analysis of all available types of AE data in the time and frequency domain with specialized software reveals the full potential, of the method in providing high accuracy defect detection. The present paper presents the results of AE measurements performed during train passes, with different speeds & directions, where wagons without any wheel defects and ones containing known artificial flats were moving along the rails. AE features, like signal amplitude, duration, energy, average signal level etc. of AE signals are being analyzed and compared.

It is therefore important to quantify the effect of the prosthetic foot mechanism on biomechanical parameters, in order to prevent pressure ulcers and deep tissue injury. Our aim was to monitor the internal stresses in the residuum of transtibial amputation (TTA) prosthetic-users ambulating on different terrains, which the amputees encounter during their daily activities, i.e. paved floor, grass, ascending and descending stairs and slope. We specifically aimed to compare between the internal stresses in the TTA residuum of amputees ambulating with a novel hydraulic prosthetic foot compared to conventional energy storage and return (ESR) prosthetic feet. Monitoring of internal stresses was accomplished using a portable subject-specific real-time internal stress monitor. We found significant decrease (p<. 0.01) in peak internal stresses and in the loading rate of the amputated limb, while walking with the hydraulic foot, compared to walking with ESR feet. The loading rate calculated while ambulating with the hydraulic foot was at least three times lower than the loading rate calculated while ambulating with the ESR foot. Although the average decrease in internal stresses was ∼2-fold larger when replacing single-toe ESR feet with the hydraulic foot than when replacing split-toed ESR feet with the hydraulic foot, the differences were statistically insignificant. Our findings suggest that using a hydraulic prosthetic foot may protect the distal tibial end of the TTA residuum from high stresses, therefore preventing pressure-related injury and pain. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Deep tissue injury; ECHELON; Foot/ankle mechanism; Pressure ulcer; Rehabilitation","adult; article; biomechanics; calculation; clinical article; conventional energy stored prosthetic foot; decubitus; foot orthosis; human; hydraulic energy stored prosthetic foot; leg amputation; leg prosthesis; male; mechanical stress; parameters; priority journal; tissue injury; transtibial amputation; walking; Adult; Amputation Stumps; Artificial Limbs; Biomechanics; Foot; Gait; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prosthesis Design; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855980433

Possible applications for such small-scale power systems are mountain cabins, remote islands, and telecommunication stations, among others. The basic idea in this particular power system configuration was to make it as simple as possible; the fuel cell and the metal hydride unit were air-cooled, and the components were connected in parallel without DC/DC converters. The only control action possible in the power system (presented in this study) was to switch the components either ON or OFF. However, connecting the components electrically in parallel without DC/DC converters gives no degrees of freedom regarding the ability to regulate power and voltage levels of the different components.

However, the relationship of moisture content modulation to the mechanics of the whole hoof is unknown. This study explores the effect of moisture variation on hoof capsule mechanics and, in particular, deflections and stored elastic energy variations in the hoof. A finite element model of the hoof was used. The hoof capsule tissue was modelled using finite elasticity with a heterogeneous transversely isotropic material relation, in which the elastic parameters were varied according to the moisture content of the tissue. The laminar junction and sole corium were modelled using an exponential Fung-type constitutive relation fitted to published data. The distal phalanx bone was modelled as a homogeneous isotropic material. Substrate interaction was modelled by contact with a rigid plate and loads typical of a trot were applied. Different scenarios were modelled where the moisture content of the hoof wall was varied from 40% to 100% of the fully hydrated case. Results demonstrated that hoof capsule deflections and stored elastic energy in the capsule increased monotonically with increasing moisture content. Stored energy in the laminar junction and sole corium remained constant. The mechanical behaviour of the hoof capsule is sensitive to variation in moisture content and this mechanism may provide a way to modulate impact energy transmission. Experimental validations of hoof models should control for moisture content to improve reliability. © 2011 IAgrE.",,"Biomechanics; Bone; Digital storage; Elasticity; Hydration; Moisture control; Moisture determination; Tissue; Constitutive relations; Elastic parameters; Experimental validations; Isotropic materials; Mechanical behaviour; Moisture variation; Substrate interaction; Transversely isotropic materials; Finite element method; Equidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855759457

Hearts isolated from diabetic rats showed a significant increase in myocardial fat content, a significant decrease in GLUT4, and an increase in acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme mRNA (p < 0.05). Ghrelin administration for 10 days caused a significant improvement in lipid profile, HOMA index, and body mass, and significantly corrected the myocardial mass, significantly reduced the fat content of the myocardium, significantly increased GLUT4, and decreased acyl CoA oxidase mRNA (p < 0.05).

The aim of haymaking is to store feed for later on-farm use. Traditional haymaking practice in Ethiopia has many problems. Delayed or early harvesting, improper handling system during harvesting, transportation, and storage stages are identified as main causes of feed loss. This project is, therefore, intended to evaluate and demonstrate manual hay presses so as to assist users in haymaking and baling practice. Two hay press models, vertical and horizontal hay presses, were manufactured and after preliminary test, practical on field test was conducted at two sites. Besides, discussions were made with farmers and their opinions were recorded. The test result has shown that, the average pressing rate, bale density, and baling time of vertical hay press was 45.2 kg h-1, 86.5 kg m -3 and 14.1 min per piece. Likewise, similar parameters of the horizontal type were 36.9 kg hr-1, 72.3 kg m -3 and 17.4 min per piece, respectively. It was observed that most of the respondent farmers preferred vertical type press due to its lower energy requirement and better output. Therefore, the vertical hay press model is recommended for further promotion.","Animal feed; Hay making; Mechanical hay press","Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855438985

Systems incorporating both standard and condensing gas instantaneous water heaters are evaluated. An experimental method was developed to characterize the steady-state performance of the gas booster and the resulting performance equation incorporated in a TRNSYS model of the solar water heater to assess gas consumption. Using this method, annual gas consumption is found to be 15% higher than calculated by a current standard where gas booster efficiency is held constant regardless of water flow rate or temperature.

First, voxel intensity similarity may not be necessarily equivalent to anatomical similarity in the image correspondence searching process. Second, during the imaging process, some interferences such as unexpected rotations of input volumes and monotonic gray-level bias fields can adversely affect the registration quality. In this paper, a new feature-based nonrigid image registration method is proposed. The proposed method is based on a new type of image feature, namely, uniform spherical region descriptor (USRD), as signatures for each voxel. The USRD is rotation and monotonic gray-level transformation invariant and can be efficiently calculated. The registration process is therefore formulated as a feature matching problem. The USRD feature is integrated with the Markov random field labeling framework in which energy function is defined for registration. The energy function is then optimized by the α-expansion algorithm. The proposed method has been compared with five state-of-the-art registration approaches on both the simulated and real 3-D databases obtained from the BrainWeb and Internet Brain Segmentation Repository, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high registration accuracy and reliable robustness behavior. © 2011 IEEE.","Monotonic gray-level transformation invariant; nonrigid image registration; rotation invariant; uniform spherical region descriptor (USRD)","Anatomical similarity; Bias field; Brain segmentation; Descriptors; Energy functions; Feature matching; Feature-based; Gray-level; Gray-level transformation; Image correspondence; Image features; Imaging process; Markov Random Fields; Nonrigid image registration; Registration accuracy; Registration process; rotation invariant; Voxel intensities; Arts computing; Image matching; Image segmentation; Rotation; Spheres; Image registration; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; histology; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84255199089

However, due to new energy-saving climate control, current strategies might result in inappropriate irrigation. Because of the limited water buffering capacity of soilless growing media like rockwool, this could have adverse effects on fruit production and quality. We present an overview of tomato plant ecophysiological responses to substrate water availability to allow the evaluation of mechanistic hypotheses about internal plant water storage and depletion and reversible stem-fruit water transport. Methods: The hydraulic properties of the growing medium were determined and plant water uptake, stem and fruit diameter variations were studied. Results: A low substrate matric suction (-2 to -3 kPa) had a significant effect on stem and fruit growth dynamics. The substrate water retention curve indicated a sharp decrease in hydraulic conductivity, limiting the water availability for plant roots significantly. Conclusions: The hydraulic properties of the growing medium are of utmost importance for plant water uptake, and should therefore be incorporated in plant models describing water flow. Internally stored water responds instantaneously to varying water availability and rates of water backflow from tomato fruits can be quite substantial. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Growth; Hydraulic conductivity; Modelling; Rockwool; Solanum lycopersicum L.; Stem diameter; Transpiration; Water relations; Water uptake","adaptation; agricultural production; ecophysiology; energy conservation; fruit; growth; hydraulic property; irrigation; numerical model; sap flow; solar radiation; transpiration; water availability; water retention; water uptake; Lycopersicon esculentum; Solanum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83555179228

In this regard, the building sector has a high potential for improving the quality match between energy supply and demand because high temperature sources are used to meet low-temperature heating needs. Low exergy (or LowEx) systems are defined as heating or cooling systems that allow the use of low valued energy, which is delivered by sustainable energy sources (i.e., through heat pumps, solar collectors, either separate or linked to waste heat, energy storage) as the energy source. These systems practically provide heating and cooling energy at a temperature close to room temperature while the so-called LowEx approach, which has been and still being successfully used in sustainable buildings design. The present study comprehensively reviews the studies conducted on LowEx heating and cooling systems for establishing the sustainable buildings. In this context, an introductory information is given first. Next, energy utilization and demand in buildings are summarized while various exergy definitions and sustainability aspects along with dead (reference) state are described. LowEx heating and cooling systems are then introduced. After that, LowEx relations used to estimate energy and exergy demand in buildings and key parameters for performance assessment and comparison purposes are presented. Finally, LowEx studies and applications conducted are reviewed while the last section concludes.

During constant operating conditions, the drying kinetic of the sludge has shown mainly: a constant drying rate, one or two falling rate periods and a final short period with variations along the process of the physical properties of the product with the appearance of shrinkage and cracks phenomena. Solar drying was benefit as using free solar energy can reduce the cost of the operation. On the other hand, it plays an important role for the pathogen reduction until Environmental protection Agency (EPA) recommendations. In some studied cases, the value of 1000 CFU g -1 DS, which represents the EPA Class A pathogen requirement, for fecal coliform was attained. The general design of used solar dryers was constituted of: a greenhouse made with transparent material and a floor, where the product is speared in thick layers. Furthermore, fans and ventilations can be used in order to have homogeneous distribution of the air inside the greenhouse with replacement of humidified air with fresh one. Automatic or handle mix of the product was used once or for several times a day. In order to increase the performances of the drying system, other ways such as heating the floor using solar water heater, infrared lamps, using heat pumps or adding thermal energy storage systems were also tested. Covered solar drying has given better results than open solar drying. However, the origin of the wastewater sludge affects the obtained results.

The continuous research for an alternative power source due to the perceived scarcity of fuel fossils is its driving force. It had become even more popular as the cost of fossil fuel continues to rise. Of all the renewable sources of energy available, solar energy is the most abundant one and is available in both direct as well as indirect forms. Solar energy applications were divided mainly into two categories: the first is the direct conversion to electricity using solar cells (electrical applications). The second is the thermal applications. The latter include solar heating, solar cooling, solar drying, solar cooking, solar ponds, solar distillation, solar furnaces, solar-thermal power generation, solar water heating, solar air heating, etc. Detailed description, fundamentals and previous work performed on solar dryers and solar air heaters, as the vital element for the indirect and mixed modes of solar dryers, were presented in the present review paper. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It measures 2,300mm long, 600mm wide and 1,100mm high and consists of 50mm × 50mm mild steel angle iron and aluminium sheet wrapped all over it. The interior of the dryer is painted black to ensure maximum heat retention within the system for faster drying. The multipurpose dryer is constructed with the incorporation of vents to enable uniform air circulation within the system. This is to facilitate uniform drying of specimens. The development of the dryer is to help minimize losses of agricultural produce by drying them to the required moisture content that will enable them to be kept in storage. The dryer was used to determine the moisture content of coconut meat and it was found to be 53.47% and 1.15% wet and dry basis respectively. The dryer could be used to dry all agricultural produce to the required moisture content that will enable them to be preserved. This is achieved by selecting the appropriate temperature graduated on the dryer. The equipment has hot air at a velocity of 18.7m/s distributed uniformly across specimen trays in the drying chamber. As the hot air passes over agricultural produce in trays, the drying process takes place. It has been found that the multipurpose dryer is suitable for drying agricultural produce and other allied produce to the required moisture content up to a maximum temperature of 110°C. The dryer efficiency was determined to be 75%. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Agricultural produce; Dryers; Machine design; Moisture content; Storage","Agricultural produce; Air circulation; Dryer efficiency; Drying chambers; Drying process; Heat retention; Hot air; Hot-air-pass; Maximum temperature; Moisture contents; Performance evaluation; Wet and dry; Agricultural machinery; Carbon steel; Dryers (equipment); Drying; Energy storage; Engineering research; Machine design; Moisture; Moisture determination; Driers (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81855185770

The first and the second reactors were shut down by the end of 2004 and by the end of 2009, respectively. During operation, the power plant has accumulated large quantities of radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel. As a result of the decision to implement immediate dismantling strategy for the decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, quantities of radioactive waste to be managed within the next 10-20 years will increase significantly. Therefore, a reliable and effective management of radioactive waste has become a key to the Lithuania's nuclear programme. The paper describes key aspects of the Lithuania's national policy and strategy in radioactive waste management, legislative and financing systems. The main emphasis is given to the progress in radioactive waste management practices. Projects on construction of new solid radioactive waste management and storage facility, disposal facilities for very low level short-lived radioactive waste and for low and intermediate level short-lived radioactive waste, new free release measurement facility, new spent nuclear fuel interim storage facility are in progress.

In this new system, the wind energy is directly converted to thermal energy used to heat the water. The wind energy is converted to frictional thermal energy by dissipation within a thin layer of oil. The oil is filled in an annular gap confined between two horizontal concentric cylinders with different diameters; the outer insulating cylinder is rotating while the inner cylinder is fixed. The heat generated is transferred into the inner cylinder then to the heat exchanger. The heat transfer fluid is carrying the heat from the heat exchanger to the water storage tank by mechanical pump. A mathematical model is proposed to model the system mechanical and thermal behavior. The theoretical model has been solved analytically to estimate the amount of thermal energy generated by the system based on a given wind design speed at the site. The theoretical performance of the proposed heater is analyzed and the effects of different design parameters on the heater performance are investigated. The theoretical predictions of the system performance show that the efficiency of proposed wind water heater at design wind speed is equal to 34.8%. The relatively low conversion efficiency of kinetic wind energy to sensible thermal one is due to the limitation imposed by the windmill performance. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Renewable energy; Water heater; Wind energy","Annular gap; Concentric cylinders; Design parameters; Design wind speed; Heat transfer fluids; Inner cylinder; Mechanical pump; New design; Renewable energies; System-based; Theoretical models; Theoretical performance; Theoretical prediction; Thermal behaviors; Thin layers; Water storage tanks; Wind design; Aerospace engineering; Conversion efficiency; Cylinders (shapes); Design; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Thermal energy; Water heaters; Wind power; Mathematical models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81255158267

In the both states, it was found that X prefers Mg 2Ni-X to Mg-Ni-X solid solution, and that the preference is stronger in the hydrided state. The effect is more pronounced for elements X from the 13th group. Suggested explanation was based on influence of X on the formation enthalpy of hydrides.

The products obtained were characterized, and their physicochemical properties (i.e. surface hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and polypeptide composition) were evaluated at different storage conditions. All the procedures evaluated resulted in sunflower protein concentrates with high protein solubility (>60%) but with different chemical composition, color, and physicochemical properties. The products exhibited intense coloration and antioxidant properties due to their residual phenolic compounds content. The addition of an isoelectric precipitation step increased the protein content and the removal of phenolic compounds. The resulting concentrates exhibited high protein digestibility in vitro, even in the presence of phenolic compounds, and maintained high protein solubility for at least 6 months of storage. During this period, only structural changes in proteins were observed, as evidenced by their surface hydrophobicity. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to produce sunflower protein concentrates with high solubility on a pilot plant scale, using sunflower oilcake as starting material. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Phenolic compounds; Pilot plant scale; Storage; Sunflower oilcake; Sunflower protein concentrates","Antioxidant properties; Chemical compositions; Helianthus annuus; High solubility; In-vitro; Isoelectric precipitation; Phenolic compounds; Physicochemical property; Pilot plant scale; Protein concentrates; Protein contents; Protein digestibility; Protein solubility; Removal of phenolic compounds; Storage condition; Structural change; Sunflower oilcake; Sunflower protein concentrates; Surface hydrophobicity; Energy storage; Hydrophobicity; Manufacture; Phenols; Pilot plants; Solubility; Storage (materials); Proteins; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052968879

Various technologies are available for low temperature energy storage. In the present work, a solar-assisted ejector cooling system with latent heat cold storage and conventional auxiliary heating was considered. The latter was applied in order to assure constant operating conditions for the ejector cycle. The analysis was carried out for an office building with cooling requirements during working hours only. The capacity of the cold storage was selected to ensure full coverage of the cooling load throughout the periods with cooling requirements. A quantitative energy analysis is presented, assessing the influence of parameters such as rated system power, ejector energy efficiency, solar collector area, ejector operating conditions and the amount of energy from the auxiliary source. Two energy efficiency parameters were defined, based on which the optimum system configuration and operating principle were identified. The advantages of each configuration were described. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Ejector cooling system; Energy conversion; Solar assisted cooling; Solar energy; Thermal energy storage","Airconditioning systems; Auxiliary heating; Auxiliary source; Cooling load; Efficiency parameters; Ejector cooling system; Ejector cycle; Energy analysis; Low temperature energy; Low temperatures; Operating condition; Operating principles; Solar assisted cooling; Solar cooling; System configurations; Working hours; Air conditioning; Air ejectors; Cold storage; Collector efficiency; Cooling; Cooling systems; Ejectors (pumps); Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Flywheels; Heat storage; Office buildings; Refrigerators; Solar radiation; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Solar energy; air conditioning; cooling; energy efficiency; energy flux; low temperature; office location; quantitative analysis; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961129677
