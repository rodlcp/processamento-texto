The comparison has been done with and without externality costs, and thus incorporates sustainability principles. The analysis is extended to investigate suitable solar cell technologies for an on-campus PV farm at Middle East Technical University Northern Cyprus Campus, with and without substantial storage support. The estimated economical break-even points of the PV system with battery storage as opposed to current fossil fuel based energy are approximately 15 and 17 years respectively for mono-crystalline silicon (Si) and multi-crystalline Si technology. Assuming the produced electricity can be stored to the grid through bi-directional power delivery, the economical break-even point can be reduced to 6 to 7 years depending on utilized technology. The electricity generation cost of grid-tied PV system at university with multi-crystalline Si technology has already become competitive against that of the grid electricity in Northern Cyprus. Therefore PV electricity production can be expected to significantly contribute to electricity production in Northern Cyprus in near future based on the analysis in this paper.","Northern Cyprus; Photovoltaic technology; Pv feasibility; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891120141

Their respective trap depths are of 1.37, 1.35, and 0.86 eV. The latest, although rather shallow, gave TL at the highest temperature (around 300 C) due to a very low frequency factor of 6 × 106 s-1. The most efficient thermoluminescence was observed from material containing 0.1% of Tb and 0.2% of Hf and prepared in a vacuum. Analogous compositions made in air or forming gas also stored energy, and their glow curves were very similar in shape. The glow band faded at ambient conditions by about 50% within 5 days, much faster than predicted by the Arrhenius-type behavior. Thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence (with 400-440 nm light) produced the green emission of Tb 3+ ion, exclusively. High energy UV- or X-ray photons induced a broad band absorption in the range of 320-500 nm with maximum around 375 nm. This band could be bleached out by continuous irradiation into it or by heating.

In the international technical literature, there are many different optimization models and methods available to approach this planning problem. However, the models described in literature only take in consideration the classic expansion strategies (i.e. investing in capacity; additional cables and transformers), and hardly any study takes into account 'smart grid' planning solutions. Demand-side management, storage, and active distribution network concepts are not (yet) taken seriously by utilities as viable alternatives in the planning process. Therefore, this paper will focus on smart grid planning solutions. Different approaches for dealing with these planning solutions are discussed. Moreover, requirements will be stated how to integrate smart grid solutions in future distribution network planning (tools). For a complete and comparison view, the classic (expansion) planning strategies are also treated in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.","decision support tools; distribution system; energy storage; medium voltage; optimization; Power system planning; smart grids","Decision support tools; Distribution systems; Medium voltage; Power system planning; Smart grid; Decision support systems; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Optimization; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890889153

Measuring by pickups the relative vertical orbit shift of two beams, caused by the presence of βx field, one could cancel the unwanted MDM spin precession, which mimics the EDM signal. By proper choice of the bending electric and magnetic field values one could make rational the ratio of the revolution frequencies of two beams.

Use of the Forth language allows to interactively develop and run complex testing or debugging routines. The solution is based on a small, 16-bit soft core CPU, used to implement the Forth Virtual Machine. Thanks to the use of the tethered Forth model it is possible to minimize usage of the internal RAM memory in the FPGA. The function of the intelligent terminal, which is an essential part of the tethered Forth system, may be fulfilled by the standard PC computer or by the smartphone. System is implemented in Python (the software for intelligent terminal), and in VHDL (the IP core for FPGA), so it can be easily ported to different hardware platforms. The connection between the terminal and FPGA may be established and disconnected many times without disturbing the state of the FPGA based system. The presented system has been verified in the hardware, and may be used as a tool for debugging, testing and even implementing of control algorithms for FPGA based systems. © 2013 SPIE.","CPU; Forth; FPGA; Tethered Forth","CPU; Electronic systems; Forth; FPGA applications; Hardware platform; Intelligent terminal; Testing and debugging; Tethered Forth; Algorithms; Astronomy; Computer debugging; Computer software; Experiments; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); FORTH (programming language); Hardware; High energy physics; Random access storage; Program debugging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890677981

The generators on IS possess some substantial potentials, namely they are capable to generate both a series of single pulses and a series of pulse trains with a gigawatt power and high efficiency of the energy transfer to the load. In a number of works different variants of electric schemes for a high resource switch applicable to various loads in the mode of pulse series generation were proposed. The current work considers the option of the generator at the load with a resistive-dominated component and a vibrating microwave driver (gyrotron) was chosen as an example of the load. Among the problems in using microwave drivers is the thermal effect on the walls of the resonator construction and outlet glass. To solve this problem a method of step-by-step microwave driver switching in the mode of pulse series was offered. For this goal the electric scheme of two-stage opening switch was designed to generate series of pulses on the resistive load gigawatt power of millisecond duration. Features appearing in the scheme of the dc current break are also discussed. © 2013 IEEE.","generation of series pulses; inductive storage; microwave source; pulsed power","generation of series pulses; Inductive energy storage; Inductive storage; Microwave sources; Opening switch; Pulsed-power; Resistive loads; Single pulse; Capacitor storage; Electric generators; Electric switches; Energy transfer; Microwave resonators; Microwaves; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890467834

Newly developed fuel cells can operate in reverse mode as electrolyzer cells; therefore, they are becoming an attractive technology for energy storage grid-tie applications. In this application dc-dc converter optimization is very challenging due to the large voltage range that the converter is expected to operate. Moreover, the fuel-electrolyzer cell side of the converter is characterized by low voltage and high current. Dc-dc converter efficiency plays a fundamental role in the overall system efficiency since processed energy is always flowing through the converter; for this reason, loss analysis and optimization are a key component of the converter design. The paper presents an isolated full bridge boost dc-dc converter (IFBBC) designed for this new application focusing on losses analysis. The system topology is briefly discussed and the major concerns related to the system, cells stacks and converter operating points are analyzed. The dc-dc converter losses are modeled and presented in detail; the analysis is validated on adc-dc converter prototype rated at 6 kW 30-80 V 0-80 A on the low voltage side and 700-800 V on the high voltage side (for a grid-tie application). The prototype is based on fully planar magnetic, Si MOSFETs, Si IGBTs and SiC diodes; efficiencies up to ∼96.5% and ∼97.8% were demonstrated depending on the converter operating point. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy Storage; Fuel and Electrolyzer Cell; Isolated Full Bridge Boost Converter (IFBBC); Loss Analysis; Power Semiconductors","Bidirectional operation; Boost DC-DC converter; Converter efficiency; Electrolyzers; Full-bridge boost converter; Loss analysis; Power semiconductors; Renewable energy source; Electrolytic cells; Energy storage; Fuel cells; HVDC power transmission; MOSFET devices; Optimization; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Silicon; Silicon carbide; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890198061

Power electronic converters are modeled by nonlinear averaging methods to suit system-level studies. A unified model for bidirectional converters is proposed to avoid transitions between two separate models.

Dynamic energy losses are caused by the rolling resistance due to the rotational inertia of the idler rolls, the flexural deformation of the transported bulk material and the belt itself, and the indentation of the idler rolls into the belt surface. This paper presents an approach for the calculation of the indentation rolling resistance of pipe conveyors. The viscoelastic behaviour of the belt's rubber is modelled as a three-dimensional generalized model, with multiple Maxwell parameters, incorporated in a Winkler foundation model. The rheological behaviour of the pipe conveyor belt cover rubber was based on dynamic/mechanic analysis (DMA) that was measured with a tension test of a rubber sample from the frequency-temperature sweep test mode. The experimental data of dynamic moduli of the tested rubber were extended beyond the measured interval of frequencies based on the frequency-temperature superposition principle. Maxwell parameters were obtained by approximating the constructed master curves of the loss and storage moduli of the rubber. Finally the calculated results of the indentation rolling resistance factor of pipe belt conveyors were compared for a different number of Maxwell parameters.",,"Flexural deformations; Indentation rolling resistances; Maxwell viscoelastic models; Rheological behaviour; Rotational inertia; Superposition principle; Viscoelastic behaviour; Winkler foundation models; Belt conveyors; Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Materials handling equipment; Rolling resistance; Rubber; Tensile testing; Viscoelasticity; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890077565

This paper describes a new analytical method for determining the concentrated reaction forces of each of the rolls of the individual supporting idler stations of an empty pipe conveyor. The analytical model was linearized around a specific belt configuration, by applying distributed loads from the belt weight and from the belt stiffness to the pre-folded belt with initial pipe shape geometry. The opening load from the belt stiffness applied to the belt with prescribed geometry represents the effect of bending the belt from the initially flat shape to a pipe shape and enables avoidance of nonlinearities inherent to that belt folding process. The statically indeterminate linearized system is solved by employing the Method of Superposition, by replacing the support restraints with the appropriate redundant forces, and by assuming that the displacements are equal to zero at the supports. The displacements are obtained considering the strain energy of the system analytically using the Maxwell-Mohr Integral.

Dietary lysine was held at a constant concentration, just below the requirement. All other amino acids were balanced and equal in the diets. Arginine supplementation increased protein and fat accretion, without affecting the hepatosomatic or visceralsomatic indices. Dietary arginine correlated with putrescine in the liver (R 0·78, P= 0·01) and with ornithine in the muscle, liver and plasma (P= 0·0002, 0·003 and 0·0002, respectively). The mRNA of ornithine decarboxylase, the enzyme producing putrescine, was up-regulated in the white adipose tissue of fish fed the high-arginine inclusion compared with those fed the low-arginine diet. Concomitantly, spermidine/spermine-(N1)- acetyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine turnover that consumes acetyl-CoA, showed an increased activity in the liver of fish fed the arginine-supplemented diets. In addition, lower acetyl-CoA concentrations were observed in the liver of fish fed the high-arginine diet, while ATP, which is used in the process of synthesising spermidine and spermine, did not show a similar trend. Gene expression of the rate-limiting enzyme for β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, was up-regulated in the liver of fish fed the high-arginine diet. Taken together, the data support that increased dietary arginine activates polyamine turnover and β-oxidation in the liver of juvenile Atlantic salmon and may act to improve the metabolic status of the fish. © The Authors 2013.","Arginine; Atlantic salmon; Polyamines; Spermidine/spermine-(N1)- acetyltransferase","acetyl coenzyme A synthetase; acyltransferase; arginine; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; long chain fatty acid; lysine; messenger RNA; ornithine; ornithine decarboxylase; polyamine; putrescine; spermidine; spermine (N1) acetyltransferase; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; article; Atlantic salmon; concentration (parameters); controlled study; diet supplementation; energy metabolism; enzyme induction; enzyme metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression; growth; lipid storage; nonhuman; white adipose tissue; Acetyltransferases; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Aquaculture; Arginine; Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase; Diet; Dietary Proteins; Dietary Supplements; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme Induction; Fish Proteins; Isoenzymes; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Muscle, Skeletal; Ornithine; Ornithine Decarboxylase; Plant Proteins; Polyamines; Putrescine; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888332322

Melt infiltration originates from the field of ceramic nanomaterials and is based on the infiltration of porous matrices with the melt of an active phase or precursor. In recent years, it has become a technique for the preparation of advanced materials: nanocomposites, pore-confined nanoparticles, ordered mesoporous and nanostructured materials. Although certain restrictions apply, mostly related to the melting behavior of the infiltrate and its interaction with the matrix, this review illustrates that it is applicable to a wide range of materials, including metals, polymers, ceramics, and metal hydrides and oxides. Melt infiltration provides an alternative to classical gas-phase and solution-based preparation methods, facilitating in several cases extended control over the nanostructure of the materials. This review starts with a concise discussion on the physical and chemical principles for melt infiltration, and the practical aspects. In the second part of this contribution, specific examples are discussed of nanostructured functional materials with applications in energy storage and conversion, catalysis, and as optical and structural materials and emerging materials with interesting new physical and chemical properties. Melt infiltration is a useful preparation route for material scientists from different fields, and we hope this review may inspire the search and discovery of novel nanostructured materials. Melt infiltration has in recent years emerged as a preparation strategy for a wide range of advanced nanostructured materials, including metals, polymers, ceramics, and metal hydrides and oxides. In specific cases, it offers extended control over the nanostructure and the assembly of novel nanocomposites, facilitating the exploration of new functionalities and fundamental size and confinement effects. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recent Advances: A growing body of literature supports a specific role for vitamin C in a number of reactions that are associated with vascular function and control including, for example, nitric oxide bioavailability, lipid metabolism, and vascular integrity. Critical Issues: A large body of epidemiological evidence supports a relationship between poor vitamin C status and increased risk of developing CVD, and the prevalence of deficiency continues to be around 10%-20% of the general Western population although this problem could easily and cheaply be solved by supplementation. However, large intervention studies using vitamin C have not found a beneficial effect of supplementation. This review outlines the proposed mechanism by which vitamin C deficiency worsens CVD progression. In addition, it discusses problems with the currently available literature, including the discrepancies between the large intervention studies and the experimental and epidemiological literature. Future Directions: Increased insights into vitamin C deficiency-mediated CVD progression will enable the design of future randomized controlled trials that are better suited to test the efficacy of vitamin C in disease prevention as well as the identification of high-risk individuals which could possibly benefit from supplementation.

Furthermore, the superior properties of this material are interesting not only due to the increase in their intrinsic catalytic activity, but also due to the exceptional surface purity itself. The nanoparticles can be used directly (i.e., as-received, without any cleaning steps) in biomedical applications (i.e., as more efficient drug carriers due to an increased number of adsorption sites) and in energy-harvesting/data-storage devices.

However, a short life expectancy of adult individuals limits the feasibility of their use. Cocoons of the red mason bee, Osmia rufa L. (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), can be stored at 4° C in a postdiapause state, and adult bees can be used for pollination outside their natural flight period. The period of storage in this form has an unfavorable influence on the survival rate, life expectancy, and fertility of the bee. It was suggested that the negative results are connected with exhaustion of energy reserves. To test this hypothesis, the present study examined the contents of protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and the activities of some enzymes, and their degradation in red mason bees that emerged in spring according to their biological clock and in summer after elongated diapause. It was found that postdiapause artificially elongated by 3 months caused significant decreases in body weight, total sugar, glycogen, lipids, and protein content in O. rufa. Glucose level was highest in bees that emerged in the summer, which was coincident with increased activities of maltase and trehalase. The activities of sucrase and cellobiase were not changed, while amylase activity was considerably decreased. The activities of triacylglycerols lipase and C2, C4, C10 carboxylesterases were highest in bees that emerged in July. Low temperatures restrict O. rufa emergence, and during prolonged postdiapause, metabolic processes lead to significant reductions of structural and energetic compounds. © This is an open access paper.","diapause; enzymes; insect metabolism; solitary bees","animal; article; bee; carbohydrate metabolism; diapause; lipid metabolism; physiology; season; Animals; Bees; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Diapause, Insect; Lipid Metabolism; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888634870

All types of batteries show highly non-linear behaviour in terms of dependence of internal parameters on operating conditions, momentary replenishment and a number of past charge/discharge cycles. A good indicator for the quality of overall customer service in any battery based application is the availability and reliability of these informations, as they point out important runtime variables such as the actual state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH). Therefore, a modern battery management systems (BMSs) should incorporate functions that accommodate real time tracking of these non-linearities. For that purpose, Kalman filter based algorithms emerged as a convenient solution due to their ability to adapt the underlying battery model on-line according to internal processes and measurements. This paper proposes an enhancement of previously proposed algorithms for estimation of the battery SOC and internal parameters. The validity of the algorithm is confirmed through the simulation on experimental data captured from the lead acid battery stack installed in the real-world remote telecommunication station. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery management system; Estimation; Kalman filter; Lead acid battery; State-of-charge","Battery management system; Battery management systems (BMSs); Charge/discharge cycle; Electrochemical batteries; Energy storage technologies; Parameter estimation algorithm; State of charge; Telecommunication stations; Algorithms; Consumer electronics; Estimation; Lead acid batteries; Management; Kalman filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888622570

The search of optimal technical solutions at the stored energy of ∼107 J and over leads to an obvious conclusion which is in the favor of using inductive storages (IS) since they have a greater potential in view of the energy concentration1. In work a method of screening the primary winding in the transformer IS is proposed that permits attaining, with minimal losses, the value of ts/t p ∼107 and more where ts and tp are the times of the energy storage in IS and the energy transfer from IS, respectively. Structure of pulses generators on IS is parallel-series connections of elements - inductive storage - the opening switch - a load. This connection version in case of POS is required. One of the problems of POS is impossible nanosecond synchronization at parallel works of generators. The technical solution with semiconductor opening switch (SOS), is offered consideration in this paper. SOS lets to attain high level synchronization of all parts of generator. Technical solution construction of module based on IS, which may be part of high pulsed power generators is offered this paper too.

One of possible applications for the generators based on IS was proposed, namely generation of series of gigawatt power individual pulses with a pulse duration of ∼10-2 sec and more. A rail launcher of macro-size bodies was taken as the load. The proposed variant of the generator and accelerator can be used to launch bodies of several kilograms at a pulse series of 5-10 pulses per second.

A rail accelerator with its inductance of 1μH/m is used as the load and the duration of a single pulse in the train is to 2-3·0-4 sec. The number of pulses in train is determined by the conditions of allowable spread of the operation current in the secondary winding of IS (∼5%) and can vary from 100 to 150 pulses.

The management of this is an on-going practice, based on comprehensive (IAEA) guidelines. A special waste category however consists of the historical waste from research reactors, mostly originating from various experiments in the early years of the nuclear era. Removal of the waste from the research site, often required by law, raises challenges: The waste packages must fulfill the acceptance criteria from the receiving storage site as well as the criteria for nuclear transports. Often the aged waste containers do not fulfill today's requirements anymore, and their contents are not well documented. Therefore removal of historical waste requires advanced characterization, sorting, sustainable repackaging and sometimes conditioning of the waste. This paper describes the Dutch experience of a historical waste removal campaign from the Petten High Flux research reactor. The reactor is still in operation, but Dutch legislation asks for central storage of all radioactive waste at the COVRA site in Vlissingen since the availability of the high- And intermediate-level waste storage facility HABOG in 2004. In order to comply with COVRA's acceptance criteria, the complex and mixed inventory of intermediate and low level waste must be characterized and conditioned, identifying the relevant nuclides and their activities. Sorting and segregation of the waste in a Hot Cell offers the possibility to reduce the environmental footprint of the historical waste, by repackaging it into different classes of intermediate and low level waste. In this way, most of the waste volume can be separated into lower level categories not needing to be stored in the HABOG, but in the less demanding LOG facility for low-level waste instead. The characterization and sorting is done on the basis of a combination of gamma scanning with high energy resolution of the closed waste canister and low-resolution localized gamma scanning inside a hot cell. A complicating factor is that the conditioning of the waste, consisting of compacting and cementing, would require such an extensive infrastructure at the Petten site, that it appeared to be more practical to have it executed by a foreign service provider. Therefore the waste packages have to comply with cross-border transport and waste acceptance criteria, and the national legislation of this service provider too. This paper describes this historical waste project, focusing on the fast and precise characterization approach, the expert system behind it, and the sorting and repackaging effort at the Petten site.

However, the subsurface is heterogeneous and thus affects the heat distribution around ATES wells. In this paper, the influence of heterogeneity on the performance of a doublet well system is quantified using stochastic heat transport modeling. The results show that on average, thermal recovery decreases with increasing heterogeneity, expressed as the lognormal standard deviation of the hydraulic conductivity field around the doublet. Furthermore, heterogeneity at the scale of a doublet ATES system introduces an uncertainty in the amount of expected thermal interference between the warm and cold storage. This results in an uncertainty in thermal recovery that also increases with heterogeneity and decreases with increasing distance between ATES wells. The uncertainty in thermal balance due to heterogeneity can reach values near 50 percent points in case of regional groundwater flow in excess of 200 m/yr. To account for heterogeneity whilst using homogeneous models, an attempt was made to express the effect of heterogeneity by an apparent macrodispersivity. As expected, apparent macrodispersivity increases with increasing heterogeneity. However, it also depends on well-to-well distance and regional groundwater velocity. Again, the uncertainty in thermal recovery is reflected in a range in the apparent macrodispersivity values. Considering the increasing density of ATES systems, we conclude that thermal interference limits the number of ATES systems that can be implemented in a specific area, and the uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity field related to heterogeneity should be accounted for when optimizing well-to-well distances. © 2013.

The coal known reserves guarantees its utilization for around 200 years. Thus, it is predictable that emission due to coal utilization will continue to grow, including carbon dioxide (CO2). Unless the right measures are taken, CO2 emissions from energy sector will be in 2050 around 130% higher than the values emitted in 2005, IEA 2011. The negative effects of such an increase in climate change and in worldwide economy oblige the development and demonstration of clean coal technologies with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Gasification may have an important role in achieving almost zero emissions in energy production from coal. It is possible to produce a carbon free fuel and CO2 stream ready for storage through coal gasification, which is considered a pre-combustion capture technology. The use of oxygen in gasification (oxy-gasification) allows the conversion of coal, including low grade coals or in mixtures with wastes into syngas, which after proper cleaning and upgrading may be converted into CO2 and H2. The latter may be used as a carbon free fuel and CO2 goes to storage or valorization. This process is well known for some years, though it is technically feasible and environmentally friendly, its economic viability needs to be improved. On the other hand, there are still some challenges that need to be overtaken, namely to ensure high conversion of syngas into CO2 and H2 and to guarantee the production of high quality H2, together with CO2 streams ready for storage. The integration of these developed technologies in IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) will help to increase energy conversion efficiency and to improve economic viability.This Chapter will review the last achievements of recent research work about these subjects, the stage of maturity of each technology, the R, D&amp;D (Research, Development &amp; Deployment) needs and the main barriers before the full integration of the most promising options. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Reasonably high stiffness-to-weight ratios make them suitable for both static and mobile applications. However, higher operating pressures are sought continuously, to get higher energy densities in such storage systems, and safety aspects become critical. Thus, reliable design and test procedures are required to reduce the risks of undesired and unpredicted failures. An in-service health monitoring system may contribute to a better product development, design and optimization, as well as to minimize the risks and improve the public acceptance. Within the scope of developing different COPV models for a wide range of operating pressures and applications, optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors were embedded in the liner-composite and composite-composite interfaces during their manufacture in order to allow the online strain monitoring during preliminary testing and service-life. The ability of these measuring systems to effectively assess the strain fields was to be investigated. Simultaneously, a finite element analysis (FEA) was made using the ABAQUS® platform. In this numerical analysis, accurate and realistic simulation of the different materials, geometry and loading conditions was approached. Particularly, the anisotropic nature of the wound laminate and the varying orientation of the fibers were attained. However, the cohesive zones were not attributed independent properties. Comparison between experimental and numerical data was addressed. In general, although the experimental-numerical data agreement was not as good as desired, a preliminary insight to both the structural health monitoring (SHM) system and the numerical modeling approaches was actually achieved. Full characterization and validation shall be further addressed in the continuation of the present work.

The overall idea is, by knowing the meteorological forecast for the next 24h, to dispatch the PV system and to be able to grant the scheduled hourly energy profile by a proper management of the storage. Due to forecast inaccuracies, the energy manager controls the storage in order to ensure that the plan for hourly energy production is respected, minimizing the storage itself usage. The experimental study is carried out in SYSLAB, a distributed power system test facility at DTU Riso Campus and part of PowerLabDK. Both the PV and the storage are connected to the local network and are fully controllable through the SCADA system.

The outflow is shown to depend on the degree of filling of the porous medium and its temperature in a critical manner. A physical mechanism is proposed where the transition of a system of liquid nanoclusters in a confinement into a metastable state in narrow filling and temperature ranges results from the appearance of a potential barrier due to the fluctuations of the collective ""multiparticle"" interaction of liquid nanoclusters in neighboring pores of different sizes at the shell of a percolation cluster of filled pores. The energy of a metastable state forms a potential relief with numerous maxima and minima in the space of a porous medium. The dispersed liquid volume in a metastable state is calculated with an analytical percolation theory for a ground state with an infinite percolation cluster. The outflow time distribution function of pores is calculated, and a power law is obtained for the decrease in nonwetting liquid volume retained in a porous medium with increasing time. The relaxation of the system under study is a multistage process accompanied by discontinuous equilibrium and overcoming of numerous local maxima of a potential relief. The formation of the metastable state of retained nonwetting liquid results from the nonergodicity properties of a disordered porous medium. The proposed model can describe the detected dependences of dispersed liquid volume on the degree of filling and temperature. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,"Discontinuous equilibrium; Meta-stable state; Multistage process; Nonwetting liquid; Percolation clusters; Percolation theory; Physical mechanism; Potential barriers; Filling; Nanoclusters; Percolation (computer storage); Porous materials; Liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893837162

The approach considers that, from knowledge creation and knowledge management perspective, sciences pass in a repetitive manner through a set of phases. These phases have dominant characteristics dominated by some type of patterns, as previously described in the literature (Kuhn, 1962). However it is considered that the switch itself and the next direction in sciences, due to this switch from one phase to another, have similarities with other areas of knowledge creation and knowledge management in the society, as for instance in the use of the concepts of belief. The approach uses a theoretical basis and provides a set of practical guiding rules to look for the causes of difficulties in searches for solutions on various issues, while using scientific approaches and to use a set of paradigms and framework guided searches for the definition of the main features of the type of solutions to be searched. The approach considers the criteria to be used in order to define the phase in which a certain issue reflected by sciences is at a certain moment, the main contradictions and problems in solving it, their most probable causes and eventually to indicate a systematic guiding process to look for a solution. This approach was applied in support to the searches for solutions on the issues of risks for complex systems evaluations-qualitative and quantitative (Serbanescu, 1993, 2008-2011) in various fields, i.e. in modelling new nuclear energy cases, renewable energy (in general and photovoltaic and hydrogen storage in particular), security of energy supply (local and regional), decision making in energy systems, use of risk analyses in the design of complex systems etc. During those case studies the search for solutions was also compared, using the proposed methodology and the results obtained, with some other approaches applicable to the studied cases. The results confirmed convergence of the results and the fact that for such issues of the risk evaluations for diverse complex systems the approach proposed lead to stable, repeatable and auditable solutions, which were in accordance with the solutions obtained by using other guidance. However in addition to other methods the advantage of this approach proved to be its systematic and predictable character, as well as the possibility to use it in difficult new situations of evaluating issues, which have high degree of uncertainties of all types and/or high complexity. It is also considered that the continuation of evaluation of its applicability to other areas, aside with extended comparisons with other methods available now in the knowledge management area, as for instance (Snowden, 1996), could consolidate the results obtained so far and bring new potential useful applications. On the other side, if the applicability and usefulness will be confirmed for other applications, this could be an important possible switch at the theoretical level in the search for methodologies and strategies to be adopted by using various sciences to solve specific problems.","Belief; Myth; Paradigm; Risk; Science","Belief; Degree of uncertainty; Knowledge creations; Myth; Paradigm; Renewable energies; Science; Specific problems; Hydrogen storage; Risk assessment; Risks; Knowledge management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893753707

Reasons are manifold. They mainly include increased thermal comfort requirements for the building occupants. Higher thermal comfort implies higher needs for the buildings' heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems at their peak levels. This operation eventually entails the risk of load peaks, which increases risks for electric black-outs. Demand side management (DSM) is an established concept for buildings, which includes the optimal shifting of potential loads to time periods such that peak loads can be prevented effectively. The concept thus provides that electric and thermal storage potentials are exploited adequately. Further development should enforce the use of renewable energy sources, which offers another possibility to efficiently reduce the risks of potential load peaks. Mathematical modeling of HVAC systems is an established approach to understand the system behavior and to trigger plans and strategies on how to tackle the HVAC system controls in order to recognize potentials and consequently perform efficient load shifting in an automated way. Model based control concepts endorse the systematic and transparent approach towards automated load shifting. This paper presents the methodology for the design of a model based predictive control concept for load shifting in the non-residential building sector. The methodology includes the mathematical modeling of the HVAC systems and the loads of a passive house standard non-residential building. The concept for the model based predictive controller is developed upon a simplification of the plant model. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Building sectors; Demand side managements; Model based controls; Model based predictive control; Model-based predictive controller; System behaviors; Use of renewable energies; World population; Air conditioning; Buildings; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Heating; Industrial electronics; Renewable energy resources; Thermal comfort; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893627720

These features make the bearingless ac homopolar machine a promising machine for highspeed flywheel energy storage systems (FESS). The variable excitation of the bearingless ac homopolar machine has the potential to increase the FESS's efficiency by allowing for low excitation during periods of free-wheeling and high-speed operation. However, the magnetic suspension's position stiffness and current stiffness depend upon the excitation level. This dependency must be taken into account in the suspension controller or the magnetic suspension may become unstable at certain excitation levels.

For this reason, energy storage is becoming more important and bidirectional fuel cells represent an attractive technology. Fuel cells require high-current low-voltage dc-dc or dc-ac converters as power interface to the grid. In power electronics, the converter efficiency is characterized at fixed operating voltage for various output power. This type of characterization is not suitable for fuel cells, since as the power from the fuel cell increases, the cell voltage decreases.

Peak-shaving in high Photovoltaic (PV) penetration conditions and providing ancillary service in high load conditions are among the applications of EESS in distribution systems. In this paper, a new method is developed based on the voltage sensitivity analysis of the network in order to calculate the EESS capacity required for prevention of voltage rise and voltage drop in distribution grids with residential PVs and Electric Vehicles (EVs). The effect of EV home charging on EESS capacity in high PV penetration is also addressed. The results indicate that increasing the EV penetration in the network can decrease the EESS capacity need. This decrease is highest in situations with low PV penetration. © 2013 IEEE.","electric vehicle; Energy storage; photovoltaic; smart grid","Ancillary service; Distribution grid; Distribution systems; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electrical energy storage systems; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893618769

Namely, if available in large enough numbers, EVs can be used as a distributed energy resource (DER) and their presence can influence optimal DER investment and scheduling decisions in microgrids. In this work, a novel EV fleet aggregator model is introduced in a stochastic formulation of DER-CAM [1], an optimization tool used to address DER investment and scheduling problems. This is used to assess the impact of EV interconnections on optimal DER solutions considering uncertainty in EV driving schedules. Optimization results indicate that EVs can have a significant impact on DER investments, particularly if considering short payback periods. Furthermore, results suggest that uncertainty in driving schedules carries little significance to total energy costs, which is corroborated by results obtained with the stochastic formulation of the problem. © 2013 IEEE.","distributed energy resources; driving patterns; electric storage; electric vehicles; microgrids; uncertainty","Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Driving pattern; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Micro grid; Scheduling decisions; Stochastic formulation; uncertainty; Associative storage; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Industrial electronics; Investments; Office buildings; Optimization; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893616148

We illustrate that a benefit of individual modeling is that we can overview and optimize the complete flexibility of a heat pump portfolio. Following, we illustrate two disadvantages of individual models, namely that it requires much computational effort to optimize over a large portfolio, and second that it is difficult to accurately model the houses in certain time periods due to local disturbances. Finally, we propose a lumped model approach as an alternative to the individual models. In the lumped model, the portfolio is seen as baseline consumption superimposed with an ideal storage of limited power and energy capacity. The benefit of such a lumped model is that the computational effort of flexibility optimization is significantly reduced. Further, the individual disturbances will smooth out as the number of houses in the portfolio increases. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computational effort; Energy capacity; Heat pumps; Individual modeling; Individual models; Local disturbances; Lumped modeling; Time-periods; Heat pump systems; Optimization; Smart power grids; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893604350

This paper introduces a storage integrated photovoltaic (S-PV) system at residential areas as a multiple objective unit to address requirements either from technical or commercial side. Furthermore, a coordination mechanism for multiple S-PV units based on multi-agent system (MAS) technology will be discussed. The decision-making ability of the agents is necessary for arbitrating possible conflict of interests among S-PV units in case of disagreement between serving network functions and trading in the energy market. The proposed decision-making method of the agents is based on the coalitional game theory. More specifically, the two concepts for solving a coalition game with transferable pay-off are examined including the Shapley value and the Nucleolus. These concepts are compared to pro rata division of payoff in order to demonstrate their effectiveness in providing economic incentives for the S-PV units to participate in a coalition.

In this paper, an optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize fuel consumption of a marine vessel under various loading conditions. The studied dc hybrid system includes diesel engines, synchronous generator-rectifier units, and a full-bridge bidirectional converter that incorporates an energy storage device into the system. In order to evaluate potential fuel saving provided by such a system, an online optimization control, based on the proposed algorithm, is implemented in simulation of an Offshore Support Vessel (OSV) over different operating modes. The simulation results show that the dc system without energy storage provides a fuel saving of approximately 7% compared to the conventional ac system.

The mechanical condition of the power production units, such as the small wind turbines, is considered of crucial importance especially in the case of islanded operation. In this paper, the fault assessment is achieved efficiently and consistently via electric signature analysis (ESA). In ESA the fault related frequency components are manifested as sidebands of the existing current and voltage time harmonics. The energy content between the fundamental, 5 th and 7th harmonics (referred as residual value - RV) is measured and sent to the central microgrid controller. The controller compares RV to three predefined limits where inspection, maintenance and shut down of the turbine are the corresponding actions.

However, at present, Lithium-ion batteries are expensive storage devices and consequently their ageing behavior must be known in order to estimate their economic viability in different application. The ageing behavior of Lithium-ion batteries is described by the fade of their discharge capacity and by the decrease of their power capability. The capability of a Lithium-ion battery to deliver or to absorb a certain power is directly related to its internal resistance. This work aims to investigate the dependency of the internal resistance of lithium-ion batteries on the storage temperature and on the storage time. For this purpose, accelerated ageing calendar lifetime tests were carried out over a period of one year. Based on the obtained laboratory results, an empirical ageing model was developed; the model is able to predict with accurately the increase of the internal resistance of Lithium-ion batteries during calendar (storage) ageing. Based on the proposed ageing model, it was found out that the internal resistance of the studied Lithium-ion battery cell will double after approximately eleven years if stored at 25°C. © 2013 IEEE.","ageing behaviour; ageing model; experimental investigation; internal resistance; Lithium-ion battery","Ageing behaviour; Ageing models; Experimental investigations; Internal resistance; Lithium-ion battery; Industrial electronics; Virtual storage; Lithium batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893539077

By this solution, the required DC capacitor is substantially reduced and so increasing the inverter lifetime, whereas requiring no additional semiconductors makes it more reliable and less expensive than other solutions.

The question of whether electric cars are capable of meeting daily mobility requirements in Germany is investigated. The analysis is based on data from the German Mobility Panel Survey from 1995 to 2010 and the travel survey of 2009 and 2010 for the Stuttgart, Germany, area and combines a long-term travel behavior analysis with a region-specific verification. The focus is on individuals who exclusively drive a car and walk during the day and who rely on the car as a primary means of transport. For this group, the determinants of the decision to drive an internal combustion engine vehicle versus a battery electric vehicle (BEV) are analyzed, with a focus on driving range and energy costs. Results of the analysis suggest that around 80% of all daily travel by car drivers could be done with currently available models of electric cars and that charging them only at night would be sufficient in most cases. Therefore, the driving range of BEVs cannot be the restricting factor. In contrast, the current cost structure of BEVs (high investment cost, low energy cost) is not favorable for the large share of drivers with low annual mileage because the high investment cost is not compensated for by low operation costs. In the Stuttgart region, drivers from the suburbs would benefit most from such energy cost savings; however, city dwellers would need other cost structures or incentives to switch to BEVs.",,"Battery electric vehicles; Daily mobilities; Electric mobility; Energy cost savings; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Investment costs; Restricting factors; Travel behaviors; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Investments; Transportation; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893414819

Four activity types are visually identified and characterized according to: SO2 emission rate, ash mass, event duration, peak temperature, thermal radiation energy, infrasound onset and frequency, reduced infrasonic pressure, and acoustic energy. These activity types include: (1) ash explosions, (2) pulsatory degassing, (3) gas jetting, and (4) explosive eruption. Unique infrasound signals are associated with all four activity types suggesting that infrasound can be used to help remotely and continuously detect and characterize volcanic activity at Karymsky and other similar volcanoes. Our observations suggest that SO2 is emitted continuously, though in varying abundance, while ash is emitted discontinuously and is only associated with certain types of activity. Our data set supports previous models that attribute variations in surface activity to changes in conduit permeability at Karymsky Volcano. Evidence for a decrease in conduit permeability as a trigger for ash explosions and explosive eruption activity types is supported by weakened but still detectable SO2 emission rates prior to eruption, along with the highly impulsive infrasonic onset and large reduced infrasound pressure indicating high pressure at the vent. We speculate that changes in conduit permeability at Karymsky Volcano result from changes in magma supply from the shallow-crustal storage region though additional measurements are required to validate this hypothesis.

Besides the normal changes in user requirements, e.g., the wish to solve a variation of a scientific problem, such software is also challenged by a flood of new technologies that promise higher performance and better energy utilization. Continuously adapting HPC codes for multicore processors and many-core accelerators while also adapting to new user requirements, however, drains human resources and prevents utilization of more cost-effective hardware. Here we present some ideas for dealing with software variability in the PDE domain, namely the use of coordinate-free numerics for achieving flexibility. We also show how Fortran, over the last few decades, has changed to become a language well suited for state of-the-art software development. Fortran's new coarray distributed data structure, the language's class mechanism and side-effect-free, pure function capability provide the scaffolding on which we implement high performance software. These features empower compilers to organize parallel computations with efficient communication.

This modified process uses electrically heated mould tooling integrated within the rotating axes to produce polymer liner components. The integrally heated tooling provides improved control of heating parameters, thus increasing the dimensional accuracy of the part and reducing energy consumption. Microscopy, in conjunction with image processing software, has been used to characterise void densities in liner samples. High percentage air void densities in polymer materials have been shown to increase permeability as they act as leakage paths for permeation; therefore reducing air void densities for liner applications is of paramount importance. Results show that increased hold temperatures reduce void density percentages but increase void sizes. Other processing parameters such as mould wall thickness variations and cooling rates are analysed for this novel process of liner manufacture.

A taper ratio of 20 was considered in the present study while the Reynolds numbers based on the uniform inflow velocity and the width of the plate at the wide and narrow ends were 1000 and 250, respectively. The tapering gave rise to cellular vortex shedding with randomly occurring vortex dislocations which prohibited a distinction between coherent and incoherent fluctuations. In the current DNS, it was observed that the magnitude of the Reynolds stresses and the production and dissipation rates of fluctuating kinetic energy are much lower than in the wake of a uniform normal flat plate. This reduced magnitude is perhaps due to the fact that the present tapered plate produces a highly incoherent wake, which may result in the reduction of the coherent velocity fluctuations and their overall contribution to the Reynolds-averaged data. In addition to the primary shear-stress term, a secondary shear-stress component was found to co-exist in the present case. The appearance of this secondary shear-stress term, together with the inherent spanwise inhomogeneity and the existence of a distinct secondary flow, was found to drive the fluctuations towards isotropy. In addition, the present DNS surprisingly revealed the appearance of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities towards the higher local Reynolds numbers, i.e. beyond 920. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","DNS; Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; Reynolds stresses; Turbulent kinetic energy; Vortex shedding","Digital storage; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Reynolds number; Shear stress; Vortex flow; Vortex shedding; Wakes; Cellular vortex shedding; Coherent and incoherent fluctuations; Coherent velocity; Kelvin- helmholtz instabilities; Reynolds stress; Shear stress component; Turbulent kinetic energy; Vortex dislocations; Shear flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892367837

This paper extends prior work on the economic equilibrium of spot and reserve markets with a special focus on markets that are characterised through a large share of hydro power. We theoretically discuss crucial factors determining the unit-commitment decision of generators by explicitly considering the interrelation of their decisions. Taking these effects into account we reflect on the economic equilibrium between spot and reserve markets. To test our hypotheses we developed a linear program with a detailed representation of the secondary control energy market design currently implemented in Germany/Austria. We use this model to derive integrated market outcomes of both, the spot and balancing market. The proposed approach is applied to the Austrian power market; A market which is characterized by a large share of run-of-river generators and pumped hydro storages.

However, if the PSH unit is integrated in a generation company (GenCo) that has a portfolio generation with different power plant technologies, the PSH unit operation is considerably changed. To analyze this problem, an optimal weekly scheduling of a PSH unit integrated in a price-maker GenCo is computed. The degree of market power is modeled by the residual inverse demand function with variable elasticity.

The microgrid system is a flexible cell that can be operated connected to the main power network or autonomously, in a controlled and coordinated way. The use of storage devices in microgrids is related to the provision of some form of energy buffering during autonomous operating conditions, in order to balance load and generation. However, frequency variations and limited storage capacity might compromise microgrid autonomous operation. In order to improve microgrid resilience in the moments subsequent to islanding, this paper presents innovative functionalities to run online, which are able to manage microgrid storage considering the integration of electric vehicles and load responsiveness.

The onset of the percolation threshold reached at 10 vol% of OLC is accompanied by drastically increased microwave absorption. The broadband dielectric properties of the composites at low loading of OLC, below the percolation threshold, are mainly governed by the α relaxation, the dynamics of the ""soft"" molecular segment of the PU chain. With increased OLC concentration, the glass-transition temperature decreases and the α relaxation completely vanishes for the composite with 5 vol% OLC.

Well-compacted municipal solid waste (MSW) occupies less volume than an uncompacted MSW sample of the same weight and provides a safer storage area. The composition of MSW changes in between countries and even cities. For that reason, for effective compaction, the composition effect should be investigated. In this study, effects of composition, degradation and energy on the compaction behavior of artificially-prepared and natural fresh and aged MSW samples were determined. Artificial samples were prepared in representative different compositions Europe (E-1), Turkey (T-1) and the USA (U-1) to examine the effect of the composition. In addition to the synthetic MSW samples, natural MSW samples were obtained from the municipal landfill area of Manisa, Turkey. The standard Proctor test results have shown that the highest maximum dry unit weight was observed with the U-1 composition, which has the lowest organic content and the highest metal content. The degradation effect was investigated on the natural samples. The degraded MSW sample (3-4 years) has significantly higher maximum dry unit weight than the fresh natural MSW sample because of its low organic content. According to the results of this study, with respect to the composition effect, the percentage of organic waste is the most important factor on the compaction behavior of MSWs. As paper, organic and plastic contents increase in the MSW composition the γdry-max value decreases and wopt increases. The ash content does it reversely, as such that any increase in γdry-max decreases the wopt value of the MSW. © 2013 The Author(s).","composition effect; degradation effect; Municipal solid waste; standard and modified Proctor tests; waste compaction","Compaction behavior; Degradation effect; Effective compactions; Modified Proctor test; Municipal landfills; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Standard Proctor test; Waste compaction; Compaction; Composition effects; Land fill; Municipal solid waste; plastic; ash; chemical composition; compaction; degradation; landfill; municipal solid waste; organic matter; underground storage; waste disposal; article; compaction; degradation; energy; Europe; municipal solid waste; organic waste; priority journal; solid waste management; storage; Turkey (republic); United States; Manisa; Turkey; composition effect; degradation effect; Municipal solid waste; standard and modified Proctor tests; waste compaction; Europe; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Turkey; United States; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890025691

This depends on the character of the duration curve of external temperature conditioning the heat demand for space heating and ventilation. The power rating of the turbine in a CHP (combined heat and power) unit ought to be chosen according to the optimal coefficient of the share of cogeneration. This coefficient defines the ratio of the maximum heat flux from the heating steam turbine to the maximum demand for heat. The optimal coefficient of the share of cogeneration depends mainly on the ratio of heat required for the production of hot tap water to the heat needed for space heating and ventilation, and additionally on the benefits of promoting high-efficiency cogeneration, biomass co-firing and the increase of the power output of the turbogenerator during the peak load time thanks to thermal storage. The paper presents a complex algorithm for choosing the optimal coefficient of the share of cogeneration in district heating systems. The final results of investigations are empirical equations describing the influence of those factors on the optimal value of the share of cogeneration in district heating systems with or without thermal storage. The wish of the EU to reduce CO2 emissions in order to protect the climate has made the authors find it necessary to assess the influence of CO2 emission allowance on the value of the optimal coefficient of the share of cogeneration. The free CO2 emission allowances during the transitional period have not been taken into account due to the lack of final political decisions in this matter. The thermo-economical impact of biomass co-firing on the optimal value of the share of cogeneration has been assessed based on the present support obligatory in Poland; also the planned new Polish act for RES (renewable energy sources) has been analysed as one of the scenarios. In the absence of a final version of the new RES act, the authors assumed a complete withdrawal of supporting the biomass co-firing technology in centralized systems, which seems to be the intention of the Polish legislature. It has been assumed that the support of high-efficiency cogeneration will be continued according to the existing model. The approach presented in the paper may be applied both in back-pressure CHP plants and in extraction-condensing CHP plants.The presented paper partially sums up previous publications of both authors and introduces new empirical equations concerning a CHP unit with an extraction-condensing turbine, taking into account biomass co-firing and thermal storage.

Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands","Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a popular deposition technique comprising two or more sequential, self-limiting surface reactions, which make up an ALD cycle. Energy-enhanced ALD is an evolution of traditional thermal ALD methods, whereby energy is supplied to a gas in situ in order to convert a traditional thermal ALD co-reactant to a highly reactive species with short-term stability. Therefore, energy-enhanced ALD encompasses plasma-enhanced ALD and ozone-based ALD techniques. In this article, we aim to provide insight into precursor considerations, such that the advantages of energy-enhanced ALD can be exploited. The examples of such advantages are that a wider variety of precursors can be used, and that deposition temperatures down to room temperature with a high growth-per-cycle can be employed. The precursor freedom is demonstrated here by Ti compounds of the general formula [Ti(Cpx)L3] (Cpx=alkyl-substituted η5-cyclopentadienyl, L=OMe, OiPr or NMe2). Such heteroleptic cyclopentadienyl complexes allow for improved volatility by preventing oligomerisation and offering improved thermal stability, thereby leading to a longer storage life in bubblers and allowing for ALD at higher deposition temperatures than with analogous homoleptic precursors. However, experimental data show that [Ti(Cpx)L3] compounds are not reactive with water during ALD but do react with plasmas and ozone. Density Functional Theory calculations suggest that this is because chemisorption is prevented by the steric hindrance of the cyclopentadienyl ligand. Further processing versatility afforded by energy-enhanced ALD is also observed with depositions at low temperatures (&lt;200°C) and even room temperature. Such low temperatures are often not considered viable for thermal ALD as there is insufficient thermal energy to drive reactions, resulting in low growth per cycle values and relatively high film contamination. The high reactivity of plasmas and ozone allows the deposition of good to fair quality films at low temperatures with a high growth-per-cycle, exemplified by [Al(CH3)3]2 (TMA) and [Al(CH3)2(OiPr)]2 (DMAI) aluminium precursors. The considerations required for energy-enhanced room-temperature ALD (RT-ALD) are also presented here, using Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2, from TMA, [SiH2(NEt2)2] (BDEAS) and [Ti(OiPr)4] (TTIP), as examples. The essential criterion is that incoming metalorganic precursors and co-reactant gases must be reactive with the surface groups at room temperature. As long as this is met, then further desirable conditions for RT-ALD are a high precursor vapour pressure and short purge times. Using these examples, the advantages of energy-enhanced ALD with respect to precursor choices are highlighted. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","3c2e; iPr; tBu; ALD; Atomic layer deposition; BDEAS; CCP; Cp; CpMe; Cpx; DFT; DMAI; Eads; Energy-enhanced ALD; Et; FT-IR; GPC; ICP; MBE; Me; Ozone-based ALD; Plasma-enhanced ALD; Precursors; RF; RT; RT-ALD; RTP; S-OH; Thd; Ti-N-Prime; Ti-Prime; Ti-Star; TMA; TTIP",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885482308

An innovative element that allows the combined use of two passive cooling techniques, evaporative cooling and night ventilation, is proposed in the present work. In order to optimize the use of those techniques it was decided to include in the element configuration a core component with latent heat storage capabilities. Briefly it can be said that the element is composed by the accumulating core, consisting of a cement mortar vertical panel impregnated with paraffin, with two adjacent channels for air circulation. The element, whose configuration should allow its integration into the buildings envelope, has a parallelepiped shape with one air inlet and one air outlet in each of its opposite faces, the exterior and the interior ones. The core surface adjacent to the exterior channel is maintained continuously wetted by a water sprinkler system integrated in the element. The airflow in each channel is provided by tangential fans mounted on top of the element. The paraffin wax used corresponds to a commercial wax with phase transition range near 21. °C, slightly below typical comfort temperatures. A prototype of the element was constructed and subjected to a series of experimental studies that aim to know its response in operating conditions similar to real ones. These studies took place in a climate chamber for a wide range of conditions. The results suggest that the proposed element exhibits the potential for passive cooling of buildings. It was concluded that the paraffin wax incorporation in the cement mortar core has substantially improved the capacity of thermal energy accumulation of the element, that the evaporation process on the outside surface of the core provides a substantial temperature reducing of the core, and that its use also during night-time periods allows to cool the core well below the outside temperatures, thus maximizing the possibility of application of night ventilation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Indirect evaporative cooling; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Night ventilation; Passive cooling of buildings","Indirect evaporative cooling; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Night ventilation; Parallelepiped shapes; Passive cooling; Passive cooling techniques; Phase transition range; Reduce energy consumption; Cements; Energy utilization; Evaporative cooling systems; Heat storage; Latent heat; Mortar; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Ventilation; Evaporation; building; cement; cooling; evaporation; experimental study; innovation; latent heat flux; mortar; optimization; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884969170

The analysis focuses on the development of a coupled groundwater flow and heat transfer model over a period of 10 years. Results are then post-processed to evaluate efficiency of each individual well and system. Efficiency of the ATES systems has ranged between 68% and 87%. The analysis showed that efficiency tends, in general, to increase over time and stabilize at an asymptotic value after few years. Analysis of interference among individual wells of an ATES system and wells of other systems showed that interference could, in fact, have a positive impact on the efficiency of a well/system. Interference can increase efficiency of an ATES system since it can help in trapping energy (cold or warm) within the capture zone of all operating ATES systems. In the study area, the interference phenomenon affects efficiency, in general, positively where it increases the efficiency of individually operating wells by a maximum of 20%. However, the phenomenon also affects efficiency of some wells negatively where it reduces the efficiency of individually operating wells by a maximum of 25%. In average, systems in the study area are positively affected by interferences among each other with an overall average of 3.2% for all wells (over the 10 years operation period). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); Energy efficiency; Heat transfer in porous media; Thermal energy; Thermal interference","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Asymptotic values; Flow and heat transfer; Interference phenomena; Operating well; Operation period; Thermal interferences; Trapping energy; Energy efficiency; Groundwater flow; Heat transfer; Porous materials; Thermal energy; Aquifers; aquifer; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; groundwater flow; heat transfer; installation; porous medium; storage; thermal power; well water; Netherlands; South Holland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877895661

Three levels of light attenuation were imposed for 3 weeks in two adjacent meadows (2-3 m depth), each dominated by one species. The response of photosynthesis to light was determined with oxygen electrodes. Chlorophylls and carotenoids were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Soluble protein, carbohydrates, malondialdehyde and phenol contents were also analysed. Both species showed evident signs of photoacclimation. Their maximum photosynthetic rates were significantly reduced with shading. Ratios between specific light harvesting carotenoids and the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids revealed significantly higher light harvesting efficiency of C. nodosa, a competitive advantage in a low light environment. The contents of both soluble sugars and starch were considerably lower in Z. marina plants, particularly in the rhizomes, decreasing even further with shading. The different carbohydrate energy storage strategies found between the two species clearly favour C. nodosa's resilience to light deprivation, a condition enhanced by its intrinsic arrangement of the pigment pool. On the other hand, Z. marina revealed a lower tolerance to light reduction, mostly due to a less plastic arrangement of the pigment pool and lower carbohydrate storage. Our findings indicate that Z. marina is close to a light-mediated ecophysiological threshold in Ria Formosa. © 2013 Silva et al.",,"carbohydrate; carotenoid; chlorophyll; malonaldehyde; phenol; protein; starch; sugar; xanthophyll; article; carbohydrate synthesis; controlled study; Cymodocea nodosa; epoxidation; light harvesting system; light limitation stress; nonhuman; photoacclimatization; photosynthetic rate; plant shading; plant stress; Portugal; rhizome; seagrass; xanthophyll cycle; zostera marina; Alismatidae; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Light; Photosynthesis; Pigments, Biological; Stress, Physiological; Zosteraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892386632

It is also the largest renewable energy source offering significant potential for reduction in carbon emissions. In Norway, hydropower accounts for nearly 99% of the total electricity production. To meet winter demand, storage schemes are implemented in tandem with run-of-river schemes to a large extent in cold region hydropower systems. In these systems, ice creates operational constraints during winter that can lead to reductions in power production. The problems occur in the various phases of the ice regime, mainly due to frazil ice, ice runs, and ice jams. Counteracting these ice problems is usually a difficult task that involves expensive measures and possibly lost production. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the effects of freshwater ice on hydropower systems. It has been shown that ice in freshwater systems poses a number of operational constraints on the various components of a hydropower system at a time when energy demand is at its peak. The literature review presents a useful baseline for operators of power plants as well as showing problem areas for future research. The trends in the northern areas toward warmer and unstable winters could both alleviate and exacerbate the current challenges for cold climate hydropower operation and the findings of this paper should provide useful background for assessments of future ice impacts. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Carbon emissions; Electricity production; Freshwater systems; Hydropower system; Literature reviews; Operational constraints; Power production; Renewable energy source; Hydroelectric power; Ice problems; Renewable energy resources; Water; Ice; alternative energy; baseline survey; carbon emission; cold region; demand analysis; energy planning; hydroelectric power plant; ice cover; ice mechanics; operations technology; power generation; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888066846

The hydro power plants equipped with pumping systems, in addition to the flexible operation, allows the storage of excess wind power in the form of water, pumping it to their upper reservoirs. In this paper, the technical feasibility of coordinating two hydro pumping plants with the wind power installed capacity in Portugal is assessed through a dedicated model. The objective is to maintain constant, throughout the year, the power output of this aggregate at a target value. Historical records of the power production and demand as seen from different points of the transmission grid constitute the background for the simulations. The results obtained show that the continuous supply of the target power throughout the year depends largely on the established target value itself, on the values of the installed capacity of each technology (wind and hydro), as well as on the storage capacity of both reservoirs of the hydro pumping plants. © 2013 IEEE.","coordinated operation; energy storage; hydro pumping plant; wind power","Coordinated operation; Flexible operation; Historical records; Installed capacity; Short-term variations; Transmission grids; Wind power installed capacities; Wind power production; Electric power transmission networks; Electrical engineering; Energy storage; Pumping plants; Reservoirs (water); Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887362803

A rotating conductive disk is placed in front of calculated number of pole surfaces that create a magnetic field which is unchanged according to time. Since the disk rotates, a relatively changing magnetic field passes through the conductive disk causing Eddy currents to be induced inside the disk. These induced Eddy currents produce an opposing magnetic field forcing the rotating disk to slow down by means of consuming mechanical energy. Mathematical analysis of the effects of Eddy currents is almost impossible due to the complexity of both the magnetic problem and geometry. There is no obtained certain relationship which can explain output data in terms of input data since the relation includes too many variables including disk areas, disk thickness, disk radius, speed, etc. In this study, different eddy current brake designs are analysed where all design constraints were kept unchanged apart from conductive disk thickness to determine the effect of change.

Yet, the uncertainty and variability of the wind leads to challenges for transmission system operators (TSOs) during grid management and for wind power plant (WPP) owners during market operations. In order to address these problems, convenient monitoring and forecast of wind power is indispensable. In this paper, we present the architecture of the wind power monitoring and forecast system of Turkey designed and implemented within the scope of the RITM project which primarily aims at large-scale integration of the WPPs in the transmission grid. Although wind power generation in Turkey is its infant stage, with a total installed capacity of 2202.4 MW in operation, the number of WPPs keeps increasing at an accelerated rate and the presented system currently covers 14 WPPs with a total installed capacity of 704.9 MW, hence about 32% of the wind power generation in the country is monitored and the related wind power forecasts are produced. The paper describes the data acquisition, storage, processing, and presentation components of the overall system in details. The described system is significant as its outputs can be utilized by TSOs during grid management and are already being utilized by WPP owners during day-ahead and intra-day market operations. Moreover, the system has advantages over existing systems in other countries in terms of the ease of extensibility, the range of real-time data sources, and the range of forecasts produced. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Energy productions; Large-scale wind power; Monitoring and forecast; Renewable energies; Transmission grids; Transmission system operators; Uncertainty and variability; Wind power forecast; Commerce; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electrical engineering; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887341711

This approach describes intrusion and extrusion processes for the ground state of a disordered porous medium, which is characterized by the formation of a fractal percolation cluster. The observed transition of the system of liquid nanoclusters in confinement to a metastable state in a narrow range of degrees of filling and temperatures has been explained by the appearance of a potential barrier owing to fluctuations of the collective ""multiparticle interaction"" of liquid nanoclusters in neighboring pores of different sizes on the shell of the fractal percolation cluster of filled pores. The energy of the metastable state forms a potential relief in the space of the porous medium with many maxima and minima. The volume of the dispersed liquid in the metastable state has been calculated within the analytical percolation theory for the ground state with the infinite percolation cluster. The extrusion-time distribution function of pores has been calculated. It has been found that the volume of the nonwetting liquid remaining in the porous medium decreases with time according to a power law. Relaxation in the system under study is a multistep process involving discontinuous equilibrium and overcoming of many local maxima of the potential relief. The formation of the metastable state of the trapped nonwetting liquid has been attributed to the nonergodicity of the disordered porous medium. The model reproduces the observed dependence of the volume of the dispersed liquid both on the degree of filling and on the temperature. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,"Degree of filling; Discontinuous equilibrium; Multi-particle interactions; Multistep process; Nonwetting liquid; Percolation clusters; Percolation theory; Potential barriers; Dispersions; Extrusion; Fractals; Ground state; Nanoclusters; Percolation (computer storage); Porous materials; Liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888148859

A possible way to address in particular the standby power problem is to introduce non-volatility into the devices and circuit blocks so that unused devices or even entire circuit blocks do not waste energy, and power is only spent, when information is read or written. Recently, we proposed a non-volatile magnetic flip flop which moves the information storage and processing from the CMOS domain to the magnetic domain. Here, we propose a way to extend the functionality of the device to a shift register; computing via spin wave superposition and passing information by spin torque transfer (STT). The presented shift register and its operation allows an extremely dense layout, is CMOS compatible, and non-volatile. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Circuit blocks; CMOS Compatible; CMOS technology; Increasing costs; Non-volatile logic; Spin torque transfer (STT); Standby power; Wave superposition; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric network analysis; Magnetic devices; Magnetic domains; Nanotechnology; Shift registers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886779613

Thus a large amount of energy exchange occurs with the grid and these buildings rely heavily on the grid to reach annual zero balance. Wide-spread application of such buildings could soon saturate the grid hosting capacity and limits their effectiveness on larger scale. In order to design buildings that effectively interact with the grid, well-designed energy solutions are paramount. As the recent market trends show strong growth in heat pumps and the photovoltaic applications, this study investigates the flexibility of such all-electric Net-ZEB (using electric heat pump with photovoltaic) that it could offer to the grid. Four different strategies of heat pump with thermal energy storage (TES) are compared to a directly coupled heat pump (reference) case. The flexibility of these cases to self-consume the onsite electrical production and reduce their interaction/ impact on the grid is analyzed. Results shows that using the TES with proper control can lead to 10% increase in the self-consumption, 35% reduction in the peak-exchange hours and 5% reduction in import bills. The results show that major part of the improvement in the self-consumption and exchange hours can already be realized using standard-sized TES with application of proper control. However, the reduction in import bills has more strong dependency on TES capacity. In overall, results shows that with proper application of control strategy, significant maneuvering space in demand-supply matching could be achieved at the level of an individual building.

Malfunction of insulin decreases triglyceride storage in adipose tissue, while its extreme activation induces obesity. In either case, low-molecular-weight lipid metabolites, such as oxybutyrates, ketobutyrates, ketone bodies, etc., increase in content in peripheral tissues and are utilized as a preferable substrate in energy production, thus reducing the glucose uptake in cells. Leptin inhibits the lipogenic function of insulin and prevents lipid accumulation, while leptin deficiency or a decrease in leptin activity increases the lipid production and induces obesity. Lipodystrophy decreases leptin secretion by adipocytes and facilitates the lipogenic effect of insulin, but insulin does not stimulate the triglyceride accumulation in adipose tissue in the absence of subcutaneous fat. Lipid metabolites accumulate in peripheral organs and induce lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus. The hypothesis of the alternative mechanisms of insulin functioning is consented with the data obtained in mice with a targeted knockout of the insulin receptor gene in individual organs (muscles, adipose tissue, etc.) and transgenic animals with restored expression of the gene. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","ketoacidosis; leptin; lipodystrophy; obesity; receptor",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890110848

Diatoms are rich in carbon storage compounds such as carbohydrates and lipids, and studies have shown that nitrogen or phosphorus limitation may increase the cellular carbon storage. To understand better the physiological effects of resource limitation we need a controlled steady-state environment, and this can be achieved in chemostats where growth is regulated by the availability of a limiting substrate through regulation of the dilution rate. We present data from exponential fed batch-cultures of the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, to which either nitrogen or phosphorus limiting medium was added in small doses every minute over the whole cultivation period. P limitation led to a higher carbon content per cell than N limitation. A large fraction of the carbon was stored in carbohydrates in N limited cells, and this biomass may be a suitable raw material for fermentation. Independent of treatment, a lipid content of around 10% of dry weight was found in this study. In our data the biomass production expressed in terms of cell numbers was highest at intermediate dilution rates, and the chemical composition of the cells was stable over several cycles of exponential increase in culture volume and following harvests. Higher yield of storage carbon can be achieved by increasing the total biomass production instead of maximizing the per cell content of lipids or carbohydrates.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; Carbohydrates; Fed-batch cultivation; Lipid; Nutrient limitation; Phaeodactylum tricornutum","Chemical compositions; Exponential fed-batch culture; Exponential increase; Fed-batch cultivation; Nutrient limitations; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Phosphorus limitation; Physiological effects; Algae; Batch cell culture; Carbohydrates; Carbon; Cells; Cytology; Digital storage; Forestry; Lipids; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Biomass; biomass; carbohydrate; carbon sequestration; chemical composition; diatom; growth rate; lipid; microalga; nutrient limitation; renewable resource; steady-state equilibrium; substrate; Bacillariophyta; Phaeodactylum tricornutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888838071

However the supply of energy wood is challenging because of high supply costs and rapidly increasing demand. Given, the heterogeneous structure of landownership, contractors and energy producers in Mid-Europe, supply network optimization is of major importance.A multi-criteria optimization problem (MOP) has been formulated, whereby the profit must be maximized and the CO2 emissions have to be minimized. The objective function includes decisions about chipping location, transport mode and volume and terminals used. To solve the MOP, the weighted sum scalarization approach was used to derive Pareto optimal points by stepwise changing weights from maximum profit to minimal CO2 emissions. The MOP was applied to a large-scale network of approximately 10,000 sources, 356 storage locations, 119 freight stations and 228 sinks with a demand of 982,000 t a-1.In an effort to minimize CO2 emissions, 30% of the woody biomass should be delivered chipped from the terminals and more than 50% chipped directly from forest. This results in CO2 emissions of 24.3kgt-1 and a profit of 3.0€t-1. The rest has to be transported in solid form directly from forest to plant. By changing the weight to maximize the profit, CO2 emissions will only increase by 4.5%, whereas the profit more than doubles from 3.0 to 7.4€t-1.

The aim of INDL is to provide technology independent descriptions of computing infrastructures, consisting of processing and storage resources and the network topology that connects these resources. INDL also provides descriptions for virtualization of resources and the services offered by resources. We build our infrastructure model upon the Network Markup Language (NML). Although INDL is a stand-alone model, it can be easily connected with the NML model. In this paper we show how INDL and NML are used as a basis for models used in three different applications: the CineGrid infrastructure, the Logical Infrastructure Composition Layer in the GEYSERS EU-FP7 project and the NOVI federation platform.

Below the percolation threshold the temperature dependence of the complex dielectric permittivity of the investigated composites is mainly caused by β relaxation in pure PMMA matrix and the dielectric permittivity is found to be higher in composites with thicker nanotubes. The activation energy of β relaxation increases with carbon nanotube concentration. The percolation threshold is lower in composites with both thinner and oxidized carbon nanotubes. The established influence of both the MWCNT mean outer diameter and their oxidation on the broadband dielectric characteristics can be exploited for the production of effective low-cost electromagnetic and/or antistatic coatings working at different temperatures. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The effects of vacuolar membrane ATPase (V-ATPase) dysfunction were studied on polyP accumulation under short-term cultivation in the Pi-excess media after Pi starvation. The addition of bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of V-ATPase, to the medium with glucose resulted in strong inhibition of the synthesis of long-chain polyP and in substantial suppression of short-chain polyP. The addition of bafilomycin to the medium with ethanol resulted in decreased accumulation of high-molecular polyP, while the accumulation of low-molecular polyP was not affected. The levels of polyP synthesis in the mutant strain with a deletion in the vma2 gene encoding a V-ATPase subunit were significantly lower than in the parent strain in the media with glucose and with ethanol. The synthesis of the longest chain polyP was not observed in the mutant cells. The synthesis of only the low-polymer acid-soluble polyP fraction occurred in the cells of the mutant strain. However, the level of polyP1 was nearly tenfold lower than compared to the cells of the parent strain. Both bafilomycin A1 and the mutation in vacuolar ATPase subunit vma2 lead to a considerable decrease of cellular polyP accumulation. Thus, the defects in ΔμH+ formation on the vacuolar membrane resulted in the decrease of polyP biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. © 2013 Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.",,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae; alcohol; bafilomycin A1; enzyme inhibitor; macrolide; polyphosphate; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; article; chemistry; culture medium; enzymology; gene deletion; genetics; metabolism; protein subunit; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Culture Media; Enzyme Inhibitors; Ethanol; Gene Deletion; Macrolides; Polyphosphates; Protein Subunits; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884670372

At the atomic level these transformation characteristics are influenced by a number of factors, including (i) the appearance of free surfaces, (ii) the initial presence of fcc-bcc grain boundaries, (iii) the existence of point defects (i.e., atomic vacancies) near a grain boundary, (iv) the initial thermal velocities of the atoms, and (v) the specific interatomic potential used. Other MD studies that capture the overall transformation behaviour of iron well have often underestimated or ignored the influence by these factors on the transformation response, with the risk of putting the accuracy, generality and physical explanation of the MD results on loose grounds. The present research illustrates the relative contribution of each of the above factors by means of a detailed comparison study for three different interatomic potentials. The accuracy of the interatomic potentials is established by validating for the fcc and bcc phases the calculated elastic moduli, cohesive energy, vacancy formation energy and interfacial energy against experimental and ab initio data reported in the literature. The importance of calibrating material data of both the stable bcc phase and the metastable fcc phase - instead of the stable bcc phase only - is demonstrated. The numerical results call for general caution when interpreting phenomena that start close to instability points and therefore are sensitive to small disturbances; a large spread in the overall transformation time is found under different initial thermal velocities, interfacial lattice incoherence, boundary conditions (free vs. periodic), and interatomic potentials, where for completely transformed atomic systems the discrepancy between the maximum and minimum transformation time appears to be more than a factor of 150. The transformation time is phenomenologically related to the overall activation energy and the cohesive energy difference of the fcc and bcc phases, which, beyond a certain combination of values, may even prevent the transformation process from occurring. Also, the morphology of the bcc product phase is remarkably sensitive to the type of boundary conditions and the choice of interatomic potential, while the influence by both the set of initial thermal velocities and the interfacial lattice incoherence only becomes apparent for specific atomic samples that transform relatively slowly. The presence of fcc-bcc grain boundaries increases the spatial heterogeneity of transformation events, with the appearance of an increasing number of vacancies at the grain boundary giving rise to a larger overall transformation time. The 10 main results following from the present MD study are conveniently summarised at the end of this communication. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Different interatomic potentials; Fcc-bcc transformation; Metals; Molecular dynamics simulations; Sensitivity to initial conditions","Fcc-bcc transformation; Interatomic potential; Molecular dynamics simulations; Relative contribution; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Spatial heterogeneity; Transformation process; Vacancy formation energies; Activation energy; Boundary conditions; Crystallography; Grain boundaries; Hydrogen storage alloys; Iron; Metals; Molecular dynamics; Morphology; Nucleation; Point defects; Vacancies; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883777786

For the manufacturing of such probiotic formulations, drying of microorganisms is an important process. Spray drying is a well-established and economical method for this purpose. Using spray drying, however, cells are exposed to stress, affecting their viability. The aim of this study was to generate a systemic knowledge about the impact of spray drying on the viability of B. bifidum BB-12. First, the effect of thermal stress was investigated by exposure of B. bifidum BB-12 to different temperatures in defined time intervals. The alterations in cell membrane integrity and esterase activity were studied using fluorimetry and compared to the heat response of the robust strain E. faecium M-74. Exposing microorganisms to the same temperatures, alterations in the viability of B. bifidum BB-12 occurred after shorter time intervals. Moreover, cell membrane damage and changes in the esterase activity were more rigorous, indicating the higher sensitivity of B. bifidum BB-12. Then, B. bifidum BB-12 was spray dried. The impact of spray drying on the changes in the membrane integrity and membrane potential was investigated using flow cytometry. Culturability was investigated using plate count method. Unprotected B. bifidum BB-12 was markedly harmed by the drying process, drastic membrane damage, depolarization and reduced culturability were observed. The protective impact of excipients on the cell damage during spray drying and one month storage was evaluated. Gum arabic, gelatin and pectin showed the best protective impact. Cells pre-treated with these excipients showed reduced membrane damage, enhanced stability and improved culturability during the storage time. Application of the gathered knowledge may contribute to develop rapid tools for investigation of the cell viability and to improve the production yield. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Heat stress; Probiotics; Spray drying; Stabilization; Storage; Viability","Bifidobacterium bifidum; Cell membrane damages; Cellular properties; Esterase activities; Heat stress; Membrane potentials; Probiotics; Viability; Cell membranes; Cytology; Energy storage; Enzymes; Esters; Microorganisms; Stabilization; Thermal stress; Spray drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880290765

The aim of this work is to illustrate the need to harmonize the quantification of such mitigation across all possible storage pools in the bio- and anthroposphere. We investigate nine alternative storage cases and a wide array of bio-resource pools: from annual crops, short rotation woody crops, medium rotation temperate forests, and long rotation boreal forests. For each feedstock type and biogenic carbon storage pool, we quantify the carbon cycle climate impact due to the skewed time distribution between emission and sequestration fluxes in the bio- and anthroposphere. Additional consideration of the climate impact from albedo changes in forests is also illustrated for the boreal forest case. When characterizing climate impact with global warming potentials (GWP), we find a large variance in results which is attributed to different combinations of biomass storage and feedstock systems. The storage of biogenic carbon in any storage pool does not always confer climate benefits: even when biogenic carbon is stored long-term in durable product pools, the climate outcome may still be undesirable when the carbon is sourced from slow-growing biomass feedstock. For example, when biogenic carbon from Norway Spruce from Norway is stored in furniture with a mean life time of 43years, a climate change impact of 0.08kg CO2eq per kg CO2 stored (100year time horizon (TH)) would result. It was also found that when biogenic carbon is stored in a pool with negligible leakage to the atmosphere, the resulting GWP factor is not necessarily -1 CO2eq per kg CO2 stored. As an example, when biogenic CO2 from Norway Spruce biomass is stored in geological reservoirs with no leakage, we estimate a GWP of -0.56kg CO2eq per kg CO2 stored (100year TH) when albedo effects are also included. The large variance in GWPs across the range of resource and carbon storage options considered indicates that more accurate accounting will require case-specific factors derived following the methodological guidelines provided in this and recent manuscripts. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Biochar; Bioenergy; Biomass; CCS; Climate change impact; LCA","Bio chars; Bio-energy; CCS; Climate change impact; LCA; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon capture; Crops; Feedstocks; Forestry; Global warming; Lakes; Plants (botany); Solar radiation; Carbon dioxide; accuracy assessment; biogenic material; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate effect; global warming; plant community; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879595520

A previous study using delayed electron detachment as a signal of resonance-enhanced multiphoton electron detachment (REMPED) has been repeated both at room temperature and with the trap cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. However, wavelength dependence of the overlap of the strongly focused laser beam with the ion beam introduces distortions of the absorption spectrum. We have therefore applied a new method, combining the IR light with a slightly delayed, powerful UV pulse (266 nm). After absorption of three UV photons, the ions decay by delayed (thermal) electron emission, and time spectra are recorded for varying wavelength. The fraction of ions heated by absorption of a single IR photon is then extracted from a principal component analysis of these spectra. In good agreement with the earlier REMPED experiment, an origin band for transitions between the two lowest electronic levels of the anion, with t1u and t1g symmetry, is observed at 9380 cm-1, with strong sidebands from excitation of the two Ag and eight Hg vibrations. As before, a hot band is observed at about 9150 cm-1 and assigned to a transition from an excited vibronic Jahn-Teller state. However, an earlier observed band at higher energy, interpreted as a transition from this excited state to an excited vibronic state in the t1g electronic level, is much weaker in the new measurements and could be an Hg vibrational sideband. Also earlier studies of direct laser detachment from C 60- in the storage ring ASTRID have been revisited, with ions cooled by liquid nitrogen in the ion trap. We confirm the previous measurement with a determination of the threshold for s-wave detachment at 2.664 ± 0.005 eV, slightly lower than a recent value of the electron binding, 2.683 ± 0.008 eV, obtained from the energy spectrum of photo electrons. The detachment yield is observed to increase sharply for photon energies above a threshold at 2.78 eV, maybe caused by either Feshbach resonances or a shape resonance due to the presence of a bound electron state in the continuum. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Electron detachments; Electronic levels; Feshbach resonances; Focused laser beams; Liquid nitrogen temperature; Photo-excitations; Vibrational sidebands; Wavelength dependence; Absorption spectroscopy; Electrons; Laser excitation; Multiphoton processes; Negative ions; Photons; Principal component analysis; Storage rings; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903362534

Molecular engineering is an inherent part of nanotechnology and often involves manipulation of molecules at the nanoscale. The synthesis of organic molecules is usually the first experimental step to take whether the overall aim is to develop a nanomachine or molecular motor, a memory device, or an artificial enzyme that can catalyze specific transformations. Organic synthesis is therefore an integral part of the book, and several chapters have a special emphasis on synthetic protocols. The book focuses on molecule-based computers, intelligent drug delivery systems, organic molecules that are as efficient as enzymes for performing catalytic reactions but structurally much simpler, peptide engineering of new catalysts, molecular sensors, materials for optical data storage, new electrically conducting materials, and new energy-storage materials. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The main objective of NRG's contribution is to characterize and optimize the energy use of this technique within the specific context of post-closure monitoring of a repository. For that, measurements have been performed in the HADES underground laboratory (URL) located at Mol, Belgium, at 225 m depth. The experimental set-up utilizes a loop antenna as a transmitter that has been matched to the existing infrastructure of the HADES. Between 2010 and 2012 NRG carried out several experiments at the HADES URL in order to test the technical set-up and to characterize the propagation behaviour of the geological medium and the local background noise pattern. Potential transmission channels have been identified up to 1.8 kHz and data transmission has been demonstrated at several frequencies, with data rates up to 10 bit/s and bit error rates <1%. A mathematical model description of the most relevant characteristics of the transmitter, transmission path, and receiver has been developed and al-lows to analyse possible options to optimize the set-up. With respect to the energy-efficiency, model calculations and results so far have shown that data transmission over larger distances through the subsurface is a feasible option. To support the predictions on the energy need per bit of transmitted data, additional experiments are foreseen.",,"Additional experiments; Deep geological disposal; Low frequency magnetic fields; Post-closure monitoring; Potential transmissions; Transmission paths; Underground laboratory; Wireless data transmission; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Electromagnetic fields; Experiments; Mathematical models; Optimization; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive wastes; Transmitters; Waste disposal; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886933028

However, an RBASL expects the block size to be fixed. In a realistic scenario, where the updates can be of variable size, an RBASL performs O(n) update operations on the data structure when a change in the file occurs, where is the number of blocks.

LZBH shows the structure of two identical interpenetrated three-dimensional frameworks with no bonds between them, not observed before in metal hydrides. The structural peculiarity and uniqueness among metal hydrides prompts the investigation of molecular dynamics responsible for the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of LZBH. Molecular dynamics was investigated experimentally by 1H and 7Li NMR spectrum and spin-lattice relaxation techniques. Different thermally activated reorientational processes of BH 4 tetrahedra about their 2-fold and 3-fold symmetry axes were identified from the temperature-dependent proton and lithium spin-lattice relaxation rates and were quantified by their activation energies, in relation to the LiZn2(BH4)5 structural details. The five BH4 tetrahedra of a given [Zn2(BH4) 5]- complex anion were classified into two groups with different dynamic properties, the first group containing terminal tetrahedra with crystallographically inequivalent B1, B2, and B4 boron atoms and the second group containing the bridging tetrahedron with the B3 boron atom.

Here, we demonstrate how the forward flux sampling method (FFS) can be used to determine the thermal stability of magnets with general microstructures for time scales ranging from picoseconds to years. To apply FFS to magnetic systems, we first use the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to determine a minimum energy path connecting the initial with the final state of the magnetic transition. Interfaces defined based on this minimum energy path then provide the basis for the FFS procedure in which dynamical trajectories are generated by integrating a stochastic version of the fundamental equation of motion of the magnetization (Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation) at finite temperature. This approach allows to determine average lifetimes for incoherent reversal processes and it can be applied for any value of the damping constant. We validate the method for a single-grain particle by comparison with the results of direct Langevin simulations carried out and demonstrate its capabilities and efficiency by computing the lifetime of a graded media grain, a magnetic structure with a tailored magnetocrystalline spatial anisotropy profile. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885736781

The optimal control of water availability and aeration is an essential prerequisite to successfully operate plant growth systems with soilless substrates such as aggregated foamed glass, perlite, rockwool, coconut coir, or mixtures thereof. While there are considerable empirical and theoretical efforts devoted to characterize water retention and aeration substrate properties, a holistic, physically-based approach considering water retention and aeration concurrently is lacking. In this study, the previously developed concept of integral water storage and energy was expanded to dual-porosity substrates and an analog integral oxygen diffusivity parameter was introduced to simultaneously characterize aeration properties of four common soilless greenhouse growth media. Integral parameters were derived for greenhouse crops in general, as well as for tomatoes. The integral approach provided important insights for irrigation management and for potential optimization of substrate properties. Furthermore, an observed relationship between the integral parameters for water availability and oxygen diffusivity can be potentially applied for the design of advanced irrigation and management strategies to ensure stress-free growth conditions, while conserving water resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Integral energy; Integral oxygen diffusivity; Integral water storage; Plant available water; Soilless plant growth substrates; Substrate water characteristic","Available water; Integral energy; Oxygen diffusivity; Plant growth; Water characteristics; Water storage; Design; Diffusion; Food supply; Greenhouses; Irrigation; Oxygen; Substrates; Water resources; Water aeration; aeration; agricultural development; agricultural management; empirical analysis; growth rate; irrigation system; plant community; water availability; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883771315

They are mainly used for permanent magnets, catalysts, hydrogen storage alloys for rechargeable batteries, glasses, ceramics and polishing agents. Moreover these elements are needed for the production of phosphors used in different types of lamps (fluorescent tubes, energy-saving lamps, etc.). At the end of their life cycle the illuminants are often collected and mechanically treated. On the one hand the utilized processes produce coarse fractions primarily containing glass, metal and plastics. On the other hand spent phosphors, which include small amounts of mercury and bits of broken glass, are enriched in the fine fractions which are frequently disposed in special landfills till today. Due to China's export restrictions of REE and the resulting increase in price during 2010 and 2011 many countries realized their dependency on these elements. Therefore the recycling of rare earth bearing secondary raw materials obtained economical and strategic relevance. One of the major challenges in processing spent phosphors for the extraction of rare earths is constituted by the large number of different compounds and their individual chemical properties (e.g. solubility) in aqueous phases. Therefore, the aim of the investigations on laboratory scale was the development of a hydrometallurgical process for a RE concentrate production with low contents of impurities and high yields for the recovery of rare earths. In this connection, the number of required process steps should be limited in order to enable an economic operation. The full paper will be published soon after the conference in a scientific journal.","Hydrometallurgy; Phosphors; Rare earths; Recovery","Coarse fractions; Economic operations; Export restrictions; Fluorescent tubes; Hydrometallurgical process; Polishing agents; Scientific journals; Secondary Raw Materials; Glass; Hydrogen storage alloys; Hydrometallurgy; Light emission; Lighting; Metallurgy; Phosphors; Recovery; Recycling; Rare earths",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884936263

Due to hardening during natural aging, which commences instantly after quenching, the aluminium industry cannot guarantee its customers consistent forming properties of quenched sheets. Nevertheless, delivery in a naturally aged state is necessary, especially as the claim for an excellent forming behavior exists. Formability would be significantly worse in an artificially aged, stable state. An important technical aim of this project therefore is to stabilize the quenched state of 6xxx alloys as long as possible at a low strength level or to maximally slow down the initial hardness increase. Besides negatively influencing stability properties, natural aging also shows a rather adverse effect on subsequent artificial aging. For sheet material used in the automotive industry this is of major disadvantage as not only the attainable strength level, but also age hardening kinetics during artificial aging are reduced. Thus the hardness increase as well as achievable strength values during paint baking of automobile bodies for 30 minutes, are strongly restricted. For slab material the physical process of natural aging is relevant because after few hours the hardening potential during artificial aging is reduced. On the one hand the aim now is energy saving due to shorter artificial aging periods (slab material) because of the increased artificial aging kinetics while avoiding age-hardening during room temperature storage. On the other hand improved properties with regard to maximum strength (sheet and slab material) are aspired. In cooperation with the AMAG Austria Metall AG, the aforementioned objectives are intended to be achieved with the help of marginal changes in the alloy composition (addition of microalloying elements) while at the same time optimizing individual artificial aging steps. It is presumed, that the gained knowledge can be extended to other alloy classes.",,"Age hardening kinetics; Age-hardenable aluminium alloys; Alloy compositions; Aluminium industry; Forming properties; Micro-alloying elements; Precipitation behaviour; Stability properties; Age hardening; Aluminum alloys; Automotive industry; Hardness; Metallurgy; Microalloying; Stability; Strength of materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884918635

In the blends, fatty acids act as a phase change material when polyethyl methacrylate is operated as a supporting material. The fatty acids could be retained by 50 wt% into polyethyl methacrylate without melted phase change material seepage from the blends. Therefore, these blends are called form stable composite phase change materials and they have utility advantage without encapsulation in passive latent heat thermal energy storage applications. The prepared fatty acid/polyethyl methacrylate blends (50/50 w/w%) as form-stable phase change material was characterized using optic microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy methods and the results showed that the polyethyl methacrylate was physically and chemically compatible with the fatty acids. Thermal properties and thermal stabilities of the form-stable phase change materials were measured using differential scanning calorimetry. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that the melting temperatures and latent heats of the prepared phase change materials are in the range of 30.67-61.09°C and 86.93-107.75 J/g, respectively. The thermal cycling test, including 5,000 cycling processes, was conducted to determine the thermal reliability of the synthesized form-stable phase change materials, and it is found that phase change materials were thermally and chemically stable after thermal cycling. On the basis of all the results, it was concluded that form stable polyethyl methacrylate/fatty acids composite phase change materials had important potential for practical latent heat thermal energy storage applications, such as under floor space heating of buildings and passive solar space heating of buildings by using wallboard, plasterboard, or floors impregnated with a form stable phase change material. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","composite phase change material; fatty acid; polyethyl methacrylate; thermal energy storage; thermal properties","Composite phase change materials; Form stable phase change material; Form-stable composite phase change materials; Form-stable phase change materials; Fourier transform infra reds; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Polyethyl methacrylates; Thermal cycling test; Building materials; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fatty acids; Floors; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heat storage; Heating; Latent heat; Spectroscopic analysis; Thermal cycling; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Walls (structural partitions); Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882396028

Whereas we first placed mills along our rivers to put water's power to use, today we have over 5,200 water power stations of various types, from the smallest facilities to pumped-storage hydroelectric plants in the Alps. Today, water power accounts for roughly 60 % of our domestic power production, though the various types of power stations used have diverse ecological effects. This article presents a ""win-win"" approach to improving both hydropower production and ecological outcomes on the basis of the Kamp River in Lower Austria. The Kamp is not only home to a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant and the major plants Ottenstein, Dobra-Krumberg and Thurnberg-Wegscheid, but also to 14 smaller plants with turbines that are between 25 and 75 years old, many of them with energy conversion efficiency ratios of well under 0.7. Using the case study of a small water power plant, the chances of achieving a win-win situation are presented in detail. In this context, replacing the turbines is a major aspect of improving these plants. Extensive analyses have demonstrated that balanced planning approaches can yield both higher efficiency and better conditions for aquatic ecology, thanks to increased residual flows. Further, energy calculations and numerical habitat simulations have confirmed that a win-win situation is feasible for the small power plant studied, especially if Kaplan turbines are used. For example, they show that, despite the increased residual flow of up to 800 l/s, a considerable performance increase over the status quo is possible (maximum performance increase of 17 % without considering residual flow). If the residual flow was only 400 l/s, which tests indicate would mean an improvement in the habitat conditions for all ages of the dominant fish species (the brown trout) of > 50 %, a performance increase of 8 % would be the result. Thanks to the generally applicable methodology used, the win-win approach presented here can broadly be used in the optimization, efficiency improvement and revitalization of current hydropower plants, producing both more electricity and higher residual flow levels to improve local ecological conditions. In order to make this win-win situation a reality, innovative and integrative financial models for e.g. new turbines related to the fields of green energy production and environmental protection will be essential. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"electricity; electricity generation; environmental protection; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; optimization; residual flow; simulation; Austria; Kamp River; Lower Austria; Salmo trutta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886092453

Similar effects are observed in response to endurance training. The aim was to compare the effects of endurance training with erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment in healthy humans. Thirty-six healthy untrained men were randomized to 10 wk of either: 1) placebo (n = 9), 2) ESA (n = 9), 3) endurance training (n = 10), or 4) ESA and endurance training (n = 8). In a single-blinded design, ESA/placebo was injected one time weekly. Training consisted of biking for 1 h at 65%of wattmax three times per week. Measurements performed before and after the intervention were as follows: body composition, maximal oxygen uptake, insulin sensitivity, REE, and palmitate turnover. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) mRNA levels were assessed in skeletal muscle. Fat mass decreased after training (P = 0.003), whereas ESA induced a small but significant increase in intrahepatic fat (P = 0.025). Serum free fatty acid (FFA) levels and palmitate turnover decreased significantly in response to training, whereas the opposite pattern was found after ESA. REE corrected for lean body mass increased in response to ESA and training, and muscle UCP2 mRNA levels increased after ESA (P = 0.035). Insulin sensitivity increased only after training (P = 0.011). In conclusion: 1) insulin sensitivity is not improved after ESA treatment despite improved exercise capacity, 2) the calorigenic effects of ESA may be related to increased UCP2 gene expression in skeletal muscle, and 3) training and ESA exert opposite effects on lipolysis under basal conditions, increased FFA levels and liver fat fraction was observed after ESA treatment. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.","Body composition; Insulin sensitivity; Intrahepatic lipid; Metabolism; Resting energy expenditure","cytochrome c; hemoglobin; messenger RNA; novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein; palmitic acid; placebo; uncoupling protein 2; adult; article; basal metabolic rate; biking; body composition; clinical article; controlled study; endurance training; fat mass; fatty acid blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; insulin sensitivity; lean body weight; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; metabolism; normal human; oxygen consumption; physical activity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; resting energy expenditure; single blind procedure; skeletal muscle; treatment duration; body composition; insulin sensitivity; intrahepatic lipid; metabolism; resting energy expenditure; Adult; Body Composition; Energy Metabolism; Erythropoietin; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Conditioning, Human; Physical Endurance; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884923159

However, little is known about Jatropha, and there are a number of challenges to be overcome. In fact, Jatropha has not really been domesticated; most of the Jatropha accessions are toxic, which renders the seedcake unsuitable for use as animal feed. The seeds of Jatropha contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which negatively impact the biofuel quality. Fruiting of Jatropha is fairly continuous, thus increasing costs of harvesting. Therefore, before starting any improvement program using conventional or molecular breeding techniques, understanding gene function and the genome scale of Jatropha are prerequisites. This review presents currently available and relevant information on the latest technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) to decipher important metabolic pathways within Jatropha, such as oil and toxin synthesis. Further, it discusses future directions for biotechnological approaches in Jatropha breeding and improvement. © 2013 The Authors. Biotechnology Journal published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Bragstads plass 2E, 7490 Trondheim, Norway","Recent years attitude towards climate and CO2 emissions has accelerated the sale of electric and hybrid vehicles in Norway. By the end of 2012 there were 10 000 battery electric vehicles registered. Projections indicate that Norway may surpass 200 000 chargeable vehicles by 2020, counting both battery electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. This corresponds to 7 % of the total vehicle fleet. To explore the impact a large scale electric vehicle adoption will have on the power grid, simulations of an existing low voltage power system has been conducted. The load flow simulation tool Simpow was used for this purpose, and Nord-Trøndelag Elektrisitetsverk provided information of the grid structure and consumer consumption data. From the supplied data, December 22 was chosen for the 24 hour simulation period, because it represents the highest energy consumption scenario. A hypothetically built wind turbine close to the residences was integrated in the system, using wind measurement data from a wind farm in Nord-Trøndelag. Different scenarios with regards to electric vehicle charging were explored, investigating how sensitive the grid is to additional load under different assumption patterns, and how the wind generation can contribute to a more self-sustained power system. Symmetrical and asymmetrical distribution in relation to physical location of the additional load has been compared, and the results suggest that one cannot give an exact number of vehicles that the system can handle. This system capacity when operating with dumb charging strategies is somewhere between 4 and 22 electric vehicles, depending on where the vehicles are situated physically. In other words, the placements of the additional loads are equally decisive for the system voltage variations as the number of loads are. By applying smart charging strategies, it seems the system is able to handle a large share of electric vehicle adoption. Wind generation during December 22 is higher than the residence base consumption, resulting in 593 kWh excess energy in the system. An energy storage of a 100 kWh capacity in addition to the wind generation could cover base load if the system was to operate without grid connection. Additionally, the excess energy could potentially be used to charge electric vehicles. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Asymmetrical distributions; Battery electric vehicles; Charging strategies; Electric and hybrid vehicles; Electric vehicle charging; Low-voltage power systems; Number of vehicles; Physical locations; Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Hybrid vehicles; Wind power; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884627139

Vitamin D (VD) may be implicated in obesity and its complications such as insulin resistance, hypertension, and low-grade inflammation. We investigated the effects of VD supplementation on fat distribution and on obesity complications in obese adults with low plasma levels of 25OHD. Methods In a double-blind design 52 subjects aged 18 to 50 years with BMI &gt; 30 kg/m 2 and plasma 25OHD &lt; 50 nmol/l were randomized to 26 weeks of treatment with 7000 IU of VD daily or placebo. Body composition was assessed by DXA and subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), intrahepatic (IHL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood pressure, plasma lipids, and circulating inflammatory markers were also investigated. Results VD treatment increased mean plasma levels of 25OHD from 33 nmol/l to 110 nmol/l (P &lt; 0.0001) and decreased median parathyroid hormone levels from 5.3 to 4.5 pmol/l (P &lt; 0.01) in the intervention group. Treatment did not change body fat, SAT, VAT, IHL, or IMCL compared with placebo. Neither did treatment affect HOMA, blood pressure, plasma lipids or any of several inflammatory markers investigated including hsCRP. Conclusion Increasing 25OHD levels by VD treatment for 26 weeks have no effects on obesity complications in obese adults with low baseline plasma 25OHD. © 2013 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

We analyzed four different peroxisome-deficient (pex) phenotypes. These included Δpex3 cells that lack peroxisomal membranes and in which all peroxisomal proteins are mislocalized together with Δpex6 in which all matrix proteins are mislocalized to the cytosol, whereas membrane proteins are still correctly sorted to peroxisomal ghosts. In addition, we analyzed two mutants in which the peroxisomal location of the β-oxidation machinery is in part disturbed. We analyzed Δpex7 cells that contain virtually normal peroxisomes, except that all matrix proteins that contain a peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2, also including thiolase), are mislocalized to the cytosol. In Δpex5 cells, peroxisomes only contain matrix proteins with a PTS2 in conjunction with all proteins containing a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1, including all β-oxidation enzymes except thiolase) are mislocalized to the cytosol. We show that intact peroxisomes are an important factor in yeast chronological aging because all pex mutants showed a reduced chronological lifespan. The strongest reduction was observed in Δpex5 cells. Our data indicate that this is related to the complete inactivation of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway in these cells due to the mislocalization of thiolase. Our studies suggest that during chronological aging, peroxisomal β-oxidation contributes to energy generation by the oxidation of fatty acids that are released by degradation of storage materials and recycled cellular components during carbon starvation conditions. © 2013 The Authors.

This paper quantifies the potentials of energy efficiency technologies and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) for seven Dutch industry sectors between 2008 and 2040. Economically viable energy efficiency technologies offer carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction potentials of 25±8% in 2040 compared to 1990 levels. Economically viable CCS options can raise the industry's total emission reductions to 39-47%. These potentials require abatement costs above 90 € (Euro) per tonne CO2, but they are still not sufficient to reach European Union's long term emission reduction plans. While economically viable potentials of improving energy efficiency may exist in all sectors (energy efficiency improvements of 2% per annum (p.a.)), attractive CCS potentials exist in the fertilizer, basic metal and refinery sectors with abatement costs estimated at 25-120 €/t CO2 for 2040. Implementing CCS in these sectors would reduce total industry's primary energy efficiency improvement rates from 2% to 1.6% p.a. and would increase total industrial energy use by at least 10%.

Yet recent cases show that CCS faces divergent public acceptance issues. This paper investigates stakeholder perspectives on CCS in Indonesia. Q methodology was adopted to analyse the diversity of stakeholder perspectives. Four perspectives were identified: (1) ""CO2 emissions reduction through clean energy sources rather than CCS""; (2) ""CCS as one of the options in the transition to a sustainable energy system""; (3) ""CCS as the only optimal solution to reduce CO2 emissions""; (4) ""CCS is only a tactic to keep burning coal forever"". Based on these results, we argue that stakeholder acceptance of CCS should be understood as a complex notion.

We evaluate the impact of cross-border transmission capacity on dispatch costs, curtailment needs for renewable energy sources (RES), on CO2 emissions, on hydro storage utilisation and on security of supply (in terms of energy not served). The analysis is performed with EUPowerDispatch, a minimum-cost dispatch model. For the evolution of the electricity generation portfolio and electricity consumption we use the latest Scenario Outlook and Adequacy Forecast of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). The model results show that the planned additional cross-border transmission capacity between 2010 and 2025 will reduce annual dispatch costs, will have limited impact on the security of supply and will not be a significant cause of variable RES curtailment. However, in case of more RES, it will reduce dispatch costs to a larger extent and will considerably reduce RES curtailment needs, and, if demand grows at the historical rate of 2%, it will be needed to maintain the current level of security of supply. Moreover, our study shows that hydro pumping and storage and cross-border transmission are partly complementary technologies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cross-border electricity transmission; Hydro energy storage; Renewable energy sources","Cross-border electricity transmissions; Electricity generation; Electricity-consumption; European networks; Renewable energy source; Security of supply; Transmission capacities; Transmission system operators; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Investments; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Cost benefit analysis; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy resource; energy use; hydroelectric power; renewable resource; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881661753

During the dehydration of these materials, there are chances for the release of harmful HCl gas, which can potentially damage the material as well as the equipment. Hydrolysis reactions in magnesium chloride hydrates are subject of study for industrial applications. However, the information about the possibility of hydrolysis reaction, and its preference over dehydration in energy storage systems is still ambiguous at the operating conditions in a seasonal heat storage system. A density functional theory level study is performed to determine molecular structures, charges, and harmonic frequencies in order to identify the formation of HCl at the operating temperatures in an energy storage system. The preference of hydrolysis over dehydration is quantified by applying thermodynamic equilibrium principles by calculating Gibbs free energies of the hydrated magnesium chloride molecules. The molecular structures of the hydrates (n = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6) of MgCl 2 are investigated to understand the stability and symmetry of these molecules. The structures are found to be noncomplex with almost no meta-stable isomers, which may be related to the faster kinetics observed in the hydration of chlorides compared to sulfates. Also, the frequency spectra of these molecules are calculated, which in turn are used to calculate the changes in Gibbs free energy of dehydration and hydrolysis reactions. From these calculations, it is found that the probability for hydrolysis to occur is larger for lower hydrates. Hydrolysis occurring from the hexa-, tetra-, and di-hydrate is only possible when the temperature is increased too fast to a very high value. In the case of the mono-hydrate, hydrolysis may become favorable at high water vapor pressure and at low HCl pressure. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Chlorine compounds; Dehydration; Density functional theory; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Heat storage; Hydration; Hydrolysis; Isomers; Molecules; Oil field equipment; Storage (materials); Sulfur compounds; Dehydration reactions; Energy storage systems; Hydrolysis reaction; Magnesium chlorides; Operating condition; Operating temperature; Seasonal heat storages; Thermodynamic equilibria; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903365353

This question also provides strong motivation for honing the concept of a micro grid as an atomic cell of future active distribution networks as well as the smallest market entity. The micro grid locally balances demand and supply in a far more efficient way than in current practice. Complementary, the micro grid market offers basis for creating energy prices that stimulate investments in renewable generation, storage, and demand response. As similar to the current energy markets, the micro grid market can accommodate trading of the short term and the long term energy products, balancing energy and capacity. The foundation of trading is forecasting and optimization, and consequently each party involved in micro grid trading must be able to forecast its demand, supply, or flexibility. But how precise these forecasts must be? This paper focuses on the impact of forecasting errors on the economic effects of trading and balancing in the micro grid: while lower forecasting accuracy induces greater differences between forecasted and real consumption/generation, and hence higher need for balancing energy, higher forecasting precision may increase the cost of the system. We present results of an agent-based simulation study of a micro grid with a simple market integrating local suppliers and customers with flexible loads, renewable energy sources and storage capacity. These actors buy energy, sell demand reduction, and sell energy produced by their wind turbines and solar panels, or stored in their battery. The Micro grid System Operator (MSO) operates the local market and balances demand and supply. In our model MSO operates a dedicated storage and interacts with the global grid markets and performs clearing and settlement of balancing energy costs. In the presented study we compare the economic results of trading and balancing for different values of forecasting errors in scenarios characterized with different supply levels in the micro grid. © 2013 IEEE.","demand forecasting; energy market; microgrid","Active distribution networks; Agent based simulation; Demand forecasting; Energy markets; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting precision; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Electric load forecasting; Electric power distribution; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Technology; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884370308

This demand becomes flexible if investing in complementing heat storage capabilities. In this study, we analyse how the heat pumps can influence the integration of wind power by applying an energy system model that optimises both investments and operation, and covers various heat storage options. The Danish energy system by 2030 with around 50-60% wind power is used as a case study. Results show that the heat pumps, even without flexible operation, can contribute significantly to facilitating larger wind power investments and reducing system costs, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. Investments in heat storages can provide only moderate system benefits in these respects. The main benefit of the flexible heat pump operation is a reduced need for peak/reserve capacity, which is also crucial for the feasibility of the heat storages. Socio-economic feasibility is identified for control equipment enabling intelligent heat storage in the building structure and in existing hot water tanks. In contrast, investments in new heat accumulation tanks are not found competitive. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that in the considered range of the pulse repetition rates f = 2 - 16 kHz in the first case we deal with a typical energy dependence on frequency having a maximum near 4 - 5 kHz. In the second case, the lasing energy is frequency-independent; hence, the average power in this range is proportional to f.

Moreover, energy storage systems have a high potential of not only smoothing and improving the predictability of the intermittent renewables but also of providing the ancillary services in the future energy markets. However, this is currently difficult to achieve due to high prices of the energy storage systems and difficulties with accurate prediction of the energy storage systems lifetime, which introduces significant risk into the business model. This paper deals with the investigation of the lifetime of LiFePO4/C battery systems when they are used to provide primary frequency regulation service. A semi-empirical lifetime model for these battery cells was developed based on the results obtained from accelerated lifetime testing. The developed Li-ion battery lifetime model is later a base for the analyses of the economic profitability of the investment in the Li-ion battery energy storage system (BESS), which delivers the primary frequency regulation service on the Danish electricity market. Moreover, in this paper a possible improvement of the Li-ion BESS energy management strategy is shown, which allows for obtaining the higher NPV. © 2013 IEEE.","Batteries; Frequency regulation; Life estimation; Wind energy","Accelerated lifetime testing; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Frequency regulations; Intermittent renewables; Life estimation; Primary frequency regulation; Renewable energy generation; Energy conversion; Exhibitions; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Solar cells; Wind power; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883707907

A continuous gradient sample and discrete gradient samples (25 and 188 samples) were deposited. Ternary alloys were prepared from pre-blended powder mixtures. Chemical composition measurements showed that samples of different compositions can be synthesized. XRD phase analysis indicated that structures close to equilibrium or occasionally quenched are obtained after the process. The microstructure of the prepared samples was analyzed. The hydrogen storage properties of the selected samples were investigated. After laser deposition, the samples were found to absorb significant quantities of hydrogen with just a simple activation.

The prepared alloy exhibited good chemical composition after laser deposition, compared to the nominal composition, which was further improved using high-temperature annealing at 1000 C for 24 h. Better powder quality and the optimization of the LENS parameters are still necessary for obtaining the improved chemical homogeneity of the alloy after synthesis. The alloy exhibited a two-phase structure, i.e., the dominant C14 Laves phase matrix with a minor amount of the α-Ti solid solution, after synthesis and annealing. The PCT isotherms were measured up to 100 bar of hydrogen pressure at 50 C after activation of the alloy by annealing at 500 C for 2 h under vacuum. The obtained maximum hydrogen capacity was 1.81 wt.% after synthesis and 1.56 wt.% after additional annealing. The equilibrium pressure of hydrogen desorption was too low for a complete desorption reaction, resulting in the presence of a C14 hydride phase in the alloy after PCT tests. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Autophagy research has gained a strong momentum in recent years because of its relevance to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, muscular dystrophy, lipid storage disorders, development, ageing and innate immunity. Autophagy has traditionally been thought of as a bulk degradation process that is mobilized upon nutritional starvation to replenish the cell with building blocks and keep up with the energy demand. This view has recently changed dramatically following an array of papers describing various forms of selective autophagy. A main driving force has been the discovery of specific autophagy receptors that sequester cargo into forming autophagosomes (phagophores). At the heart of this selectivity lies the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which ensures the targeting of autophagy receptors to LC3 (or other ATG8 family proteins) anchored in the phagophore membrane. LIR-containing proteins include cargo receptors, members of the basal autophagy apparatus, proteins associated with vesicles and of their transport, Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and specific signaling proteins that are degraded by selective autophagy. Here, we comment on these new insights and focus on the interactions of LIR-containing proteins with members of the ATG8 protein family. © 2013.

In this way it is possible to reduce the energy consumption and improve the thermal comfort in buildings. The introduction of micro and nanomaterials in the mortars matrix can cause microstructural changes that need to be addressed in order to optimize the PCM addition. The relationship between the hardened state performance of different PCM-mortars, its internal microstructure and pore distribution as been observed for different binders such as lime, cement and gypsum. Their hardened state properties, microstructural modifications and heat storage capabilities were evaluated. The ability to store and release heat depends strongly on the size and distribution of internal pores and not only on the PCM content. Using a thermal efficiency test, an important correlation between thermal performance and the mortars microstructure was established, for mortars with 0-30% of PCM added. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This causes temperature perturbations far beyond the natural variations in aquifers and the effects of these temperature variations on groundwater quality, in particular trace elements, have not been investigated. Here, we report the results of column experiments to assess the impacts of temperature variations (5°C, 11°C, 25°C and 60°C) on groundwater quality in anoxic reactive unconsolidated sandy sediments derived from an aquifer system widely used for drinking water production in the Netherlands. Our results showed that at 5°C no effects on water quality were observed compared to the reference of 11°C (in situ temperature). At 25°C, As concentrations were significantly increased and at 60°C, significant increases were observed pH and DOC, P, K, Si, As, Mo, V, B, and F concentrations. These elements should therefore be considered for water quality monitoring programs of shallow geothermal energy projects. No consistent temperature effects were observed on Na, Ca, Mg, Sr, Fe, Mn, Al, Ba, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Eu, Ho, Sb, Sc, Yb, Ga, La, and Th concentrations, all of which were present in the sediment. The temperature-induced chemical effects were probably caused by (incongruent) dissolution of silicate minerals (K and Si), desorption from, and potentially reductive dissolution of, iron oxides (As, B, Mo, V, and possibly P and DOC), and mineralisation of sedimentary organic matter (DOC and P). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Arsenic; Desorption; Ground source heat pumps; Groundwater quality; Shallow geothermal energy; Trace elements","Anoxic sediments; Aquifers; Arsenic; Desorption; Dissolution; Geothermal heat pumps; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Iron oxides; Organic minerals; Potable water; Silicate minerals; Temperature distribution; Trace elements; Water quality; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Drinking water production; Reductive dissolution; Sedimentary organic matter; Shallow geothermal energies; Temperature perturbations; Temperature variation; Water quality monitoring; Geothermal energy; aluminum; arsenic; barium ion; calcium; cobalt; cuprous ion; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; ground water; iron; iron oxide; lanthanum; lead; manganese; nickel; silicate; sodium ion; strontium; thorium; zinc; anoxic conditions; aquifer pollution; arsenic; cobalt; concentration (composition); copper; desorption; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic phosphorus; drinking water; geothermal energy; heat flow; iron oxide; mineralization; mobility; molybdenum; pH; potassium; pump; temperature effect; unconsolidated medium; water quality; alkalinity; aquifer; article; concentration (parameters); desorption; dissolution; energy yield; geothermal energy; isotherm; Netherlands; pH; priority journal; sediment; temperature; temperature sensitivity; water quality; Netherlands; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Arsenic; Desorption; Ground source heat pumps; Groundwater quality; Shallow geothermal energy; Trace elements; Adsorption; Arsenic; Carbon; Drinking Water; Geologic Sediments; Geothermal Energy; Groundwater; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metals; Netherlands; Silicates; Temperature; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883281458

These methods combine scintillometer measurements with point-sampling measurements of scalar quantities and consequently have a faster statistical convergence than the eddy-covariance method. The scintillometer measures the friction velocity and stability averaged over space, allowing the time averaging to be a minute or less in homogenous conditions. This paper aims to thoroughly test the methods by analysing their sensitivity to the variables that go into the method and validate the methods with 30-min eddy-covariance data. Introduced are: the Bowen-variance method, the flux-variance method, the structure-parameter method, and the energy-balance method. Sensitivity analysis shows that each method is sensitive to the turbulence measurements of the scalar quantities that are specific to the method, as well as to the friction velocity. This demonstrates that the accuracy of the flux results from a correct representation of the turbulence variables used by the methods. Furthermore, a 30-min flux validation shows that the methods compare well to the independent eddy-covariance fluxes. We found that the structure-parameter method performs best - a low scatter (the correlation coefficient, r=0.99) and a 5% underestimation were observed. Also the other methods perform well, although the energy-balance did not close, because storage terms and CO2 flux were neglected. Furthermore, during the night the variance methods were influenced by non-stationarity in the measurement signal. Finally, we suggest using the correlation coefficients between temperature and scalar quantities to acquire the sign of the fluxes. Data for this study were gathered in May-June 2009 over a wheat field near Merken, Germany, in the framework of the TransRegio32 program. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide flux; Eddy covariance; Energy-balance closure; Latent-heat flux; Scintillometer; Structure parameters","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; data set; eddy covariance; energy efficiency; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; latent heat flux; temperature effect; turbulence; velocity; water vapor; wheat; Germany; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880325205

Different system scenarios capture the application’s different resource requirements that change dynamically at run-time. In addition to computational resources, the many possible memory platform configurations and data-to-memory assignments are important system scenario parameters. In this work we focus on clustering of different memory requirements into groups and presenting the system scenario generation in detail. The clustering is a non-trivial problem due to the many different memory requirements, which leads to a very large exploration space. An extended memory model is used as a practical enabler, in order to evaluate the methodology. The memory models include existing state-of-the-art memories, available from industry and academia, and we show how they are employed during the system design exploration phase. Both commercial SRAM and standard cell based memory models are explored in this study. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated and tested using a large set of multimedia benchmarks published in the Polybench, Mibench and Mediabench suites, representative for the domain of multimedia applications.

The change in the contact properties of the plasma-modified films during storage and heating has been studied as well. The experiments have shown that the formation of polyconjugated structures and crosslinking of macromolecules take place in the film surface layer during long-term treatment at the anode (>60 s, 50 mA), processes that result in an acetone-insoluble layer. The composition and surface structure of the films have been examined by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

In contrast, physisorption on individual fullerenes or small aggregates of fullerenes has remained largely unexplored, last but not least, because of technical challenges. A summary of recent progress in identifying specific adsorption sites on positively charged C 60, C70, and their aggregates is given in this Minireview. Adsorption energies and storage capacities for helium, hydrogen, methane, oxygen, nitrogen, water, and ammonia are determined. Mass spectrometric data reveal the formation of a commensurate phase in which all hollow sites of C 60 or C70 are occupied. This phase is identified for all nonpolar molecules, including oxygen, which does not form a commensurate phase on planar graphite. The polar molecules, on the other hand, do not wet fullerenes and they do not form this commensurate phase. A hierarchy of other distinct adsorption sites are identified for nonpolar molecules, namely, groove sites for fullerene dimers and beyond, and dimple sites for fullerene trimers and beyond. Furthermore, evidence is presented for the preferential adsorption of hydrogen and methane in registered sites on fullerene dimers. The interpretation of experimental data that merely count the number of preferred adsorption sites is aided by molecular dynamics simulations, which utilize interaction potentials derived from ab initio calculations to determine adsorption energies. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Dynamic properties such as storage modulus (E′), loss modulus (E″) and damping parameter (tan δ) were determined in a single-cantilever bending mode. The storage modulus of the composites increased up to 110% and 130% with enzymatic and NaOH treatments, respectively. The composites reinforced with NaOH and enzyme-treated fibers showed a shift in loss modulus to a higher region when compared to untreated fiber composites. This was attributed to the increased immobilization of polymer matrix at the fiber-matrix interface as a result of pre-treatments. Tan δ pick values of the samples with treated and untreated jute fibers are fairly close indicating that all the samples showed very similar energy damping behavior. The derivative thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry curves indicated that the thermal stability of the composites slightly decreased in the case of NaOH and enzyme treatments.

Internal energy stored in the bonds is used to fuel work producing engines or metabolic activity of living organisms. This paper investigates the thermodynamic efficiency of the glucose and lipid synthesis and breakdown by photosynthetic microalgae. Photosynthetic microalgae are able to convert 3.8% of the solar exergy into the chemical exergy of algal lipid. As the microalgae convert the first product of the photosynthesis, i.e. glucose, into lipid, 47-49% of the chemical exergy is lost. If the microalgal cell consumes the photosynthetically produced glucose for its own energy demand, then about 30% of the glucose exergy can be converted into work potential in case of immediate and short-term energy demands. Organism can convert about 22% of the glucose exergy into work potential after a long-term storage. If the algal lipid is harvested for biodiesel production and the produced biodiesel is combusted in a Diesel engine, then about 17% of the exergy of the photosynthetically produced glucose can be converted into useful work. Biodiesel is among the most popular renewable fuels. The lipids are harvested from their storage in the cells to produce biodiesel before following the lipid breakdown path of the cellular metabolism. Our analysis indicates that, extracting the first product of photosynthesis, i.e. glucose or glucose polymers instead of lipids may be more efficient thermodynamically, if new motors capable to extract their bond energy is developed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuels; Bond energy; Energy metabolism; Storage and use of high energy bonds; Synthesis; Thermodynamic efficiency","Algae; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Diesel engines; Exergy; Glucose; Lipids; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Photosynthesis; Synthesis (chemical); Thermodynamics; Biodiesel production; Bond energies; Cellular metabolism; Energy metabolism; High energy bonds; Long-term storage; Metabolic activity; Thermodynamic efficiency; Fuel storage; biofuel; carbohydrate; demand analysis; diesel engine; energy efficiency; exergy; fuel cell; glucose; lipid; metabolism; microalga; photosynthesis; polymer; thermodynamics; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881116295

As the temperature of waste heat carriers is usually moderately high (ca. 100°C), there is a potential possibility for using them in district heating systems. The main goal of present paper is thus the energy and CO2 emission analysis of CHP (combined heat and power production) plants equipped with CO2 removal and utilizing waste heat generated within the plant. First case is dealing with the CFB (circulating fluidized bed) plant equipped with post-combustion chemical CO2 absorption. The second case is dealing with an IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) equipped with the pre-combustion CO2 removal by physical absorption. Both plants have been modeled on the Thermoflex software. The reference, CFB-based CHP plant without CO2 removal has also been modeled. The obtained results indicate that IGCC plant has better thermodynamic indicators than CFB-based unit. Moreover, the CO2 emission considering system interconnections within the electricity production network is negative for both plants equipped with CCS (carbon capture and storage). The highest exergy efficiency is achieved for the reference CFB plant.

The heat storage is coupled with a self-circulating solar parabolic trough filled with thermal oil (Duratherm 630). The absorber tube is not insulated in the first test, and insulated with a glass tube during the second test (the air layer insulating the absorber is 7. mm thick, enclosed between two glass cylinders). An electronic system tracks the sun during the experiments.The storage is mainly oil-based but contains a significant part of nitrate salts in order to store energy with latent heat (melting temperatures: 210-220°C). The salts are contained in eight aluminum cylinders.

Short-term frequency stability relates with the primary or speed control level, as defined in the regulations of the classical grids. The focus is on autonomous MGs that dynamically behave similarly to the classical power systems. This is the systems case with classical distributed generators (DGs), but which can also contain renewable energy sources (RESs) in a certain penetration level. During MG islanded operation, the local generators take over most of the frequency control process, by means of their automatic generation control, which include inertia response and primary control. However, RES-based DGs are rarely able to provide grid frequency support, as they lack controllability and usually the power conversion chain does not have the possibility of storing and releasing energy when required by the system. Therefore the need of boosting the MG power reserves by adding energy storage systems is often a requirement. The study highlights the improvement in the MG short-term frequency stability brought by an original BESS control structure enhanced with both inertial response and an adaptive droop characteristic during battery state-of-charge limitations. The conducted analysis is accomplished by adopting aggregated models for the involved control mechanisms. The developed model is analysed in frequency domain, whereas an experimental test bench including a real-time digital simulator with BESS controller in a hardware-in-the-loop structure is used for assessing the system performances. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,"Automatic generation control; Battery energy storage systems; Distributed generator (DGs); Energy storage systems; Experimental test benches; Real-time digital simulator; Renewable energy source; Short term frequency stability; Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Frequency stability; Renewable energy resources; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883000221

That is why the interest in production and storage of hydrogen is still increasing. One of the promising technology is using microwave plasma for hydrogen production. In this study we propose two types of an atmospheric pressure microwave plasma source (MPS) for hydrogen production via methane conversion. The first one was a nozzleless waveguide-supplied coaxial-line-based. The second one was a nozzleless waveguide-supplied metal-cylinder-based. They can be operated with microwave frequency of 2.45 GHz and power up to a few kW with a high gas flow rates (up to several thousands l/h). We present experimental results concerning electrical properties of the MPS, plasma visualization, spectroscopic diagnostics and hydrogen production. The experiment was carried out with methane flow rate up to 12,000 l/h. An additional nitrogen or carbon dioxide swirl flow was used. The absorbed microwave power was up to 5000 W.

This concept shows that different renewable energy sources can be used simultaneously to power off-grid applications together with battery and hydrogen energy storage options. Photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy are used as primary sources and a fuel cell is used as backup power. A total of 2.7 kW energy production (wind and PV panels) along with 1.2 kW fuel cell power is supported with 17.2 kWh battery and 15 kWh hydrogen storage capacities. Supply/demand scenarios are prepared based on wind and solar data for Istanbul. Primary energy sources supply load and charge batteries. When there is energy excess, it is used to electrolyse water for hydrogen production, which in turn can either be used to power fuel cells or burnt as fuel by the hydrogen cooker. Power-to-gas and gas-to-power schemes are effectively utilized and shown in this study. Power demand by the installed equipment is supplied by batteries if no renewable energy is available. If there is high demand beyond battery capacity, fuel cell supplies energy in parallel. Automatic and manual controllable hydraulic systems are designed and installed to increase the photovoltaic efficiency by vertical axis control, to lift up & down wind turbine and to prevent vibrations on vehicle. Automatic control, data acquisition, monitoring, telemetry hardware and software are established. In order to increase public awareness of renewable energy sources and its applications, system has been demonstrated in various exhibitions, conferences, energy forums, universities, governmental and nongovernmental organizations in Turkey, Austria, United Arab Emirates and Romania.

In such environments, microbial metabolism is limited by the diffusive supply of electron acceptors. One strategy to optimize energy yields in a resource-limited habitat is symbiotic metabolite exchange among microbial associations. Thermodynamic and geochemical considerations indicate that microbial co-metabolisms are likely to play a critical part in sedimentary organic carbon cycling. Yet only one association, between methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria, has been demonstrated in marine sediments in situ, and little is known of the role of microbial symbiotic interactions in other sedimentary biogeochemical cycles. Here we report in situ molecular and incubation-based evidence for a novel symbiotic consortium between two chemolithotrophic bacteria - anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria and the nitrate-sequestering sulphur-oxidizing Thioploca species - in anoxic sediments of the Soledad basin at the Mexican Pacific margin. A mass balance of benthic solute fluxes and the corresponding nitrogen isotope composition of nitrate and ammonium fluxes indicate that anammox bacteria rely on Thioploca species for the supply of metabolic substrates and account for about 57 ± 21 per cent of the total benthic N 2 production. We show that Thioploca-anammox symbiosis intensifies benthic fixed nitrogen losses in anoxic sediments, bypassing diffusion-imposed limitations by efficiently coupling the carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycles. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Firstly, the potential of EVs to provide regulating and operating reserve power is investigated. Secondly, EVs' potential as energy storage system is considered. A real time electricity price signal which depends on the fluctuating wind power generation is used to provide incentives for EVs charging. The case of Shenzhen city which is expected to be a forerunner of massive EVs deployment in China is preliminarily studied to estimate the potential of EVs under 2050 scenario assuming 17% wind penetration. Result shows that about 15.25% of plugged EVs could meet the increased regulating reserve need, and 46.70% could satisfy the increased operating reserve need when 50% of EVs is plugged into grid at the same moment. In addition, EVs have the potential to provide back-up power for wind shortage and absorb the excess wind power as energy storage system. © 2013 IEEE.","Electric Vehicles (EVs); energy storage; wind power","Back-up power; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity prices; Energy storage systems; Fluctuating wind power; High winds; Operating reserve; Wind penetration; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Wind power; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881289091

The results show that the various tariff structures lead to markedly different optimal cooling trajectories, that can be understood in terms of the trade-offs between thermal leakage to the environment, time dependent PV revenues and prices for consuming electricity. The value of the optimized energy management vs uncontrolled cooling was found to be largest for the case where electricity prices were low during PV generation.

The activities of N-doped catalysts with low Pt contents (≤1 wt.%) were 10 times higher than the activities of undoped catalysts. The N-doped catalysts demonstrated an improved selectivity to hydrogen and an increased resistance to CO inhibition. However, they were inactive for ethylene hydrogenation.

The aim was to obtain optimum growing temperatures around the roots of plants. The candidate PCMs were 40% oleic acid-60% decanoic acid mixture and oleic acid alone. Field experiments with these PCMs were carried out in November 2009 with Cucurbite Pepo and March 2010 with Capsicum annum plants. No additional heating system was used in the greenhouse during these periods. In the November 2009 tests with zucchini, 40% oleic acid + 60% capric acid mixture was the PCM and a temperature increase in the PCM container (versus the control container) was measured as 1.9 C. In our March 2010 tests with peppers, both PCMs were tried and the PCM mixture was found to be more effective than using oleic acidalone.

This paper focuses on the technical aspects of CO2 storage, even if the CCS challenge is equally dependent upon finding viable international solutions to a wide range of economic, political and cultural issues. It has already been demonstrated that it is technically possible to store adequate amounts of CO2 in the subsurface (Sleipner, InSalah, Snøhvit). The large-scale storage challenge (several Gigatons of CO2 per year) is more an issue of minimizing cost without compromising safety, and of making international regulations.The storage challenge may be split into 4 main parts: 1) finding reservoirs with adequate storage capacity, 2) make sure that the sealing capacity above the reservoir is sufficient, 3) build the infrastructure for transport, drilling and injection, and 4) set up and perform the necessary monitoring activities. More than 150 years of worldwide experience from the production of oil and gas is an important source of competence for CO 2 storage. The storage challenge is however different in three important aspects: 1) the storage activity results in pressure increase in the subsurface, 2) there is no production of fluids that give important feedback on reservoir performance, and 3) the monitoring requirement will have to extend for a much longer time into the future than what is needed during oil and gas production. An important property of CO2 is that its behaviour in the subsurface is significantly different from that of oil and gas. CO2 in contact with water is reactive and corrosive, and may impose great damage on both man-made and natural materials, if proper precautions are not executed. On the other hand, the long-term effect of most of these reactions is that a large amount of CO2 will become immobilized and permanently stored as solid carbonate minerals. The reduced opportunity for direct monitoring of fluid samples close to the reservoir, the general pressure build up, and the reactive nature of CO2, have created a need for new research and knowledge, to be used in conjunction with operating competence from the oil and gas industry. Experimental work on fluid flow, deformation and reaction, as well as simulations to predict the future performance of the injected CO2, are much more important in connection with CO2 storage, as compared with conventional oil and gas production. To conclude this overview of the CO2 storage challenge, the technical feasibility of large-scale CO2 storage has been demonstrated. The cost is however going to be significant, especially in the initial phase. The public acceptance of CCS, and the willingness to pay the bill, will depend on several important factors: a serious acceptance of the climate problem, economic and political regulations that are globally fair, and the willingness of each and one of us to accept a higher price for energy. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences - SIF 2013.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881000547

The materials are characterized using the adsorption of nitrogen, SEM/EDX, and potentiometric titration. Their electrochemical performance was measured in two and three electrode cells in H2SO4 as an electrolyte. Activation results in a significant increase in the capacitance owing to the development of porosity and an increase in the surface oxygen content. To account for the beneficial effect of the volume of pores smaller than 0.7 nm on the double layer capacitance and of surface wettability on ion transfer to these pores, a charge storage accessibility factor, CSAF, was proposed as a product of the volume of pores smaller than 0.7 nm and surface oxygen content.

Design/methodology/approach - Two models were developed, using mathematical programming, accommodating either fixed or variable shelf settings in vertical carousel storage, along with other varying storage types. The models were validated, yielding a sizeable reduction in workload, and run under varying scenarios of storage additions to reduce workload even further. Findings - For different storage addition scenarios, application of the new model formulation yielded a reduction of 22 percent in workload. In addition, aside from space savings, approximately 40 percent of refill order total waiting time was reduced due to improved allocation. Research limitations/implications - The authors' analysis was limited by considering direct cost savings only. Yet, reduced workloads in pre-batching may also yield indirect cost savings, such as reduced quality costs, inventory costs, and investment savings by not having to extend the pre-batching area. Such considerations may be addressed in future research, provided data on indirect savings are available. Practical implications - While intuitive storage allocation overloads the pre-batching department and increases space utilization, suggesting an incorrect perception that more personnel and space are needed, the proposed approach provides a better alternative through optimized allocations. Originality/value - The present paper adds to the literature on carousel storage location by explicitly addressing the storage sizing issue, as well as workload balancing.

In constructing the model, we started from an existing stoichiometric model, and systematically reduced this initial model to a one compartment model and further eliminated unidentifiabilities due to time scales. Kinetic analysis focuses on a time scale of seconds, thereby neglecting biosynthesis of new enzymes. We used linlog kinetics in representing the kinetic rate equations of each individual reaction. The final parameterization is performed for the final reduced model using previously published short term glucose perturbation data. The constructed model is a self-contained model in the sense that it can also predict the cofactor dynamics. Using the model, we calculated the Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) parameters and found that the interplay among the growth, product formation and production of storage materials is strongly governed by the energy budget in the cell, which is in agreement with the previous findings.

A uniform thin layer of disentangled CNFs with a herringbone structure was deposited on the carbon surface through the decomposition of propane at 450 °C over an AC-supported nickel catalyst. CNF coating was controlled by the reaction time and the nickel content. The superior CNF/AC composite displays excellent electrochemical performance in a 0.5 mol L-1 solution of K 2SO4 due to its unique structure. At a high scan rate (100 mV s-1) and current loading (20 A g-1), the capacitance values were three- and fourfold higher than those for classical AC/carbon black composites. Owing to this feature, a high energy of 10 Wh kg-1 was obtained over a wide power range in neutral medium at a voltage of 0.8 V. The significant enhancement of charge propagation is attributed to the presence of herringbone CNFs, which facilitate the diffusion of ions in the electrode and play the role of electronic bridges between AC particles. An in situ coating of AC with short CNFs (below 200 nm) is a very attractive method for producing the next generation of carbon composite materials with a high power performance in supercapacitors working in neutral medium. Coated to perfection: Activated carbon (AC) with a nickel catalyst is coated in situ with herringbone carbon nanofibers (CNFs) through catalytic chemical vapor deposition from propane at 450 °C. The CNF/AC composite is implemented in supercapacitors, showing much higher power than the pristine AC, which is attributed to the presence of CNFs to enhance ion diffusion in the electrode and act as electronic bridges between AC particles (see picture).

The power system consists of a pulsed voltage generator and a long transmission line. Experiments are aimed at generating a highly ionized dense plasma as an active medium for an extreme ultraviolet laser on hydrogen-like ions of nitrogen (λ = 13.4 nm). Emphasis is on the distribution of the energy transmitted from a storage ring to a load among its components and on the reduction of the energy that remains in the electrical circuit by the end of the pump pulse and will inevitably dissipate in the discharge tube. The solution of this problem will make it possible to diminish the load on the walls of the discharge chamber and extend its service life. It is shown that energy deposition into the load is effective when the timeaveraged sum of the ohmic and dynamic components of the discharge resistance is roughly equal to the wave impedance of the transmission line.

This paper assesses the effect of biomass co-firing on gasification based hydrogen production supply chain, with carbon dioxide capture and storage, from technical, economical and environmental point of view. Several cases consisting of various feedstocks to the gasification reactor are investigated (coal only and coal in mixture with sawdust or wheat straw). Considered plant concepts generate between 330 and 460. MW hydrogen of 99.99% (vol.) purity.First a performance analysis regarding the energy efficiency of the process, the syngas composition and the carbon dioxide capture rate is carried out. The simulations are made using chemical process simulation software Aspen Plus. Second, total capital investment and operating costs for the gasification plant are evaluated. Finally, using the results from Aspen Plus simulations and the cost estimations, a discrete event model is developed, to address hydrogen production supply chain analysis under demand variability, with Arena software. The implications of biomass co-firing on the system are evaluated in terms of: hydrogen amount sold and hydrogen amount stored (MW), hydrogen lost sales amount (MW), partial sales percent and gasification plant profit.The results show that as the biomass quantity in the feedstock increases the hydrogen production rate decreases by 9-28% for sawdust, respectively by 7-23% for wheat straw. The energy efficiency of the process and the gasification plant profit also decrease, but the CO2 emissions are lower for the cases of biomass co-firing. © 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Biomass co-firing; CO2 capture; Entrained flow; Gasification; Hydrogen production; Supply chain","Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Chemical process simulation; Co-firing; Discrete event models; Entrained flow; Hydrogen production rate; Total capital investments; Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Discrete event simulation; Energy efficiency; Feedstocks; Fuels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Investments; Straw; Supply chains; Gasification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881545065

Using these criteria, we assessed lipid profiles, glucose metabolism parameters, blood pressure and regional fat in 91 premenopausal women with NWO and 54 age-matched healthy controls. Methods: We measured total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides (TG), glucose, insulin, visfatin and adiponectin.%BF, abdominal fat (Android) and hip fat (Gynoid) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin resistance was evaluated by homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Results: Women with NWO had higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P = 0·003), LDL (P = 0·048), TG (P = 0·004) Android (P = 0·008) and Gynoid (P = 0·007) levels, but lower HDL (P = 0·009) than healthy controls. The NWO women had one (P = 0·041), two (P = 0·007) or three (P = 0·002) metabolic syndrome components more frequently than the controls. Across %BF tertiles, the number of metabolic syndrome components significantly increased (R = 0·21; P = 0·02), as did Gynoid (R = 0·83; P < 0·001) and Android (R = 0·81; P < 0·001) levels. Android (but not Gynoid) level was linearly associated with DBP (R = 0·194; P = 0·019), HDL (R = -0·295; P = 0·0004) and TG (R = 0·183; P = 0·031). Visfatin and adiponectin levels were comparable in both groups. Visfatin was inversely correlated with cholesterol, LDL and HOMA-IR. Adiponectin was inversely correlated with the Android/Gynoid and Android/Total fat ratios. Conclusions: Compared with healthy controls, women with NWO had higher DBP, TG, LDL, and regional fat and lower HDL. These findings seem to be associated more with excess Android fat than excess %BF. © 2013 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

The core objective of this paper is to investigate the possible effects of a further uptake of PV on the prices in electricity markets.

The major effects of these developments on the electricity markets will be: (i) a much higher price volatility from hour-to-hour and day-to-day; (ii) higher prices for electricity from fossil capacities and storage technologies for balancing the intermittent renewable generation; and (iii) growth of balancing markets and intensified competition at the level of decentralized balancing organizations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity markets; Grid parity; Photovoltaics; Wholesale electricity prices","Commerce; Electricity; Renewable energy resources; Electricity exchanges; Electricity market; Grid parities; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy source; Renewable generation; Storage technology; Wholesale electricity; Costs; electricity generation; market system; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; renewable resource; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880697408

The main energy sources of Turkey are coal, natural gas and hydropower. However, almost all the natural gas and high quality coal is imported. Thus, hydropower is the main domestic energy source. According to the State Hydraulic Works (SHW), the primary executive state agency responsible for the planning, operation, and management of water resources, Turkey has an economically viable hydroelectric potential of 140,000. GWh/year. Currently, around 35% of this potential is utilized. Increasing the share of hydropower in the energy budget of Turkey will reduce dependency on foreign energy sources. However, development of the unused hydropower potential, especially through run-of-river plants, has caused many problems in the country. Run-of-river plants are small hydropower plants (SHPPs) usually with no storage. Electricity Market Law No. 4628 which came into effect in February 2001 was a major step towards the privatization of the electricity sector. The law enabled planning and construction of SHPPs by the private sector. This created a big market for consulting firms which prepare feasibility reports, construction companies, and companies that own and operate these SHPPs. However, due to inadequate water resources management strategies, rivers are impaired; their natural flows are disturbed to generate electricity without paying necessary attention to components of the ecosystem and the needs and concerns of local residents. Thus, Turkey faces a challenging problem: Maximizing the utilization of hydropower which is the main domestic energy source while maintaining environmentally conscious and sustainable development. This study aims to explain the change in the contribution of hydropower in the energy budget of Turkey with time and current social and environmental problems associated particularly with SHPPs. Issues requiring immediate attention to facilitate sustainable development of hydropower potential are identified. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Economical aspects; Environmental aspects; Hydropower; Integrated watershed management; Social aspects; Turkey","aquatic environment; article; electric potential; energy consumption; energy resource; energy yield; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental sustainability; hydropower; pH; priority journal; river; suspended particulate matter; Turkey (republic); water flow; water temperature; watershed management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876830619

Analysis of the properties of various chitosan grades has resulted in a working hypothesis that chitosan can be used as part of protective film-forming coatings for meat and meat products. The aim of this study was the research of composition, properties and antibacterial activity of chitosan-based coatings used for cold storage of meat and meat products. Material and methods. Protective coatings, developed by the authors, based on organic acids and chitosan with food gelatin, or distarch glycerol, or wheat fiber, or sodium alginate, or guar gum have been used as research material. The coatings were applied on the surfaces of retail cuts of veal and rabbit meat, boiled sausages, smoked sausages and smoked-boiled pork brisket. Antimicrobial activity of the solutions was evaluated in vitro. Microbial indicators of the mixtures were also determined by the zone of inhibition assay. Dynamic viscosity, the activation energy of viscous flow and pH of mixtures of fluids were measured. During the storage of meat and meat products total viable count of microorganisms was determined. Results. Polymer solutions of chitosan:starch and chitosan:gelatin are technologicaly compatible, solutions of chitosan:fiber are two-phase colloidal systems. Coatings did not alter the samples inherent flavour characteristics. All coatings reduced total viable count of microorganisms compared to control samples without coating. Composition based on 2% solution of chitosan and organic acids and 2% gelatin solution in a ratio of 1:1 has the strongest bacteriostatic effect for meat and meat products. Including potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate in gelatin and chitosan solutions mixture for protective coating was not found reasonable, because of their lower bacteriostatic effect. Combined application of vacuum and protective coatings provided the strongest suppressing effect on microflora in all samples. Conclusions. The chitosan-based edible coatings developed can be used to increase the shelf life and improve the microbial safety parameters of meat and meat products. The results of this study indicate that coatings have bigger stabilising effect on samples with the least amount of basic hurdle factors, in other words on most shelf unstable products. © Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Poznaniu.","Chitosan; Meat; Microbiological stability; Protective coating","Activation energy of viscous flow; Anti-bacterial activity; Anti-microbial activity; Chitosan-based edible coatings; Dynamic viscosities; Microbial indicators; Microbiological stability; Total viable counts; Activation energy; Chitosan; Cold storage; Food additives; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Organic acids; Protective coatings; Solid solutions; Meats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880631444

Among other things, such tools should handle depressurization from supercritical pressures down to atmospheric conditions. This might involve the formation of solid CO2 (dry ice) as the state passes the triple point. In this work, we propose a dynamic simulation method that handles the dry-ice formation. The method uses the Span-Wagner reference equation of state, with additional relations for thermodynamic properties along the sublimation line. A density-energy state function formulation is employed, which naturally follows from mass and energy conservation. To illustrate the method's capabilities, demanding test cases are considered, both for depressurization of a vessel and for fluid dynamics in a pipeline, where phase change occurs because of changing boundary conditions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Equations of state of liquids; Fluid dynamics; Refrigerants; Atmospheric conditions; Depressurizations; Efficient simulation; Equation of state; Fluid dynamics simulations; Mass and energy conservation; Super-critical pressures; Vapor liquid solids; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880887064

The esterification reactions were proven by using Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy techniques. The melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of the esters were measured using differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The melting temperatures and latent heats of the erythritol tetra myristate and erythritol tetra laurate esters were determined as 10.82 and -9.03°C and 180.90 and 161.39 J/g, respectively. The thermal cycling test indicated that the synthesized esters had good thermal reliability in terms of the changes in thermal properties after 1,000 thermal cycling. Thermal stability of the PCM was also investigated by using thermal gravimetric analysis. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of the synthesized esters were increased by about 28% for erythritol tetra myristate and 25% for erythritol tetra laurate by addition of 5 wt% expanded graphite. Based on all these results, it can be concluded that the synthesized esters as novel solid-liquid PCM have great potential for low temperature applications, such as transport of blood, operating tables, hot-cold therapies, and refrigerators. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","lauric acid; myristic acid; phase change materials; thermal energy storage; thermal reliability","Fourier transform infra reds; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Lauric acid; Low-temperature applications; Myristic acid; Phase Change Material (PCM); Thermal gravimetric analysis; Thermal reliability; Differential scanning calorimetry; Esterification; Esters; Heat storage; Latent heat; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phase change materials; Phase transitions; Saturated fatty acids; Thermal cycling; Thermal energy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879120195

Nevertheless, hydropower must be seen as a high-value resource in the renewable energy sector. However, very few studies deal with the physical processes behind the artificial unsteady flows, as the variability of local river morphology and roughness in general. Thus, the aim of the present study is to address these issues on the basis of one-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical modelling. In total, four Austrian rivers have been investigated, which were further divided into 13 sub-reaches according to their bed slope. From single and multiple linear regression models, it was possible to relate potential retentions of peak flow for peak duration of <2h and for bed slopes <0.005 to the spatial extent of wetted width between base and peak flows, independent of the selected ramping rate (discharge relationship between base and peak flows). Moreover, the ramping velocity (rate of decreasing water level between peak and base flows) correlated positively with an increase in depth variance during peak flow, which was related further to an increase in mean flow velocities and a higher specific discharge over the 13 selected reaches. Nevertheless, within sensitivity testing, it could be proven that increases in channel roughness cause an increase in peak flow retention and a decrease of the ramping velocities for the decreasing limb. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Hydropeaking; Hydropower; River morphology; Roughness; Unsteady flow modelling","European Water Framework Directive; Flow modelling; Hydropeaking; Hydropower; Mean flow velocities; Multiple linear regression models; Renewable energy sector; River morphology; Hydroelectric power; Linear regression; Morphology; Numerical models; Surface roughness; Unsteady flow; Water levels; Rivers; flow modeling; flow velocity; fluvial geomorphology; hydrodynamics; hydroelectric power; numerical model; peak flow; retention; river system; surface roughness; unsteady flow; water storage; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880006987

The as-deposited MnO2 nanosheets are 20-25 nm thick on average and are mesoporous with a pore size ranging from 2 to 8 nm. The potential for using these MnO2 nanosheet arrays as supercapacitor electrodes has been explored by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests within a potential window of 0-1.0 V versus saturated calomel electrode. The cyclic voltammograms of the MnO2 nanosheet electrode show a typical pseudocapacitive behavior. The nanosheets exhibit specific capacitance of 201, 150, 122, 105 and 96 F g-1 at current densities of 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 A g-1, respectively. Furthermore, it is found that upon cycling at 5 A g-1, the specific capacitance loses 35% of its initial value in the beginning 1800 cycles and then remains constant up to 3000 cycles, showing reasonably good cycling performance. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates that the equivalent series resistance and charge transfer resistance of the electrode are very low, suggesting that the nickel foam supported MnO2 nanosheet array is a promising binder-free electrode for use in pseudocapacitors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The crystal structure is considered as a message consisting of atoms classified into equivalence classes according to their distribution over crystallographic orbits (Wyckoff sites). The proposed complexity measures combine both size-and symmetry-sensitive aspects of crystal structures. Information-based complexity parameters have been calculated for 3949 structure reports on minerals extracted from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. According to the total structural information content, IG,tota l, mineral structures can be classified into very simple (0-20 bits), simple (20-100 bits), intermediate (100-500 bits), complex (500 - 1000 bits), and very complex (&gt;1000 bits). The average information content for mineral structures is calculated as 228(6) bits per structure and 3.23(2) bits per atom. Twenty most complex mineral structures are (IG,total in bits): paulingite (6766.998), fantappieite (5948.330), sacrofanite (5317.353), mendeleevite-(Ce) (3398.878), bouazzerite (3035.201), megacyclite (2950.928), vanden-driesscheite (2835.307), giuseppetite (2723.097), stilpnomelane (2483.819), stavelotite-(La) (2411.498), rogermitchellite (2320.653), parsettensite (2309.820), apjohnite (2305.361), antigorite (m = 17 polysome) (2250.397), tounkite (2187.799), tschoertnerite (2132.228), farneseite (2094.012), kircherite (2052.539), bannisterite (2031.017), and mutinaite (2025.067). The following complexity-generating mechanisms have been recognized: modularity, misfit relationships between structure elements, and presence of nanoscale units (clusters or tubules). Structural complexity should be distiguished from topological complexity. Structural complexity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure, though at ultra-high pressures, the situation may be different. Quantitative complexity measures can be used to investigate evolution of information in the course of global and local geological processes involving formation and transformation of crystalline phases. The information-based complexity measures can also be used to estimate the 'ease of crystallization' from the viewpoint of simplexity principle proposed by J.R. Goldsmith (1953) for understanding of formation of simple and complex mineral phases under both natural and laboratory conditions. According to the proposed quantitative approach, the crystal structure can be viewed as a reservoir of information encoded in its complexity. Complex structures store more information than simple ones. As erasure of information is always associated with dissipation of energy, information stored in crystal structures of minerals must have an important influence upon natural processes. As every process can be viewed as a communication channel, the mineralogical history of our planet on any scale is a story of accumulation, storage, transmission and processing of structural information. © 2013 The Mineralogical Society.","Classification of minerals according to their complexity; Crystal structure; Information-to-energy conversion; Mineral evolution; Minerals; Nanoscale structural units; Shannon information measures; Structural complexity; Structure topology","Mineral evolutions; Shannon information; Structural complexity; Structural unit; Structure topology; Crystal structure; Energy conversion; Equivalence classes; Kaolinite; Nanotechnology; Serpentine; Topology; Minerals; crystal structure; crystallization; crystallography; mineral deposit; mineralogy; quantitative analysis; topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879948394

InMotion is a multidisciplinary project group of experienced master students, PhD students, and professors from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The authors of this paper were involved in the project to develop a suitable powertrain architecture for use in the IM01 series hybrid race car. The most important requirements were to achieve a lap time of below 2 min 45 s on the Circuit de la Sarthe, and to have a durability, efficiency, cornering speed, and acceleration that exceeds Formula 1 race cars. Data provided from InMotion included design restrictions, a simplified drive cycle, and technical data of some components. This data was analyzed and the required powertrain component sizes were determined. A detailed drive cycle calculation and sensitivity analysis were introduced to find the variables that significantly influence the lap time. The powertrain was modeled using the backwards approach and an energy management strategy was designed with the objective of minimizing fuel consumption. Finally, five different powertrain configurations were presented, and several tradeoffs between lap time and different parameters were discussed. The results showed that the fastest achievable lap time using the proposed configurations was 3 min 9 s. It was concluded that several car and component parameters have to be improved to decrease this lap time to the required 2 min 45 s. Recommendations for future work to achieve this were addressed. © 2013 IEEE.","energy management strategy; powertrain design; race car dynamics; Series hybrid electric race car","Eindhoven University of Technology; Energy management strategies; Hybrid-electric powertrain; Multidisciplinary projects; Powertrain components; Powertrain configuration; Powertrain design; Race car; Automobile exhibitions; Design; Digital storage; Ecology; Energy management; Lead acid batteries; Powertrains; Racing automobiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879904168

This paper describes a model for the prediction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ammonia emissions, originated from animal husbandry, were presented. The input data in the model were primarily acquired from different Norwegian governmental institutions; however, some were unavailable. The remaining data were based on personal knowledge such as manure storage conditions (i.e., storage time on Norwegian farms, temperature ranges between storage periods, loading capacity of trucks for manure transport, etc.). The model included: methane emissions from animal facilities and waste storage units, ammonia emissions from storage units, nitrous oxide from stores, transportation of manure to collaborative biogas plants, and energy production and substituted energy when biogas production was selected. The model was then used to study the reduction in GHG emissions when anaerobic digestion was applied. All of the calculated gas emission values showed that methane was sensitive to temperature; however, only 4% of emissions were emitted from animal facilities due to minor amounts of manure. The contribution of stored manure in summer was approximately 62%, although some amounts were excluded because it was the grazing season. The estimates of GHG effects of anaerobic treatment was 45% lower than the governmental estimates. The contribution of ammonia emissions to GHG emissions is small due to low oxidation rates, but the reduction itself can lead to increase ammonia concentrations in manure and thereby reduce the need of artificial nitrogen input.

The importance of understanding and exploiting the co-production of CO and CO2 are examined. A distinction must be made between, on the one hand, the tendency toward chemical and electrochemical equilibrium and on the other hand the complex effects of chemical and electrochemical inhibition. The tendency toward equilibrium may be very active in the DCFC anode, resulting in high CO/CO 2 ratios at high temperature and/or at low current density, consistent with the Boudouard equilibrium. The complex inhibitive effects tend to produce predominantly CO2 at moderate temperature and moderate current density. If the DCFC anode is allowed to come close to equilibrium, electrochemical production of CO may result. It is accompanied by a large increase in entropy compensated by absorption of thermal energy. This approach to equilibrium may be desirable, for example, in energy conversion systems where the absorption of thermal energy can be ensured via solar collectors. In that case, the product CO may be electrochemically converted or used for chemical or heating value. Such systems can reach an efficiency of greater than 80%. On the other hand, by inhibiting the Boudouard equilibrium either within the reaction mechanism or in the gas product in contact with carbon, it is possible to promote, even at relatively high temperature (700-750 C), the 4-electron conversion of carbon to CO2, resulting in very high conversion efficiency (70-80%). Recent work has pinpointed the conditions under which a DCFC operating at high Coulombic efficiency can be realized. Such a power source of very high energy density, provided it also has sufficient power density, may compete with commercially available batteries and fuel cells in electrical storage and conversion applications. The molecular structure characteristics and kinetics yielding favorable conditions for this type of operation are discussed in detail, together with the optimal operating conditions for this mode of DCFC application. © Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Key elements for process design, such as wastewater pre-treatment, application method and rate, and the potential effects on leachate quantity and quality, are discussed based on a comprehensive literature review. Furthermore, a case-study for eight (8) olive mill enterprises generating 8700m3 of wastewater per year, was conceptually designed in order to calculate the capital and operational costs of the facility (transportation, storage, treatment, final disposal). The proposed facility was found to be economically self-sufficient, as long as the transportation costs of the OMW were maintained at ≤4.0€/m3.

Originally aiming at the production of positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclides, some of these facilities are equipped with several beam lines suitable for scientific research. Radiobiology, radiophysiology, and other dosimetric studies can be performed using these beam lines. In this work, we measured the Bragg peak of the protons from a PET cyclotron using a stacked target consisting of several aluminum foils interleaved with polyethylene sheets, readout by in-house made transimpedance electronics. The measured Bragg peak is consistent with simulations performed using the SRIM/TRIM simulation toolkit. Furthermore, we report on experimental results aiming at measuring proton beam currents down to 10 pA using a thin aluminum foil (20-μm-thick). The aluminum was chosen for this task because it is radiation hard, it has low density and low radiation activity, and finally because it is easily available at negligible cost.

Degree of oxidation and hydrolysis of fat also influence the changes taking place in its polymorphism. The aim of this study was to establish the influence of kind of fat used for baking shortcrust pastries on selected properties of lipid fraction extracted from final product directly after baking and after storage. Changes of polymorphism in raw fats and fats extracted from shortcrust cookies were analyzed with the use of DSC. DSC analysis of raw fats revealed that the least amount of polymorphic forms had Akobake MP fat, the highest amounts of which can be found in Akobake BC fat and ""Kasia"" margarine (both three forms). The biggest changes in crystal lattice after baking process, compared to raw fat, took place in lipid fractions obtained from pasties obtained with the use of Akobake MP fat. In case of Akobake BC fat, in raw fat, the dominance of a form (59 J g-1) with a melting point around 3.5 C and much smaller amounts of forms with melting temperatures of 25 and 35 C, that is 3.2 and 7.5 J g -1, respectively, were observed. During storage, further lowering of melting temperature of a polymorphic form with the lowest value of maximal temperature of melting process (peak I) was noticed. This phenomena indicates that further changes take place in lipid fractions during storage of the final product. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","DSC; Fats and oils; Oxidation; Polymorphic form; Storage","Degree of oxidations; Differential scanning calorimetry methods; DSC; Lipid fractions; Melting enthalpy; Melting process; Polymorphic forms; Shortcrust cookies; Crystal lattices; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy storage; Melting point; Oxidation; Thermoanalysis; Oils and fats",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880058499

Calculated adsorption energies of 118-281 meV are in the optimal range for high-density storage of natural gas. Groove sites, dimple sites, and the first complete adsorption shells are identified experimentally and confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, using a newly developed force field for methane-methane and fullerene-methane interaction. The effects of corrugation and curvature are discussed and compared with data for adsorption on graphite, graphene, and carbon nanotubes. Snuggling of bucky and methane: What are the preferred adsorption sites of methane on small aggregates of C60? How many methane molecules adsorb in groove sites? How many in dimple sites? We provide answers for aggregates containing up to four C60 molecules. For example, this figure shows that seven CH4 fit into the groove of the dimer, in excellent agreement with experiment.

If incineration is intended for final disposal of the bales, the energy content of the baled MSW gains importance. In this study, nine cylindrical bales containing a mix of different waste materials were constructed and several parameters, including total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, moisture content, loss on ignition, gross calorific value and net calorific value (NCV) were determined before the baling and at the end of 10 months of storage. In addition, the relationships between the waste materials and the energy contents of the bales were investigated by the bivariate correlation analyses. At the end, linear regression models were developed in order to forecast the decrease of energy content during storage. While the NCVs of the waste materials before the baling ranged between 6.2 and 23.7 MJ kg-1 dry basis, they ranged from 1.0 to 16.4 MJ kg-1 dry basis at the end of the storage period. Moreover, food wastes exhibited the highest negative correlation with NCVs, whereas plastics have significant positive correlation with both NCVs and TCs. Similarly, TOCs and carbon/nitrogen ratios decreased with the increase in food amounts inside the bales. In addition, textile, wood and yard wastes increase the energy content of the bales slightly over the storage period. © The Author(s) 2013.","combustibility of wastes; energy content of wastes; Municipal solid waste (MSW); waste baling; waste incineration","Bivariate correlations; Energy content; Gross calorific values; Linear regression models; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Negative correlation; Positive correlations; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens; Calorific value; Incineration; Regression analysis; Storage (materials); Waste incineration; Municipal solid waste; carbon; nitrogen; plastic; carbon; combustion; incineration; moisture content; municipal solid waste; nitrogen; plastic; regression analysis; waste disposal; article; bale; energy resource; food; incineration; moisture; municipal solid waste; paper; priority journal; storage; textile; total organic carbon; waste management; wood; combustibility of wastes; energy content of wastes; Municipal solid waste (MSW); waste baling; waste incineration; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879348645

This paper presents field and laboratory results aiming to elucidate the effects that ATES operation may have on chemical groundwater quality. Field data from an ATES site in the south of the Netherlands show that ATES results in chemical quality perturbations due to homogenisation of the initially present vertical water quality gradient. We tested this hypothesis by numerical modelling of groundwater flow and coupled SO4 transport during extraction and injection of groundwater by the ATES system. The modelling results confirm that extracting groundwater from an aquifer with a natural quality stratification, mixing this water in the ATES system, and subsequent injection in the second ATES well can adequately describe the observation data. This mixing effect masks any potential temperature effects in typical low temperature ATES systems (&lt;25 WC) which was the reason to complement the field investigations with laboratory experiments focusing on temperature effects. The laboratory experiments indicated that temperature effects until 25 WC are limited; most interestingly was an increase in arsenic concentration. At 60 WC, carbonate precipitation, mobilisation of dissolved oxygen concentration, K and Li, and desorption of trace metals like As can occur. © IWA Publishing 2013.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Environmental impacts; Ground source heat pumps; Groundwater quality","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Arsenic concentration; Carbonate precipitation; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Ground-water qualities; Laboratory experiments; Potential temperature; Water quality gradients; Aquifers; Experiments; Geothermal heat pumps; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Injection (oil wells); Laboratories; Mixing; Temperature; Water injection; Water quality; Environmental impact; aquifer; arsenic; desorption; dissolved oxygen; environmental impact; experimental study; groundwater flow; laboratory method; sulfate; temperature effect; thermal power; water quality; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879337608

CUE determines energy and material flows to higher trophic levels, conversion of plant-produced carbon into microbial products and rates of ecosystem carbon storage. Thermodynamic calculations support a maximum CUE value of ~ 0.60 (CUE max). Kinetic and stoichiometric constraints on microbial growth suggest that CUE in multi-resource limited natural systems should approach ~ 0.3 (CUE max/2). However, the mean CUE values reported for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems differ by twofold (~ 0.26 vs. ~ 0.55) because the methods used to estimate CUE in aquatic and terrestrial systems generally differ and soil estimates are less likely to capture the full maintenance costs of community metabolism given the difficulty of measurements in water-limited environments. Moreover, many simulation models lack adequate representation of energy spilling pathways and stoichiometric constraints on metabolism, which can also lead to overestimates of CUE. We recommend that broad-scale models use a CUE value of 0.30, unless there is evidence for lower values as a result of pervasive nutrient limitations. Ecosystem models operating at finer scales should consider resource composition, stoichiometric constraints and biomass composition, as well as environmental drivers, to predict the CUE of microbial communities. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd/CNRS.","Carbon use efficiency; Ecoenzymatic activity; Ecological stoichiometry; Microbial production; Nutrient limitation; Threshold element ratio","carbon; aquatic community; biological production; biomass; carbon sequestration; ecological modeling; energy flow; enzyme activity; growth rate; metabolism; microbial community; nutrient limitation; nutrient use efficiency; organic carbon; stoichiometry; terrestrial environment; thermodynamics; threshold; trophic level; biological model; metabolism; microflora; physiology; review; thermodynamics; Carbon; Microbiota; Models, Biological; Thermodynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879165492

The handling of CO2 on such scale gives rise to a number of technological challenges and safety aspects. The accidental rupture of a vessel containing liquefied CO2 may lead to a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion (BLEVE). Whether explosive evaporation of liquefied CO2 is also possible at storage temperatures below the homogeneous nucleation temperature 271 K (-2 °C) is unclear.This article describes the results of 12 experiments with 40 L CO2 cylinders at various temperatures to investigate the temperature dependence of explosive evaporation. The cylinders were opened with linear shaped charges to simulate a near instantaneous rupture, and blast was measured at various locations. The observed blast could be clearly attributed to explosive evaporation. The results show that below the homogeneous nucleation temperature, BLEVE blast does not disappear abruptly, but instead follows a gradual decay. Predictions with a numerical BLEVE blast model overestimate the observed blast peak overpressure and impulse, but qualitatively show a similar behaviour. The energy lost by the acceleration of the cylinder parts is a possible reason for overestimations of the model.The consequence of the test results is that for accident scenarios with CO2 at low temperatures a BLEVE should not be neglected in hazard assessments. Future large scale bulk storage will take place at a 105 times larger volume than the cylinders applied in the current small scale experiments. We expect that the blast-reducing effects of a tank shell will disappear at such scale.The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 241381. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Blast; BLEVE; Carbon dioxide; CO2; Explosive evaporation; Homogeneous nucleation temperature","Blast; BLEVE; Boiling liquid expanding vapour explosions; Explosive evaporation; Homogeneous nucleation temperature; Small-scale experiment; Technological challenges; Temperature dependence; Boiling liquids; Cylinders (shapes); Evaporation; Experiments; Nucleation; Shaped charges; Temperature distribution; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876958924

Different analysed, independent PSP data sources (e.g., Eurostat, Eurelectric) show a great variation in the main statistical values (installed capacity and power generation) of the EU pumped storage plant fleet. Presented and analysed PSP layouts and a clear methodology for determining renewable electricity generation from mixed pumped storage plants will avoid ambiguities that actually pertain to power databases to clearly separate renewable and non-renewable electricity generation. Most of the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAP) submitted to the European Commission do not correctly account for renewable electricity generation due to natural inflow into upper basins of PSPs. Moreover, renewable and non-renewable electricity generation types are mixed up.

The EEC Directive 91/271, referring to the Urban Waste Water Treatment, modified by the EEC Directive 98/15 is implemented in Romania also. This requires that until 31 December 2018, all localities with more than 2000 population equivalent (p.e.) must be served by sewerage networks and wastewater treatment plants where the resulting sludge should be managed ecologically. Therefore it is necessary to implement urgently an environmental management strategy of the sludge. The ecological studies on the sewage sludge management in short (2013), medium (2020) and long (2040) term were made in the EU in 2008 and in Romania in 2012. Both in the EU and in Romania the main option is to use the sludge on agricultural land as organic fertilizer but also to use the sludge as an energy source recovered by combustion. For an efficient management, in both cases there is a need for the sludge dewatering and drying. Thus the sludge volume will decrease, the transport and storage costs will be significantly reduced, and the lower heat value (ul) will increase. As a main conclusion one will support the idea that it is necessary to make a preliminary assessment of the thermodynamic energy content of the sewage sludge in order to depict and select the global vision of the process, assuring both the optimal energy development and environmental friendly treatment processes.","Combustion; Energy recovery; Environmental management; Sewage sludge; Thermodynamic cycles; Wastewater","Efficient managements; Energy recovery; Environmental management strategy; Environmental-friendly; Preliminary assessment; Thermodynamic cycle; Thermodynamic energy; Wastewater treatment plants; Combustion; Environmental management; Fertilizers; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage sludge; Thermodynamic properties; Toxicity; Wastewater; Water treatment plants; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879266893

The evaluated co-gasification cases were evaluated in term of key plant performance indicators for generation of totally or partially decarbonized energy vectors (power, hydrogen, substitute natural gas, liquid fuels by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis). The work streamlines one significant advantage of gasification process, namely the capability to process lower grade fuels on condition of high energy efficiency. Introduction in the evaluated IGCC-based schemes of carbon capture step (based on pre-combustion capture) significantly reduces CO2 emissions, the carbon capture rate being higher than 90% for decarbonized energy vectors (power and hydrogen) and in the range of 47-60% for partially decarbonized energy vectors (SNG, liquid fuels). Various plant concepts were assessed (e.g. 420-425 MW net power with 0-200 MWth flexible hydrogen output, 800 MWth SNG, 700 MWth liquid fuel, all of them with CCS).

However, it is an industry in which the use of raw materials is maximised leaving a large volume of waste. The cork industry has tried to take advantage of these residues, mainly through direct energy recovery, despite the technical and safety difficulties presented by the use of such low density material, which complicates and hinders its transportation for industrial uses outside the area in which it is produced. The densification process opens new doors for such use and also for its storage, because it produces better results when compared with other more common products, such as wood sawdust or even forest and agricultural waste. Thus, cork pellets emerge as a safer and more easily transportable alternative for energy recovery from cork dust and other granulated types of cork waste, which offer the prospects for wider use. The results demonstrate that cork pellets have higher calorific value when compared with other biomass pellets; typically, approximately 20 MJ/kg with 3% volume of ashes, which is equivalent to that obtained from the combustion of pellets produced from combined forest and agricultural waste with a bulk density of 750 kg/m3, which offers real advantages in terms of logistics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Three mechanisms of self-discharge were proposed: due to a leakage-current, faradaic reactions and charge redistribution. According to the law of energy preservation, if the voltage drop is associated with the energy loss, the energy would more likely be exchanged with the environment. While heat generation was measured during EDLC charging and discharging, the corresponding effect during storage under open-circuit conditions has not been reported. This may support the conclusion that voltage changes during 'self-discharge' are not related to a considerable energy loss. Moreover, it has been shown that a two-stage charging process, i.e. first galvanostatic charging followed by a potentiostatic charge redistribution, resulted in considerably slower potential changes when the device was switched to the open circuit. All discussed models were based on the assumption that the energy accumulated by EDLCs is proportional to the voltage in the second power, with capacitance (C/2) as the proportionality constant. However, it has been shown that during EDLC charging or discharging through a resistance R, equations valid for 'dielectric' and electrolytic capacitors, do not hold in the case of EDLCs. Consequently, the assumption that the energetic state of the EDLC is proportional at any time to the voltage in the second power may not be valid due to considerable variability of the 'constant' C. Therefore, voltage changes may not reflect the energetic state of the device. © 2013 The Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878284930

The specific surface area and micropore volume decrease rather sharply when the pellet density approaches the crystal density. Optimum volumetric storage capacity of 40 g L-1 is obtained for monoliths of remarkable mechanical integrity. The X-ray diffraction patterns do not exhibit notable changes with compression up to densities close to the crystal density. However, the infrared spectra show significant modification of the band structure in the range of vibration frequencies characteristic to the carboxylate and phenylene groups, due to the pressure-induced changes in the coordination environment of the metal, close to the adsorption sites. The compression effect on hydrogen adsorption can be correlated with the changes in the nitrogen adsorption isotherms.

It is shown that aggregating EVs through a fleet operator represents the most attractive strategy both in relation to flexibility and lowest cost. Finally, even though fleet-operator-based aggregation fits the existing electricity system very well, the analysis presented reveals that EV fleet-operator-based charging will also cause a challenge to the distribution grid if a distribution system operator-driven market for congestion is not established. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Syngas can then be used either for power generation or processed to various chemicals (hydrogen, ammonia, methanol etc.). Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) represent a group of technologies aimed to capture CO2 from energy-intensive processes and then stored for long period of time in suitable geological locations. This paper evaluates in details mass and energy integration aspects for an IGCC power plant fitted with pre- and post-combustion carbon capture configurations based on gas-liquid absorption processes (chemical and physical solvents). Case studies analyzed in the paper are using coal to produce around 375 - 485 MW net electricity simultaneous with capturing about 90% of the carbon contained in the feedstock. Two carbon dioxide capture options (post- and pre-combustion capture options) are compared with the situation of no carbon capture in term of mass and energy integration aspects as well as quantification of overall energy penalties.

Grains consist mainly of starch, which is easily degraded in the rumen by microbial glycosidases, providing energy for rapid growth of rumen microbes and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) as the main energy source for the host. Yet, low dietary fiber contents and the rapid accumulation of SCFA lead to rumen disorders in cattle. The chemical processing of grains has become increasingly important to confer their starch resistances against rumen microbial glycosidases, hence generating ruminally resistant starch (RRS). In ruminants, unlike monogastric species, the strategy of enhancing resistant starch is useful, not only in lowering the amount of carbohydrate substrates available for digestion in the upper gut sections, but also in enhancing the net hepatic glucose supply, which can be utilized by the host more efficiently than the hepatic gluconeogenesis of SCFA. The use of chemical methods to enhance the RRS of grains and the feeding of RRS face challenges in the practice; therefore, the present article attempts to summarize the most important achievements in the chemical processing methods used to generate RRS, and review advantages and challenges of feeding RRS to ruminants. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Barley; Chemical grain processing; Resistant starch; Ruminally resistant starch; Ruminant health","amylopectin; amylose; carbohydrate; glucose; glycosidase; lactic acid; short chain fatty acid; sodium hydroxide; starch; vegetable protein; acidosis; analytic method; barley; bovids; chemical grain processing method; chemical reaction; dietary fiber; enzyme activity; food processing; gluconeogenesis; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; nutrient content; nutritional assessment; nutritional value; review; Bos; Hordeum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878777111

Some WEC systems have integrated energy storage that overcomes this limitation, but add significant expenses to an already costly system. As an alternative approach, this article investigates the direct export option that relies on aggregate smoothing among several WECs. By optimizing the positioning of the WEC devices with respect to the incoming waves, fluctuations may be mutually canceled out between the devices. This work is based on Fred. Olsen's WEC system Lifesaver, and a WEC farm consisting of 48 devices is designed in detail and simulated. The major cost driver for the electrical export system is the required oversize factor necessary for transfer of the average power output. Due to the low power quality, this number can be as high as 20 at the entry point of the electrical system, and it is thus crucial to quickly improve the power quality so that the downstream power system is efficiently utilized. The simulations undertaken in this work indicate that a high quality power output can be achieved at the farm level, but that a significant oversize factor will be required in the intermediate power system within the farm. © 2012 by the authors.","Array; Average; Energy; Farm; Peak; Power; Quality; Ratio; Wave",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888624748

Removing surface multiples and interbed multiples proves to be challenging in many cases. The nowadays widely used method of Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME) has lately been redefined as a full-waveform inversion process, resulting in the method of Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI). The new method is shown to be more accurate than the former method in several situations, because it estimates primaries such that they, together with their multiples, explain the input data. Its main advantage is that the minimum energy assumption in traditional multiple subtraction is avoided. The SRME methodology has been extended to the case of internal multiples by several authors, however, the involved subtraction of predicted multiples is probably even more challenging than for the surface-multiple case. Therefore, in this paper the EPSI method is generalized to remove both surface and interbed multiples. As in previous implementations of internal multiple removal based on data-driven convolution, the newly proposed scheme requires some knowledge about the subsurface: the data should be divided into (macro) layers and appropriate time windows must be selected. The method is tested on two 2D synthetic datasets to prove its viability. Furthermore, application to a 2D field dataset showed improved accuracy compared to conventional prediction and subtraction. © 2012 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.","Data processing; Inversion; Modelling; Seismics","Full-waveform inversion; Inversion; Multiple subtraction; Seismics; Sparse inversions; Surface multiples; Surface-related multiple elimination; Synthetic datasets; Data processing; Digital storage; Models; Seismic prospecting; Estimation; accuracy assessment; data inversion; data processing; numerical model; seismic data; two-dimensional modeling; waveform analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878977605

In addition, hydrogen can be released from these materials by low temperature thermolysis (&lt;100°C), making them well-suited for proton exchange membrane fuel cells and other low temperature applications. This article covers recent research on aluminum-based hydrides, including crystal structures, thermodynamics, kinetics, hydrogenation conditions, and regeneration methods. © 2013 Materials Research Society.","Al; Energy Storage; H; Hydrogenation","Automotive applications; H; Hydrogen storage research; Low-temperature applications; Portable power systems; Recent researches; Solid rocket propellant; Volumetric capacity; Aluminum; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Liquefied gases; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solid propellants; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Hydrides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878885502

Phase change materials (PCMs) are investigated as an option to regulate photovoltaic module temperature and thereby reduce its electrical efficiency decrease. In this study, a simplified heat balance model is used to calculate the extra energy gain; such a PV/PCM system can bring on an annual basis. With present day commercially available PCM materials, a moderate increase of up to 3% of the total energy output can be expected. When taking into account the additional PCM material cost, a PV/PCM module presently is not economically viable. For an acceptable payback period of 10-20 years to be reached, the heat storage capacity of a PCM would require an increase of about one order of magnitude, which is presently not realistic. Nevertheless, a combination with building climate control in which the PCM plays a double role controlling both the PV temperature as well as the inside climate temperature may be feasible.

The interactions of deuterons with nuclei have been especially the subject of common research in the history of nuclear physics. Moreover, the knowledge of cross section for deuteron-nucleus interactions are required for various application such as space applications, accelerator driven sub-critical systems, nuclear medicine, nuclear fission reactors and controlled thermonuclear fusion reactors. Particularly, the future of controlled thermonuclear fusion reactors is largely dependent on the nuclear reaction cross section data and the selection of structural fusion materials. Finally, the reaction cross section data of deuteron induced reactions on fusion structural materials are of great importance for development and design of both experimental and commercial fusion devices. In this work, reaction model calculations of the cross sections of deuteron induced reactions on structural fusion materials such as Al (Aluminium), Ti (Titanium), Cu (Copper), Ni (Nickel), Co (Cobalt), Fe (Iron), Zr (Zirconium), Hf (Hafnium) and Ta (Tantalum) have been investigated.

In the present study, we identified gene products catalyzing formation of TG and SE in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Based on sequence homologies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two diacylglycerol acyltransferases Dga1p and Lro1p and one acyl CoA:sterol acyltransferase Are2p from P. pastoris were identified. Mutants bearing single and multiple deletions of the respective genes were analyzed for their growth phenotype, lipid composition and the ability to form lipid droplets. Our results indicate that the above mentioned gene products are most likely responsible for the entire TG and SE synthesis in P. pastoris. Lro1p which has low fatty acid substrate specificity in vivo is the major TG synthase in this yeast, whereas Dga1p contributes less to TG synthesis although with some preference to utilize polyunsaturated fatty acids as substrates. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, Are2p is the only SE synthase in P. pastoris. Also this enzyme exhibits some preference for certain fatty acids as judged from the fatty acid profile of SE compared to bulk lipids. Most interestingly, TG formation in P. pastoris is indispensable for lipid droplet biogenesis. The small amount of SE synthesized by Are2p in a dgaδlroδ double deletion mutant is insufficient to initiate the formation of the storage organelle. In summary, our data provide a first insight into the molecular machinery of non-polar lipid synthesis and storage in P. pastoris and demonstrate specific features of this machinery in comparison to other eukaryotic cells, especially S. cerevisiae. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Acyltransferase; Lipid droplet; Pichia pastoris; Steryl ester; Triacylglycerol","diacylglycerol acyltransferase; fat droplet; polyunsaturated fatty acid; steryl ester synthase; synthetase; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; article; biogenesis; catalysis; eukaryote; eukaryotic cell; genetic analysis; in vivo study; nonhuman; Pichia pastoris; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Amino Acid Sequence; Esters; Molecular Sequence Data; Pichia; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sterol Esterase; Sterols; Substrate Specificity; Triglycerides; Eukaryota; Pichia pastoris; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876900509

This is certainly technically feasible. However, this paper asks whether the green battery idea is politically feasible. The paper analyses four scenarios, three of which Norway serves as a green battery and one domestic. It focuses on decision-makers' and interest groups' positions on new interconnectors from Norway to continental Europe and the United Kingdom (UK), pumped-storage hydropower, and new renewable energy production in Norway. The paper argues that the present policy is characterised by incremental change-decisions about new interconnectors are made on an individual basis. Moreover the paper argues there is little reason to believe that this status quo policy will change based on any of the green battery scenarios in the near term. Still, decision-makers and interest groups are positive, in principle, towards new interconnectors and pumped-storage hydropower. Hence, Norway might become a green battery in the longer term. In the short term, however, a politically feasible contribution from Norway is balancing power through already existing hydropower capacity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Political feasibility; Pumped-storage hydropower; Renewable energy","Balancing power; Decision makers; Interconnectors; Interest groups; Political feasibility; Pumped-storage; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Renewable energy resources; Hydroelectric power; alternative energy; decision making; energy policy; energy resource; European Union; feasibility study; hydroelectric power; renewable resource; Norway; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876329587

These entities are intracellular organelles, known as oil bodies. It is often reported that they have a spherical shape, but imaging using cryo-SEM analysis showed that they are rather elastic and their shape depends on their surrounding environment. In this research we have shown that in maize germ, which has a relatively low moisture content, the oil body geometry depends on the available space they have. On the other hand, oil bodies in sunflower seeds, which contain double amounts of water, appear with an almost spherical shape. Oil bodies can be extracted from oleaginous seeds using an aqueous alkaline extraction, which leads to a stable natural oil-in-water emulsion. As no additional energy is required, this method can be considered as sustainable and may find a lot of potential uses in industry. Extraneous co-extracted proteins most likely form a second layer around the oil body surface, which protects the oil bodies from coalescence, even at high oil concentration. The extraneous proteins of maize germ oil body emulsions could be removed by applying aqueous washing steps, but not in the case of sunflower seed oil bodies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CLSM; Cryo-SEM; Maize germ; Oil bodies; Sunflower seed","CLSM; Cryo-SEM; Maize germ; Oil bodies; Sunflower seeds; Coalescence; Emulsions; Enzyme activity; Phospholipids; Proteins; Sunflower oil; Oilseeds; Helianthus; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875774290

Introduction of carbon significantly changes the hydrogenation behaviour, which becomes strongly dependent on the nature and amount of carbon additive. For the materials containing 1 wt.% AC or TEG, and 5 wt.% MWCNT, the hydrogenation becomes superior to that for the individual magnesium and finishes within 1 h. Analysis of the data indicates that carbon acts as a carrier of the ""activated"" hydrogen by a mechanism of spill-over. For Mg-G the hydrogenation starts from an incubation period and proceeds slower. An increase in the content of EG and TEG above 1 wt.% results in the deterioration of the hydrogenation kinetics. The effect of carbon additives has roots in their destruction during the HRBM to form graphene layers encapsulating the MgH2 nanoparticles and preventing the grain growth. This results in an increase of absorption-desorption cycle stability and a decrease of the MgH2 crystallite size in the re-hydrogenated Mg-C hybrid materials (40-125 nm) as compared to Mg alone (180 nm). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of nanoscale storage materials offers a promising strategy to increase the energy storage capabilities of Li-ion batteries, potentially making them suitable for electric vehicles. Nanosizing, which increases surface area, enhances the importance of interfaces and surfaces on directly observable materials properties such as the voltage profile and the phase diagram. As a result, nanosized materials can show improved storage properties, and materials inactive at the micro size can become excellent storage materials. We suggest novel surface storage mechanisms to explain these phenomena. First-order phase transitions, which are responsible for the batteries' constant voltage output, are partially suppressed at the nanoscale. So far the morphological changes during the phase transition remain unclear. A complete understanding of the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of a collection of nanosized electrode particles within an actual electrode remains a formidable challenge.In this Account, we describe the efforts toward understanding the effects of nanosizing and its applications in representative insertion materials. We are particularly interested in the mechanisms and properties that will help to increase the energy storage of Li-ion batteries. We review and discuss the nanosize properties of lithium insertion materials, olivine LiFePO4, and titanium oxides. Although nanosizing intrinsically destabilizes materials, which is potentially detrimental for battery performance, the relative stability of oxide and phosphate insertion compounds makes it possible to exploit the advantages of nanosizing in these materials. The larger capacities and typical voltage profiles in nanosized materials appear to be related to the surface and interface properties that become pronounced at the nanosize, providing a potential means of tailoring the material properties by particle size and shape.The large irreversible capacity at the surface of some materials such as titanium oxides represents a disadvantage of nanosizing, but research is suggesting ways to resolve this problem. The changes in the first-order phase transition upon (de)lithiation could be related to the interface between the coexisting phases. At these interfaces, concentration gradients and strain lead to energy penalties, which significantly influence the thermodynamics of nanomaterial grains. However, it is less clear what nanoscaling effects predominate in the large collection of particles in actual electrodes. The complexity of these materials at the nanoscale and the difficulty in observing them in situ pose additional challenges. Future demands for stored electricity will require significant research progress in both nanomaterials synthesis and in situ monitoring. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864748139

Both storage units have the same storage potential and contain a nitrate mixture (salts) in order to store energy with latent heat (melting temperature: 210-220 C). The system is liquid-based: the collector concentrates the energy on the receiver so that the fluid (a heat transfer oil: Duratherm FG) inside the receiver tube is heated and can carry the energy to the storage. The loop connecting the collector and the storage is filled with the heat transfer oil which circulates by self-circulation.

Complementary measurements of throughfall and stemflow were made to study rainfall interception. The sum of the observed sensible (H) and latent (λE) heat fluxes was almost 95% of the net radiation (Rn) minus the canopy heat storage fluxes, indicating very good energy balance closure. The mean annual evapotranspiration was 1066mm, and 95% of the corresponding FAO Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (ET0) of 1117mm yr-1. Interception loss was 8% of annual rainfall (1386mm). Both the eddy covariance, and the throughfall and stemflow measurements showed average wet-canopy evaporation rate to be very low (0.05mmh-1) compared to the corresponding rainfall rate (3.06mmh-1). As a result, and despite the low canopy storage capacity of the coffee plantation (Cm, 0.50mm), interception was dominated by post-event evaporation of intercepted water rather than by within-event evaporation. Comparing the results for the coffee plantation with interception data from mature and secondary LMCFs in the study area suggests that the conversion of LMCF to shade-coffee may lead to a decrease in interception loss of 8-18% of incident rainfall. This decrease is caused by a three- to seven-fold decrease in Cm, probably due to the lower leaf area and smaller epiphyte biomass of the coffee plantation. The mean annual dry-canopy evaporation was 992mm, and 89% of ET0. Comparing the eddy covariance-based estimate of dry-canopy evaporation for the coffee plantation with sapflow-based estimates of transpiration for the LMCFs did not show any clear differences. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..","Cloud forest; Coffee cultivation; Hydrometeorology; Land use change; Rainfall interception; Transpiration","agrometeorology; canopy exchange; cloud forest; coffee; eddy covariance; energy balance; energy flux; epiphyte; evapotranspiration; heat flux; hydrometeorology; interception; land use change; montane forest; Penman-Monteith equation; plantation; rainfall; sap flow; shading; stemflow; throughfall; Mexico [North America]; Veracruz",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875101189

Simplified power-time flexibility models for appliances are introduced on which generic economic simulations can be based. These simulations permit a good indication of the economic value that can be attained as a function of model parameters. This shows that classical load shifting of washing appliances creates sufficient value in the day-ahead market to justify investments in smart energy control services. Cooling appliances create significant value on the balance market and while full scale deployment would lead to significant price erosion in today's market, it could accommodate additional unbalance caused future sustainable generation. The scale of domestic demand response resources can be quantified in two simple parameters: regulation power and storage capacity. For the Dutch situation these are 700 MW, equivalent to 5% of average national power consumption and 5 GWh storage: around 20 minutes of average national power consumption.

Two-phase transport in an electrolyzer cell is visualized by simultaneous neutron radiography and optical imaging. Optical and neutron data are used in a complementary manner to aid in understanding the two-phase flow behavior. Two different patterns of gas-bubble evolution and departure are identified: periodic growth/removal of small bubbles vs. prolonged blockage by stagnant large bubbles. In addition, the bubble distribution across the active area is not uniform due to combined effects of buoyancy and proximity to the inlet. The effects of operating parameters such as current density, temperature and water flow rate on the two-phase distribution are investigated. Higher water accumulation is detected in the cathode chamber at higher current density, even though the cathode is purged with a high flow rate of N2. The temperature is found to affect the volume of water; higher temperature yields less water and more gas volume in the anode chamber. Higher temperature also enhanced the water transport in the cathode chamber. Finally, water transported through the membrane to the cathode reduced the cell performance by limiting the hydrogen mass transport. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Although this energy expenditure is partly offset by benefits in LNG transportation there is a need of improving the balance of the LNG process chain. Nowadays the cost of liquefaction of LNG oscillates between 0.45 and 0.55 kW h/kg when the thermodynamic minimum is 0.30 kW h/kg (assuming the composition is 100% methane). The proximity of these numbers means that the possibility of improving the liquefaction process is very limited. A different approach to the problem allows LNG as a source of exergy which can be utilized by combining LNG gasification with other processes to be considered. Such solutions can help optimize the economical balance of the overall LNG process chain. The paper proposes a novel idea of coupling the LNG regasification with the filling process of Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) tanks. Latent heat of LNG vaporization is directly used for the precooling of the ANG adsorption bed. This enables gas compressors to be avoided and improves the competitiveness of the ANG storage method which is an alternative to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) storage and distribution.

For this, real world data of generators located in a German distribution grid are used.

As the effect of the plasma treatment decreases in time, the so-called ""aging effect"", it is important to gain knowledge on how this effect impacts the wetting behavior of commonly used polymers in order to be able to optimize production processing times. In this article the authors study the wetting behavior of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) and polyimide (PI) polymer films after plasma treatment in time. The plasma treatment was performed using a novel maskless DBD plasma patterning technology, i.e., μPlasma Printing, at atmospheric pressure under nitrogen atmosphere. After treatment, the samples were stored at room temperature at 30%-40% relative humidity for up to one month. An increase in wettability is measured for all polymers directly after μPlasma Printing. The major increase in wettability occurs after a small number of treatments, e.g., low energy density. More treatments show no further beneficial gain in wettability. The increase in wettability is mainly due to an increase in the polar part of the surface energy, which can probably be attributed to chemical modification of the surface of the investigated polymers. With the exception of FEP, during storage of the plasma treated polymers, the wettability partially declines in the first five days, after which it stabilizes to approximately 50% of its original state. The wettability of FEP shows little decline during storage. As the storage time between production steps is mostly under two days, μPlasma Printing shows good promise as a pre-treatment step in the production of printed electronics. © 2013 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,"Barrier discharge plasmas; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; Nitrogen atmospheres; Patterning technology; Polyethylene naphthalate; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Printed electronics; Production process; Atmospheric pressure; Chemical modification; Nitrogen plasma; Plasma applications; Polyethylene terephthalates; Polymer films; Printing; Semiconducting films; Wetting; Polymers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886073286

To obtain ChBD-based cell immobilization, Usp45 signal sequence with ChBD of chitinase A1 enzyme from Bacillus circulans was fused with different lengths of PrtP (153, 344, and 800 aa) or AcmA (242 aa) anchors derived from L. lactis. According to the whole cell ELISA analysis, ChBD was successfully expressed on the surface of L. lactis cells. Scanning electron microscope observations supported the conclusion of the binding analysis that L. lactis cells expressing the ChBD with long PrtP anchor (800 aa) did bind to chitin surfaces more efficiently than cells with the other ChBD anchors. The attained binding affinity of nisin producers for chitin flakes retained them in the fermentation during medium changes and enabled storage for sequential productions.

Nevertheless, underlying mechanisms remain to be established. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker valsartan (VAL) on skeletal muscle fatty acid (FA) handling in subjects with IGM. Design/Setting: This was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial at Maastricht University Medical Center. Intervention/Main Outcomes/Participants: Fasting and postprandial skeletal muscle FA handling were assessed at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment with VAL or placebo in 26 subjects with IGM. Fasting and postprandial skeletal muscle FA handling were determined by combining the forearm balance technique with stable isotopes of palmitate. [2H2]-Palmitate was infused iv to label endogenous triacylglycerol (TAG) and free fatty acid (FFA) in the circulation, and [U-13C]- palmitate was incorporated in a high-fat mixed meal (2.6 MJ, 61% energy from fat) to label chylomicron TAG. Muscle biopsy samples were taken to determine im TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG), FFA, and phospholipid contents, their fractional synthetic rates and degree of saturation, and mRNA expression of oxidative genes. Results: VAL decreased saturation of im TAG and DAG fractions but did not affect net muscle uptake of [2H2]-palmitate, very low-density lipoprotein ([ 2H2])-TAG and chylomicron ([U-13C])-TAG, and muscle mRNA expression. VAL decreased FA spillover, as estimated by circulating [U-13C]- palmitate, and FFA rate of appearance and tended to decrease chylomicron TAG concentrations. Conclusions: VAL treatment for 26 weeks decreased saturation of skeletal muscle TAG and DAG stores, suggesting altered intramuscular lipid partitioning of FA. The VAL-induced reduction in postprandial FA spillover, endogenous lipolysis, and chylomicron TAG concentrations indicate improved adipose tissue lipid buffering capacity.

It is however poorly understood which components of these diets are underlying this decrease. This study assessed the role of saturated fat intake on striatal DRD 2/3 availability. Forty rats were randomized to a free-choice high-fat high-sugar diet (HFHS) or a standard chow diet for 28 days. Striatal DRD 2/3 availability was measured using 123 I-IBZM storage phosphor imaging at day 29. The HFHS group was split in a HFHS-high-fat (HFHS-hf) and HFHS-low-fat (HFHS-lf) group based on the percentage energy intake from fat. Rats of both HFHS subgroups had increased energy intake, abdominal fat stores and plasma leptin levels compared with controls. DRD 2/3 availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was significantly lower in HFHS-hf than in HFHS-lf rats, whereas it was similar for HFHS-lf and control rats. Furthermore, DRD 2/3 availability in the NAcc was positively correlated with the percentage energy intake from sugar. Total energy intake was lower for HFHS-hf than for HFHS-lf rats. Together these results suggest that a diet with a high fat/carbohydrate ratio, but not total energy intake or the level of adiposity, is the best explanation for the decrease in striatal DRD 2/3 availability observed in diet-induced obesity. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","diet-induced obesity; dopamine D2/3 receptor; energy intake; free-choice high-fat high-sugar diet; saturated fat; striatum","dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine 3 receptor; leptin; abdominal fat; animal experiment; article; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; human; lipid diet; male; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; obesity; priority journal; rat; sugar intake; Animals; Benzamides; Biological Availability; Contrast Media; Corpus Striatum; Diet; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Sucrose; Dopamine Antagonists; Energy Intake; Food Habits; Male; Obesity; Pyrrolidines; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptors, Dopamine D2; Receptors, Dopamine D3; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877582760

This requires unprecedented rates of decarbonization even in the short-run. The availability of the option of net negative emissions, such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or reforestation/afforestation, allows to delay some of these emission reductions. In the paper, we assess the demand and potential for negative emissions in particular from BECCS. Both stylized calculations and model runs show that without the possibility of negative emissions, pathways meeting the 2 °C target with high probability need almost immediate emission reductions or simply become infeasible. The potential for negative emissions is uncertain. We show that negative emissions from BECCS are probably limited to around 0 to 10 GtCO2/year in 2050 and 0 to 20 GtCO2/year in 2100. Estimates on the potential of afforestation options are in the order of 0-4 GtCO2/year. Given the importance and the uncertainty concerning BECCS, we stress the importance of near-term assessments of its availability as today's decisions has important consequences for climate change mitigation in the long run. © 2013 The Author(s).",,"Carbon capture; Emission control; Reforestation; Bio energy; Calculations and modeling; Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Cumulative emissions; Emission reduction; High probability; Integrated assessment modelling; Climate change; afforestation; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; integrated approach; probability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876695082

Nuclear medicine physics was introduced as a part of a project on radiation imaging and radioactivity measurements in the 2002-2003 IAEA biennium program in Dosimetry and Medical Radiation Physics. Ten years later, IAEA activities in this field have expanded to cover quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) of nuclear medicine equipment, education and clinical training, professional recognition of the role of medical physicists in nuclear medicine physics, and finally, the coordination of research and development activities in internal dosimetry. As a result of these activities, the IAEA has received numerous requests to support the development and implementation of QA or QC programs for radioactivity measurements in nuclear medicine in many Member States. During the last 5 years, support was provided to 20 Member States through the IAEA's technical cooperation programme. The IAEA has also supported education and clinical training of medical physicists. This type of support has been essential for the development and expansion of the Medical Physics profession, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The need for basic as well as specialized clinical training in medical physics was identified as a priority for healthcare providers in many countries. The IAEA's response to meet the increasing needs for training has been 2-folds. Through its regular program, a priority is given to the development of standardized syllabi and education and clinical training guides. Through its technical cooperation programme, support is given for setting up national medical physics education and clinical training programs in countries. In addition, fellowships are granted for professionals working in the field for specialized training, and workshops are organized at the national and regional level in specialized topics of nuclear medicine physics. So as to support on-the-job training, the IAEA has also setup a gamma camera laboratory in Seibersdorf, Austria. The laboratory is also equipped with QC tools and equipments, and radioisotopes are procured when training events are held. About 2-3 specialized courses are held every year for medical physicists at the IAEA gamma camera laboratory. In the area of research and development, the IAEA supports, through its coordinated research projects, new initiatives in quantitative nuclear medicine and internal dosimetry. The future of nuclear medicine is driven by advances in instrumentation, by the ever increasing availability of computing power and data storage, and by the development of new radiopharmaceuticals for molecular imaging and therapy. Future developments in nuclear medicine are partially driven by, and will influence, nuclear medicine physics and medical physics. To summarize, the IAEA has established a number of programs to support nuclear medicine physics and will continue to do so through its coordinated research activities, education and training in clinical medical physics, and through programs and meetings to promote standardization and harmonization of QA or QC procedures for imaging and treatment of patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of annealing treatment on the phase composition, microstructure, hydrogen absorption-desorption and electrochemical properties was investigated. The phase-structural composition, microstructures and morphologies of the phases were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and by scanning electron microscopy. Increase of the annealing temperature to 950 °C leads to a higher abundance of the La2MgNi9 and La3MgNi14 phases and an elimination of the present at lower temperatures LaNi5-x and LaMgNi4 intermetallics. The hydrogen absorption-desorption behaviors, the electrochemical performance and electrochemical cycling stability significantly improve after the annealing. For pasted electrodes, the annealed alloys had a discharge capacity of 350-360 mAh g-1 compared to 325 mAh g-1 for the as-cast sample. The discharge capacity of the annealed samples remained high, almost 50% after 300 cycles with 100% depth of discharge (DOD) in half-cell tests. Pellet electrodes prepared from the annealed alloy and carbonyl nickel powder showed a discharge capacity of 396 mAh g-1. In present work we also report the performance of a small prototype NiMH cell where the annealed alloy was used as the active material in the negative MH electrode and a sintered Ni electrode acted as the positive electrode. After 300 cycles at charge/discharge rates of 0.2 C the cell showed a very good cycling stability with its capacity remaining on the level of 87%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Electrochemical energy conversion; Hydrogen storage alloy; La-Mg-Ni alloy; Ni-MH battery","Absorption-desorption; Annealing temperatures; Electrochemical cycling stability; Electrochemical energy conversions; Electrochemical performance; La-Mg-Ni alloy; Ni-metal hydride batteries; Ni-MH batteries; Annealing; Electrochemical properties; Electrodes; Energy conversion; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage alloys; Intermetallics; Lanthanum alloys; Microstructure; Nickel; Phase composition; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary batteries; Sintering; X ray diffraction; Electric discharges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874929543

Silicon is an excellent anode candidate for Li-ion batteries due to its extremely high storage capacity. However, the volume expansion induces tremendous material deterioration, resulting in poor cycle life. In order to cope with this shortage, various strategies have been proposed. Nanowires were found to be mechanically too fragile to be applied in all-solid-state battery stacks. Honeycomb structures have recently been proposed as they can sustain striking reversible deformations upon (de)lithiation. Finally, thin films turn out to be extremely stable. To further increase the energy density of these thin-film batteries, novel approaches have been proposed. One of the new concepts is based on the etching of deep 3D-structures into a Si substrate, increasing the effective surface area significantly. In combination with advanced materials, new opportunities are obtained to increase the energy density further.","3D-integrated; Microbatteries; Si honeycombs; Si nanowires; Si thin films","3D-integrated; Advanced materials; All-solid state batteries; Effective surface area; Material deterioration; Micro battery; Reversible deformation; Si nanowire; Anodes; Exhibitions; Honeycomb structures; Nanowires; Thin films; Three dimensional computer graphics; Silicon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876448444

Although economic recession in the early 1990s was a driver in the decrease of air pollution by industry, the sharp growth in the use of private cars has made transport an increasingly important contributor in air and noise pollution problems, especially in major cities. Leptokaria is a modern Greek city in Pieria prefecture, Central Macedonia which lies on the coast of Aegean Sea, under the Mount Olympos. The atmospheric pollution in an urban environment poses a serious problem, since the joint consequences of vehicle emissions and traffic noise affect dramatically the physical and mental health of the citizens as well as the quality of life and services. In this paper, exhaust gas data from spark ignition (SI) engine vehicles were taken with interseasonal measurements by monitoring the tailpipe gases. In particular: CO, CO 2, O2, and HC were measured both at idle and 2000 rpm. In addition, sensory observations on the qualitative noise, optic and nasal evaluation of the operation of gasoline engine vehicles were carried out, as well as controls of possession of exhaust gas cards. Furthermore, a novel emission control process has been proposed and presented for the detection of gross polluting vehicles. Based on these data, the main result that has been found is that in Leptokaria there is 1 vehicle which pollutes as much as the rest of 4 vehicles, simultaneously. © by PSP.","Air quality; Sensory observations; Vehicle emissions","air quality; atmospheric pollution; noise pollution; sensory system; traffic emission; Greece; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876061234

The paper compares the energy chains of propulsion configurations and discusses the relations with energy carriers, storage, and conversions. It is shown that perspectives more or less follow the developments on all electric shipping: i.e., as for energy efficiency short range shipping and dynamic behavior favor SC technology; high-temperature superconducting engines may also be an improvement if electric propulsion is selected for other reasons than efficiency.

This is done using a bottom-up model that considers the main processes involved in each facility. The model described in the paper assumes the retrofitting/upgrade of each European facility with a BAT or IT as soon as the criterion for a capital budgeting decision is met. The paper details the effect on the savings in energy and CO2 emissions by European industry, assuming different levels of requirement in the payback period used as main capital-budgeting decision criterion. This approach reveals the full potential that some technologies under research (as the ones considered in the Ultra-Low CO2 Steelmaking project and Carbon Capture and Storage technologies, as well as other technologies that are not widely deployed (Direct Reduced Iron technologies), may have in the European industry. The starting point of the simulation is adjusted so that the CO2 emissions of each facility in the model have a counterpart in the emissions recorded for the benchmarking exercise of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. The results show that, by 2030, for a payback period of two years, the margin of improvement in CO2 emissions is around 20%.

Alternative and future fuels are the subject of considerable research and public interest. A simple approach is presented that can be used in science education lectures at the high school or undergraduate level to provide students with an understanding of the elemental composition of future fuels. Starting from key fuel requirements and overlaying the chemical trends evident in the periodic table, it can be demonstrated that future chemical fuels will be based on three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Liquid hydrocarbons are the most convenient transportation fuels because of their physical state (easier to handle than gases or solids) and their high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. Challenges remain for storage of electricity and gaseous fuels. Recognizing the need to address climate change driven by increasing emissions of CO2, sustainable mobility will be powered by low-CO2 hydrogen, low-CO2 hydrocarbons, low-CO2 oxygenates, low-CO2 electricity, or a combination of the above. © 2012 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","Alcohols; Continuing Education; Energy Storage; Environmental Chemistry; First-Year Undergraduate/General; Fuels; General Public; Periodic Table; Physical Chemistry; Second-Year Undergraduate; Textbooks/Reference Books; Upper-Division Undergraduate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876005506

To do this, a parametric clear sky solar irradiance model has been built and validated. For applying the model, a set of four meteorological parameters (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, water vapor column content and the ngström turbidity coefficient) are required at input. The energy loss in a pollution episode was evaluated as the difference between the clear sky solar irradiation computed in two situations: (1) Using measured values for all inputs and (2) using measured values for all inputs excepting the ngström turbidity coefficient, for which a climatological reference value has been assumed. The calculations show that the aerosol pollution can lead to a significant loss of collectable solar energy, of over 20%. Overall results drive to the generic conclusion that the pollution episodes should be considered in both stages of a photovoltaic plant: in development, by taking them into account when the typical meteorological year is constructed, and in the exploiting stage, by accounting them in the forecasting procedure of the output power.

The presence of comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) strongly increased ATGL-mediated TG catabolism in cell culture experiments. Mutations in the genes coding for ATGL or CGI-58 in humans cause neutral lipid storage disease characterized by TG accumulation in multiple tissues. ATGL gene mutations cause a severe phenotype especially in cardiac muscle leading to cardiomyopathy that can be lethal. In contrast, CGI-58 gene mutations provoke severe ichthyosis and hepatosteatosis in humans and mice, whereas the role of CGI-58 in muscle energy metabolism is less understood. Here we show that mice lacking CGI-58 exclusively in muscle (CGI-58KOM) developed severe cardiac steatosis and cardiomyopathy linked to impaired TG catabolism and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The marked increase in ATGL protein levels in cardiac muscle of CGI-58KOM mice was unable to compensate the lack of CGI-58. The addition of recombinant CGI-58 to cardiac lysates of CGI-58KOM mice completely reconstituted TG hydrolytic activities. In skeletal muscle, the lack of CGI-58 similarly provoked TG accumulation. The addition of recombinant CGI-58 increased TG hydrolytic activities in control and CGI-58KOM tissue lysates, elucidating the limiting role of CGI-58 in skeletal muscle TG catabolism. Finally, muscle CGI-58 deficiency affected whole body energy homeostasis, which is caused by impaired muscle TG catabolism and increased cardiac glucose uptake. In summary, this study demonstrates that functional muscle lipolysis depends on both CGI-58 and ATGL. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Cardiac muscles; Energy homeostasis; Energy metabolism; Fatty acid oxidation; Glucose uptake; Hydrolytic activities; Skeletal muscle; Triacylglycerols; Cell culture; Enzymes; Genes; Heart; Mammals; Metabolism; Muscle; adipose triglyceride lipase protein; CGI 58 protein; fatty acid; muscle protein; recombinant protein; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cardiac steatosis; cardiomyopathy; controlled study; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glucose transport; heart disease; heart muscle; heart muscle metabolism; hydrolysis; knockout mouse; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; mitochondrion; mouse; muscle level; nonhuman; priority journal; protein depletion; protein function; skeletal muscle; steatosis; whole body energy homeostasis; 1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cardiomyopathies; Echocardiography; Female; Glucose; Homeostasis; Hydrolysis; Lipase; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Lipolysis; Male; Mice; Mitochondria; Muscles; Myocardium; Oxygen Consumption; Triglycerides; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876009387

Using a polyvinyl chloride hyperboloid construction, a floating standalone measuring device was developed. Being an open construction, it is almost insensitive to direct radiation. With this construction, a spiral-shaped fiberoptic cable setup was created that obtained temperature measurements with a vertical spatial resolution of 0.0002 m and a temporal resolution of 1min. DTS measured the detailed variations in air and surface water temperature. The new method was tested in the deep Lake Kinneret (Israel) from 6 to 9 Oct 2011 and in the shallow Lake Binaba (Ghana) from 24 to 28 Oct 2011. With the developed method, it is possible to capture the heat storage change in the top water layer, and therefore verify the water surface heat balance on a time scale of several minutes. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the measured temperature profiles of the airwater interface in Lake Kinneret and Lake Binaba. It was shown that the usage of DTS measurements for the verification of surface energy balance was applicable for Lake Kinneret, but probably not suitable for the conditions in the shallow Lake Binaba. In the latter, heat storage changes near the lake surface were not only caused by surface energy fluxes, but by internal heat waves and currents that bring cooler water to the upper layer. © 2013, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875526313

In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed to investigate the thermal behavior of a greenhouse heated by a hybrid solar collector system. This hybrid system contains an evacuated tube solar heat collector unit, an auxiliary fossil fuel heating unit, a hot water storage unit, control and piping units. A Matlab/Simulink based model and software has been developed to predict the storage water temperature, greenhouse indoor temperature and the amount of auxiliary fuel, as a function of various design parameters of the greenhouse such as location, dimensions, and meteorological data of the region. As a case study, a greenhouse located in ŞanlIurfa/Turkey has been simulated based on recent meteorological data and aforementioned hybrid system. The results of simulations performed on an annual basis indicate that revising the existing fossil fuel system with the proposed hybrid system, is economically feasible for most cases, however it requires a slightly longer payback period than expected. On the other hand, by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions significantly, it has a considerable positive environmental impact. The developed dynamic simulation method can be further used for designing heating systems for various solar greenhouses and optimizing the solar collector and thermal storage sizes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The fusion reaction does not produce radioactive nuclides and it is not self-sustaining, as is a fission reaction when a critical mass of fissionable material is assembled. Since the fusion reaction is easily and quickly quenched the primary sources of heat to drive such an accident are heat from radioactive decay and heat from chemical reactions. Both the magnitude and time dependence of the generation of heat from radioactive decay can be controlled by proper selection and design of materials. Tantalum is one of the candidate materials for the first wall of fusion reactors and for component parts of irradiation chambers. Accurate experimental cross-section data of alpha induced reactions on Tantalum are also of great importance for thermonuclear reaction rate determinations since the models used in the study of stellar nucleosynthesis are strongly dependent on these rates (Santos et al. in J Phys G 26:301, 2000). In this study, neutron-production cross sections for target nuclei 181Ta have been investigated up to 100 MeV alpha energy. The excitation functions for (α, xn) reactions (x = 1, 2, 3) have been calculated by pre-equilibrium reaction mechanism. And also neutron emission spectra for 181Ta (α, xn) reactions at 26.8 and 45.2 MeV have been calculated. The mean free path multiplier parameters has been investigated.

Plasma pinching is accompanied by the generation of a beam of multicharged ions of the cathode material (aluminum) up to Al8+. The maximum energies of ions obey the scaling relation E max = 5ZeU 0 that has been obtained previously for a low-voltage discharge.

The results obtained demonstrated that the iron content in patient's spleen in the form of iron storage proteins was about ten times larger than that in normal tissue. However, in the case of patient with primary myelofibrosis the magnetic anisotropy energy barrier differed from that in normal case and, probably, the iron core size was supposed to be slightly larger than that in both normal spleen tissue and normal human liver ferritin in contrast to well-known data for iron overload in patients with thalassemia accompanied by the iron-core size increase. Therefore, the iron overload in the case of patient with primary myelofibrosis may be related to increase in the ferritin content mainly.

Vegetable oils are recognised as suitable alternatives to fish oil (FO) in feed for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) but introduce high amounts of LA in the salmon fillet. The effect on fish consumers of such a replacement remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigate the effect of excessive dietary LA from soyabean oil (SO) on endocannabinoid levels in Atlantic salmon and mice, and study the metabolic effects in mice when SO replaces FO in feed for Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon were fed FO and SO for 6 months, and the salmon fillet was used to produce feed for mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed diets of 35 % of energy as fat based on FO-and SO-enriched salmon for 16 weeks. We found that replacing FO with SO in feed for Atlantic salmon increased LA, arachidonic acid (AA), decreased EPA and DHA, elevated the endocannabinoids 2- arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), and increased TAG accumulation in the salmon liver. In mice, the SO salmon diet increased LA and AA and decreased EPA and DHA in the liver and erythrocyte phospholipids, and elevated 2-AG and AEA associated with increased feed efficiency, weight gain and adipose tissue inflammation compared with mice fed the FO salmon diet. In conclusion, excessive dietary LA elevates endocannabinoids in the liver of salmon and mice, and increases weight gain and counteracts the anti-inflammatory properties of EPA and DHA in mice. © 2012 The Authors.","2-Arachidonoylglycerol; Anandamide; Atlantic salmon; Inflammation; Linoleic acid; Obesity","2 arachidonoylglycerol; anandamide; arachidonic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; fish oil; icosapentaenoic acid; linoleic acid; phospholipid; soybean oil; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; Atlantic salmon; controlled study; erythrocyte; fat intake; inflammation; lipid storage; liver; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Analysis of Variance; Animal Feed; Animals; Arachidonic Acids; Dietary Fats; Endocannabinoids; Fish Oils; Inflammation; Linoleic Acid; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Salmo salar; Soybean Oil; Weight Gain; Mus; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876241856

Perilipin 5 (Plin5) is expressed in cardiac muscle (CM) and has been shown to interact with ATGL and its coactivator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58). Furthermore, ectopic Plin5 expression increases cellular TG content and Plin5-deficient mice exhibit reduced cardiac TG levels. In this study we show that mice with cardiac muscle-specific overexpression of perilipin 5 (CM-Plin5) massively accumulate TG in CM, which is accompanied by moderately reduced fatty acid (FA) oxidizing gene expression levels. Cardiac lipid droplet (LD) preparations from CM of CM-Plin5 mice showed reduced ATGLand hormone-sensitive lipase-mediated TG mobilization implying that Plin5 overexpression restricts cardiac lipolysis via the formation of a lipolytic barrier. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed TG hydrolytic activities in preparations of Plin5-, ATGL-, and CGI-58-transfected cells. In vitro ATGLmediated TG hydrolysis of an artificial micellar TG substrate was not inhibited by the presence of Plin5, whereas Plin5-coated LDs were resistant toward ATGL-mediated TG catabolism. These findings strongly suggest that Plin5 functions as a lipolytic barrier to protect the cardiac TG pool from uncontrolled TG mobilization and the excessive release of free FAs.

The primary goal is to elucidate the validity of each particular method applied to linear molecules that have different rotational constants but which are perturbed by the same atom. Vibration-rotational electric dipole absorption spectra of CO2, C2H2, CO, HCl and HF molecules perturbed by an Ar atom are examined at room temperature. The most accurate vibrationally independent potential energy surfaces (PESs) are applied to all molecular pairs. The following theoretical approaches are involved in cross-examination: two classical schemes (exact C3D and C3Diso) and four semiclassical formalisms (NG-of Neilsen and Gordon, PA-peaking approximation, SGC-of Smith, Giraud and Cooper, and RB-of Robert and Bonamy). Identical ""exact"" isotropic trajectories, driven by only the isotropic part of the PES, are used in C3Diso and in all semiclassical calculations. The comparison is made with experimental data as well as with benchmark quantum dynamical results obtained in the same conditions within close coupling and coupled states schemes. Quantum results reproduced the experimental data excellently in all cases considered, which is as it should be if the interaction PES is accurate. An exact classical C3D approach displays good results for all molecules. By contrast, NG, PA and SGC semiclassical formalisms seriously underestimate line broadening for molecules with small rotational constants (CO2, C2H2 and, to a lesser extent, CO), mainly due to the use of isotropic trajectories in these schemes. The RB method strongly overestimates line broadening for the majority of values of the rotational quantum number J for all molecules studied. The only exception is the case of HF molecules at high J values, where PA, SGC and RB semiclassical schemes provide good results, coinciding well with quantum CC calculations for J&gt;3. Mean overall magnitudes of relative errors, taking an average over all J values and all five molecules studied and of the methods considered are C3D-11%, C3Diso-14%, NG-14%, PA-12%, SGC-14% and RB-21%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accuracy; Classical and semiclassical methods; Collisional line broadening; Half-widths; Linear molecules; Trajectory calculations","Accuracy; Half-widths; Line broadening; Linear molecules; Semiclassical methods; Trajectory calculations; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Molecules; absorption; accuracy assessment; benchmarking; comparative study; experimental study; model validation; precision; spectral analysis; theoretical study; vibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875547208

The XPS valence-band spectrum as well as the XES Zr Lβ2,15, Fe Lα and O K α bands are measured for Zr4Fe2O 0.6 oxide. Our APW+LO calculations show that the O 2p-like states make the major contributions at the bottom of the valence band, whilst the Fe 3d- and Zr 4d-like states are the dominant contributors at the top of the valence band and at the bottom of the conduction band of Zr4Fe 2O. Peculiarities of the occupation of the valence band of Zr 4Fe2O predicted by the APW+LO calculations are confirmed experimentally by comparison, on the common energy scale, of the XPS valence-band spectrum and the XES bands representing the energy distributions of the Zr 4d-, Fe 3d- and O 2p-like states in the compound under consideration.

Pmch-deficient rodents are lean and smaller, characterized by lower food intake, body-, and fat mass. Pmch is expressed in hypothalamic neurons that ultimately are components in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) drive to white and interscapular brown adipose tissue (WAT, iBAT, respectively). MCH binds to MCH receptor 1 (MCH1R), which is present on adipocytes. Currently it is unknown if Pmch-ablation changes adipocyte differentiation or sympathetic adipose drive. Using Pmch-deficient and wild-type rats on a standard low-fat diet, we analyzed dorsal subcutaneous and perirenal WAT mass and adipocyte morphology (size and number) throughout development, and indices of sympathetic activation in WAT and iBAT during adulthood. Moreover, using an in vitro approach we investigated the ability of MCH to modulate 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Pmch-deficiency decreased dorsal subcutaneous and perirenal WAT mass by reducing adipocyte size, but not number. In line with this, in vitro 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation was unaffected by MCH. Finally, adult Pmch-deficient rats had lower norepinephrine turnover (an index of sympathetic adipose drive) in WAT and iBAT than wild-type rats. Collectively, our data indicate that MCH/MCH1R-pathway does not modify adipocyte differentiation, whereas Pmch-deficiency in laboratory rats lowers adiposity throughout development and sympathetic adipose drive during adulthood. © 2013 Mul et al.",,"melanin concentrating hormone; melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1; noradrenalin; adipocyte; adulthood; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body mass; brown adipose tissue; catecholamine metabolism; cell count; cell differentiation; cell maturation; cell size; cell structure; controlled study; dorsal subcutaneous white adipose tissue; energy balance; epididymal white adipose tissue; hormone action; in vitro study; interscapular brown adipose tissue; lipid storage; nonhuman; noradrenalin release; perirenal white adipose tissue; signal transduction; sympathetic adipose drive; sympathetic function; sympathetic tone; white adipose tissue; wild type; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Hypothalamic Hormones; Melanins; Mice; Pituitary Hormones; Rats; Sympathetic Nervous System; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875465517

Power electronic converters are modeled by nonlinear averaging methods to suit system-level studies. A unified model for bidirectional converters is proposed to avoid transitions between two separate models.

Many conventional photoswichable molecules could be considered as solar thermal fuels, although they suffer from low energy density or short lifetime in the photoinduced high-energy metastable state, rendering their practical use unfeasible. We present a new approach to the design of chemistries for solar thermal fuel applications, wherein well-known photoswitchable molecules are connected by different linker agents to form molecular rings. This approach allows for a significant increase in both the amount of stored energy per molecule and the stability of the fuels.

Current genotyping technologies such as Sequenom iPLEX, ABI TaqMan and KBioscience KASPar made the genotyping of huge SNP sets in large populations straightforward and allow the generation of hundreds of thousands of genotypes even in medium sized labs. While data generation is straightforward, the subsequent data conversion, storage and quality control steps are time-consuming, error-prone and require extensive bioinformatic support. In order to ease this tedious process, we developed SNPflow. SNPflow is a lightweight, intuitive and easily deployable application, which processes genotype data from Sequenom MassARRAY (iPLEX) and ABI 7900HT (TaqMan, KASPar) systems and is extendible to other genotyping methods as well. SNPflow automatically converts the raw output files to ready-to-use genotype lists, calculates all standard quality control values such as call rate, expected and real amount of replicates, minor allele frequency, absolute number of discordant replicates, discordance rate and the p-value of the HWE test, checks the plausibility of the observed genotype frequencies by comparing them to HapMap/1000-Genomes, provides a module for the processing of SNPs, which allow sex determination for DNA quality control purposes and, finally, stores all data in a relational database. SNPflow runs on all common operating systems and comes as both stand-alone version and multi-user version for laboratory-wide use.

Although several building composite PCMs (BCPCMs) have been developed in recent years, the additional investigations are still required to enrich the diversity of BCPCMs for solar heating and energy conservation applications in buildings. For this purpose, the present work is focused the preparation, characterization and determination of 10 new kinds of BCPCMs. The BCPCMs were prepared by blending of liquid xylitol pentalaurate (XPL) and xylitol pentamyristate (XPM) esters with gypsum, cement, diatomite, perlite and vermiculite as supporting matrices. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis showed that the ester compounds were adsorbed uniformly into the building materials due to capillary forces. The highest adsorption ratio of XPL ester into gypsum, cement, perlite, diatomite, and vermiculite were found to be 20, 19, 71, 52 and 40 wt.%, respectively while it was found to be 22, 25, 66, 50 and 41 wt.% for XPM ester, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicated that the melting temperatures and latent heat energy storage capacities of the prepared BCPCMs are in range of about 40-55°C and 31-126 J/g, respectively. Thermogravimetric (TG) investigations showed that the BCPCMs had good thermal endurance even above their phase change temperatures. The BCPCMs exhibited almost same chemical and phase change characteristics after 1000 thermal cycling test. It can be also concluded that especially the BCPCMs perlite, vermiculite, diatomite content were found to better candidates for thermal energy storage applications in buildings due to the fact that they have relatively higher heat storage capacity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this system, air is compressed in a cavern when power prices are low, and this air is used to run a natural gas-fired turbine to generate power when prices go up, with the aim of profiting from the price difference. This type of system can independently compress air, generate electricity, or do both. However, the prices of electricity and natural gas fluctuate, which directly impacts the amount of revenue that can be made, and this requires the calculating of estimates to optimize operation strategies and maximize profit. For these reasons, this is a crucial energy storage technology that requires economic analyses to justify investment decisions in power markets. In this paper, a mixed integer programming method is developed to schedule the operation of the system for forward market prices that are estimated using a markov-based probabilistic model. Then an algorithm that includes two separate modules in a simulation is employed to optimize the annual operation of the system. The paper presents a case study for Turkey as well as economic analyses based on probabilistic forward prices and the profits obtained from the optimization module. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Salinity is responsible for other stresses such as ion toxicity, and nutrient imbalances. During the development of salt stress within the plant, all the major processes such as photosynthesis, protein synthesis, energy and lipid metabolisms are affected. In terms of salinity tolerance, plants are classified as halophytes, which can grow and reproduce under high salinity (>400 mM NaCl), and glycophytes, which cannot survive high salinity. Most of the grain crops and vegetables like bean, eggplant, corn, potato and sugarcane are natrophobic (glycophytes) and are highly susceptible to soil salinity. Among physiological responses to abiotic stresses, the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) - a sesquiterpenoid with one (C-1) asymmetric carbon plays an important role. The accumulation of ABA in response to water or salt stress is a cell signaling process, encompassing initial stress signal perception, cellular signal transduction and regulation of expression of genes encoding key enzymes in ABA biosynthesis and catabolism. This phytohormone plays a dual roles in its physiological regulation. It exhibits inhibitive functions when it is accumulated in large amount under stress to help plant survival through inhibition of processes such as stomatal opening and plant size expansion. Moreover ABA is involved in the inhibition of ethylene production, which is a growth inhibitor under stress. At low concentration it exhibits promoting influence while at 'normal' conditions, the metabolite has been shown essential for vegetative growth in several organs, e.g., primary root growth and post-germination seedling development. Also, in seeds ABA modulates the biosynthesis of storage components such as lipids and proteins. The amount of active ABA can be regulated by synthesis, conjugation and catabolism. The present review will throw light on role of ABA in signal transduction under salt stress. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Laboratories studies have suggested that reduced ice cover may reduce the survival of stream dwelling fishes in Northern environments. This, however, has not been empirically investigated in natural populations in large rivers. Here, we examine how the winter survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon in a large natural river, the River Alta (Norway, 70°N), is affected by the presence or absence of surface ice. Apparent survival rates for size classes corresponding to parr and presmolts were estimated using capture-mark-recapture and Cormack-Jolly-Seber models for an ice-covered and an ice-free site. Apparent survival (Φ) in the ice-covered site was greater than in the ice-free site, but did not depend on size class (0.64 for both parr and presmolt). In contrast, apparent survival in the ice-free site was lower for larger individuals (0.33) than smaller individuals (0.45). The over-winter decline in storage energy was greater for the ice-free site than the ice-covered site, suggesting that environmental conditions in the ice-free site caused a strong depletion in energy reserves likely affecting survival. Our findings highlight the importance of surface ice for the winter survival of juvenile fish, thus, underpinning that climate change, by reducing ice cover, may have a negative effect on the survival of fish adapted to ice-covered habitats during winter. © 2013 The Authors.

The purpose is to identify the environmental impacts occurring along the wine life cycle as well as the stages that mostly contribute to the environmental impact, as well as the associated causes. The stages considered include: (1) viticulture, (2) wine production (vinification to storage), (3) wine distribution and (4) bottles production. Methods: The consumption of materials and energy, as well as the emissions to air, soil and water from the wine campaign of 2008/2009 were reported to the functional unit (0.75 l of white vinho verde). A Portuguese company that produces about 25 % of the current total production of white vinho verde supplied specific life cycle data for the stages of viticulture, wine production and distribution. SimaPro and the Ecoinvent database were used to perform the environmental assessment using CML 2001 impact methodology. A sensitivity analysis for a set of significant parameters was performed. Results: Results show that for viticulture the contribution of each impact category is larger than 50 %. The production of bottles is the second contributor varying from about 4 % (to eutrophication) to 26 % (to acidification). Wine production and distribution are the subsequent contributors. The contribution of wine production varies between 0.6 % (to land competition) and about 13 % (from marine aquatic and sediment ecotoxicity 100a). The contribution of distribution is up to 14 % (to photochemical oxidation). Sensitivity analysis shows that significant changes are calculated for parameters as the nitrate leaching to groundwater, the emission of nitrous oxide from managed soil, and from runoff and leaching. Changes in these parameters are significant for only a few impact categories as eutrophication and global warming. Conclusions: Viticulture is the stage with the largest relative contribution to the overall environmental impact and the bottle production is the subsequent stage. In order to improve the environmental performance of the supply chain for wine, it is necessary to optimise the dosage of fertilisers and phytosanitary products used during viticulture. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the most influential parameters relate with the emission of nitrogen compounds associated with the use of fertilisers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Distribution; Fertilisers; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Phytosanitary products; Viticulture; White wine","acetamide aniline; ammonia; aniline derivative; barium; benzene; chemical compound; chlorofluorocarbon; dichlorodifluoromethane; diesel fuel; formaldehyde; glyphosate; ground water; nickel; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; phenexamid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; vanadium; zinc; abiotic depletion; acidification; agricultural procedures; article; biofuel production; biotechnological production; carbon footprint; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; fertilizer application; food availability; food handling; food storage; glass bottle; greenhouse effect; land use; life cycle assessment; nitrate leaching; ozone depletion; photooxidation; Portugal; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; viticulture; white wine; wine industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878586059

The burning products of solid fuel form a supersonic flow injected through the nozzle into the diffuser chamber having input for the water component ejected from the storage. High values of temperature and pressure at stagnation point impart the substantial kinetic energy to the flow, which provides the atomization of water droplets into mist spray. Since the water evaporation occurs already in the diffuser chamber due to the high temperature of input gas flow, the droplet size is gradually decreases to the lower limit value that could ever exist. The presence of vapor phase enlarges the volume of fire extinguishing jet allowing it to operate as a flooding agent (along with the effect of heat consumption due to water evaporation) at the very beginning of fire suppression process, much before the water droplets evaporation by the flame itself. Proposed technique of the water mist production has showed noticeable fire suppression capability through the series of testing application to the gasoline and wood model fire sources. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Fire suppression; Gas generator; Solid propellant; Water mist","Fire suppression; Fire-extinguishing; Lower limit value; Solid propellant gas generators; Temperature and pressures; Water evaporation; Water mist; Water mist sprays; Evaporation; Fire extinguishers; Fuels; Gas generators; Kinetics; Phase transitions; Solid propellants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875056837

However, the required higher production level of herbivores questions the sustainability of this conversion. An increase in herbivore production can be achieved by increasing the number of animals associated with the increasing demand of plant biomass or by improving the efficiency with which plant biomass is converted into meat and milk. The potential to increase food production by cattle, the main food-producing herbivore in the temperate zones outside China, was considered in three production systems: grassland-based, mixed rain-fed and mixed irrigated systems. The potential to increase plant biomass production in grassland-based systems seems limited, unless fertiliser is imported in large quantities and crop production is increased, sacrificing valuable, high-quality grasslands, which often conflicts with sustainable production methods. Also, in mixed systems with high inputs of fertiliser or water, improvements in plant biomass production seem marginal and the main challenges for these systems are in breeding high-quality plant biomass at lower levels of fertiliser and the use of new co-products from food processing and bio-based economies. Consequently, the main challenge in herbivore nutrition management is to improve the efficiency of plant biomass utilisation. Stocking rate management along with seasonal variation in the grazing capacity of grasslands and moderate use of fertiliser may increase meat production in grassland-based systems by 400%. Improving plant biomass utilisation in the more industrialised mixed rain-fed systems seems possible by better feed storage technologies and for dairy cattle by improving animal health and lifetime production level. Managing the transition period seems crucial to achieve more sustainable mixed rain-fed and mixed irrigated dairy production systems. Whether sustainable production methods will be implemented also depends on macro-economic conditions and awareness of regional and global environmental concerns. © 2011 The Animal Consortium.","herbivores; nutrient efficiency; nutrition; sustainability","fossil fuel; animal; animal food; animal husbandry; biomass; climate; climate change; conference paper; economics; herbivory; livestock; physiology; plant; time; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Biomass; Climate; Climate Change; Fossil Fuels; Herbivory; Livestock; Plants; Time Factors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874905884

In this study, the optimum insulation thicknesses, insulation-energy costs, and savings resulting from the use of these insulations is calculated in cities selected from four different climate zones in Turkey for four various insulation materials such as foamboard, extruded polystyrene (XPS), rock wool, and expanded polystyrene (EPS) in cold storage applications. Calculations show that rock wool insulation material yields the highest savings. Optimum insulation thicknesses vary between 0.074 and 0.159 m, energy savings vary between 30.59 and 80.61 $/m2, and payback periods for investment cost vary between 3.15 and 3.73 years for the cooling. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cooling cost; Energy saving; Optimum insulation thickness","Cooling applications; Cooling costs; Energy cost; Expanded polystyrene; External walls; Extruded polystyrene(XPS); Insulation materials; Investment costs; Large parts; Optimum insulation thickness; Payback periods; Rock wool; Save energy; Cold storage; Costs; Energy conservation; Insulating materials; Investments; Mineral wool; Permafrost; Polystyrenes; Insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874600935

Large fluctuations on demand during summer, winter, and 24-h period in combination with the technical restrictions of diesel generators of the existing conventional power stations are a major concern of power supply system. Reversing the roles of diesel generators and wind farms (WFs), to use WF as the basic energy source and diesel generators as stand-by system changed in fact the whole philosophy of energy supply systems in islands and created perspectives for the fundamental reformation of the conventional energy supply systems in autonomous grids. In fact, methods of contemporary interim medium term energy storage are investigated for hybrid systems in order to adjust the stochastic behavior of wind energy to the demand, to provide the system with guaranteed power. This Wind-Hydro Plants in combination with the most adequate RES forming an Renewable Energy Supply System (RESS), increase further the economical penetration of RES into autonomous grids up to 90% or even 100% and simultaneously reduce drastically the fuel costs.

The purpose is twofold: 1) although a single renewable generator at one site produces intermittent power, we seek combinations of diverse renewables at diverse sites, with storage, that are not intermittent and satisfy need a given fraction of hours. And 2) we seek minimal cost, calculating true cost of electricity without subsidies and with inclusion of external costs. Our model evaluated over 28 billion combinations of renewables and storage, each tested over 35,040 h (four years) of load and weather data. We find that the least cost solutions yield seemingly-excessive generation capacity - at times, almost three times the electricity needed to meet electrical load. This is because diverse renewable generation and the excess capacity together meet electric load with less storage, lowering total system cost. At 2030 technology costs and with excess electricity displacing natural gas, we find that the electric system can be powered 90%-99.9% of hours entirely on renewable electricity, at costs comparable to today's - but only if we optimize the mix of generation and storage technologies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Hazelnut shells (HS), an abundant agricultural biomass, were pre-carbonized to hydrophilic and thermochemically more stable hydrochar (HH) under hydrothermal conditions. Successive calcination of HH under inert atmosphere yielded a hydrophobic nanoarchitectured carbon material with a 250 m2 g-1 specific surface area (HH-T) while the same procedure in the presence of a porogen yielded a highly porous hydrophilic carbon material with a specific surface area of 1700 m2 g -1 (HH-KT). The batch-equilibrium and batch-kinetic methylene blue dye (MB) adsorption experiments, in aqueous solutions revealed that the HH-KT exhibits adsorption rates and capacities higher than biomass-derived activated carbons obtained by traditional routes. Monolayer adsorption capacity and pseudo-second order kinetic rate constant, as high as 524 mg g-1 and 0.052 g mg-1 min-1 were recorded for HH-KT, respectively. HH-KT, with its honeycomb-like structure dominated by micropores and mesopores, high pore volume, and appropriate surface functionality to anchor basic dyes, proves ideal for adsorption of polar organic pollutants from aqueous solutions.

Up to 4.4 vol %, SWCNTs could be incorporated using an in situ polymerization method. Nanocomposites prepared from aBPDA-P3, a nonlinear matrix polymer with a Tg of 230 C, remains amorphous, and the presence of the SWCNTs reduces the Tg by 11 C. No effect on E′ or stress-strain behavior was observed. When ODPA-P3 was used as the matrix, the SWCNTs appear to be highly compatible with this more linear polymer host. The SWCNTs act as a nucleating agent at concentrations as low as 0.1 vol %. XRD and TEM measurements show that the SWCNTs become embedded in a highly crystalline polymer matrix. The result is a significant change in thermomechanical properties. The polymer Tg was increased by 12 C, from 196 to 208 C, and due to the induced crystallinity, the modulus above Tg showed a dramatic increase. The neat polymer fails at T g, but the 4.4 vol % nanocomposite shows a storage modulus of 1 GPa at 280 C. Stress-strain measurements show a noticeable improvement in strain and toughness at low SWCNT loadings (0.1-0.3 wt %), which is indicative of good stress transfer between the SWCNTs and polymer matrix. At higher loadings the yield strength increases from 80 to 126 MPa at 4.5% strain. Our findings show that the poly(ether imide) backbone geometry determines whether the polymer is good host for SWCNTs. The more linear ODPA-P3 is able to maximize its interaction with the SWCNT surface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an amorphous polymer has been shown to develop a semicrystalline morphology in the presence of SWCNTs. Steric factors in aBPDA-P3 seem to inhibit favorable π-π interactions and prevent the polymer chains from adapting low-energy conformations that readily interact with the SWCNT surface. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Amorphous polymers; Backbone geometry; Crystalline polymers; Crystallinities; In-situ polymerization; Induced crystallization; Linear polymers; Low-energy conformations; Neat polymer; Nonlinear matrix; Nucleating agents; Polymer chains; Semicrystallines; Steric factor; Strength increase; Stress transfer; Stress-strain behaviors; Stress-strain measurement; Thermomechanical properties; XRD; Ethers; Matrix algebra; Nanocomposites; Organic compounds; Stress-strain curves; Polymer matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874401077

The series and parallel active filter (AF) of 3P4L USPAF system are realized by four-leg voltage source inverters (VSIs) to a common dc-link capacitor. Due to its high power density, the UCES is well-suited to supply high power for short period of time. The objective of this paper is to enhance the unbalanced voltage sag mitigating capability of the 3P4L USPAF system by adding UCES, directly connected in the dc-link. This is achieved by injecting energy from the UCES to maintain the dc-link voltage constant. Thus, the proposed system is capable of mitigating unbalanced voltage sag with zero-sequence component in the source voltage and compensating harmonic, reactive power and unbalanced current of the load in 3P4W distribution systems. The proposed scheme is validated by an experimental prototype with a 1.93 F UCES bank and using dSPACE DS1103 real-time control platform in the laboratory. The experimental results show that the combined system offer improved performance to maintain the load voltage constant at its rated value during unbalanced voltage sag in the supply voltage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The ejection process for double-stranded DNA phages has been studied thoroughly in vitro, where after triggering with the cellular receptor the genome ejects into a buffer. The experimental data have been interpreted in terms of the decrease in free energy of the densely packed DNA associated with genome ejection. Here we detail a simple model of genome ejection in terms of the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures inside the phage, a bacterium, and a buffer solution or culture medium. We argue that the hydrodynamic flow associated with the water movement from the buffer solution into the phage capsid and further drainage into the bacterial cytoplasm, driven by the osmotic gradient between the bacterial cytoplasm and culture medium, provides an alternative mechanism for phage genome ejection in vivo; the mechanism is perfectly consistent with phage genome ejection in vitro. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,"Bacterial cytoplasm; Buffer solutions; Cellular receptors; Critical steps; Culture medium; Double stranded DNA; Ejection process; Experimental datum; Hydrodynamic flows; In-vitro; In-vivo; Osmotic gradients; Water movements; Bacteria; Bacteriophages; Cells; Cytology; Digital storage; Hydrodynamics; Hydrostatic pressure; Osmosis; Genes; virus DNA; article; bacteriophage; bacterium; biological model; chemistry; computer simulation; genetics; hydrostatic pressure; osmotic pressure; virology; virus genome; virus uncoating; Bacteria; Bacteriophages; Computer Simulation; DNA, Viral; Genome, Viral; Hydrostatic Pressure; Models, Biological; Osmotic Pressure; Virus Uncoating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874541533

We found that the properties of SIS′FS junctions fall into two distinct classes based on the thickness of S′ layer. We fabricate Nb-Al/AlOx-Nb-PdFe-Nb SIS′FS MJJs using a co-processing approach with a combination of HYPRES and ISSP fabrication processes. The resultant SIS′FS structure with thin superconducting S′-layer is substantially affected by the ferromagnetic layer as a whole. We fabricate these type of junctions to reach the device compatibility with conventional SIS junctions used for superconducting SFQ electronics to ensure a seamless integration of MJJ-based circuits and SIS JJ-based ultra-fast digital SFQ circuits. We report experimental results for MJJs, demonstrating their applicability for superconducting memory and digital circuits. These MJJs exhibit IcRn product only ∼30% lower than that of conventional SIS junctions co-produced in the same fabrication.

Ensiling, which involves the production of acid by lactic acid bacteria, is often used to preserve crops cheaply. Biogas substrates are also often fibrous, which can make them difficult to mix and means that some of their energy is locked up within the fibres. Different pre-treatment technologies are being investigated to access the energy in these fibres, to increase the rate of biogas production and to improve the mixing qualities of the substrates. Pre-treatment technologies are based on three principles: physical (including mechanical shear, heat, pressure and electric fields), chemical (acids, bases and solvents) and biological (microbial and enzymatic). Combinations of these principles are also used, including steam explosion, extrusion and thermo-chemical processes. Although many of these processes have been investigated at small scale, few have been analysed at large scale in un-biased studies. Many of these techniques are associated with high energy input (e.g. mechanical and heat pre-treatment), high equipment costs (e.g. mechanical systems where the blades erode) or use large volumes of chemicals (e.g. alkali pre-treatment). Different pre-treatment technologies work better with different substrates, and more research is required in this field to understand which combinations are worthwhile.

Therefore there is a growing need for energy storage. With power-to-gas, excess electricity is converted into hydrogen by water electrolysis, which can be stored and, when needed, can be reconverted into electricity with fuel cells. Besides the energy vector for electricity, mobility and heat, hydrogen can be utilized as a raw material for the chemical industry or further be used for the synthesis of various hydrocarbon fuels such as methane. This article is an international review of numerous power-to-gas pilot plants that have either already been realized or are being planned. It provides information about their installed components and capacities as well as about operating experience that has been had with them. In many of the projects it was concluded that the design and sizing, control strategy and system integration of the power-to-gas plants have a great influence on their overall efficiency, reliability and economics. Topics for further research are the improvement of the efficiency, reliability, lifetime and costs of electrolyzers and fuel cells and better ways of dealing with power sources. In order to improve the overall performance, the reduction of auxiliary equipment and the continuous long-term operation of power-to-gas pilot plants will be necessary. The further development of codes and standards for permits to operate, as well as of hydrogen components and control strategies, would bring additional benefits for power-to-gas systems. It is also recommended that optimum system configurations and components be determined with regard to the available infrastructure and the type of application involved.

Mammals store energy reserves for the whole body within adipocytes, highly specialized cells of adipose tissue. Under conditions of excess nutrient intake, energy is stored as triacylglycerides within intracellular lipid storage droplets. When energy demand exceeds intake, adipocytes respond by hydrolyzing triacylglycerides and releasing the stored energy into systemic circulation as free fatty acids and glycerol. Processes that balance adipose energy storage and release are tightly regulated, with inhibitory and stimulatory hormones acting on cell surface receptors of responsive adipocytes. Perilipin protein Plin1 localizes at the surface of lipid droplets in adipocytes and regulates lipolytic activity, hydrolysis of triacylglycerides. Differential transmembrane signaling defines the phosphorylation state of Plin1; unphosphorylated Plin1 restricts access of the hydrolytic lipases to lipid droplets and suppresses lipolysis, whereas phosphorylated Plin1 recruits activated lipases such as adipocyte triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase to lipid droplet surfaces. These latter events activate lipolytic activity in vivo 50-100-fold in comparison to quiescent, unstimulated adipocytes. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We address both continuous and discrete operational modes of computation based on the energy source's charging profile. Unlike other reported works where investigations are limited to wireless energy transfer and functional demonstrations, our aim is to develop a theoretical model that comprises the complete system architecture by combining energy transfer and consumption in a step-by-step manner. We show that field resilience operation in a wireless energy field can be incorporated by modulating the power consumption in the digital platform in response to changing energy fields using this analysis.

One of the main demands that consumers display is for minimally processed, high-nutrition/low-energy natural foods with no or minimal chemical preservatives. The nutritional value of raspberry fruit is widely recognized. In particular, red raspberries are known to demonstrate a strong antioxidant capacity that might prove beneficial to human health by preventing free radical-induced oxidative stress. However, food products that are consumed raw, are increasingly being recognized as important vehicles for transmission of human pathogens. Food irradiation is one of the few technologies that address both food quality and safety by virtue of its ability to control spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms without significantly affecting sensory or other organoleptic attributes of the food. Food irradiation is well established as a physical, nonthermal treatment (cold pasteurization) that processes foods at or nearly at ambient temperature in the final packaging, reducing the possibility of cross contamination until the food is actually used by the consumer. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of gamma radiation on raspberries in order to assess consequences of irradiation. Freshly packed raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.) were irradiated in a 60Co source at several doses (0.5, 1, or 1.5 kGy). Bioburden, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, physicochemical properties such as texture, color, pH, soluble solids content, and acidity, and sensorial parameters were assessed before and after irradiation and during storage time up to 14 d at 4°C. Characterization of raspberries microbiota showed an average bioburden value of 104 colony-forming units (CFU)/g and a diverse microbial population predominantly composed of two morphological types (gram-negative, oxidase-negative rods, 35%, and filamentous fungi, 41%). The inactivation studies on the raspberries mesophilic population indicated a one log reduction of microbial load (95% inactivation efficiency for 1.5 kGy), in the surviving population mainly constituted by filamentous fungi (79-98%). The total phenolic content of raspberries indicated an increase with radiation doses and a decrease with storage time. The same trend was found for raspberries' antioxidant capacity with storage time. Regarding raspberries physicochemical properties, irradiation induced a significant decrease in firmness compared with nonirradiated fruit. However, nonirradiated and irradiated fruit presented similar physicochemical and sensory properties during storage time. Further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of irradiation as a raspberries treatment process. © 2013 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"cobalt 60; phenol; acidity; antioxidant activity; article; body burden; controlled study; food color; food irradiation; food texture; fungus; gamma radiation; Gram negative bacterium; microflora; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; radiation dose; raspberry; storage temperature; Antioxidants; Colony Count, Microbial; Food Irradiation; Food Microbiology; Food Preservation; Fruit; Gamma Rays; Phenols; Rosaceae; Fungi; Negibacteria; Rubus glaucus; Rubus idaeus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876154162

Improvement and proper choice of energy sources is a prerequisite to achieving lower carbon emission. Turkey's prime energy sources and carbon emission is given comparatively with France and Germany. It is shown that Turkey's electrical energy generation is largely due to thermal power plants, which require carbon capture and storage units to lower CO2 emissions in order to meet the Kyoto criteria. An electrical energy consumption model for the future is forecasted using exponential smoothing. Predicated on this model and applying penalty to large carbon emission sources, an optimal allocation of energy sources is determined for minimum operating costs. The results obtained demonstrated that the future electrical energy requirement can be compensated with the help of nuclear power plants as well as carbon capture and storage units to be built for thermal power plants. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","carbon capture and storage cost; Kyoto Protocol; Turkey's electrical energy policy","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon emissions; CO2 emissions; Electrical energy; Electrical energy consumption; Electrical energy supply; Energy source; Exponential smoothing; KYOTO protocol; Optimal allocation; Thermal power plants; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Nuclear power plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Energy policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872484183

The application of such combined pulses with widely variable prepulse and high-power pulse power and energy ratios is of interest in the research area of electronic hardware vulnerability. The characteristics of output radiation pulses are controlled by the variation of the H-plane tee transition attenuation at the stage of microwave energy storage in the compressor cavity. Results of theoretical estimations of the parameters tuning range and experimental investigations of the prototype S-band compressor (1.5 MW, 12 ns output pulse; ∼13.2 dB gain) are presented. The achievable maximum in the prepulse power is found to be about half the power of the primary microwave source. It has been shown that the energy of the prepulse becomes comparable with that of the short-duration (nanosecond) pulse, while the power of the latter decreases insignificantly.

The composite was redox conducting at both positive and negative potentials due to the Fc/Fc+ and C60-/C60 electrode process of the ferrocene and fullerene moiety of the dyad, respectively. The composite was prepared, first, by electrophoretic deposition of a film of noncovalently modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid stacked single-wall carbon nanotubes (pyr-SWCNTs). Then, this film was coated, by potentiodynamic electropolymerization, with a film of the palladium-doped polymer of 2′-ferrocenylfulleropyrrolidine (C60Fc-Pd). The AFM imaging showed that the C60Fc-Pd film was uniformly built of 40-150 nm diameter globules of C60Fc-Pd while the film formed a tangle of pyr-SWCNTs bundles wrapped with clusters of ∼45 nm diameter globules of C60Fc-Pd. The XPS measurements identified interactions between the Pd and C60 moieties in C60Fc-Pd. The electrochemical and viscoelastic properties of the pyr-SWCNTs/(C60Fc-Pd) film in a blank acetonitrile solution of tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate favorably compared to those of the C60Fc-Pd film as disclosed by simultaneous cyclic voltammetry (CV) and piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) measurements. Specific capacitance (Cs) of the pyr-SWCNTs/(C60Fc-Pd) film was higher than that of the C60Fc-Pd film and for positive charging its maximum value was Cs,max ≅ 300 F g-1. The EIS measurements revealed capacitive and mixed capacitive and pseudocapacitive behavior of the composite over the narrow and wide range of the applied potentials, respectively. Alternate galvanostatic +0.72 mA cm-2 charging and -0.72 mA cm-2 discharging and then opposite polarity charging of a device constructed of two identical composite film electrodes was reversible only for low (+0.6 and -0.6 V) voltage of charging and discharging. After multiple charging and discharging (1000 cycles), the capacity increased by ∼5%, but it decreased by ∼18% for the high (+1.2 and -1.2 V) voltage.

The effect of heat-treatment on the structure and the discharging behavior of CoB alloy was also investigated. It was observed that the amorphous/nano-crystalline CoB had very limited hydrogen storage capacity and the crystallized CoB had no hydrogen adsorption ability at all. The big portion of boron present in CoB alloy dissolved selectively into 6 M KOH solution in the first discharge process. After selective dissolution of boron even the amorphous/nano- crystalline CoB alloy lost its hydrogen adsorption ability. The initial discharge capacity of CoB alloy increased as the boron content of CoB alloy increased since the oxidation of boron contributed to (created complication in) the initial discharge process of CoB alloy. After initial charge/discharge process all the subsequent charge/discharge processes were controlled totally by the perfectly reversible Co oxidation/reduction reactions which took place more efficiently in the crystallized structures. So this study makes important contribution to the resolution of the disagreement in the literature that CoB cannot be considered as the hydrogen storage alloy.

In this paper, the integration of plug-in electric vehicles in the power systems with high wind power penetrations is proposed and discussed. Optimal operation strategies of PEV in the spot market are proposed in order to decrease the energy cost for PEV owners. Furthermore, the application of battery storage based aggregated PEV is analyzed as a regulation services provider in the power system with high wind power penetrations.

The polymeric support and the immobilization of the enzyme were characterized by FTIR analysis. SEM-EDS and FTIR results showed that the enzyme was successfully covalently attached to the polymeric support.

This evolution has occurred, not only with respect to the number of devices, but also in their average energy storage capacity. An obvious commercial consequence has been an increased pressure to develop improved active materials for power sources and more efficient methods for battery production. In recent decades the growth of the commercial market for high performance batteries has been based on the development of both solid-state and gel electrolytes. The incorporation of these electrolytes as components of various devices (advanced batteries, smart windows, displays and super-capacitors) offers significant advantages relative to traditional electrolytes, including enhanced reliability and improved safety. The xerogel matrices prepared in this study are represented as U(900) and U(600) and contain 15.5 or 8.5 oxyethylene structural units (CH2CH2O) respectively. The oxyethylene chains are bonded at each end to a siliceous intersection through urea bridging links. These sol-gel derived oxyethylene /siloxane xerogels (designated as di-ureasils) were doped with controlled amounts of LiAsF6 or LiSbF6 to prepare a range of electrolyte compositions. The compositions prepared, with 200&gt;n≥2.5 (where the salt content is expressed as n, the molar ratio of oxyethylene moieties to Li+ ions), were characterized by electrochemical and thermal techniques. Preliminary tests performed with a prototype electrochromic device (ECD) incorporating the most promising electrolyte composition, d-U(900)8LiAsF6 as electrolyte and WO3 as cathodic electrochromic layer, are extremely encouraging. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The maximum vertical velocity (v4) was 23.4% (CMJ) and 7.8% (DJ) greater when the jumps were performed with LROM compared with SROM (p<. 0.05). These differences are considerably less than it could be expected from the greater COM and knee angular displacement and duration of active state. This small difference can be attributed to the greater deceleration during eccentric phase (CMJ:32.1%, DJ:91.5%) in SROM than that in LROM. v4 was greater for SJ in LROM than for SJ in SROM indicating the significance of the longer active state and greater activation level (p<. 0.001).

This article provides an evaluation of the performance of the interrill component of the WEPP model for WDR events. The interrill delivery rates were measured in the wind tunnel facility of the International Center for Eremology (ICE), Ghent University, Belgium with an experimental setup to study different raindrop impact velocity vectors. Synchronized wind and rain simulations with wind velocities of 6, 10 and 14 m s-1 were applied to a test surface placed on windward and leeward slopes of 7, 15 and 20%. Since both rainfall intensity and raindrop impact velocity varied greatly depending on differences in the horizontal wind velocity under WDRs, the resultant kinetic energy flux (KEr, in J m-2 s-1) was initially used in place of the WEPP model intensity term in order to incorporate the effect of wind on impact velocity and frequency of raindrops. However, our results showed only minor improvement in the model predictions. For all research data, the model Coefficients of Determination (r2) were 0·63 and 0·71, when using the WEPP and the KEr approaches, respectively. Alternately, integrating the angle of rain incidence into the model by vectorally partitioning normal kinetic energy flux (KErn, in J m-2 s-1) from the KEr greatly improved the model's ability to estimate the interrill sediment delivery rates (r2=0·91). This finding suggested that along with the fall trajectory of wind-driven raindrops with a given frequency, raindrop velocity and direction at the point of impact onto the soil surface provided sufficient physical information to improve WEPP sediment delivery rate predictions under WDR. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Interrill erosion; Kinetic energy flux; Raindrop impact velocity vector; WEPP; Wind-driven rain","Belgium; Horizontal winds; Impact velocities; Interrill; Interrill erosion; Model coefficient; Model prediction; Physical information; Raindrop impact; Rainfall intensity; Rate predictions; Research data; Sediment delivery; Soil detachment; Soil surfaces; Test surfaces; Water erosion prediction project models; WEPP; Wind velocities; Wind-driven rain; Wind-tunnel facilities; Digital storage; Drops; Erosion; Forecasting; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Rain; Sedimentology; Sediments; Velocity; Geologic models; computer simulation; interrill erosion; numerical model; precipitation intensity; sediment transport; water erosion; wind tunnel; Belgium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872802607

Additionally, liver indices were more sensitive to feeding stress than were muscle measurements. HSI determination (and K) is fairly straightforward, with lower costs and simple procedures. Nevertheless, liver lipid content is also an important indicator of the feeding level and constitutes a direct measurement of food utilization and energy storage capacity. The individual variability and complex dynamics of FA with the feeding level are disadvantageous for use in FA analysis even for early-warning signals of feed limitation.

As such, an important question is the scale of carbon dioxide abatement we require from CCS to meet future climate targets, and whether they appear reasonable. For a number of energy technology and efficiency improvement scenarios, we use a simple climate model to assess the necessary contribution from CCS to 'fill the gap' between scenarios' carbon dioxide emissions levels and the levels needed to meet alternative climate targets. The need for CCS depends on early or delayed action to curb emissions and the characteristics of the assumed energy scenario. To meet a 2. 5°C target a large contribution and fast deployment rates for CCS are required. The required deployment rates are much faster than those seen in the deployment of renewable energy technologies as well as nuclear power the last decades, and may not be feasible. This indicates that more contributions are needed from other low-carbon energy technologies and improved energy efficiency, or substitution of coal for gas in the first half of the century. In addition the limited availability of coal and gas by end of the century and resulting limited scope for CCS implies that meeting the 2. 5°C target would require significant contributions from one or more of the following options: CCS linked to oil use, biomass energy based CCS (BECCS), and CCS linked to industrial processes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon capture and storage; Climate policy; Deployment rates; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy scenarios; Renewable energy","biomass power; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; environmental policy; feasibility study; global warming; renewable resource; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871987229

Examination of fuels refined by different processes has indicated that significantly higher peroxide concentrations exist in fuels which have been severely hydrotreated. Hydroperoxide concentration has been found to be a factor in fuel instability. Presently, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of oxidation of JP-10 through hydroperoxidation. The total electronic energies of JP-10, its related radicals and hydroperoxides produced from JP-10 have been calculated. Their thermodynamic stabilities have been discussed.

The demands of a rapidly proliferating cell for carbon metabolites for the synthesis of biomass, energy and redox equivalents, are fundamentally different from the requirements of a differentiated, quiescent cell, but it remains open whether this metabolic switch is a cause or a consequence of malignant transformation. One of the major requirements is the synthesis of lipids for membrane formation to allow for cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cytokinesis. Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism were indeed found to play a major role in cancer cell proliferation, and most of these enzymes are conserved in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most notably, cancer cell physiology and metabolic fluxes are very similar to those in the fermenting and rapidly proliferating yeast. Both types of cells display highly active pathways for the synthesis of fatty acids and their incorporation into complex lipids, and imbalances in synthesis or turnover of lipids affect growth and viability of both yeast and cancer cells. Thus, understanding lipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae during cell cycle progression and cell proliferation may complement recent efforts to understand the importance and fundamental regulatory mechanisms of these pathways in cancer. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to examine the effects of quercetin on lipid metabolism, mice received a mild-high-fat diet without (control) or with supplementation of 0.33% (w/w) quercetin for 12 weeks. Gas chromatography and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance were used to quantitatively measure serum lipid profiles. Whole genome microarray analysis of liver tissue was used to identify possible mechanisms underlying altered circulating lipid levels. Body weight, energy intake and hepatic lipid accumulation did not differ significantly between the quercetin and the control group. In serum of quercetin-fed mice, triglycerides (TG) were decreased with 14% (p&lt;0.001) and total poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were increased with 13% (p&lt;0.01). Palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid were all decreased by 9-15% (p&lt;0.05) in quercetin-fed mice. Both palmitic acid and oleic acid can be oxidized by omega (ω)-oxidation. Gene expression profiling showed that quercetin increased hepatic lipid metabolism, especially ω-oxidation. At the gene level, this was reflected by the up-regulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 4a10, Cyp4a14, Cyp4a31 and Acyl-CoA thioesterase 3 (Acot3). Two relevant regulators, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por, rate limiting for cytochrome P450s) and the transcription factor constitutive androstane receptor (Car; official symbol Nr1i3) were also up-regulated in the quercetin-fed mice. We conclude that quercetin intake increased hepatic lipid ω-oxidation and lowered corresponding circulating lipid levels, which may contribute to potential beneficial effects on CVD. © 2013 Hoek-van den Hil et al.",,"arachidonic acid; constitutive androstane receptor; cytochrome P450 reductase; docosahexaenoic acid; linoleic acid; oleic acid; palmitic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; quercetin; triacylglycerol; acyl coA thioesterase 3 gene; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cardiovascular risk; constitutive androstane receptor gene; controlled study; cytochrome P450 4a10 gene; cytochrome P450 4a14 gene; cytochrome P450 4a31 gene; cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase gene; drug effect; drug mechanism; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid omega oxidation; gas chromatography; gene; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; lipid analysis; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver weight; male; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantitative analysis; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation; Animals; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oxidation-Reduction; Quercetin; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872837874

Therefore typically a compact design, in which the rotor of the needed electrical machine simultaneously acts as storage mass is chosen. Since the machine is running in vacuum and the rotor can dissipate its heat only by means of thermal radiation or through the bearings if conventional bearings are used, the rotor losses play a vital role.

Among many types of FCs, proton exchange membrane FC (PEMFC) is one of the most promising power sources due to its advantages, such as, low operation temperature, high power density and low emission. However, using sole PEMFC for dynamic loads may not be feasible to satisfy the peak demand changes. Therefore, hybridizing PEMFC and an energy storage system (ESS) decreases the FC cost and improves its performance and life. Ultra-capacitor (UC) is the most powerful candidate to hybridize with PEMFC for dynamic loads. The DC-DC converter is the key enabling technology for hybridization of PEMFC and UC. Generally, the efficiency and performance of hybridization is largely limited by the converter topology employed for the mentioned hybridization. Integrating each source (PEMFC and UC) with a DC-DC converter is not feasible in terms of cost, performance, and control. Due to the above mentioned reasons, an attractive converter topology which can combine PEMFC and UC is strongly required. In this regard, the objective of this study is to design and simulate a novel double input DC-DC converter based on current additivity concept, in order to combine two different types of energy systems (PEMFCs and UCs).Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Even if today we have an index that measures a country's dependency on imports of energy resources, we still do not have an index that measures the security of its supplies. There are certain risks involved in the process of transferring energy resources from producers to the final consumers, some of them domestic and some of them external. As the European Commission suggests, security of supply can be achieved through energy resources storages, long term supply contracts, indigenous production and diversification of suppliers. The article aims to present an index that measures shortterm security risk of external energy supply by combining import diversification and socio-economic energy risks associated with the exporting country. There are several other studies that have previously addressed the problem but none of them has used the socio-economic energy risks index in quantifying the reputability of the supplier in the mix of energy imports. We argue that in short and medium term, diversity of energy supplies is hard to achieve since it requires the construction of new energy transport routes and energy receiving terminals, that call for great investments, and therefore UE along with its member states should focus on international cooperation as a way of increasing the reliability of their suppliers and thus reduce the risk of their external energy supply.","Energy dependency; Energy security; Herfindahl-Hirschman diversity index; Import diversification; Socio-economic energy risk index","Diversity index; Energy dependency; Energy risks; Energy security; Import diversification; Economics; Energy policy; Energy resources; International cooperation; International trade; Transportation routes; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872480835

However, according to the recently avowed Vision 2023 agenda the country also plans to produce 30% of its electricity demand from renewable energy sources by 2023. Meanwhile, each year around 25 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated nationwide. Not only MSW pollutes the environment handling, processing and storage requires precious labour and capital. In that context, a synergistic solution can be created between MSW management and energy supply. In this study, economics and environmental impacts of electricity generation from MSW via (i) direct combustion and (ii) biogas harnessing in 81 cities of Turkey is analysed in detail for a period between 2012 and 2023. Firstly, it is estimated that nationwide 8500 GWh of electricity could have been generated by direct combustion of MSW in 2012. This is predicted to rise 9700 GWh in 2023. It is calculated that 3100 million m3 of methane would be emitted from the landfills of Turkey in 2012. If no action taken this would rise to 3600 million m3 in 2023. Furthermore, it is estimated that by capturing 25% of this methane via landfill bioreactors 2900 GWh or 0.5% of Turkey's annual electricity demand could be supplied in 2023. Simulations also showed that by realizing apposite landfill investments by 2023 annual energy savings worth 200-900 million € could be generated from MSW. Consequently, this could lead to greenhouse gas emission savings up to 11.0 million tonnes of CO 2 per annum. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Combustion; Electricity; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Turkey","Annual energy savings; Biogas production; Direct combustion; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Energy supplies; Renewable energy source; Turkey; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Economics; Electric generators; Electricity; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Investments; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Renewable energy resources; Land fill",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871793431

Despite this, information on FLU detection, accumulation and effects on marine crustaceans is scarce. This work investigated the accumulation of FLU in Carcinus maenas and the responses of several early-warning biomarkers after a 7-day laboratory exposure to five FLU concentrations (2.56 to 100μgL-1). After exposure to FLU, sub-samples of the crabs' digestive gland and muscle were collected for biomarker determinations. The remaining digestive gland and muscle, together with the rest of the whole-body soft tissues, were analysed for FLU residues by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The biomarkers assessed were: i) the quantification of FLU-type compounds by fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF); ii) the activities of glutathione S-transferases (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR), and the levels of total glutathione (GT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) for oxidative stress; iii) the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for neurotoxicity; iv) the activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes, and total protein, glycogen and lipids as indicators of changes in energy metabolism and storage; and v) the lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) as a measure of cell damage. The results showed strong (R2&gt;0.95) concentration-dependent accumulation of FLU residues (as measured by GC-MS) in the remaining whole-body soft tissues and of FLU-type compounds (as measured by FF) in the digestive gland and muscle. A strong positive linear relationship (R2=0.91) between FLU residues and FLU-type compounds was also found. Comparing to controls, activities of GST and GR were significantly higher in crabs exposed to ≥16 and ≥40μgL-1 FLU, respectively. TG levels and IDH activity showed a significant trend to increase with FLU concentrations whereas AChE activity exhibited the opposite trend.

Starting with 1998 a new energy law has been adopted, and Romania started the implementation of deep restructuring and reform process in the energy sector, unbundling the generation, transmission, distribution, supply activities and introducing competition on the base of specific regulations issued by an independent regulatory authority. Since 2005 the electricity and market is 100% opened for non residential customers and a new model for the Romanian Electricity Market has been introduced using price based unit commitments and the balancing market as a tool for providing in the real time the demand and supply balance. In 2007 Romania joined the European Union and implemented in the Romanian energy policy the European priorities like the 20/20/20 targets, CO2 emission reduction, renewable energy percentage and energy efficiency increase, defined by EU Commission. Starting with 2008, Transelectrica has been requested connection solutions for numerous wind farms, the installed capacity totalling much more than the country's internal consumption. These applications are being concentrated in three regions: Dobrogea, Moldova and Banat, the question of insufficient network transfer capacity was raised. Since 2010, the installed and operational capacity of wind power plants has been constantly increasing, at the beginning of this year installed capacity reached 2100 MW, most of the wind power plants (80 %) were concentrated in the Dobrogea region. A large number of projects are promoted by developers, being difficult for Transelectrica to forecast which projects will find funding and will then be finalized and which one will be abandoned at the stage of intention. In the last two years encouraged by the renewable energy promotion Law issued by the Parliament in 2008 and updated several times, we face an important development of large photovoltaic plants, recording an increased number of grid connection applications for such new generation units. This paper will present the challenges that the Romanian Transport System Operator have to deal with in the transmission network planning process and the projects for developing the grid that can be taken into account (for example: building new interconnection lines, adding Phase Shift Transformers on existing interconnections lines, new pumped storage hydropower plants for balancing purposes, partially observing N-1 criteria, sizing the grid, avoiding onerous grid costs, developing smart grids, etc.). © 2013 CIGRE.

The inclusion of information technologies across the entire electrical grid creates new capacities, with impact on the environment, science and technology, economy and lifestyle. Creation of a smart grid provides utilities and their customers a significant improvement in power reliability and services. This paper presents an overview of smart grid technologies focusing on its characteristics, benefits and challenges. Moreover, this paper reviews the reliability impacts of the major smart grid resources such as renewables, demand response and storage. The main differences between a traditional grid and a smart grid, the trends in the evolution of power distribution systems and the highlights of smart grid segments and applications are also presented. Smart Grids represent one of the great challenges at the global level. Under the effect of political and societal pressure due to climate change and pollution concerns, and enabled by availability of new technologies, the electrical power systems are undergoing reconsideration. Including the technology of information in the whole electric grid creates new capabilities with strong impact in the environment, science and technology, but also in the economy and life in general. The term ""smart grid"" describes the evolution of the electrical grids and reflects a change of paradigm in the electric market organization and management. Some changes are already on the way to be implemented, such as a growth of the renewable fraction of the generating power, some other are envisioned, such as the fully flexible energy routing or the consumer driven distribution. From a global perspective, implementing smart grids at a large scale will definitely improve the services that supply electrical energy in the future. In recent years, electrical grids have been faced with an increasing concentration of distortion loads that generate distortion, causing both current and voltage harmonic distortions. The impact of these loads increases as their power approaches the power capacity of the grid. © 2013 CIGRE.

Additionally the temperature influence has been modelled to determine demand dependency on the season. As a use case the uncontrolled and controlled charging of multi-storage car parks with over 3355 vehicles are compared, when the maximum obtained power from the grid is limited and additional local generation with PV is available. Simulations show that controlled charging – while reducing the maximum power from the grid drastically – has nearly no negative effect on the resulting charged energy and thus range of the vehicles when departing. © 2013 CIGRE.

In Denmark solar heat production is very modest during the winter, contrary to the heat consumption. The large percentage of solar heat coverage is made possible by seasonal thermal energy storage large enough to preserve the solar energy produced during summertime until winter. For this purpose a 75,000 m3 pit thermal energy storage has been established. The pit measures 88 meters by 113 meters at the top and has a depth of 16 meters, filled with water. The excavation for the pit goes through various layers of sand and clay below groundwater at steepest possible slopes to ensure an economical design.

This means that the grid support functions, traditionally achieved by the conventional power plants, need to be provided by new technologies. Since grid support with energy storage devices is becoming more attractive, the aim of this paper is to analyse the viability of providing primary frequency regulation with Lithium-ion based energy storage systems. Three control strategies of the energy storage system are analysed and compared in terms of economic benefits on the Danish energy market. The revenues and degradation of the Lithium-ion batteries are obtained by simulations. Furthermore, an energy management strategy based on variable state-of-charge (SOC) set-point is evaluated. Preliminary, the influence of different state-of-charge levels on the cycle lifetime is estimated. Finally, the economic analysis is based on simulations performed with different bidding ratios, i.e. different SOC set-points, for primary upward and primary downward frequency regulation. The results showed that all three control strategies were associated with considerable economic benefits even though different degradation levels of the Lithium-ion batteries were observed. Furthermore, it was found that the economic benefits are declining by increasing the batteries' SOC set-point. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.",,"Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy storage; Ions; Lithium; Secondary batteries; Control strategies; Conventional power plants; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Frequency regulations; Penetration level; Primary frequency regulation; Renewable sources; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034734684

This paper presents a method to optimize combinations of selected worldwide regions in different time zones with the surprising capability of providing sufficient electricity generation to overcome intermittency or reduce it to such an extent that substantially less storage and generation capacity are needed. The recent sharp drop in the cost of photovoltaic (PV) generation capability accompanied by worldwide increased investment in PV plants suggests a new economic base for cooperative efforts to sequentially combine day time insolation. The approach presented here optimizes two aspects, first, the selection of sites across large geographic areas, and second, the size and relative proportion of generation and storage capacity at each site. Our approach converts 20 years of daily insolation data by NASA Solar Sizer to hourly scale. The hourly data are used to assess and compare supranational distributed solar networks in different parts of the globe that have recently been proposed, and to subsequently optimize their generation capacity and storage. We show that linking regions in different time zones and on the two hemispheres can fully eliminate intermittency without the need for fuel and renewable energy other than solar. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Silicon is an excellent anode candidate for Li-ion batteries due to its extremely high storage capacity. However, the volume expansion induces tremendous material deterioration, resulting in poor cycle life. In order to cope with this shortage, various strategies have been proposed. Nanowires were found to be mechanically too fragile to be applied in all-solid-state battery stacks. Honeycomb structures have recently been proposed as they can sustain striking reversible deformations upon (de)lithiation. Finally, thin films turn out to be extremely stable. To further increase the energy density of these thin-film batteries, novel approaches have been proposed. One of the new concepts is based on the etching of deep 3D-structures into a Si substrate, increasing the effective surface area significantly. In combination with advanced materials, new opportunities are obtained to increase the energy density further. © 2013 by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

Hydropower is a mature and widely used technology; about 160 countries in the world have developed hydropower. Hydropower is among the most efficient technologies for the production of renewable energy, with a typical efficiency of 90% or better. Hydropower is cost competitive, and is today the only renewable technology that can produce electricity at equal or lower cost than thermal energy sources such as coal, oil, and gas, typically in the range €0.03-0.05 kWh-1. Hydropower can broadly be classified into four main types: run-of-river (ROR), storage (reservoir-based), pumped storage and in-stream (hydrokinetic) technologies. Hydropower projects are always site specific, tailored for the optimal use of available head and water resources. Classification by size as ""small hydro"" versus ""large hydro"" is not a logical or useful classification parameter for hydropower. Energy from hydropower today supplies 16% of global electricity demand. It is estimated that about one-third of the economic global hydropower resources has already been developed, and that most of the remaining potential will probably be developed by 2050, increasing capacity and energy production to 2-3 times the current level. © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The flywheel rotation speed was measured during the first minute of deceleration and the total friction torque was obtained. The measurements were taken for three different maximal speeds of the flywheel. The friction torque on the deep groove ball bearings was computed and hence the percentage of the total friction torque was obtained.

Storing potential energy in water in a reservoir behind a hydropower plant is used for storing energy at multiple time horizons, ranging from hours to several years. Pumped storage hydropower plants (PSH) are designed to lift water to a reservoir at higher elevation when the electricity demand is low or when prices are low, and turbine water to produce electricity when the demand is high and/or prices are high. PSH are often designed with a relatively high capacity to operate in turbine or pumping mode for only a few hours each. Technically, PSH are equipped either with a separate turbine and pump or with a reversible pump turbine. They often use artificial reservoirs with limited capacity for storing water. The environmental impacts of PSH are similar to those from conventional hydropower plants. In addition, PSH may lead to additional threats to biodiversity by transferring water and species between sites. Special attention must be paid to environmental impacts caused by fluctuating reservoir levels. Future challenges for PSH development are connected with technical improvements to increase the potential head and the flexibility in pump mode, and also business models, grid connection, environmental and societal issues related to the increasing need for energy storage, and balancing services followed by the increased deployment of renewable and intermittent energy sources. This chapter includes results from a case study on large-scale energy storage and balancing services from Norwegian hydropower to Europe, showing the technical potential to develop 20000 MW of new hydro of which about 10000 MW includes pumping. Also included is a system analysis study showing how wind power production can benefit from a nearby hydropower plant with pumping capacity. © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

This is currently considered as an option for lessing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Many laboratory experiments, as well as pilot projects, have been carried out using different capture systems, but until now no experience from the one-to-one size operational installation has been gained. The energy industry must meet several challenges associated with the start-up of the new full-scale project. This paper investigates the problems that can occur while linking a new technology like the CO2 Capture Ready Process to a working fossil fuel power plant. A Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP) has been used, as it is a structured and systematic examination of a planned or existing process or operation, in order to identify and evaluate problems that may represent risks to personnel or equipment. A case study of a post-combustion CO2 capture system with an aqueous monoethanolamine as a solvent is presented, as it is the most likely system to be used in Polish power plants. Basic problems in the analysis as well as the parameters that should be considered to determine vulnerabilities of the process were successfully identified. Gaining experience about the installation's behaviour while connected to the existing equipment of any power plant is critical for future CCS projects. © 2013 Central Mining Institute","amine; Carbon Capture Ready Process; HAZOP; post-combustion; risk analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969885736

Because of this, they have moved swiftly from the research laboratory into the marketplace in applications including: aerospace, automotive, coatings, electronics, energy storage, coatings and paints. Based on the huge interest, enhanced properties as well as ease of production and handling, the European Union is funding a 10 year $1.73 billion coordination action on graphene. South Korea is spending $350 million on commercialization initiatives and the United Kingdom is investing $76 million in a commercialization hub), since many of the current and potential applications of carbon nanotubes may be replaced by graphene at much lower cost. The main objective of this study was to characterize the influence of exfoliated graphene nanoplatelet (xGnP) particle diameter, filler loading and the addition of coupling agents on the mechanical, rheological and thermal properties of xGnP-filled impact modified polypropylene (IMPP) composites. The xGnP nanoparticles used in this research were of three different sizes: xGnP5 with an average thickness of 10 nm, and an average platelet diameter of 5 μn, whereas xGnP15 and xGnP25 have the same thickness but average diameters are 15 μn and 25 μn, respectively. The coupling agent used in this study was polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). Test results show that nanocomposites with smaller xGnP diameter exhibited better flexural, tensile and impact properties for both neat IMPP and composites containing coupling agent. For composites containing a coupling agent, the tensile and flexural modulus and strength increased with the addition of xGnP. The TGA results indicated that the degradation temperature of IMPP is lowered with the addition of PP-g-MA, indicative of the poor thermal stability of PP-g-MA. However, the thermal stability of the composites increases with xGnP loading because of the high thermal stability of the xGnP. Microscopy, rheology, thermal analysis including dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were also used to study the processing, structure, and properties of the nanocomposites.",,"Carbon; Coatings; Coupling agents; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Filled polymers; Nanocomposites; Plastic products; Polypropylenes; Research laboratories; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamic stability; Yarn; Automotive applications; Degradation temperatures; Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis; High thermal stability; Mechanical , physical and thermal properties; Modified polypropylene; Polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride; Tensile and impact properties; Graphene",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947075195

These vehicles were monitored under real-world operation with a portable laboratory that collects data from vehicle sensors (via on-board diagnosis port), exhaust gas composition and GPS in a second-by-second basis. An indirect method to measure battery energy fluxes and consequently estimating electric range was developed, providing maximum errors for the Charge Depleting driving range of 4.2% for the Toyota Prius Plug-in and -0.2% for the Opel, when comparing with measured data.

The energy management of multi-source electric vehicles is a crucial aspect to obtain an effective contribution of the power sources, namely one with high specific energy and another with high specific power. This issue is particularly relevant for electric vehicles subject to high accelerations, breaking and those performing a large number of start and stop in its driving cycle. A comprehensive energy management system architecture with different management levels is presented and compared with a rule-based strategy (power disaggregation) and a pure battery electric vehicle. Simulations have been performed for two different urban driving cycles (NYCC and ARTEMIS low power urban) in order to validate and compare the effectiveness of the strategies under study. The results obtained show the usefulness of the proposed multi-level energy management strategy based on an integrated rule-based meta-heuristic approach versus an energy management strategy directed by the power disaggregation concept. The proposed approach increases the electric vehicle performance due to a better usage of the sources, which leads to a reduced installed power capacity.","Battery; EDLC (Electric Double-Layer Capacitor); Efficiency; Energy Storage; Power Management","Battery electric vehicles; Efficiency; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Heuristic methods; Power management; Vehicle performance; Battery; Comparative analysis; Comparative studies; Comprehensive energy; EDLC (Electric Double-Layer Capacitor); Energy management strategies; Meta-heuristic approach; Urban driving cycles; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940851253

Among these disturbances are obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome co-aggregates established cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, hypertension, dislipidemia and central obesity itself. Interestingly, adipose tissue is no longer considered a merely energy storage tissue. Rather, the release of distinct hormones, as well as of inflammatory cytokines, rendered it an established endocrine and inflammatory organ with a potential to modulate angiogenesis. Accordingly, obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome are characterized by distinct features that enhance angiogenesis, such as hypoxia, low grade inflammation, oxidative stress, hormone imbalance or hyperglycemia, which are also key players in cancer development and progression. Corroborating these findings, metabolic disorders have been associated with increased incidence and poor outcome of several types of neoplasia, including the highly prevalent breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. Therefore, angiogenesis is very likely a key player in this association between these metabolic conditions and cancer. Given the epidemic character of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which are already considered to be major public health threats, and elucidating the angiogenic mechanisms implicated in these metabolic disorders predisposing and promoting cancer, becomes of paramount importance. The present chapter focuses on the pro-angiogenic environment that is primarily developed in these metabolic disorders, and its relevance to tumor progression. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adipokines; Angiogenesis; Cancer; Diabetes; Inflammation; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939843259

Then, an optimization model, using Dynamic Programming with Successive Approximations (DPSA) for a multi-reservoir system for energy production, has been developed. The objective function used in the model has the objective of maximization of the total energy. A multi-reservoir system in the Munzur River Basin of Turkey has been selected for the application. The results of the proposed approach have been evaluated with regard to the relationships of yield-capacity-risk. As a result, the capacity was increased when the yield was raised, and the same yield has been obtained in a different capacity by reducing the capacity under a certain yield risk.

One of the active conditioners is connected in series with the electrical power system, allowing the compensation of problems in the system voltages. The other active conditioner is connected in parallel with the electrical system, and allows the compensation of current harmonics, current unbalances and power factor. In three-phase four-wire systems the parallel connected active conditioner also compensates the zero sequence current components, eliminating the neutral wire current. The UPQC operates in an automatic way, adjusting itself dynamically to the variations of the load and of the electrical system, keeping high levels of power quality in the voltages delivered to the load. At the same time, it only consumes from the electrical system the active power necessary to the load operation, in a balanced way through the three phases, and with sinusoidal currents. The compensation capabilities of the UPQC can be very useful to ensure high levels of power quality in the future Smart Grids, which are not characterized as a single technology or device, but rather as a vision of a distributed electrical system, supported by reference technologies, as Power Electronics Devices, Renewable Energy Resources, Energy Storage Systems (ESS), Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013","Active Conditioners; P-q Theory; Power Quality; Smart Grids; UPQC - Unified Power Quality Conditioner","Advanced metering infrastructures; Electric power transmission networks; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Compensation capability; Electrical power system; Information and Communication Technologies; P-q theory; Power electronics devices; Smart grid; Three phase four wire systems; Unified power quality conditioners; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928265990

An excess body weight can be the consequence of genetic factors, endocrine disorders or certain drugs. However, ""simple obesity"" is the most common, consequence of providing too much energy from food products in comparison to energy expenditure (caloric excess). Today's lifestyle promotes the development of obesity. The lack of physical activity, sedentary lifestyle and energy-rich diet are the main causes of an excess body fat accumulation. Because of improper eating behaviours children consume an excess amount of energy, and their diet is deficient in elements necessary for proper development. The examples of such bad eating habits are: snacking highly processed and calorie-rich foods between meals eating in front of the TV screen, skipping breakfasts, drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, ""eating out"" frequently and ""emotional eating"".

This could relieve the grid since production and consumption of the electricity is physically located close to each other. However, most of the time consumption and production does not coincide. A typical household has its peak energy demand in the morning, at noon and especially during the evening. The PV-system is only able to provide the energy for the demand at noon. To overcome this issue, there are different concepts: One solution could be to establish intelligent electricity consuming device in private homes that start operating only when the sun is shining and the PV-system is producing enough electricity. A different approach is to store the energy during the day using storage devices so that it is available in the evening and the next morning. To keep the storage device small, a combination of both approaches could be the economical best solution.

It consists of Gas Turbine (GT) as the topping cycle and ABC. Gas turbines are very popular in compressor stations. The popularity of this technology results from its advantages, the most important of which are: the fast start-up, high efficiency, low pollutant emissions, the short time needed for the installation to be constructed and a reasonable size. The ABC has similar features. The mechanical power obtained from the air turbine can be used either to support the gas turbine system or to generate electricity. Air turbine systems are simple in terms of operation. This results from the fact that there is no combustion process and there are no toxic agents or agents causing erosion or needing to be topped up. The ABC also improves the performance of the new combined engine in the off-design mode. The main feature of the GT (as well as GT-ABC) is a low water consumption. ABC configurations can be used to improve the efficiency of simple power units with gas turbines operating at locations without access to large amounts of water. For this reason, they can be used in gas transport and storage systems. The paper presents an application of the GT-ABC system with example configurations. Two gas turbines are selected as the topping cycle and compared to each other (the ABB GT10 turbine and the General Electric LM2500+RD turbine). The purpose of this paper is to show the thermodynamic potential of the GT-ABC system in a compressor station application. The significant increase in generated power and the relatively small amount of waste heat make this cycle very interesting. The improvement in energy efficiency involves a lower fuel consumption, which makes the cycle more environmentally friendly. A comparative economic analysis of the GT and the GT-ABC systems operating at a compressor station is performed.","Air bottoming cycle; Air heat exchanger; Compressor station; Gas turbine air bottoming cycle; Intercooler","Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Fuel consumption; Waste heat; Air bottoming cycles; Combustion pro-cess; Compressor stations; General electrics; Generate electricity; Intercoolers; Pollutant emission; Thermodynamic potentials; Gas turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903643267

These units in the future are to be integrated with the carbon capture and storage (CCS) installations, which according to assumptions allow achieving a significant reduction of this greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. A significant share of energy market in Poland constitute coal-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants based on blocks, of which electrical power does not exceed the level of 135 MW. The integration of these units with CCS installation can be economically inefficient. On the other hand, the lack of such integration enhances the investment risk due to the possibility the high price of CO2 emission allowances in the near future. Mentioned factors and additional favorable conditions for development of cogeneration allow to think about investing in a large supercritical CHP plants. In the case of plants with extraction-condensing steam turbine the major problem is choosing of a method of integration of the unit with CCS installation. Here, particularly the choice of a separation method is important. The most suitable methods for the CHP plants are those methods which for separation process require the electric energy. Unfortunately, technologies based on these methods, such as membrane or cryogenic technologies are in the research process and their commercial implementation are not expected in the near future. Separation technology which is closest to commercialization is a technology that uses the chemical absorption method. Realization of separation process requires the large amount of heat supply to a stripper column. In the case of power plants in solutions proposed by the designers the heat source is steam bleed from the steam turbine. Unfortunately, in the case of CHP plants steam which potentially can be used for the process of desorption is used for production of useful heat. For a supply with steam of both district heating heat exchanger and desorption column, building of a much larger block is required. In the paper the results of economical analysis aimed at comparing the three cases of CHP plants integrated and not integrated with the CCS installations are shown. The same structure of steam cycle and numerical assumptions for all variants are adopted. The first solution is a CHP plant without integration with CCS installation, second solution is CHP plant integrated with CCS installation and third solution is CHP plant integrated with CCS but additional in relation to second case with useful use of heat recovered within CCS installation. For evaluation of respective solutions two indicators, i.e the break-even price of electricity and emission avoidance cost were used.","CO2 separation and compression; Economic analysis; Supercritical combined heat and power plants","Carbon capture; Coal; Costs; Desorption; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Membrane technology; Power generation; Steam engineering; Steam power plants; Steam turbines; Technology; Carbon capture and storage; CO2 separation; Combined heat and power plants; Commercial implementation; Cryogenic technologies; Extraction-condensing steam turbines; Separation technologies; Supercritical coal-fired units; Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903641484

The analytical model is used for the study of the dynamics of the system involving simultaneous supply of heating and cooling for buildings. The model includes the dynamics of the gas cooler, evaporator and the thermal storages, while the compressor and the expansion valve are considered quasi-static. The heat transfer in the dynamically modeled components is described by partial differential equations (PDEs) consisting of heat conduction, convection, and source terms. Each component is divided into a number of volumes adjusted according to the required precision and reasonable computational time. We applied two discretization schemes in order to find a numerical solution to the PDEs. The spatial discretization for the heat exchangers is performed by using the upwind scheme, where the fluid properties are individually calculated within each volume. Due to the discrete events in form of tapping and loading (or charging and discharging) of the heat storages, the discretization approach takes into account the sharp spatial transitions within the thermal storages. Therefore, the method of lines in combination with the Superbee slope-limiter was applied for the spatial discretization for high resolution calculation. The modeling approach results in a set of algebraic and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), hence the model becomes an algebraic differential equation problem, which we solved by using MATLAB solver ODE15s. This extended model was used to simulate a dynamic response of the case with varying heating and cooling consumption over a period of 24 hours in a building. The heating and cooling energy consumption follow a sinusoidal and continuous pattern. The results include the effect on both the outlet temperatures and the system coefficient-ofperformance (COP). The outlet energy from the hot storage and the cold storage is used for heating tap water and a chilled water space cooling application subject to temperature requirements. Dimensioning of both storages is crucial for obtaining the required temperatures. The model identifies the critical storage levels required to satisfy the periodic but out-ofphase combination of heating and cooling demands. The volume of the cold storage will have to be considerably larger than the hot storage due to the lower temperature difference.

The objective of the campaign is to support claims that thorium (Th) provides a comparative advantage if used as the major fertile component in nuclear fuel for conventional light water reactors. The scope of the project is focused around PuO2-ThO2 and UO2-ThO2 ceramics to address fuel manufacturing, fuel cycle neutronics and economics, and in-pile thermal and mechanical behavior. Thorium, as the basis fertile component for a mixed oxide fuel, is advantageous for many reasons. The combination of plutonium and thorium to form a Th-MOX fuel is an attractive way to incinerate reactor or weapons grade plutonium. The irradiation of Th-MOX results in a spent reactor fuel with lower radiotoxicity and plutonium levels. Furthermore, thorium oxide is highly inert and cannot be oxidized beyond its +4 oxidation state (unlike UO2 which easily oxidizes to U308). ThO2 is also much less soluble in aqueous media. As a result of the aforementioned, ThO2 provides safety benefits in abnormal reactor operation and added safety margins in waste management and spent fuel storage. ThO2 has a higher thermal conductivity and releases less fission gas due to a higher degree of oxide stability than UO2. The higher absorption cross-section and the reduced fast fission factor of Th coupled with the flatter spectrum dependent neutron yield of uranium-233 allows more plutonium to be loaded into the fuel pins while still maintaining adequate safety margins and negative reactivity coefficients. Lastly, the net plutonium destruction for thorium-based fuels is roughly 50 - 70 percent, vastly exceeding that of uranium based fuels. The Norwegian Th-MOX program began by detailing manufacturing blueprints for these fuel ceramics. Care was taken to insure that sufficient uniformity and high theoretical density were achieved in a simple process compatible with current commercial LWR fuel manufacturing. The irradiation test is being conducted at the Halden reactor operated by the Norwegian Institute of Energy Technology (IFE). A highly instrumented test rig has been configured to take on-line measurements of fission gas release, fuel stack elongation, cladding elongation, fuel pellet swelling, pellet cladding mechanical interaction, neutron flux environment, fuel temperature profile, coolant flow and coolant temperatures. Following the irradiation the fuel will be subjected to post irradiation analysis to examine fission gas composition, fuel microstructure evolution, thermal conductivity evolution and other fuel matrix properties. The data collected from the campaign is aimed to demonstrate not only the advantages, but also the safe and long-term reliable performance of Th-MOX. This data will directly support the planning and approval of a commercial irradiation of such fuel.",,"Ceramic materials; Coolants; Economics; Fission products; Fuel storage; Gases; Irradiation; Light water reactors; Manufacture; Microstructure; Mixed oxide fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Piles; Plutonium; Radiation; Safety factor; Thermal conductivity; Thorium; Uranium; Absorption cross-section; Comparative advantage; Fuel temperature profile; Light water reactor (LWR); Mechanical interactions; Micro-structure evolutions; Reactivity coefficients; Weapons-grade plutonium; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903190997

It is a proven, mature, predictable and price competitive technology. Hydropower has the best conversion efficiencies among all known energy sources (about 90% efficiency, water to wire). It requires relatively high initial investment, but has a long lifespan with very low operation and maintenance costs. The existing hydropower system has an annual generation capacity of 3500TW·h·a-1 and contributes to 16% of the annual electricity generation worldwide. There is still a large potential for further development, as the total technical potential has been estimated to be roughly 15000TW·h. Out of this, about 8000TW·h has been classified as economical potential. In Europe close to 50% of technical potential has already been developed, in Asia 25% and in Africa only 8%. Significant potential can also be found in existing infrastructure that currently lacks generating units (e.g. existing barrages, weirs, dams, canal fall structures, water supply schemes) by adding new hydropower facilities. Only 25% of the existing 45000 large dams in the world are currently used for hydropower, the other 75% are used exclusively for other purposes (e.g. irrigation, flood control, navigation and urban water supply schemes). Hydropower offers significant potential for carbon emissions reductions, since greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are generally very low, typically less than 1% of that from coal power plants. Hydropower is cost competitive, with levelised cost of energy (LCOE) typically in the range (3 to 5) USc·(kW·h)-1, which is comparable to the cost of energy from thermal power plants. Hydropower has an energy payback ratio (EPR) of 200-300, highest of all types of renewable energies. Hydropower can provide both energy and water management services and also help to support other variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar, by providing storage and load balancing services. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Hydroelectric power; Hydropower; Renewable; Water power","Flood control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Storage as a service (STaaS); Thermoelectric power plants; Water management; Water power; Water supply; Carbon emissions reductions; Electricity generation; Hydropower; Levelised cost of energies; Operation and maintenance; Renewable; Renewable energy source; Variable renewable energies; Hydroelectric power plants",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902401762

The other objective is to manage the consumption such that consumption costs are minimum for all households. To fulfill the objectives, as the first step of designing a hierarchical controller, we focused on designing an energy and cost minimizing controller for one building. To this aim, a model predictive controller is formulated to schedule the building's energy consumption using potential load flexibility.

However, application of air cooling increases the levelized cost of electricity up to 16%. An alternative for air cooling is radiation cooling. A new function is given to the parabolic trough mirror, which is the realization of optical contact between a radiating plane and the sky. The sky is cold, therefore the radiating plane cools down. This cooling is available day and night and can supply most of the cooling power that is needed for the condenser of the Rankine cycle. When there is wind, the radiating plane also dissipates heat. Radiation cooling and wind are sufficient for cooling the solar thermal power plant. Storage of cold in a water basin is an essential component, because wind cooling and radiation cooling are more effective at night, when the air temperature is low. Pumping the cold night-air through heat exchangers in the basin is an alternative when wind speeds are generally low. An additional function is given to the water basin, namely the support of a floating parabolic mirror field. A field of floating parabolic trough mirrors that are stationary with respect to each other rotates collectively around a vertical axis in order to follow the sun. We expect that this simple concept will lead to a substantial cost reduction, in spite of the less favorable average angular orientation of the mirrors. Floating parabolic trough fields are most suited for applying radiation cooling in solar power plants. © 2013 The Authors.","Blue sky cooling; Cooling; Floating mirror field; Storage of cold; Wind cooling","Cooling; Cost reduction; Mirrors; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Angular orientation; Levelized cost of electricities; Mirror field; Parabolic mirrors; Parabolic trough; Radiation cooling; Solar resources; Solar thermal power plants; Floating power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902244991

With a focus on 'scale-up', this chapter presents a method for risk-based qualification of large-scale CO2 absorption processes for CCS applications. The method is based on DNV's Technology Qualification procedures which aim at overcoming the challenges posed by the uncertainties that reside in the design and performance predictions of new technologies at commercial scale. An overview of the amine absorption technology and status of commercialisation is given. Different scale-up methods for well-defined and new technologies as well as industry's traditional approach to scale-up of amine absorption processes for CCS are reviewed and discussed. Main challenges for the scale-up are suggested to be high cost, complexity and size-dependency of the multiple phenomena involved as well as unavailability of relevant scale-up experience on the specific field of interest. The method is described as a tool for managing scale-up risks in a systematic and cost-efficient way by identifying the adequate tests required to scale up the specific process to the commercial size. Finally, a case study demonstrating examples of industrial scale-up challenges and tests required to tackle them is given based on publically available literature. These challenges include high cost and high energy penalty, amine emissions to air, amine degradation, flow maldistribution and corrosion. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Two beers were produced from the same hopped wort, which was fermented with two different yeast strains. Half of the bottled beers were tunnel pasteurized resulting in four different beer samples. The pasteurization influenced the volatile profile of both fresh beers, but during storage the differences between the volatile profiles of pasteurized and non-pasteurized beers disappeared. During the storage period, the pasteurized beers gave a lower rate of radical formation, as evaluated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, indicating a better oxidative stability. The pasteurization had no effect on the levels of the pro-oxidative metals iron and copper. Pasteurization slightly increased the protein content of the beers. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the two beers had different protein profiles, which changed during storage; however, pasteurization of both beers did not affect their protein profiles. The level of thiols were lowered in one beer and raised in the other beer by pasteurization, but during storage the levels of thiols decreased at the same rate in all of the beers. It was concluded that pasteurization had a positive influence on the oxidative stability of non-filtered beer. © 2013 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling.","Beer; Oxidation; Pasteurization; Radicals; Storage; Volatile profile","Beer; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Energy storage; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Proteins; Accelerated storages; Oxidative stability; Protein contents; Radical formation; Radicals; SDS-PAGE analysis; Storage stability; Volatile profile; Pasteurization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901241904

X-ray diffraction allows a unique perspective for studying structural modifications and reaction mechanisms that occur when gas and solid interact. The fundamental challenge associated with such a study is that experiments are conducted while the solid sample is held under a gas pressure. To date in-situ high gas pressure studies of this nature have typically been undertaken at large-scale facilities such as synchrotrons or on dedicated laboratory instruments. Here we report high-pressure XRD studies carried out on a multi-purpose diffractometer. To demonstrate the suitability of the equipment, two model studies were carried out, firstly the reversible hydrogen cycling over LaNi5, and secondly the structural change that occurs during the decomposition of ammonia borane that results in the generation of hydrogen gas in the reaction chamber. The results have been finally compared to the literature. The study has been made possible by the combination of rapid X-ray detectors with a reaction chamber capable of withstanding gas pressures up to 100 bar and temperatures up to 900°C. © 2013 Materials Research Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Diffractometers; Hydrogen; X ray apparatus; X ray diffraction; Gas storage materials; High gas pressures; High-pressure XRD; In-situ diffraction; Reaction chambers; Reaction mechanism; Structural modifications; Sustainable energy sources; Gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900301869

The laboratory experiments allowed monitoring the output current, voltage, and the power of the generator under varying drive speeds that emulates the changes in the wind speeds. Based on the increased load references applied to the generator, it is observed that the current from the generator increases; however, it is observed that the generator output voltage does not vary as the same rate.

Indeed the pipeline transport is less expensive, consumes much less utilities (fuel, water and electricity) and is less climate intensive than the shipping transport. The shipping transport required however lower upfront investments for similar overall project costs.

CO2 EOR is also proposed as an important CO2 storage option, but has not yet been optimized for CO2 storage. We focus here on the application of reservoir management methods for optimizing CO 2 storage. In hydrocarbon production, high recovery factors normally relate to good volumetric sweep of the injected phase, as has been demonstrated by 4D seismic monitoring for a number of fields. The volumetric sweep in turn depends on the sweep efficiency at the pore scale as well as the macroscopic areal and vertical sweep. Flexible drainage strategies that can be adapted over time have also proven to be a key to successful enhanced recovery measures. In order to translate this reservoir management perspective to CO2 storage in saline aquifers, we simulate a number of cases using Sleipner-based and Snøhvit-based reservoir models. The Sleipner case involves CO 2 injection close to the critical point in a high permeability sandstone reservoir while the Snøhvit case involves deeper, highpressure injection into a moderate permeability fluvial reservoir. Our simulation results indicate that the sweep efficiency during the injection period has a critical effect on the long-term storage behavior. Therefore, the injection period is an important time-window where it is possible to actively design the injected phase composition, injection pressure and temperature, the injection strategy, and the flooding pattern in order to manage the CO2 plume development. Careful design of the injection wells is critical for successful delivery of the overall injection plan. For large-scale CO2injection projects alternative well configurations are required to increase injectivity. Our simulated cases with long-reach and/or multilateral injection wells give significant improvements in injectivity. Such well designs combined with methods for enhancing the sweep efficiency result in increased overall storage efficiency and effective use of the available pore space.","Active plume management; CCS; Injection design; Swing injection",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898762251

Most of the present works in literature related to CO2 capture assumes exhaust stream from power plants, as they represent large CO2 volume sources, and consider steady flow of exhaust stream to the capture units. However, the feed stream to the CO? capture unit from these sources will typically vary over time. As these fluctuations in the exhaust gas profile lead to lower utilization rate of the capture unit, building the CO2 capture plant for a full capture might not be optimal. Therefore this work evaluates the optimum CO 2 capture unit capacity taking into consideration the trade-off between the cost of capturing CO2 and paying the emissions cost (quota or tax) for given fluctuating exhaust gas profiles. Costs functions of an amine-based post combustion capture unit for a coal power plant exhaust gas are modelled to represent the cost of capturing CC)2. A Mixed Integer Linear program is formulated and implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) to calculate the economic optimum CO2 capture plant capacity. The model when applied to a typical fluctuating exhaust gas profile show results indicating significant economic gains in optimizing the installed CO? capture capacity. Therefore, in addition to significantly decreasing the cost of CCS on power plants, being able to forecast the fluctuating load on the CO2 capture unit can also avoid investment delays compared to cases in which only full capacity capture is considered.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); MILP; Optimal capacity; Optimization; Techno-economics",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898749008

The pressure build up can be controlled by production of water from the aquifer. In that context the synergy effect by combining CCS with geothermal energy production (GE) is obvious; i.e. the injection site for CCS may be surrounded by several GE plants, where the GE plants are operated so the net production of water can balance the injected CO2 from the CCS operation sufficiently. Furthermore, the CO2 plume migration may be controlled by operating the different sites as pressure sinks and sources. The paper illustrates the concept for an area in the northern part of Denmark, where a potential CCS site is characterized together with four prospective locations for GE plants. The GE plants are located in a radius of up to 10 km from the CCS site but still outside the closure of the CCS site.

The hybrid electric and electric mobility is a technology revolution for the automotive industry. In response to the stringent regulations and requirements enforced, vehicle manufacturers are developing new strategies, using hybrid electric or electric powertrain solutions. In order to obtain the goal of using alternative powertrain solutions, it is important to integrate from the early beginning different devices and to optimize their behavior. However, with a minimum of one electric energy storage package represented as the battery package, a hybrid electric powertrain triggers more concerns surrounding energy flows. During operation, there are energy losses caused by heat generation. Generated heat, emphasized as losses, is having a negative effect on the battery package efficiency. Apart from the functional behavior of the battery package, which is the deliver and to store electrical energy, due to internal losses it also has a thermal behavior, which needs to be taken into account. Thereby this paper aims to present the thermal behavior of a battery package in order to study its' energy flows and to determine its' efficiency as part of the powertrain. Based on thermal resistances, a thermal network was developed to compute internal losses for different parts of the battery package. Using simulation, both the battery package and its thermal model, were integrated in a mock-up virtual hybrid electric vehicle to study its behavior during a predefined cycle.","Battery; Hybrid vehicle; Losses; Simulation; Thermal modeling","Automotive industry; Electric vehicles; Energy dissipation; Hybrid vehicles; Losses; Powertrains; Thermoanalysis; Battery; Electric power trains; European Union regulations; Hybrid-electric powertrain; Simulation; Stringent regulations; Technology revolution; Thermal model; Automobile manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898487690

Usually, a HPS combines two or more energy sources that work together with the Energy Storage Devices (ESD) to deliver power continuously to the DC load or to the AC load via the inverter system. In the automotive applications, the ESD stack can be charged from the regenerative braking power flow or from other power sources like the thermoelectric generator or the renewable source. The last may have a daily variable power flow such as the photovoltaic panels integrated into a car's body or into buildings. In the first section, an efficient fuel cell/battery HPS topology is proposed for high power applications to obtain both performances in energy conversion efficiency and fuel cell ripple mitigation. This topology uses an inverter system directly powered from the appropriate Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) stack that is the main power source and a buck Controlled Current Source (buck CCS) supplied by a batteries stack, which is the low power auxiliary source. The buck CCS is connected in parallel with the main power source, the PEMFC stack. Usually, the FC HPS supply inverter systems and PMFC current ripple normally appear in operation of the inverter system that is grid connected or supply the AC motors in vehicle applications. The Low Frequency (LF) ripple mitigation is based on the active nonlinear control placed in the tracking control loop of the fuel cell current ripple shape. So the buck CCS will generate an anti-ripple current that tracks the FC current shape. This anti-ripple current is injected into the output node of the HPS to mitigate the inverter current ripple. Consequently, the buck CCS must be designed in order to assure the dynamic requested in the control loop. The ripple mitigation performances are evaluated by some indicators related to the LF harmonics mitigation. It is shown that good performances are also obtained with the hysteretic current-mode control, but the nonlinear control has better performances. The nonlinear control of the buck CCS is implemented based on a piecewise linear control law. This control law is simply designed based on the inverse gain that is computed to give a constant answer for all levels of the LF current ripple. The control performances are shown by the simulations performed. Finally, the designed control law will be validated using a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). In the second and the third section is proposed and analysed a nonlinear control for FC HPS based on bi-buck topology that further improves FC performance and its durability in use in the low and medium power applications. The nonlinear voltage control is analysed and designed in the second section using a systematic approach. The design goal is to stabilise the HPS output voltage. This voltage must have a low voltage ripple. Additionally, the power spectrum of this ripple must be spread in a wide frequencies band using an anti-chaos control. All the results have been validated with several simulations. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.","Energy efficiency; Fuel cell; Hybrid power sources; Inverter systems; Nonlinear control; Ripple mitigation; Spread power spectrum","AC motors; Chaos theory; Control theory; Conversion efficiency; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric power system control; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Fuzzy logic; Linear control systems; Photovoltaic cells; Piecewise linear techniques; Polyelectrolytes; Power spectrum; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Regenerative braking; Thermoelectric energy conversion; Thermoelectric equipment; Topology; Controlled current source; Energy storage devices (ESD); Hybrid power sources; Inverter system; Non linear control; Piecewise-linear controls; Ripple mitigation; Thermoelectric generators; Power control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898010673

It is necessary to find solutions with high energy storage efficiency in case of malfunctions of the 230V electricity network that supplies computers as well as systems to store the energy generated from solar energy conversion systems or systems with regenerative braking on vehicles [1]. Accumulators store charge for long periods of time under constant voltage and relatively small currents, but they can supply very high currents. One possible solution is the use of a system based on an EDLC and a battery. Important characteristics of EDLC (Electric Double-Layer Capacitors of Supercapacitors) are the charging current and the supply current that can reach values of up to 1000 A and 100000 charging/discharging cycles. The configuration that was researched can accumulate and generate electric charge under currents of tens of amperes. The advantages of using this battery-EDLC tandem in UPS units consist of reducing the specific weight of the equipment and increasing the lifespan of the UPS unit with up to 10 years. Another advantage of using this system is given by the larger number of charge/discharge cycles possible through the use of supercapacitors and eliminating the electric switching systems [2]. © 2013 IEEE.","Accumulators; EDLC; Supercapacitors","Capacitors; Electronics packaging; Energy conversion; Hybrid systems; Power supply circuits; Regenerative braking; Solar energy; Accumulators; Charge/discharge cycle; Charging/discharging; EDLC; Electric double layer capacitor; Energy from renewable sources; Energy storage efficiencies; Super capacitor; Uninterruptible power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897811108

The majority of new installations are expected to be residential PVs that are connected into distribution systems. However, the PV hosting capacity of low voltage (LV) grids is limited due to the voltage rise at the point of connection associated with the PV feed-in current. Reactive power management using PV inverters and using the electrical energy storage systems (EESS) are amongst the main solutions for increasing the PV hosting capacity in LV grids. In this paper, a method is developed in order to examine the effect of reactive power absorption by PV inverters on EESS capacity required for overvoltage prevention in LV grids. Simulations show that reactive power absorption can effectively decrease the EESS capacity. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy storage; High PV penetration; Overvoltage; Reactive power","Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Electric power measurement; Electrolysis; Energy storage; Distribution systems; Electrical energy storage systems; Grid-connected photovoltaic system; Hosting capacity; Over-voltages; Point of connection; Pv penetrations; Reactive power management; Reactive power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896484734

Namely, deduplication system are now targeting large-scale cloud computing storage infrastructures holding unprecedented data volumes with a significant share of duplicate content. It is however hard to assess the usefulness of deduplication in particular settings and what techniques provide the best results. In fact, existing disk I/O benchmarks follow simplistic approaches for generating data content leading to unrealistic amounts of duplicates that do not evaluate deduplication systems accurately. Moreover, deduplication systems are now targeting heterogeneous storage environments, with specific duplication ratios, that benchmarks must also simulate. We address these issues with DEDISbench, a novel micro-benchmark for evaluating disk I/O performance of block based deduplication systems. As the main contribution, DEDISbench generates content by following realistic duplicate content distributions extracted from real datasets. Then, as a second contribution, we analyze and extract the duplicates found on three real storage systems, proving that DEDISbench can easily simulate several workloads. The usefulness of DEDISbench is shown by comparing it with Bonnie++ and IOzone open-source disk I/O micro-benchmarks on assessing two open-source deduplication systems, Opendedup and Lessfs, using Ext4 as a baseline.

To find the optimal operable policies, we solve a moving horizon optimal control problem assuming known disturbances. Next, we proposed simple implementation based on feedback control, which gives a near-optimal operation for a range of disturbances. The methods were successfully tested in simulations, which show that there is a great economical gain in using dynamic optimization for the case of variable energy price. © IFAC.",,"Energy utilization; Heating; Optimal control systems; Dynamic optimization; Fluctuating energy; Online optimization; Operational constraints; Optimal control problem; Optimal policies; Outdoor temperature; Storage capability; Process control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896364863

The last point is restricted by the availability of batteries and is usually fixed for a planned deployment. The first two points are intertwined in a complex relation because good vertical resolution requires both short acoustic pulses and a reasonably wide bandwidth, both of which lead to shorter range. As such, it is hard to reach any breakthrough in the range-resolution characteristics of an ADCP without finding a completely new approach to estimating velocity from the acoustic echo. Against this backdrop, our development of a new long range current profiler focused on optimizing each element in the system that we could control, from transducer design to mechanical design, from power consumption to profiling range, and from interfacing to data storage. Combined with a very flexible timing controller, this novel system provides the basis for a new generation of current profilers where the hardware platform is referred to as AD2CP, of which the Signature75 long range current profiler is the first fully commercial implementation.

Exercise training has received increasing recognition as a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment of T2D. Emerging research suggests that resistance training (RT) has the power to combat metabolic dysfunction in patients with T2D and seems to be an effective measure to improve overall metabolic health and reduce metabolic risk factors in diabetic patients. However, there is limited mechanistic insight into how these adaptations occur. This review provides an overview of the intervention data on the impact of RT on glucose metabolism. In addition, the molecular mechanisms that lead to adaptation in skeletal muscle in response to RT and that are associated with possible beneficial metabolic responses are discussed. Some of the beneficial adaptations exerted by RT include increased GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle, increased insulin sensitivity and hence restored metabolic flexibility. Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to RT may be other beneficial effects. RT is increasingly establishing itself as an effective measure to improve overall metabolic health and reduce metabolic risk factors in diabetic patients. © 2013 Barbara Strasser and Dominik Pesta.",,"adiponectin; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase IV; glucose; glucose transporter 4; glycosylated hemoglobin; insulin; mammalian target of rapamycin; protein kinase B; protein S6; tumor necrosis factor alpha; glucose; glucose transporter 4; glycogen; oxygen; SLC2A4 protein, human; aging; energy expenditure; exercise; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance; glucose transport; glycemic control; glycogen synthesis; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oxygen consumption; resistance training; review; skeletal muscle; weight reduction; exercise; muscle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exercise; Glucose; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Glycogen; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Muscles; Oxygen; Resistance Training",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896076044

The goal is to maximize the energy delivered to the power grid under very strict grid requirements to power quality. We define an extremely low power output gradient and demonstrate how decentralized energy storage in the turbines' inertia combined with a central storage unit or deferrable consumers can be utilized to achieve this goal at a minimum cost. We propose a variation on model predictive control to incorporate predictions of wind speed. Due to the aerodynamics of the turbines the model contains nonconvex terms. To handle this nonconvexity, we propose a sequential convex optimization method, which typically converges in fewer than 10 iterations. We demonstrate our method in simulations with various wind scenarios and prices for energy storage. These simulations show substantial improvements in terms of limiting the power ramp rates (disturbance rejection) at the cost of very little power. This capability is critical to help balance and stabilize the future power grid with a large penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. © 2013 EUCA.",,"Aerodynamics; Convex optimization; Disturbance rejection; Energy storage; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Wind; Wind power; Convex optimization methods; Decentralized energy; Large penetrations; Power gradient; Power ramp rates; Renewable energy source; Storage units; Wind scenarios; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893296557

The MPC incorporates forecasts of the power production and disturbances that influence the loads, e.g. time-varying weather forecasts, in order to react ahead of time.

However the electricity is the secondary energy carrier in relation to chemical energy of organic fuel. Higher efficiency of electric boilers economically collapses by extremely low efficiency of electricity generation at the thermal power plants. To municipal consumers use of electricity is 1.4 times more expensive than heat from the centralized sources, and to individual consumers - 2.3 times. But the multirate system of payment for electricity allows to accumulate energy at night, with payment on the lowest tariff, and to use it throughout the day. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of such heating system. The authors developed the procedure of definition of two most important characteristics of electro-accumulation heating systems: the required power of electric heaters and necessary volume of the storage tank. Fig. 2-4 show the dependence of the required relative electrical power of system on the external temperature and time of the consumption of electric power. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the necessary relative volume of the storage tank on external temperature.

The need of positioning the storage tank of large sizes and modernization of the feeding electrical networks remain the serious problems of the accumulation systems of electro-heating.

In our hydrological-economical study on floodplain wetlands located in the Lower Basin of the Biebrza Valley, we attempt to quantify the monetary value of water storage in the floodplain during flood phenomena as an important ecosystem service. The unit monetary value of water storage in the catchment of Biebrza Valley was assessed on the basis of small artificial water reservoirs, constructed in recent years and located in the area of research, and reached 0.53 EUR·m-3·year-1. In a GIS-based study on hydrological floodplain processes in the years 1995-2011, we assessed the average annual volume of active water storage in the floodplain which reached 10.36 M m3 year-1, giving a monetary value of EUR 5.49 million per annum.

Minima on the energy surface correspond to stable or metastable magnetic states and can represent parallel, antiparallel or, more generally, non-collinear arrangements. A rate theory has been developed for systems with arbitrary number, N, of magnetic moments, to estimate the thermal stability of magnetic states and the mechanism for magnetic transitions based on a transition state theory approach. The minimum energy path on the 2N-dimensional energy surface is determined to identify the transition mechanism and estimate the activation energy barrier. A pre-exponential factor in the rate expression is obtained from the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for spin dynamics. The velocity is zero at saddle points so it is particularly important in this context to realize that the transition state is a dividing surface with 2N -1 degrees of freedom, not just a saddle point. An application of this rate theory to nanoscale Fe islands on W(110) has revealed how the transition mechanism and rate depend on island shape and size. Qualitative agreement is obtained with experimental measurements both for the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor. In particular, a distinct maximum is observed in the pre-exponential factor for islands where two possible transition mechanisms are competing: Uniform rotation and the formation of a temporary domain wall. The entropy of the transition state is enhanced for those islands making the pre-exponential factor more than an order of magnitude larger than for islands were only the uniform rotation is viable.© by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München.","Magnetic Memory; Magnetic Nano-Islands; Potential Energy Surface; Rate Theory; Spin Transitions","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Domain walls; Magnetic moments; Magnetic storage; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Spin fluctuations; Thermodynamic stability; Tungsten; Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations; Magnetic memory; Metastable magnetic state; Nano-islands; Preexponential factor; Rate theory; Spin transition; Transition state theories; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888612880

Clinical studies suggest involvement of fetuin-A in metabolic disorders such as visceral obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and fatty liver. Curcumin is extracted from the rhizome Curcuma longa and has been shown to possess potent antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of curcumin treatment on serum fetuin-A levels as well as hepatic lipids and prooxidant-antioxidant status in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 was fed control diet (10 % of total calories from fat). Groups 2 and 3 were given curcumin (100 and 400 mg/kg bw/day, respectively) by gavage for 8 weeks and were fed control diet. Group 4 was fed with HFD (60 % of total calories from fat). Groups 5 and 6 received HFD together with the two doses of curcumin, respectively. Curcumin treatment appeared to be effective in reducing liver triglycerides and serum fetuin-A levels. These findings suggest that the reduction of fetuin-A may contribute to the beneficial effects of curcumin in the pathogenesis of obesity. © 2013 University of Navarra.","Curcumin; Fatty liver; Fetuin-A; High-fat diet; Obesity","ascorbic acid; curcumin; fetuin A; glutathione; glutathione transferase; malonaldehyde; superoxide dismutase; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; diet supplementation; drug effect; fatty liver; food intake; histopathology; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipid storage; liver homogenate; male; nonhuman; rat; triacylglycerol blood level; vitamin blood level; weight gain; Curcuma longa; Rattus; Administration, Oral; alpha-2-HS-Glycoprotein; Animals; Antioxidants; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol; Curcumin; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Liver; Insulin; Liver; Male; Malondialdehyde; Obesity; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888427840

One example is the Range Extender (RE), which is a combination of an internal combustion engine (ICE) with a generator unit, which serves the purpose of a power back-up in case of a battery with low state of charge (SOC), without any direct connection to the drivetrain. For this kind of RE-application, different boundary conditions are very important. Especially in EVs topics like packaging space and NVH behavior play a main role. To fulfill these important characteristics, AVL has developed a Wankel-RE unit in which the generator is driven directly from the eccentric shaft of the rotary-piston ICE. With such an arrangement and the correct balancing of the power unit directly on the rotor of the generator, a very small packaging size in combination with smooth and silent running can be achieved and fulfills the most important characteristics for an electric vehicle. Besides these outstanding attributes, and although RE rotary engine concepts have proven to have acceptable fuel efficiency even under stringent emission challenges, the main drawback of rotary engines can be seen in non-availability of large scale manufacturing devices for specific rotary engine components. Therefore, the industry would prefer and is demanding solutions based on conventional piston engines. Following this request, AVL has developed an alternative concept which shows the potential of substituting the Wankel engine by a common single-cylinder piston engine within the same tight packaging boundaries. By means of a tailor made balancing system, the mass forces and torsional vibration have been brought to a level which is competitive to the excellent NVH behavior of the Wankel engine. This paper shows the development of this concept, the resulting design and packaging in combination with simulation results confirming the NVH behavior of the single cylinder RE. © Copyright @2013 SAE Japan and Copyright @ 2013 SAE International.",,"Charging (batteries); Electric generators; Engine cylinders; Packaging; Pistons; Secondary batteries; Vibrations (mechanical); Wankel engines; Alternative concepts; Development programs; Different boundary condition; Engine components; Large-scale manufacturing; Restricted capacities; Single cylinders; Torsional vibration; Engine pistons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887953737

In WSNs energy consumption of a node is a critical aspect as it is a limited resource. Since the nodes are tiny devices with limited storage, computational capability a power, it is necessary that all protocols at all layers in WSNs must be energy efficient. The focus, however, has been given to the routing protocols which might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this paper, we present a survey of the state-of-the-art Hybrid Routing Algorithms (HRA) for WSN. Here, we present classification of different HRA for the various approaches chased.

For this purpose, 4 different storage types, including above-ground storage with plastic cover, horizontal-reinforced concrete storage, vertical-reinforced concrete silo and vertical-steel silo were taken into consideration. Total of 296 samples were collected from each of the stored product stacks as one of these before being taken into storage and the others during the storage for 12 months. Nutritional quality values (dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, crude ash, and metabolizable energy) of samples were analyzed in the laboratory in two replicates. As a result of the laboratory analyses and statistical data evaluation, the horizontal reinforced concrete storage and vertical reinforced concrete silo hadn't significant effect on the quality and nutritional value of barley and wheat, the vertical steel silo was more appropriate for maize storage. It has been concluded that there are too much losses from both the amount and the nutritional quality of the wheat, barley and maize stacks in surface soil storage types. Total average nutritional value losses for wheat were 3.83% in reinforced concrete horizontal storage 2.73% in reinforced concrete silo, 2.87% in vertical steel silo and 16.47% in soil storage conditions. These values were accordingly 4.64%, 2.24%, 3.82% and 19.53% for barley stacks and 5.28%, 3.16%, 2.34% and 21.19% for maize stacks. During the research, the average loss was calculated as the amount of wheat, barley and maize stacks. Accordingly, these losses for wheat stacks were 2.15% in horizontal-reinforced concrete storage, 1.26% in vertical-reinforced concrete silo, 1.39% in vertical-steel silo and 8.31% in soil storage conditions.

For climate change mitigation, a special attention is given to the reduction of CO2 emissions by applying capture and storage techniques in which CO2 is captured and then stored in suitable safe geologic locations. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are expected to play a significant role in the coming decades for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and to ensure a sustainable development of power generation and other energy-intensive industrial sectors (e.g. cement, metallurgy, petro-chemical etc.). This paper evaluates super-critical coal-based power plants with and without carbon capture. The analysis is geared toward quantification of main plant performance indicators such as: fuel consumption, gross and net energy efficiency, ancillary energy consumption, carbon capture rate, specific CO2 emissions, capital costs, specific capital investments and operational costs etc. For CCS configurations, two post-combustion CO2 capture options were considered. The first option is based gas-liquid absorption using a chemical solvent (methyl-diethanol-amine - MDEA etc.). The second option is based on calcium looping cycle, in which the carbonation/calcination sequence of CaO/CaCO3 system is used for carbon capture. The power plant case studies investigated in the paper produces around 950 - 1,100 MW net power with at least 90 % carbon capture rate. The mathematical modelling and simulation of the whole power generation schemes will produce the input data for quantitative techno-economic and environmental evaluations of power plants with carbon capture (similar power plant concept without CCS was used as reference for comparison). Mass and energy integration tools were used to assess the integration aspects of evaluated carbon capture options in the whole power plant design, to optimise the overall energy efficiency and to evaluate the main sources of energy penalty for CCS designs. © 2013, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal combustion; Cost benefit analysis; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Investments; Sustainable development; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Coal based power plants; Gas liquid absorption; Mathematical modelling and simulation; Overall energy efficiency; Post-combustion CO; Techno-economic and environmental evaluations; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886407812

To reach these goals, complex optimisation principles are needed, due to the fact that heat and cold demand and availability vary in time and need to be aligned also including continuous as well as batch processes which can be found in all industry. For this reason heat and cold storages are indispensable and necessary for increasing the resource and energy efficiencies in complex energy systems. It has been proven that the pinch analysis is a very suitable method for the design of an optimised overall energy system. This has been shown for renewable energy integration at total sites (Varbanov and Klemeš, 2010) and specifically for solar thermal integration (Brunner et al., 2008). Recently the approach has been applied for energy efficiency and renewable energy integration in breweries (Muster-Slawitsch et al., 2011). Several authors worked with algorithms including batch processes and storages in the pinch analysis but until now no software tools for the purpose of designing complex storage systems under practical considerations are available. To close this gap, the tool SOCO (Storage Optimisation Concepts) has been developed that is able to plan and design complex storage systems on the basis of real life process data coming from the industries, commerce and district heating businesses (Fluch et al., 2012). The application enhances possibilities of demand reduction (heat integration), increases the measures on energy efficiency and boosts the implementation of economically and technically reasonable renewable energy technologies (focus on solar process heat). Included in SOCO is a Pinch Analysis on the basis of real life data with varying heat load profiles and the possibility to create heat exchanger networks. Based on the illustration of the residual load profile with its different temperature levels the best possible way of integrating renewable energy technology can be shown. Furthermore, one of its main topics is the design of storage systems with regards on the heat exchanger network, previously calculated within the pinch analysis, and with regards on the possibility to implement renewable energies. Therefore, the storage itself is simulated using a node model adapted for storages with a fixed level and a varying level. Based on these simulations SOCO optimises the amount, style, dimension and design of the storage systems as type of storage, insulation, connections, charging and discharging of the storages. Within the project data of 10 storage systems have been evaluated and out of these three detailed case studies have been performed (two integrated in a production process, one storage system of a district heating network). It can be stated that based on the evaluation of the status quo significant optimisation can be reached by an optimised combination of processes with heating and cooling demand, an optimised storage management including the control systems and the charging and discharging strategies and an optimised design of the storage itself. The thereby achievable increase of efficiency of the storage and respectively the increase of the total energy efficiency in the production process is up to 20 %. It can be stated that the developed SOCO tool is a very useful software and methodology for the optimisation of energy efficiency in industry, commerce and district heating. The user is able to design the status quo and based on real data the developed algorithms for heat integration including the storage system and management suggest an optimised solution with the target of energy efficiency and integration of renewable energy sources.

The heart of the WavestarWEC is the Power Take-Off (PTO) system, converting the wave induced motion of the floats into a steady power output to the grid. In the present work, a PTO based on a novel discrete displacement fluid power technology is explored for theWavestarWEC. Absorption of power from the floats is performed by hydraulic cylinders, supplying power to a common fixed pressure system with accumulators for energy smoothing. The stored pressure energy is converted into electricity at a steady pace by hydraulic motors and generators. The storage, thereby, decouples the complicated process of wave power absorption from power generation. The core for enabling this PTO technology is implementing a near loss-free force control of the energy absorbing cylinders. This is achieved by using special multi-chambered cylinders, where the different chambers may be connected to the available system pressures using fast on/off valves. Resultantly, a Discrete Displacement Cylinder (DDC) is created, allowing near loss free discrete force control. This paper presents a complete PTO system for a 20 float Wavestar based on the DDC.

Tis study was undertaken for the characterization and conceptualization of the hydrogeolog-ical behavior of a unique example of the dissected relict karst aquifer, which is known as the Harmanköy-Beyyayla Karst System (HBKS) in Central Turkey. In order to obtain the conceptualization of the HBKS, properties of recharge, fow, storage, and discharge was analyzed. Te contribution of allogenic-point recharge to the Beyyayla and Döşkaya aquifers occurs from the Beyyayla and Tozman sinkhole with approximately 85% of total recharge. Te rest of the recharge takes place as autogenic-difuse/point type from the limestone rock-mass. Te recharge on the Nardi{dotless}n aquifer originates from direct precipitation onto the limestone area mainly as autogenic-difuse and, to lesser extent, as autogenic-point. Groundwater fow occurs as conduit fow at the Beyyayla and Döşkaya aquifers and as dispersed fow at the Nardi{dotless}n aquifer.

We introduce the use of electric vehicle (EV) public charging stations with energy storage system (ESS) as a solution for voltage regulation in LV feeders with PV. A novel method is proposed to determine the ESS charging load required for voltage regulation and compare the results for the different locations in the feeder. With time-series simulations, we quantify the energy size required for a station ESS. A Belgian LV residential grid, modeled using real PV generation and load profiles, is used as case study.

The principal nuclear site being Al-Tuwaitha. Many of these sites suffered substantial physical damage during the Gulf Wars and have been subjected to subsequent looting. All require decommissioning in order to ensure both radiological and nonradiological safety. However, it is not possible to undertake the decommissioning of all sites and facilities at the same time. Therefore, a prioritization methodology has been developed in order to aid the decision-making process. The methodology comprises three principal stages of assessment: i) a quantitative surrogate risk assessment ii) a range of sensitivity analyses and iii) the inclusion of qualitative modifying factors. A group of Tuwaitha facilities presented the highest risk among the evaluated ones, followed by a middle ranking grouping of Tuwaitha facilities and some other sites, and a relatively large group of lower risk facilities and sites. The initial order of priority is changed when modifying factors are taken into account. It has to be considered the Iraq's isolation from the international nuclear community over the last two decades and the lack of experienced personnel. Therefore it is appropriate to initiate decommissioning operations on selected low risk facilities at Tuwaitha in order to build capacity and prepare for work to be carried out in more complex and potentially high hazard facilities. In addition it is appropriate to initiate some prudent precautionary actions relating to some of the higher risk facilities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Decommissioning; Iraq nuclear facilities; Prioritization; Sensitivity analysis","Decision making; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Nuclear energy; Radioactive wastes; Sensitivity analysis; Decision making process; Modifying factors; Nuclear activities; Nuclear community; Nuclear complex; Nuclear facilities; Physical damages; Prioritization; Risk assessment; decommissioning; methodology; nuclear power; precautionary principle; prioritization; radioactive waste; risk assessment; article; decision making; finance; funding; human; Iraq; methodology; nuclear energy; nuclear power plant; nuclear safety; radiation hazard; radioactive waste storage; risk assessment; social security; war; waste disposal facility; ecosystem restoration; environmental planning; nuclear reactor; radioactive waste; Iraq; Decision Making; Environmental Policy; Environmental Remediation; Iraq; Nuclear Reactors; Radioactive Waste; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883163404

Before irradiation, linden leaf samples exhibit one singlet ESR signal centred at g = 2.0088. Besides this central signal, in spectra of irradiated linden samples, two weak satellite signals situated about 3 mT left (g = 2.0267) and right (g = 1.9883) were observed. Dose-response curves for the left satellite signal and the central single signal were constructed, and it was found that both of these curves can be described best by the combination of two exponential saturation functions. Variable temperature and fading studies at room temperature showed that the radiation-induced radicals in linden leaf samples are very sensitive to temperature. The stabilities of the left satellite (g = 2.0267) and the central single (g = 2.0088) signal at room temperature over a storage period of 126 days turned out to be best described by a sum of two first-order decay functions. The kinetic features of the left satellite signal were studied over the temperature range of 313-373 K. The results indicate that the isothermal decay curves of the left satellite ESR signal also proved to be best fitted by the combination of two first-order decay functions. Fading and annealing studies suggested the existence of two different radiation-induced free radical species. At the same time, Arrhenius plots evidenced two different kinetic regimes with two different activation energies. TL investigation of polyminerals from the linden samples allowed to discriminate clearly between irradiated and unirradiated samples even 75 days after irradiation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","ESR; Irradiation; Linden; TL","Activation energy; Arrhenius plots; Exponential functions; Free radicals; Irradiation; Magnetic moments; Paramagnetic resonance; Radiation; Satellites; Thallium; Thermoluminescence; Dose-response curves; First-order decays; Free radical species; Linden; Radiation-induced; Radiation-induced radical; Saturation function; Variable temperature; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Tilia; Tilia vulgaris; article; electron spin resonance; food irradiation; gamma radiation; luminescence; plant leaf; radiation exposure; temperature; Tilia; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Food Irradiation; Gamma Rays; Luminescence; Plant Leaves; Temperature; Tilia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883051680

The proposed method has the following stages: establishing municipal landfill surface contour by topographic measurements; setting measuring points on the deposit surface; setting the number of points needed and their spatial coordinate; field location of points for making exploratory measurements; making and recording spatial and temporal exploratory measurements; drawing the concentration distribution maps determined by the topographic structure analyzed; exploratory analysis and interpretation of measurement results and potential energy area determination. The method was used for ""Pata Rat"" non-compliant landfill, nearby Cluj-Napoca (Romania). Results interpretation shows that the stored amount suffered an important decrease by waste degradation reactions. The description of the current state of the deposit is made by analyzing the landfill gas composition. This sets out potential areas that could be further analyzed by determining the evolution of the composition of landfill gas. Basically, the goal is mainly to determine the areas of exploitation potential and less to characterize this area through qualitative and quantitative explanations the degradation reactions. The investigation was done by analysing deposit composition and landfill gas flow in storage conditions, related to a non-compliant landfill with 35 years of activity.","Energy state; Exploratory analysis; Landfill gas; Non-compliant landfills",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880690876

The introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) into society poses several important challenges, such as; new interactions, limited driving range, and recharging time, and are relatively expensive. At system level there is an even bigger challenge; the use of EVs requires an adequate charging and electric grid infrastructure, as well as dedicated solutions for vehicle charging and storage that are optimally integrated into the urban environment. In this paper the results are presented of a 'design inclusive research' project for the introduction of EVs into a dense urban environment. Researchers & designers from architecture, industrial design, electrical engineering, technology assessment and innovation management background were involved. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol with its 48 million passenger movements per year was taken as a challenging case. The Schiphol Group has the ambition to develop its properties and business park areas in a sustainable and socially responsible way. Electric mobility is considered as one of the options for sustainable innovation. The results show that it is possible to create a multifunctional, sustainable and comfortable urban area in which the electric mobility is very well integrated. It can be stated that the sustainable urban development is becoming more feasible by the clever combination of renewable energy, electricity grid design, inductive Park & Charge and customized EV services. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The commercially available technology is based on charging an electrical double-layer (EDL), and using high surface area carbon electrodes in an organic electrolyte. This review first presents the state-of-the-art on EDL capacitors, with the objective to better understand their operating principles and to improve their performance. In particular, it is shown that capacitance might be enhanced for carbons having subnanometric pores where ions of the electrolyte are distorted and partly desolvated. Then, strategies for using environment friendly aqueous electrolytes are presented. In this case, the capacitance can be enhanced through pseudo-faradaic contributions involving i) surface functional groups on carbons, ii) hydrogen electrosorption, and iii) redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The most promising system is based on the use of aqueous alkali sulfate as electrolyte allowing voltages as high as 2 V to be reached, due to the high overpotential for di-hydrogen evolution at the negative electrode.

The plan is focused on biosaline agriculture. The distinctive macro-project components are: Lake Eyre is gradually filled to a higher level by controllingevaporation and by pumping seawater from the nearby ocean using cheap tensioned textile tubes. Most of the necessary energy could be produced by photovoltaics, in a very attractive application without electricity storage requirements. Eventually, Lake Eyre is to be lidded with a floating impermeable plastic cap or with buoyant hollow plastic balls that reduce evaporation. Filled with seawater, Lake Eyre can be used as a reservoir for irrigation in biosaline agriculture. Elementary mathematical models for the proposed tasks and rough macro-economical estimations are presented. Based on overall results, we concluded that the macro-project is feasible with existing technologies and could become profitable in a few decades. But beyond payingoff the capital investment, the greatest implementation benefit is the prospect of creating conditions for human settlement in the low-fertility soils of the Lake Eyre basin.

Recently, modern multibeam echosounder systems (MBES) capable of recording backscatter data for the whole water column, not just for the seabed, have become available thus providing data allowing for visualization and analysis of objects other than the seabed such as single fish, fish schools or pollution. Unlike bathymetric sonars, which only capture the seafloor, multibeam systems produce very large amounts of data during surveys. Because of this, storing the data collected during hydrographic or scientific cruises becomes a crucial problem. In this context, the paper proposes a new approach for efficient reduction and storage of MBES records. The results of a sample implementation of the algorithm being tested on several different sets of MBES data are also discussed.","Compression; Efficiency; Reduction; Sonar; Storage","Backscatter data; Computer processing power; Large amounts of data; Multi beam systems; Multi-beam sonar data; Multibeam echosounder systems; Spatial positioning; Visualization and analysis; Compaction; Data visualization; Efficiency; Energy storage; Fish; Hydrographic surveys; Reduction; Sonar; Water pollution; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879116069

Our understanding of the adaptive significance of this diversity, however, remains limited. Determining how variation in sperm structure translates into variation in sperm performance will contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary diversification of sperm form. Here, using data from passerine birds, we test the hypothesis that longer sperm swim faster because they have more available energy. We found that sperm with longer midpieces have higher levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but that greater energy reserves do not translate into faster-swimming sperm. Additionally, we found that interspecific variation in sperm ATP concentration is not associated with the level of sperm competition faced by males. Finally, using Bayesian methods, we compared the evolutionary trajectories of sperm morphology and ATP content, and show that both traits have undergone directional evolutionary change. However, in contrast to recent suggestions in other taxa, we show that changes in ATP are unlikely to have preceded changes in morphology in passerine sperm. These results suggest that variable selective pressures are likely to have driven the evolution of sperm traits in different taxa, and highlight fundamental biological differences between taxa with internal and external fertilization, as well as those with and without sperm storage. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The main advantage of using hydrogen as energy carrier represents the negligible greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most encouraging hydrogen production methods is based on bioethanol. This paper is devoted to the conceptual design of hydrogen production process using bioethanol reforming at an industrial scale (100000 Nm3/h hydrogen equivalent to 300 MW thermal). The syngas will be then converted into hydrogen by water gas shift reaction. Two distinct designs were investigated, one without carbon capture and one with carbon capture. In the design with carbon capture and storage (CCS), the shifted syngas is treated for removing CO2 by gas-liquid absorption process. Considering that bioethanol has a low or negligible fossil carbon footprint, the case with CCS has a negative CO2 emissions contributing to decreasing atmospheric CO2.The conceptual designs of bioethanol reforming were modeled and simulated to produce mass and energy balances for quantification of key plant performance indicators (e.g. bioethanol consumption, plant energy efficiency, ancillary energy consumption, specific CO2 emissions etc.). A particular accent is put on assessment of reforming unit operation conditions, process integration issues of reforming unit and syngas conditioning line with carbon capture unit, modeling and simulation of whole plant, thermal and power integration of various plant sub-systems by pinch analysis.

Although the example used to illustrate the process entails simulations of accident scenarios in the petroleum and process industries by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the methodology is not restricted to any particular model or system. CFD tools are applicable to various aspects of societal safety, including transportation, storage and use of various energy carriers, as well as malicious attacks involving toxic gas or condensed explosives. The approach adopted involves a continuous process where relevant validation cases are classified according to the physical phenomena involved, and prioritized based on parameters such as relevance for typical applications of the model system, measurement quality and repeatability, availability of data, spatial scale, materials or substances used, etc. A model evaluation protocol (MEP) provides guidelines for prioritizing the various validation cases, and for evaluating the simulation results. Statistical methods and visualization techniques are employed for describing the validation range and the associated uncertainties of the model system. Use of the methodology is illustrated for a typical application of the commercial CFD tool FLACS: large-scale gas explosions in congested geometries. The results highlight some of the inherent challenges associated with the interpretation of results from large-scale experiments, and demonstrate how such challenges can be addressed during the model evaluation process.

The area is located close to a treated water storage facility. By extracting enough thermal energy to provide 900 homes with energy for space heating and heating tap water, the temperature of the treated water is lowered by 1.16 WC. This could lead to an increase in the energy required to heat water for domestic purposes. The temperature of tap water is influenced by the temperature of the soil surrounding the drinking water distribution system. The rate at which the water temperature will reach the soil temperature depends on the pipe material, the pipe diameter and the flow velocity. With the help of a network model, the effect of a lower initial water temperature on every customer in Almere was determined. On average, all 75,000 connections would receive slightly cooler water. The energy to heat the extra 0.125 WC is equivalent to the energy required to heat approximately 85 homes. As the extracted thermal energy enables heating of 900 homes, the energy balance is very positive. © IWA Publishing 2013.","Drinking water; Energy balance; Thermal energy","Cost benefit analysis; Energy balance; Flow velocity; Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Water distribution systems; Water treatment; Carbon neutrals; Domestic purpose; Initial water temperature; Neighbourhood; Network modeling; Pipe diameter; Soil temperature; Water temperatures; Potable water; cost-benefit analysis; drinking water; energy balance; heating; household energy; thermal power; water storage; water temperature; Almere; Flevoland; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877786865

Solution of this problem is hindered by the production of a great amount of liquid waste; 99% of its volume is low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste (LILW). The volume of high-level radioactive waste (HLW), which is characterized by high heat release, does not exceed a fraction of a percent. Solubility of glasses at an elevated temperature makes them unfit for immobilization of HLW, the insulation of which is ensured only by mineral-like matrices. At the same time, glasses are a perfect matrix for LILW, which are distinguished by low heat release. The solubility of borosilicate glass at a low temperature is so low that even a glass with relatively low resistance enables them to retain safety of under-ground LILW depositories without additional engineering barriers. The optimal technology of liquid confinement is their concentration and immobilization in borosilicate glasses, which are disposed in shallow-seated geological repositories. The vitrification of 1 m3 liquid LILW with a salt concentration of ∼300 kg/m3 leaves behind only 0. 2 m3 waste, that is, 4-6 times less than by bitumen impregnation and 10 times less than by cementation. Environmental and economic advantages of LILW vitrification result from (1) low solubility of the vitrified LILW in natural water; (2) significant reduction of LILW volume; (3) possibility to dispose the vitrified waste without additional engineering barriers under shallow conditions and in diverse geological media; (4) the strength of glass makes its transportation and storage possible; and finally (5) reliable longterm safety of repositories. When the composition of the glass matrix for LILW is being chosen, attention should be paid to the factors that ensure high technological and economic efficiency of vitrification. The study of vitrified LILW from the Kursk nuclear power plant with high-power channel reactors (HPCR; equivalent Russian acronym, RBMK) and the Kalinin nuclear power plant with pressurized water reactors (PWR; equivalent Russian acronym VVER) after their 14-yr storage in the shallow-seated repository at the MosNPO Radon testing ground has confirmed the safety of repositories ensured by confinement properties of borosilicate matrix. The most efficient vitrification technology is based on cold crucible induction melting. If the content of a chemical element in waste exceeds its solubility in glass, a crystalline phase is formed in the course of vitrification, so that the glass ceramics become a matrix for such waste. Vitrified waste with high Fe; Na and Al; Na, Fe, and Al; Na and B is characterized. The composition of frit and its proportion to waste depends on waste composition. This procedure requires careful laboratory testing. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Borosilicate glass; Curricula; Geology; Glass ceramics; Liquids; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Nuclear power plants; Plants (botany); Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive waste vitrification; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Sodium; Solubility; Temperature; Confinement properties; Economic advantages; Economic efficiency; Elevated temperature; High level radioactive wastes; Kalinin nuclear power plant; Long-term development; Spent nuclear fuels; Pressurized water reactors; glass; immobilization; nuclear power plant; radioactive waste; repository; solubility; vitrification; waste disposal; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877321435

These materials belong to a family of BaLnMn 2O5+δ oxides, which up to now were successfully synthesized for Ln=Y and La-Ho lanthanides. Up to our knowledge, this is the first report on the successful synthesis of BaErMn2O5 and BaErMn2O6, yielding &gt; 95 wt% of the considered compounds. Structural characterization of the materials is given at room temperature, together with in situ XRD studies, performed during oxidation of BaErMn2O5 in air, at elevated temperatures up to 500 °C. A complex structural behavior was observed, with oxidation process of BaErMn2O5 occurring at around 300 °C. The oxidized BaErMn2O6 shows a structural phase transition at about 225 °C. Results of structural studies are supported by thermogravimetric measurements of the oxidation process, performed in air, as well as reduction process, preformed in 5 vol% of H2 in Ar. Additionally, isothermal oxidation/reduction cycles were measured at 500 °C, showing interesting properties of BaErMn2O5+δ, from a point of view of oxygen storage technology. Electrical conductivity of BaErMn2O 5 is of the order of 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature and shows activated character on temperature with activation energy Ea=0.30(1) eV. Positive sign of Seebeck coefficient for this material indicates holes as dominant charge carriers. Oxidized BaErMn2O 6 possesses much higher electrical conductivity, almost 0.2 S cm -1 at room temperature. Additional, about 10-fold increase of electrical conductivity, occurring in the vicinity of 225 °C for this material, can be associated with phase transition from charge/orbital-ordered insulator COI(CE) to paramagnetic metal PM phase. The highest conductivity for BaErMn2O6 was measured near 500 °C and is almost equal to 40 S cm-1, while negative sign of Seebeck coefficient can be associated with electrons being dominant charge carriers. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Along this line, this paper assesses the needs for cooling water and construction materials of pulverised coal combustion (PF), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power generation technologies with and without CCS (Carbon capture and storage). Moreover, the paper evaluates how the integration of CCS technologies influences the economics and operational performance of power plants providing up-dated techno-economic indicators. Introduction of CO2 capture results in an increase of specific water consumption compared to a conventional plant which is more significant in the cases of PF and NGCC (56-62% and 50%) than in IGCC (9-12%). Therefore, the large scale deployment of CCS can have a significant impact on freshwater resources.

These allotropes, which can form a rich variety of 0D-3D forms and demonstrate a set of distinguished properties, have attracted now increased attention and research interest as promising materials, which can compete in various potential applications with "" conventional"" sp2 carbon systems such as fullerenes, nanotubes or graphene and meet the increasing requirements to carbon-based nanomaterials. It can be seen from the increasing number of publications in the last five years that the interest in GYs and GDYs rapidly grows, and a lot of new results have been obtained today. For example, a set of 0D-3D forms of GYs and GDYs have been successfully synthesized and (or) predicted theoretically, and their key properties (structural, mechanical, electronic etc.) have been measured or estimated from ab initio calculations. This gives a strong impetus to further progress in applications of GYs and GDYs as materials for nanoelectronics, energy storage, as anode materials in batteries, as membranes for facilitating selective gas separation etc. All these efforts promote the expansion of the palette of promising carbon materials and accelerate the development of modern carbon-based technologies.","Applications; Grapdiynes; Graphynes; Properties; Simulation","Anodes; Applications; Calculations; Yarn; Ab initio calculations; Carbon allotropes; Gas separations; Grapdiynes; Graphynes; Properties; Research interests; Simulation; Gas permeable membranes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875364393

In our continuous culture system, excess light absorption and growth-limiting nitrogen supply rates were combined, which resulted in accumulation of TAG (from 1.5% to 12.4% w/w) in visible lipid bodies in Neochloris oleoabundans, while cell replication was sustained. A fourfold increase in TAG productivity showed that TAG indeed served as an energy sink. However, the bulk of excess energy was dissipated leading to a significantly reduced biomass productivity and yield of biomass on light. This demonstrates that when aiming at industrial TAG production, sustaining efficient light energy use under nutrient stress is an important trait to look for in potential production organisms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiesel; Lipid accumulation; Microalgae; Nitrogen limitation; Photosynthetic efficiency","Biodiesel; Continuous cell culture; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Productivity; Biomass productivity; Lipid accumulations; Micro-algae; Neochloris oleoabundans; Nitrogen limitation; Nutrient limitations; Photosynthetic efficiency; Potential production; Algae; fatty acid; lipid; nitrogen; triacylglyceride; unclassified drug; algal culture; bioaccumulation; bioenergetics; biofuel; biological production; biomass; biotechnology; growth rate; hypothesis testing; industrial production; lipid; microalga; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; photosynthesis; algal growth; article; biomass production; cell division; energy metabolism; growth rate; light absorption; lipid storage; microalga; Neochloris oleoabundans; nitrogen balance; photobioreactor; priority journal; productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875249309

In this research we extend the recently introduced approach that integrates biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes with the global carbon cycle (using biogenic global warming potential [GWPbio]) to consider the storage period of harvested biomass in the anthroposphere, with subsequent oxidation. We then examine how this affects the climate impact from a bioenergy resource. This approach is compared to several recent methods designed to address the same problem. Using both a 100- and a 500-year fixed time horizon we calculate the GWPbio factor for every combination of rotational and anthropogenic storage periods between 0 and 100 years. The resulting GWPbio factors range from -0.99 (1-year rotation and 100-year storage) to +0.44 (100-year rotation and 0-year storage). The approach proposed in this study includes the interface between biomass growth and emissions and the global carbon cycle, whereas other methods do not model this. These results and the characterization factors produced can determine the climate change benefits or impacts associated with the storage of biomass in the anthroposphere, and the subsequent release of biogenic CO2 with the radiative forcing integrated in a fixed time window. © 2012 by Yale University.","Bioenergy; Biogenic carbon dioxide; Climate credit; Harvested wood products; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment (LCA)","Atmospheric radiation; Biomass; Carbon; Global warming; Life cycle; Bio-energy; Climate credit; Harvested wood products; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Carbon dioxide; bioenergy; biogenic emission; biomass power; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; global warming; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874197534

Transcriptional profiles and cell chemistry sampled simultaneously at all time points provide a comprehensive data set on carbon incorporation, fate, and regulation. An increase in Nile Red fluorescence (a proxy for cellular neutral lipids) was observed throughout the light period, and water-soluble glucans increased rapidly in the light period. A near-linear decline in both glucans and lipids was observed during the dark period, and transcription profile data indicated that this decline was associated with the onset of mitosis. More than 4,500 transcripts that were differentially regulated during the light/dark cycle are identified, many of which were associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Genes not previously described in algae and their regulation in response to light were integrated in this analysis together with proposed roles in metabolic processes. Some very fast light-responding genes in, for example, fatty acid biosynthesis were identified and allocated to biosynthetic processes. Transcripts and cell chemistry data reflect the link between light energy availability and light energy-consuming metabolic processes. Our data confirm the spatial localization of processes in carbon metabolism to either plastids or mitochondria or to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, which are localized to the cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondria.

Box 17, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","The objective of this study is to investigate alternative preparation techniques such as microwave and ultrasound for the recovery and evaluation of carvone and limonene from flaked dill fruits (Anethum graveolens L.). The study indicates that microwave-assisted extraction using hexane is highly recommended to reveal the correct amount of carvone and limonene in dill fruits. In this respect, when hexane is used, microwave-assisted system gives a better carvone yield of 29.96 mg/g compared to 24.54 and 23.49 mg/g for ultrasound and maceration (control) methods respectively. Furthermore, systems using hexane are able to recover high amount of limonene as opposite to systems using water where extracts are characterised by an absence of free fatty acids and a high abundance of carvone translated by high carvone/limonene ratio especially in microwaves (22.88) and ultrasound (6.55). These findings suggest that the intervention of microwaves or ultrasonics enhances extraction selectivity for carvone but have no great effect on limonene recovery. Although the recovered quantity of carvone in water extracts is much lower than the system using hexane due to low solubility of carvone in water, the advantages of using a GRAS solvent such as water are evident. It allows extracts to be readily available for spray application on potatoes' storage. In addition, the proposed enhancement involving ultrasound pre-treatment has helped in increasing carvone yield and has the advantage to be easily implemented on existing extraction processes. Industrial relevance Our study shows that new technologies such as ultrasound and microwaves offer important advantages over conventional methods, such as shorter extraction time, energy saving and selectivity. Furthermore, the pretreatment of samples with ultrasound stands an intelligent tool to enhance extraction yields without jeopardising selectivity. Those aspects are of primary importance for industry to reduce cost and bring greener routes to their established processes. In another aspect, the application of the proposed tandem method involving ultrasonics and water as a solvent would contribute to the creation of a niche market for hydrocarbon-free products, which are very sought after from exigent clients. In addition, the results indicate also that water gives valuable advantages in terms of safety, cleanliness and adoption if we decide to generalise its use at an industry scale for carvone recovery. On top of that, using water as solvent in microwaves or ultrasound systems produces extracts rich in carvone, offering a product that may be used on potato storage on products for example having Bio or Organic labels without hindering their stringent regulations. Furthermore, the use of the produced carvone directly as a spray would not influence the perception of people as carvone represents also the major compound on the widely used condiment Carum carvi L. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carvone; Dill; Extraction composition; Limonene; Microwaves; SDE; Ultrasound","Accident prevention; Energy conservation; Fatty acids; Food storage; Fruits; Hexane; Microwaves; Monoterpenes; Recovery; Solvents; Ultrasonics; Carvone; Dill; Extraction selectivity; Limonene; Microwave-assisted extraction; Preparation technique; Stringent regulations; Ultrasound pre treatments; Extraction; Anethum graveolens; Carum carvi; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873058560

Insulin resistance is associated with a decrease in glucose uptake by muscle and adipose cells and also with a decrease in glycogen synthesis on retention of glucose synthesis by liver cells. Disorders in the insulin signaling cascade on development of insulin resistance can be caused by both changes in functioning of transcriptional factors and in the secretion profile of hormone-like substances. Diacylglycerols and ceramides responsible for activation of some kinases and phosphatases can directly trigger these changes in muscle and liver cells.

However, EVs or plug-in hybrids, which can be seen as a mobile energy storage, connected to different buildings throughout the day, constitute distributed energy resources (DER) markets and can compete with stationary storage, onsite energy production (e.g. fuel cells, PV) at different building sites. Sometimes mobile storage is seen linked to renewable energy generation (e.g. PV) or as resource for the wider macro-grid by providing ancillary services for grid-stabilization. In contrast, this work takes a fundamentally different approach and considers buildings as the main hub for EVs/plug-in hybrids and considers them as additional resources for a building energy management system (EMS) to enable demand response or any other building strategy (e.g. carbon dioxide reduction). To examine the effect of, especially, electric storage technologies on building energy costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a distributed-energy resources adoption problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program with minimization of annual building energy costs or CO2 emissions. The mixed-integer linear program is applied to a set of 139 different commercial building types in California, and the aggregated economic and environmental benefits are reported. To show the robustness of the results, different scenarios for battery performance parameters are analyzed. The results show that the number of EVs connected to the California commercial buildings depend mostly on the optimization strategy (cost versus CO2) of the building EMS and not on the battery performance parameters. The complexity of the DER interactions at buildings also show that a reduction in stationary battery costs increases the local PV adoption, but can also increase the fossil based onsite electricity generation, making an holistic optimization approach necessary for this kind of analyses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","California; Distributed energy resource optimization; Electric storage; Electric vehicles; Energy costs","Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric generators; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Office buildings; Optimization; Pollution control; Renewable energy resources; Ancillary service; Battery performance; Building energy; Building energy management systems; Building sites; California; Carbon dioxide reduction; Charging rate; Commercial building; Demand response; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Economic and environmental benefits; Electricity generation; Energy cost; Mixed integer linear program; Mobile storage; On-site energy; Optimization approach; Optimization strategy; Plug-in hybrids; Renewable energy generation; Stationary batteries; Storage technology; Cost benefit analysis; building; carbon dioxide; cost-benefit analysis; electrical power; electricity generation; fossil fuel; holistic approach; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871878205

The model integrates variable speed pumps for modeling the pumps operation, two water quality objectives (one based on chlorine disinfectant concentrations and one on water age), and tanks sizing cost which are assumed to vary with location and diameter. The water distribution system is subject to extended period simulations, variable energy tariffs, Kirchhoff's laws 1 and 2 for continuity of flow and pressure, tanks water level closure constraints, and storage-reliability requirements. EPANET Example 3 is employed for demonstrating the methodology on two multi-objective models, which differ in the imposed water quality objective (i.e., either with disinfectant or water age considerations). Three-fold Pareto optimal fronts are presented. Sensitivity analysis on the storage-reliability constraint, its influence on pumping cost, water quality, and tank sizing are explored. The contribution of this study is in tailoring design (tank sizing), pumps operational costs, water quality of two types, and reliability through residual storage requirements, in a single multi-objective framework.

However, the tendency of nanoparticles to grow into larger crystallites is an impediment for stable performance. Exemplarily, loss of active surface area by metal particle growth is a major cause of deactivation for supported catalysts. In specific cases particle growth might be mitigated by tuning the properties of individual nanoparticles, such as size, composition and interaction with the support. Here we present an alternative strategy based on control over collective properties, revealing the pronounced impact of the three-dimensional nanospatial distribution of metal particles on catalyst stability. We employ silica-supported copper nanoparticles as catalysts for methanol synthesis as a showcase. Achieving near-maximum interparticle spacings, as accessed quantitatively by electron tomography, slows down deactivation up to an order of magnitude compared with a catalyst with a non-uniform nanoparticle distribution, or a reference Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Our approach paves the way towards the rational design of practically relevant catalysts and other nanomaterials with enhanced stability and functionality, for applications such as sensors, gas storage, batteries and solar fuel production.",,"Active surface area; Catalyst stability; Collective properties; Copper nanoparticles; Cu/ZnO/Al; Distribution of metal; Electron tomography; Enhanced stability; Gas storage; Inter-particle spacing; Metal particle; Methanol synthesis; Particle growth; Rational design; Solar fuels; Stable catalysts; Sustainable production; Catalyst deactivation; Electric impedance tomography; Metal nanoparticles; Particles (particulate matter); Silica; Synthesis gas manufacture; Metal fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871262062

During every session, the ICD was programmed to a monitoring mode to prevent inappropriate therapy delivery. Afterwards, the ICDs were interrogated to ensure proper function. Calculated radiation dose at the ICD site was <1 Gy in all patients. In 5 out of 17 radiation treatments (29%) the ICDs showed 6 malfunctions (35%). We noticed four disturbances in the memory data or device resets during radiation treatment and one case of inappropriate ventricular fibrillation detection due to external noise. In one case a late device data error was observed. All malfunctions occurred at 10 and 18 MeV beam energies.ConclusionDespite the fact that all recommended precautions were taken to minimize the damage to the ICDs during radiotherapy and the calculated dose to the ICDs was <1 Gy, in 29% of the treatments a malfunction occurred. We observed a possible correlation between the beam energy and the malfunctions. This correlation may be due to an interaction between neutrons produced in the head of the linear accelerator at beam energies ≥10 MeV, and boron-10 which is present in the integrated circuit. © The Author 2012.","Implantable cardioverter defibrillator; Malfunctions; Neutrons; Radiotherapy; Reset","aged; article; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; data storage device; device malfunction; devices; female; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; male; photon therapy; priority journal; prosthesis failure; radiation dose; stethoscope; Aged; Defibrillators, Implantable; Equipment Failure; Equipment Failure Analysis; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Neutrons; Radiation Dosage; Radiotherapy, Conformal; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871206307

The aim of the analysis is to provide general conclusions for a wide range of PFCV operating regimes that are chosen for efficient use of the MPC architecture on each particular drive cycle. In relation with FC system of PFCV, the Energy Storage System (ESS) can operate in following regimes: (1) Charge-Sustaining (CS), (2) Charge-Depleting (CD), and (3) Charge-Increasing (CI). Considering the imposed window for the ESS State-Of-Charge (SOC), the MPC can be connected to renewable plug-in Charging Stations (PCSs) to exchange power with Electric Power (EP) system, when it is necessary for both. The Energy Management Unit (EMU) that communicates with the EP system will establish the moments to match the PFCV power demand with supply availability of the EP grid, stabilizing it.

Data are collected from a sample of residents in the Eindhoven region of the Netherlands in 2010. The results indicate that social-demographic characteristics, knowledge, motivation and context factors play important roles in energy-saving behaviour. Specifically, four segments of residents in the study area were identified that clearly differed in their preferences of interventions: cost driven residents, conscious residents, ease driven residents and environment minded residents.

Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirectional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues. Bidirectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future aspects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, compared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors. © 2012 IEEE.","Charging infrastructure; conductive and inductive charging; integrated chargers; levels 1, 2, and 3 chargers; plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); unidirectional/bidirectional chargers","Inductive charging; integrated chargers; levels 1, 2, and 3 chargers; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Plug-ins; unidirectional/bidirectional chargers; Costs; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Hybrid vehicles; Charging (batteries)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870536193

The payment level acts as a floor basis for the PHS operator during the decision-making process to contract fixed payments for wind support or to act market-free on other market segments, through price arbitrage and reserve provision. The market share required for the efficient operation of a PHS facility and the levels of feed-in tariff (FIT) are set mathematically. Main findings put the level of FIT for an applied project in Croatia in the range 42-265. €/MW. h for an average load factor of 20%, depending on particular local conditions, such as the level of wind power curtailment in the system, the power price for charging the storage and the number of pumps and penstocks, which could lower the capital cost. It is claimed that not all services that PHS provides to the electricity system are adequately rewarded by the electricity market, and thus there is a serious uncertainty as to how investment costs in energy storage would be recovered. Other elements, outside the market, are likely to influence the operation of PHS, such as the regulated level of a desirable rate of curtailment of RES power excess, the adequate level of energy security and the reserve margins which PHS could help to ensure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Feed-in tariff; Financial mechanisms; Integration of renewable energy sources; Pumped storage hydro","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Energy storage; Natural resources; Wind power; Capital costs; Croatia; Decision making process; Electricity market; Electricity system; Energy security; Feed-in tariff; Investment costs; Level of fit; Load factors; Local conditions; Market segment; Market share; Power price; Pumped-storage hydro; Renewable energy source; Supporting scheme; Cost benefit analysis; capital; decision making; demand-side management; energy market; energy planning; financial provision; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; integrated approach; investment; pump; renewable resource; storage structure; tariff structure; wind power; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869881772

The analysis includes case studies of Denmark, Portugal, Greece, France and Italy. A high penetration of photovoltaic systems in distribution grids is considered as an additional scenario. A sensitivity analysis is performed in order to examine the smoothening effect of daily demand profiles for different configurations of the battery system. In general, battery-storage systems with low rated power and low battery capacity can smooth the demand sufficiently with the aid of a simple management process. For example, with 1 kW of peak demand, a 30-45% decrease in the variability of the daily demand profile can be achieved with a battery system of 0.1 kW rated power and up to 0.6 kW h battery capacity. However, further smoothening requires higher battery-system capacity and power. In this case, more elaborate management is also needed to use the battery system efficiently. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Municipal wastewater is a potential source of chemical energy, i.e. organic carbon that can be recovered as biogas in sludge digestion. The recovery of chemical energy can be maximised by up-concentration of organic carbon and maximised sludge digestion or by source separation and anaerobic treatment. Even more so, domestic wastewater is a source of thermal energy. Through warm water conservation and heat recovery, for example with shower heat exchangers, substantial amounts of energy can be saved and recovered from the water cycle. Water can also be an important renewable energy source, i.e. as underground thermal energy storage.
