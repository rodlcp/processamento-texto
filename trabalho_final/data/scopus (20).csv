Such data exist from a series of large-scale land-surface experiments but access to them has been difficult. It is the objective of this paper to demonstrate how the System for Information in NOPEX (SINOP) could be set up to provide a combination of data archive and tool for executing various time-limited and long-term field activities. Setting up and running SINOP involved both technical and psychological issues. The major technical problems were associated with (i) the uninterrupted flow of large data volumes, (ii) data homogeneity, and (iii) the exploding technology development. The psychological and organisational problems were more difficult to tackle than the technical problems. Funding agencies assumed somebody else would take care of data archiving and documentation, academic organisations have difficulties to compete with the private market for database managers, many individual scientists were unwilling to deliver their datasets and, especially, unwilling to document them. It is suggested that changes in attitudes from scientists, academic organisations, and publishers are needed to give credit for the publication of good datasets and for the production of good documentation about them. CDs incorporating a subset of SINOP with well-documented datasets from NOPEX operations in 1994 and 1995 are published together with this NOPEX Special Issue. The CDs include climate variables, such as radiation, fluxes of heat, momentum, and water vapour, and various energy storage terms as well as hydrological variables from 13 sites within the central-Swedish NOPEX region, at the southern boundary of the boreal zone. The publication of these data is seen as a step towards giving data-set owners proper and citeable credit for their work.","Datasets; NOPEX; Remote-sensing; SINOP","climate prediction; data management; information system; research program",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033621482

One of the largest uncertainties in present-day global climate models resides with the understanding of processes in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) system. Continuous, long-term data are needed in order to correctly quantify balances of water, energy and CO2 in this system and to correctly model it. It is the objective of this paper to demonstrate how a combined system of existing sensor, computer, and network technologies could be set up to provide continuous and reliable long-term SVAT-process data from a forested site under almost all environmental conditions. The Central Tower Site (CTS) system was set up in 1993-1994 in a 25 m high boreal forest growing on a highly heterogeneous till soil with a high content of stones and blocks. It has successfully monitored relevant states and fluxes in the system, such as atmospheric fluxes of momentum, heat, water vapour and CO2, atmospheric profiles of temperature, water vapour, CO2, short-and long-wave radiation, heat storage in soil and trees, sap-flow and a variety of ecophysiological properties, soil-water contents and tensions, and groundwater levels, rainfall and throughfall. System uptime has been more than 90% for most of its components during the first 5 years of operation. Results from the first 5 years of operation include e.g., budgets for energy, water and CO2, information on important but rarely occurring events such as evaporation from snow-covered canopies, and reactions of the forest to extreme drought. The carbon budget shows that the forest may be a sink of carbon although it is still growing. The completeness of the data has made it possible to test the internal consistency of SVAT models. The pioneering set-up at the CTS has been adopted by a large number of SVAT-monitoring sites around the world. Questions concerning tower maintenance, long-term calibration plans, maintenance of sensors and data-collection system, and continuous development of the computer network to keep it up to date are, however, only partly of interest as a research project in itself. It is thus difficult to get it funded from usual research-funding agencies. The full value of data generated by the CTS system can best be appreciated after a decade or more of continuous operation. Main uses of the data would be to evaluate how SVAT models handle the natural variability of climate conditions, quantification of water, carbon and energy budgets during various weather conditions, and development of new parameterisation schemes in global and regional climate models.","Carbon balance; Energy balance; Evaporation; Heat flux; Long term; Radiation; SVAT monitoring; Water balance","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; climate change; forest ecosystem; global climate; research program",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033621442

Fluxes were measured continuously with eddy-correlation systems from a 100 m tower. Surface conductance and potential evaporation were estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation. The overall average evaporation during the 947-days observation period was 1.07 mm d-1. The average evaporation from June to December 1994 was 1.25 mm d-1, 1.07 mm d-1 luring 1995, and 0.97 mm d-1 during 1996. Maximum daily rates were typically 4 mm d-1 around mid-summer in 1994 and 995 and slightly less in 1996. During the winter period from November to March, the evaporation sometimes reached 0.5 mm d-1. Generally, the actual evaporation followed the dynamics of the potential evaporation fairly well. As a total for the entire period, the actual evaporation accounted for 918 mm, or 69% of the potential evaporation (1332 mm). There were three major time periods with a considerable evaporation deficit: the late summer (July-August) 1994, the late summer (August) 995, and the spring to early summer (March-June) 1996 (Table 1). The first two periods were correlated with low soil moisture while the last probably was caused by low winter temperatures. A surface conductance model showed little dependence on soil moisture. Radiation and vapour pressure deficit were the most important factors. When soil water was not limiting, the diurnal courses of surface conductance showed a steep increase in the morning followed by .n almost linear decrease, the coniferous trend caused by stomatal control. During periods of water stress a midday depression occurred after the morning maximum. During wintertime, the surface conductance hardly ever approached to zero. A simple model for surface conductance based on global radiation and vapour pressure deficit fitted the estimated data fairly well except for calm nights with poor turbulent mixing. This was apparently due to water vapour storage within and above the canopy. Including the friction velocity in the model parameterisation improved the fitting considerably.","Eddy-correlation; Frost damage; Mid-day depression; Penman-monteith equation; Potential evaporation; Storage","boreal forest; energy flux; evaporation; seasonal variation; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033621436

In this work, we present a systematic study of structural modifications and hydrogen absorption-desorption kinetics of ball-milled magnesium hydride. Structural investigations showed that after only 2 h of milling, a metastable orthorhombic (γ) magnesium hydride phase is formed. A Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the 20 h milled sample gave a proportion of 74 wt.% MgH2, 18 wt.% γ MgH2 and 8 wt.% MgO. The hydrogen capacity and sorption kinetics were measured before and after milling. We found that the sorption kinetics are much faster for the milled sample compared to the unmilled one. This explains the fact that the hydrogen desorption temperature of the ball-milled sample as measured by pressured differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC), is reduced by 64 K compared to the unmilled sample. There is no significant change of the storage capacity upon milling and the absorption plateau pressure does not change. From the desorption curves, the activation energy was deduced. The milling also increased the specific surface area. This was confirmed by SEM micrographs and BET measurements. Possible mechanisms explaining the improved kinetics are presented.",,"Absorption; Activation energy; Ball milling; Desorption; Differential scanning calorimetry; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Nanostructured materials; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray crystallography; Magnesium hydride; Rietveld analysis; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033285161

Safety and stability concerns associated with solvent-based electrolytes has necessitated the use of lithium intercalation materials (rather than lithium metal) as anodes, which decreases the energy storage capacity per unit mass. The use of solid lithium ion conductors - based on glasses, ceramics or polymers - as the electrolyte would potentially improve the stability of a lithiummetal anode while alleviating the safety concerns. Glasses and ceramics conduct via a fast ion mechanism, in which the lithium ions move within an essentially static framework. In contrast, the motion of ions in polymer systems is similar to that in solvent-based electrolytes - motion is mediated by the dynamics of the host polymer, thereby restricting the conductivity to relatively low values. Moreover, in the polymer systems, the motion of the lithium ions provides only a small fraction of the overall conductivity, which results in severe concentration gradients during cell operation, causing premature failure. Here we describe a class of materials, prepared by doping lithium ions into a plastic crystalline matrix, that exhibit fast lithium ion motion due to rotational disorder and the existence of vacancies in the lattice. The combination of possible structural variations of the plastic crystal matrix and conductivities as high as 2 x 10-4 cm-1 at 60°C make these materials very attractive for secondary battery applications.",,"electrolyte; glass; imide; lithium; methylpyrrolidinium imide; unclassified drug; article; ceramics; crystal structure; electric battery; ion conductance; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; structure analysis; temperature measurement; thermal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033576550

The infrared pulse photoionizes them, thus promoting extra carriers into the excitation channel of the Er3+ ion and leading to an additional luminescence. By scanning the wavelength of the free-electron laser ionization spectra of shallow centers participating in the energy transfer are obtained.

Joensuu, PO Box 111, FIN-80101, Joensuu, Finland","Eddy correlation and stem flow measurements were coupled with detailed microclimate and soil measurements made in a boreal Scots pine forest in the late growing season of 1998 to determine sensible and latent heat fluxes from the soil and the canopy separately. A 'resistance/energy' model is constructed and parametrized in order to reproduce the dynamics of water and heat exchange between the soil, the canopy and the atmosphere as a part of a larger forest ecosystem model (FinnFor; Kellomaki and Vaisanen, 1997). Unique features of the present model are that (1) energy flux equations are expressed in terms of conceptual resistances and their solutions are obtained by closing two surface energy budget equations defined separately for canopy and soil surface; (2) the forest canopy is divided into shaded and sunlit fractions in the radiation transfer submodel and the canopy resistance submodels; (3) a numerical integrating solutions are derived separately for net radiation absorption in the canopy, bulk canopy resistance and the bulk aerodynamic resistances of the forest; and (4) iterative determinations of canopy water potential based on a classical one-dimensional water flow model enable the model to represent explicitly the interaction between the above-ground and the below-ground water dynamics. The model is validated against 19-day flux measurements. In general, the total system sensible heat flux (H), total system latent heat flux (λE), canopy latent heat flux (λE(c)), and soil surface heat flux (G(s)) computed by the model matched well with the measured data. Based on 1/2 h flux measurements, daily λE varied from 0.50-7.38 MW m-2, H from 0.64-8.3 MW m-2, and from 0.30-6.93 MW m-2. The Bowen ratio (H/λE) ranged from - 4.5 to 9.8, but 82% of the values for the Bowen ratio were within 0.5-2.5. The model computations showed that daily λE(c) and H(c) accounted for 21-64% and 43-66% of the daily total system flux, respectively. Daily soil latent heat (λE(s)) and soil sensible heat (H(s)) fluxes accounted for 0.02-4.5% and 0.05-7.6%, respectively, and the daily energy storage within the canopy (S(c)) and G(s) accounted for 0.1-7.2% and 0.8-5.6%, respectively. Plotting of 1/2 h flux data against a single environmental factor indicated that a 68% change in λE(c) and a 72% change in H(c) can be explained by a change in canopy radiation absorption (R(nc)) at the 5% probability level. The high correlation between the canopy fluxes and R(nc) could be related to the moderate weather conditions and high soil water content during the selected days, whereas λE(s), H(s), S(c) and G(s) give no significant correlation with R(n). As expected, λE(c) was strongly dependent on canopy resistance (r(cs)), but less impact on aerodynamic resistances during most of the measuring time. The proportion of energy partitioning in H and λE exhibited a clear diurnal trend and was mainly controlled by the system total resistance and the vapour pressure deficit, but less related to changes in soil water content.","Boreal coniferous forests; Eddy correlation; Resistance-energy model; Sap flow; Water and heat fluxes","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; canopy exchange; coniferous forest; ecological modeling; eddy; heat flux; microclimate; soil-vegetation interaction; stemflow; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344718561

At synchrotron radiation facilities, where beamlines are channeled out of the storage ring, a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum, with a maximum energy of the stored particle beam, will be present. At the advanced photon source (APS), where the stored beam energy is 7 GeV, bremsstrahlung generated in the straight sections of the insertion device beamlines, which are a total of 15.38 m in length, can be significant.

In addition to consumer's own control system also the heat delivery and heat storing system make load control possible. Then we can talk about DSM of heat load in general. Load management is defined as direct or indirect control of consumers' load. The target for district heating load management and demand side management is to make production more economical and to decrease environmental impacts. In some case the benefits can be also socio-economical. Both investment and operation have to be considered in heat and electricity production. Because of electricity market liberation DSM also in DH-market is coming more complicated although more advantages could be also received. More reliable production and less use of reserve and peak load boilers can be added to economical advantages of DSM. The economical benefits of DSM are best achieved in combined heat and power production plants (CHP). More electric generation is possible when electric demand is high and the market price is high enough. CHP production is becoming more utilised when district heat market is wider used in Europe. DH penetration is almost 100 % in Nordic countries (especially in Finland and Denmark), but there is potential to double the DH market in Europe. Heat load and utilisation hours of DH network should be increased especially in summer. District cooling by using absorption technique with DH supply is one of the most important ways to increase DH supply utilisation in summer. Lower environmental impacts of CHP are concrete advantages in addition to economical benefits. Basic energy supplies with low-cost fuels can be increased in the time of varying loads, low consumption and in the case of disturbances in energy production by using load and demand side management. Thus boiler start up or stand by can be avoided. Heat load in buildings could be increased or decreased in some hour period by temperature control. Thermal capacity of the building compensates small temperature variation so that the consumer does not feel the management. Tap water load is not limited in DSM. District heating network as heat storage is operated by disturbed outgoing temperature compared to the set point. In that way the network is charged or discharged by temperature. Time delays of the control depend on extent of the network. Delays are longer during small load period than high load period. Charging time of the network storage is typically 2 to 3 hours and after that the storage is discharged by itself because of the consumers' control equipment. Separated heat storage, e.g. large steel tanks, can be operated independent of the DH consumer's system. The storage tank is used for optimisation of the heat supplies especially in CHP plants. When charged the tank is like a consumer and when discharged it is like a heat supply. Same types of demand and supply side management methods are suitable to DH-systems in Northern countries and also in Europe. There are some differences for design values of district heating systems in Europe, but still the operation principles are same. The most remarkable difference is the direct or indirect connection of consumers. Differences between electrical systems are remarkable in Europe and therefore it has also impacts to economy of DSM in DH side. If CHP is becoming more utilised in Europe, it can be expected that DSM in district heating is wider used and more economical. Design of DSM methods is strong depended on local circumstances. Generally district cooling has important role in warm climate countries and the control of heat loads depending on electricity demand is becoming more important in cold climate countries. Because of the fast developments in data transmission and automation systems DSM will be wider utilised and implementation is easier in future. Through R&D and demonstration it should be found out best methods of implementation to existing and full capacity reached DH systems and on the other side design and develop more flexible solution packages for DSM in new district heated areas.","Control; Demand Side Management; District cooling; District heating; Economy; Energy consumption; Energy production; Energy suppliers; Heat storage; Load management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889227193

The behavior of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride films as well as the behavior of the oxide/nitride interface are specifically analyzed. We first recall some generalities on how an MNOS structure, used as a non-volatile memory cell, works, i.e. how data can be written, read and erased. We then recall the basic phenomena which underlie this ""memory"" behavior. We also recall the basic equations which link the charge distribution, the potential distribution and the currents in such a structure. We then briefly present several models used to explain and quantify how the charge is injected in the nitride and how this leads to a variation in threshold voltage of any transistor possessing an MNOS structure instead of a regular gate structure. Various new results on the origin and the characteristics of nitride traps are then presented. Silicon nitride is shown to contain amphoteric traps possessing three states of charge, whose origin is mainly attributed to Silicon Dangling Bonds, not linked to a Nitrogen atom. These traps are shown to be widely distributed throughout the nitride and possess numerous energy levels. Recent models describing the switching and/or the retention behavior of MNOS structures are mentioned next. In all these models one considers that the traps are distributed uniformly in the nitride bulk, although in some of them, an additional trap density is introduced at the nitride/oxide interface. MNOS memory devices are now proposed as commercial products. However, the fact that the stored charge is spread throughout the nitride, limits the possibilities of scaling down these devices. This limitation can be circumvented by introducing a third insulating layer, made of silicon oxide, between the nitride and the gate electrode. These new devices are called MONOS or SONOS, depending on the electrode material (metal or polysilicon). Their behavior can be modeled and the models take into account the presence of amphoteric traps. The ONO (Oxide/Nitride/Oxide) structure is also studied for its applications as a storage capacitor for dynamic random access memory and as an inter-gate insulator for floating gate memories. The physics and the modeling of the ONO insulator are presented. © 1999 Elsevier B.V.

Remote sensing of canopy light absorption, for example, enables an important component of canopy carbon assimilation rates to be estimated over extensive areas. Modelling of carbon exchange and net storage may also be facilitated, owing to natural selection for a narrow range of light-use efficiencies among a wide range of plant functional types. This ""functional convergence"" arises from resource allocation strategies that appear to maximise the benefits of carbon (energy) and nutrients (e.g. mainly nitrogen) relative to the costs of acquisition. Convergence is most evident on a leaf mass per unit ground area basis, a measure that more closely reflects the costs of resource acquisition than does leaf area. We demonstrate, however, that light absorption and utilisation are decoupled so that convergence is to be expected on gross production rather than net production, owing to differences in respiratory costs associated with synthesis and maintenance of plant constituents and associated ""payback intervals"" on carbon investment in different functional types. A link between fitness and carbon gain is noted in relation to gross primary production. We conclude that, while functional convergence provides a basis for the use of remote sensing of light absorption in measurement of primary production, models driven with light absorption need to include terms that describe the actual respiratory costs of maintenance and synthesis. Quantification of these processes will improve large area primary production models, and enhance the value of the information that can be acquired by remote sensing. © 1999 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956790535

Acting as flippases, some of these genes are responsible for the maintainance of phospholipid asymmetry, which is critical for membrane integrity. Recently, we could show that ABCG1 and ABCA1 substantially contribute to transmembrane cholesterol and phospholipid transport in human myeloid monocytic cells. Further, among all known human ABC transporters a subset was identified acting as lipid sensitive genes. Evidence for an involvement of ABCA1 in the stability and function of erythrocytes and platelets comes from ABCA1 mutant mice. Hematological and lipid parameters indicate that ABCA1 -/- mice parallel the phenotype of Tangier disease in humans, an inborn error in cellular lipid transport. Since Tangier patients suffer from hemolysis and impaired platelet function ABCA1 and other members of this gene family are potentially involved in the membrane maintainance of platelets and red bloods cells. In order to elucidate the role of ABC transporters concerning this issue, an approach was undertaken to investigate the differentiation dependent expression of ABC transporters using human cord blood cells. By means of multiplex gene analysis the expression of all currently known human ABC transporters during megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation of cord blood cells provides new insights in the cluster of ABC transporters potentially responsible for membrane integrity.

In particular, the dclink voltage variation under voltage sag and its dependence on source impedance, dclink inductance, and output load is computed. It is shown that, for larger source impedance, the dclink voltage variation under a voltage sag is also large and increases the susceptibility of an ASD and may result in a nuisance trip. The results from the analysis are plotted in perunit quantities and serve as a design guide to assess ASD performance for a variety of sags. In order to improve the performance of ASD's, this paper proposes an integrated boost converter approach. This approach provides ridethrough to critical ASD load during voltage sags without any additional energy storage device. Upon detection of a voltage sag, the boost converter operates with suitable duty ratio and maintains the dclink voltage within acceptable limits. This prevents nuisance tripping and facilitates continuous operation of critical ASD load at rated torque. The proposed integrated boost converter does not introduce any additional semiconductors in the series path of the power flow and is low in cost. A commercially available 480V 22kVA ASD is modified with the integrated boost converter approach, and details are discussed.

Most commercially successful lithium-ion cells use the lithiated cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathode materials, carbon-based anode materials, liquid organic carbonate based electrolyte and are available in both wound cylindrical and flat-mandrel prismatic cell designs in several sizes to 3.6 Ah. While the commercially available cells demonstrate the viability, performance and economic potential of the lithium-ion technology for consumer applications, they are not suitable for aerospace applications. Aerospace batteries require very high reliability, outstanding low temperature operation, exceptionally long cycle life, high specific energy and larger cell sizes. In addition, due to the high cost and inaccessibility of many of the aerospace applications, these battery systems must have designed-in reliability that far exceeds industrial standards.

With the attainment of independence in 1947, a dispute arose with India over the proprietary rights to the use of waters, particularly, the three Eastern rivers. India's threat to stop supplies from these rivers endangered the very existence of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan. It was soon apparent that development of storage reservoirs was an imperative necessity for the agriculture economy of Pakistan and the survival of its people. The water dispute was eventually resolved under the good offices of the World Bank and the division of the Indus river system was agreed upon the ""Indus Waters Treaty"" of 1960, thus providing an engineering solution to a political problem. Tarbela is one of the World's greatest water resources development projects built on one of the World's largest rivers- the Indus known as the ' Abasin ' or the ' father of rivers'. The project consists of a 9,000 feet (2,743 meters ) long, 465 feet (143 meters) high (above the river bed) earth and rockfill embankment across the entire width of river with two Spillways cutting through the left bank discharging 1.5 M. cusecs (42,476 cumecs) into a side valley. Two auxiliary embankments dams close the gap in the left bank valley. A group of 4 Tunnels (Tunnels # 1,2,3 & 4 ), each half a mile long, and Tunnel # 5 through the right and left abutment rocks respectively have been constructed for irrigation releases and power generation. During the construction operations, the tunnels on left abutment rock were used initially for river diversion. On three of these Tunnels, 2 Power Houses for generating electricity to a tune of 3,478 MW have been constructed are in operation, which supply 40% of demand of the whole nation. There are many ' first ' at Tarbela. The dam is the world's largest, the five tunnels, 14 meters in dia are also the biggest ever built, the outlet gates are again the largest for such high heads, the spillways are yet again large in capacity that the energy carried by the water at peak discharge is equivalent to 40 MHP.",,"Agriculture; Electric power generation; Electricity; Embankments; Irrigation; Project management; Rivers; Economic development; Indus river system; Tarbela Dam project; Dams; Agriculture; Dams; Irrigation; Planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645035650

Many units failed after autoclave stress, and these parts recovered after conventional deporting using nitric acid and a hot plate. Based on the recovery of the units, the failures were determined to be fuse-related because the nitric acid cleared the fuse cavities during depotting. Chemical analysis after thermally extracting the die from the package revealed an antimony-rich material in failing fuse cavities. Source of the antimony was linked to antimony trioxide added to the plastic package as a fire retardant. However, it was unclear whether the antimony-rich material caused the failure or if it was an artifact of thermal depotting. A new approach that did not thermally or chemically alter the fuse cavities was employed to identify the failing fuses. This approach used a combination of back-side grinding, dimpling, and back-side microprobing. The antimony-rich material found in the fuse cavity was confirmed using SEM and TEM-based EDS analysis, and it is believed to be a major contributing factor to fuse failures. However, it is unclear whether the short was caused by the antimony-rich material or by a reaction between that material and residual aluminum (oxide) left in the fuse cavity after the laser blows.",,"Aluminum fuses; Thermal depotting; Aluminum; Antimony; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Failure analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Stress analysis; Transmission electron microscopy; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542330835

Polyaniline and polypyrrole are effectively doped with electroactive polyoxometalates ([PMo12O40]3-) or ferricyanide ([(FeCN)6]3-) onions as the only doping species. The high charge and size of these anions prevents their deintercalation during reduction in most cases. These hybrids can be synthesised by chemical (bulk powders) and electrochemical (films) methods. For [PMo12O40]3-, nine aniline/pyrrole rings are found for anion in each case and the anion stays in the polymer matrix even after reduction at -0.4V (vs. Ag/AgCl, 2.6 vs. Li). In the case of the polypyrrole-Fe(CN6) hybrid, the pyrrole-ring/Fe(CN)6 ratio was around 10-12, depending on the temperature of synthesis. Temperature also affects the electrical conductivity, with the best values around 60Scm-1 (0°C). Fe(CN)6 stays in the polymer matrix when the hybrid material is reduced in organic media. Hybrids with PMo12 can intercalate up to 5.3 Li+ upon discharge (52Ah/Kg). The hybrid with Fe(CN)6 intercalates 2.7 lithium ions per formula unit (69Ah/Kg). Finally, we note that the incorporation of photoactive anions such as the polyoxometalates in COPs can yield hybrids with interesting photophysical and photocatalytic properties.","Conducting organic polymers; Hexacyanoferrate; Hybrid organic-inorganic electrodes; Insertion; Lithium batteries; Polyoxometalates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345879625

The approach is based on a concept of reducible superstructure and exergy load distribution analysis. It starts by building a specific reducible structure of the process flowsheet called the 'competitive process' superstructure. A two-step exergy analysis is carried out on the superstructure to reduce it to a final optimal flowsheet topology. In the first step, only the design options with the highest impact on the utilizable exergy coefficient of the overall flowsheet is kept for subsequent analysis. In the next step, the distribution of exergy loads from the less efficient units to the more efficient ones makes it possible to relocate the units inside the flowsheet. The new approach was applied for the design of a gas separation section within a benzene synthesis chemical plant. It has been found that the overall exergy efficiency of the benzene synthesis is highest with the design option using a membrane for hydrogen recuperation and an absorber for benzene recuperation. The final step is the relocation of the absorber achieved through the application of the exergy load distribution analysis.

This test program was initiated by first fabricating a 41 cm×41 cm×3.9 cm aluminum honeycomb panel with a partially-expanded core (unfilled weight 2.7 kg). The unit was then filled with 3 kg of the paraffin n-hexadecane and hermetically sealed. The sealed unit was then tested to determine its energy storage capacity, thermal stability, geometry limitations, and material compatibility.

The model investigated contains a Thermal Control Unit (TCU) embedded in an epoxy polymer. A TCU is an enclosure that contains Phase Change Material (PCM) and a thermal conductivity enhancer, is located at the power source, and acts as an energy storage and heat-spreading module. Physical experiments are performed to investigate the performance improvements of introducing a TCU into an embedded system and are used to validate the accuracy of the numerical model. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the effect duty cycles and substrate thermal conductivities have on the thermal performance of the electronic wearable computer system with passive energy storage. Additionally, the TCU is numerically modeled to determine the influence of boundary conditions on TCU performance. To quantify the improvements of the system, metrics are developed from analyzing the thermal evolution of the TCU parameters, such as temperature fields, temperature bands, PCM characteristics, and power loads. Results show that using a TCU for passive energy storage significantly increases the portable system's operational performance. Duty cycles with the same average power over the duration of the cycle do not influence the length of the PCM phase change time, but do impact the mean value of the temperature fluctuation bands.",,"Computer simulation; Embedded systems; Epoxy resins; Heat storage; Thermal conductivity of solids; Phase change material (PCM); Thermal control unit (TCU); Electronics packaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342297940

As totally biodegradable, melt processable polymers, they are attracting considerable interest in applications for disposable plastic products, packaging materials and as biomedical polymers. PHAs are produced by industrial scale fermentation processes and sold by Monsanto under the trade name Biopol®. A new quantitative technique using natural abundance, solution 13C NMR was developed to monitor the intracellar formation and degradation in near real time of poly(β-hydroxyalkanoates)(PHAs) in vivo (in living cells) in Alcaligenes eutrophus and Pseudomonas oleovorans. The 13C NMR technique is a faster, easier and more accurate method than that of extracting the polymers from freeze dried cells. Because the measurement occurs in near real time, the NMR technique shows great potential for determining optimal harvest times during the fermentation process. It is more direct and sensitive than current monitoring methods (microscopy or optical density, OD). We have seen instances where using OD to determine harvest times would have resulted in a 30% lower yield of polymer than if 13C NMR were used. An additional 13C NMR technique was developed to determine the mole % of the subunits in PHA heteropolymers. It is a superior and more accurate technique for charaterization of PHAs than methanolysis of the isolated polymer and analysis by gas chromatography, saving both time and money.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041411284

With the attainment of independence in 1947, a dispute arose with India over the proprietary rights to the use of waters, particularly, the three Eastern rivers. India's threat to stop supplies from these rivers endangered the very existence of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan. It was soon apparent that development of storage reservoirs was an imperative necessity for the agriculture economy of Pakistan and the survival of its people. The water dispute was eventually resolved under the good offices of the World Bank and the division of the Indus river system was agreed upon the 'Indus Waters Treaty' of 1960, thus providing an engineering solution to a political problem. Tarbela is one of the World's greatest water resources development projects built on one of the World's largest rivers- the Indus known as the 'Abasin' or the 'father of rivers'. The project consists of a 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) long, 465 feet (143 meters) high (above the river bed) earth and rockfill embankment across the entire width of river with two Spillways cutting through the left bank discharging 1.5 M. cusecs (42,476 cumecs) into a side valley. Two auxiliary embankments dams close the gap in the left bank valley. A group of 4 Tunnels (Tunnels 1,2,3 and 4), each half a mile long, and Tunnel 5 through the right and left abutment rocks respectively have been constructed for irrigation releases and power generation. During the construction operations, the tunnels of left abutment rock were used initially for river diversion. On three of these Tunnels, 2 Power Houses for generating electricity to a tune of 3,478 MW have been constructed are in operation, which supply 40% of demand of the whole nation. There are many 'first' at Tarbela. The dam is the world's largest, the five tunnels, 14 meters in dia are also the biggest ever built, the outlet gates are again the largest for such high heads, the spillways are yet again large in capacity that the energy carried by the water at peak discharge is equivalent to 40 MHP.",,"construction technique; dam; embankment; water supply; dam construction; tunneling; water supply; Pakistan",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033507899

However, to-date this remains unpractised on a regular basis mainly because of economic reasons. The DRI produced by several methods are expensive and difficult to store/handle in large quantities because of its reactive nature and thus DRI in blast furnace remains unacceptable. CPR (Composite Pre-Reduced) pellets developed at BHU-Varanasi (India) is a kind of DRI which indicates less storage problems and estimated to be cheaper than coke price in India. CPR pellets contain iron in highly metallised state in the core encased in partially reduced shell of iron oxide as protective layer for safe and easy storage. The lower cost of CPR pellets is mainly because of the use of cheap raw materials and energy source for firing without needing expensive reducing atmosphere for causing metallisation in the pellet. The pellet firing system is simple requiring less capital. The paper gives details of the CPR pellet preparation technique and then it evaluates its chemical and physical properties for blast furnace use. It also gives the estimated cost of production under Indian condition and mentions the various merits associated with the use of CPR pellet in the blast furnace.

Forests contribute to the fight against the greenhouse effect in three ways: (1) carbon sequestering; (2) CO2 avoidance through substitution by wood of energy-intensive materials such as plastics, aluminium, steal, cement and brick, (3) CO2 avoidance by using timber instead of fossil fuels for generating energy. The effect of utilization of wood is even greater than that of fixation. Carbon storage would be optimized in plantation forests (reforestation and afforestation), harvested at the time of maximum mean annual increment, when the lifetime of the products exceeds the rotation period. The rate of carbon absorption by trees and forests is a function of growth and age - the rate is higher when they are fast-growing and young. There are some possibilities to increase the carbon accumulation ability of our forests: reconstruction of stands into ones of more adequate species composition; tending of the forest and to the creating of an opportunity to obtain so-called ""thinning-induced increment""; the introduction of an understorey which could result in a increment in standing volume; the increase in the fraction of humus in forest soils which could be regulated by means of a preference for the forest regeneration model; resignation from clear-cutting and the afforestation of abandoned agricultural land. The role of Polish forests in reducing global change is not so important as far as the proportional contribution to world forest cover is concerned (0,002%) but from the domestic point of view and in the light of the obligation under the Kyoto Protocol, forest, forestry and wood utilization present a high interest for our environmental policy and an important element in the national development strategy into the 21st century.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Forest management; Wood utilization","carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; forest management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033495552

The mixing operation in a Haake batch mixer leads to a maximum torque for a level of specific energy (500-600 kJ/kg) and temperature (50-60 °C) quite independent of mixing conditions (rotor speed, mixing time, filling ratio). The gluten/glycerol dough behaves as a classical gluten/water dough, with a storage modulus higher than the loss modulus over the frequency range under study. A temperature increase induces a decrease of moduli, but the material is not thermorheologically simple. Glycerol has a plasticizing effect, which can be classically described by an exponential dependence. Mixing conditions influence the viscoelastic properties of the material, mainly through the specific mechanical energy input (to 2000 kJ/kg) and temperature increase (to 80 °C). Above 50 °C, specific mechanical energy highly increases the complex modulus. The aggregation of proteins, as evidenced by size-exclusion chromatography measurements, occurs later as the dough temperature reaches 70 °C. The nature of network interactions and the respective influence of hydrophobic and disulphide contribution is discussed. A general expression is proposed for describing the viscous behaviour of a gluten/glycerol mix, which could seem simplistic for such a complex rheological behaviour, but would remain sufficient for modelling the flow behaviour in a twin screw extruder.","Batch mixer; Bioplastics; Glycerol; Viscoelastic properties; Wheat gluten","liquid-solid mixing; rheology; temperature effect; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033405286

Results were correlated in terms of Nusselt number, Prandtl number and Reynolds number and comparisons were made with existing correlations developed with similar storage media. The size of the bed and thermal energy used in the study were relatively large, thus making the results directly applicable to industrial waste heat recovery and other such systems. The maximum temperature for the bed was about 1000°C (1830°F) with flue gas as the operating fluid in the storage mode and atmospheric air in the recovery mode. Because most related previous studies were not necessarily focused on high-temperature applications, the published gas-particle heat transfer correlations were obtained at relatively low temperature ranges, generally at room temperature or at temperatures slightly above room temperature. Moreover, only a few of the previously reported correlations attempted to associate the results with the corresponding uncertainty margins. The results from this study give a convective gas-particle heat transfer correlation for high - temperature thermal energy storage applications. Also, due to substantial uncertainties associated with the measurements of the heat transfer coefficient, it is significant to note that no firm conclusions can be reached on the validity or non-validity of previously reported related correlations for which the uncertainty margins were not reported.Experimental measurements of the forced convection gas-particle heat transfer coefficient in the packed bed, high-temperature, thermal energy storage system were carried out using a custom-made experimental facility.

Zooplankton exist in environments where food availability varies greatly over time, and success depends in part on the ability to store resources when food is abundant and to conserve them when food is scarce. This paper reports on interspecific differences in the size of stored reserves, and in respiration rate during food deprivation, of four species of planktonic rotifers. 2. The size of reserves varied from 42 to 71% of initial (well-fed) body mass. Interspecific differences in reserve size explained some of the previously observed differences in starvation time. 3. The initial response of respiration rate to food deprivation was quite variable between species. Brachionus calyciflorus was the only species to conserve energy by decreasing respiration rate in response to food deprivation. In contrast, the respiration rate of starved Asplanchna priodonta increased, while that of A. silvestrii and Synchaeta pectinata did not change, during food deprivation. 4. Theory predicts that temporal variation in resource level may facilitate the coexistence of competing species. This theory depends upon trade-offs between traits that confer competitive success indifferent environments. Although rotifers show a trade-off between competitive ability and maximum population growth rate, we found no evidence for trade-offs between either of those two traits and the size of reserves.","Respiration; Rotifers; Starvation; Storage; Zooplankton","bioenergy; biological parameters; breathing; competition; environment; growth rate; population growth; size; species difference; environmental conditions; fat reserve; food availability; interspecific variation; physiological response; respiration; zooplankton; Asplanchna priodonta; Asplanchna silvestrii; Brachionus calyciflorus; Rotifera; Synchaeta pectinata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033397322

These effects may be minimized by the use of appropriate dilution and collection media, containing balanced salts, energy sources, egg yolk and some protein. Dilution and flow- cytometric sorting of spermatozoa, which involves the removal of seminal plasma, also destabilizes sperm membranes leading to functional capacitation. This membrane destabilization renders the spermatozoa immediately capable of fertilization in vitro, or in vivo after deposition close to the site of fertilization, but shortens their lifespan, resulting in premature death if the cells are deposited in the female tract distant from the site of fertilization or are held in vitro at standard storage temperatures. This functional capacitation can be reversed in boar spermatozoa by inclusion of seminal plasma in the medium used to collect the cells from the cell sorter and, consequently, reduces their in vitro fertility. It has yet to be determined whether seminal plasma would have similar effects on flow cytometrically sorted spermatozoa of other species, and what its effects might be on the in vivo fertility of flow sorted boar spermatozoa.","Capacitation; High dilution; Seminal plasma; Sperm sorting; Spermatozoa","animal; animal cell; cell membrane; cell selection; cell survival; conference paper; cytology; female; fertility; fertilization in vitro; male; nonhuman; physiology; seminal plasma; sperm; spermatozoon; spermatozoon capacitation; spermatozoon motility; swine; Animals; Cell Membrane; Female; Fertility; Fertilization in Vitro; Male; Semen; Sperm Capacitation; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Swine",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033396934

To determine the effect of the choice of the wavelet bases, the standard PIV images are compressed by some known wavelet families, Daubechies, Coifman and baylkin families. It was found that high order wavelet bases provides good compression performance for compressing PIV Images, because they have good frequency localization that in turn increases the energy compaction. The reconstructed PIV image with lower compression ratio may emphasize particle edges at a relatively high spatial resolution, and the reconstructed PIV image with higher compression ratio may display the large-scale motion of particles and may deduce noisy. In this study, higher compression ratio, from 25% to 1.56%, can be realized without losing significant flow information in PIV processing.

The physical and metabolic causes of sub-lethal injury to two meat (L61 and L62) and two clinical (L98 and L99) L. monocytogenes strains chill-stored (4 °C) for 4 weeks in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.0 and pH 5.5, and pH 5.5 in the presence of 0.3% potassium sorbate, were characterized. Causes of sub-lethal injury were determined by examining changes in the cell structure, leakage of nucleic acids and proteins from the cells, and cell recovery from injury in the presence of the metabolic inhibitors rifampicin, D-cycloserine, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and chloramphenicol. Visible shrinkage of the cytoplasm and slight cell wall damage were apparent over the 4 week storage period by electron microscopy for all four strains and three storage conditions. By contrast, over the same storage period, only three of the strains (L62, L98 and L99) displayed slight leakage of cellular content in all three storage media, while one strain (L61) displayed greater leakage. The three strains also displayed similar storage media-dependent metabolic damage. For these strains, phosphate-buffered saline pH 5:5 caused the least damage and potassium sorbate, the most. Recovery experiments also indicated that at pH 5.5, the energy transduction system of these three strains remained undamaged, and that injury to the cell transcription machinery was greatest at pH 7.0. The fourth strain, L61, displayed less damage than the others but this was attributed to the death of the injured cell sub- population in this strain. In this study, damage to sub-lethally injured chill-stored L. monocytogenes was different from that caused by other agents, such as heat. Therefore, cells injured by chill-storage under starvation conditions may require novel protocols to assure their effective recovery.",,"carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone; chloramphenicol; cycloserine; rifampicin; sorbate potassium; article; bacterial metabolism; cell damage; cell membrane permeability; cell structure; controlled study; cooling; Listeria monocytogenes; metabolic inhibition; nonhuman; pH; strain difference; Buffers; Culture Media; Enzyme Inhibitors; Food Microbiology; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Listeria monocytogenes; Meat; Refrigeration; Bacteria (microorganisms); Listeria monocytogenes; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033373187

Rochelle). Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) have been linked to increasing levels in the atmosphere and to potential global climate change. The capture of CO 2 from large point sources, followed by its sequestration as a supercritical fluid into the deep geosphere, is one potential method for reducing such emissions without a drastic change in our energy-producing technologies. Once emplaced underground, geochemical and hydrogeological processes will act to 'trap' the CO 2 as dissolved species and in carbonate minerals. Although dry supercritical CO 2 appears to cause little reaction with the host rocks, once dissolved in water mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions can result. From a geochemical standpoint, sandstones appear to be preferable to carbonates for sequestration operations because fluid-mineral reactions within them have a better capacity for pH buffering. However, individual host lithologies will vary in structure, mineralogy and hydrogeology, and individual sequestration operations will have to take account of local geological, fluid chemical and hydrogeological conditions. This paper summarizes some of the recent laboratory experimental, natural analogue and computer modelling approaches directed at understanding reactions involved in the chemical containment of CO 2.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; supercritical flow; underground storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033372053

In particular, the dc-link voltage variation under voltage sag and its dependence on source impedance, dc-link inductance, and output load is computed. It is shown that, for larger source impedance, the dc-link voltage variation under a voltage sag is also large and increases the susceptibility of an ASD and may result in a nuisance trip. The results from the analysis are plotted in per-unit quantities and serve as a design guide to assess ASD performance for a variety of sags. In order to improve the performance of ASD's, this paper proposes an integrated boost converter approach. This approach provides ride-through to critical ASD load during voltage sags without any additional energy storage device. Upon detection of a voltage sag, the boost converter operates with suitable duty ratio and maintains the dc-link voltage within acceptable limits. This prevents nuisance tripping and facilitates continuous operation of critical ASD load at rated torque. The proposed integrated boost converter does not introduce any additional semiconductors in the series path of the power flow and is low in cost. A commercially available 480-V 22-kVA ASD is modified with the integrated boost converter approach, and details are discussed.

A highly monochromatic neutron beam (Δk/k to approximately 4*10-5) is trapped by Bragg reflections between two precisely parallel silicon crystal plates in backscattering geometry. Entry and exit of the neutrons into and from the storage system is achieved by using the Zeeman energy shift caused by a short pulsed magnetic field at the crystal plates when the neutron pulse, to be stored or released, is passing by. With a significantly improved signal to background ratio, it was possible to store up to 6 neutron pulses simultaneously for the first time. By varying the storage time separately for each pulse, the feasibility of neutron beam manipulations in time and space was demonstrated. The influence of the magnetic field strength on the transmission of a perfect crystal has been investigated. After optimizing the alignment of the storage cavity, neutrons were stored for up to 4.2 seconds, which corresponds to a flight path of 2.66 km inside VESTA, or to 2500 consecutive Bragg-reflections. Currently, a new storage device, `VESTA Type 2', is under construction. In this case the energy shift for neutron entry and exit will be achieved by using a pulsed hf-spin flipper and a static NMR magnet. It can be expected that by removing the pulsed magnets of the existing device and by reducing other sources of vibration, the storage time and efficiency can be further improved.",,"Crystals; Magnetic field effects; Magnets; Neutron reflection; Neutron scattering; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Particle beams; Particle optics; Quantum optics; Silicon; Bragg reflections; Neutron optics; Neutron storage; Zeeman shift; Neutron sources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033361674

The high photon density on the sample will be preserved within a rather wide photon energy range, between 20 to 1000 eV.

Usually in order to produce irreversible detectable changes, either single amplified Ultra-Short Laser Pulse (USLP) irradiation of pure matrix or multi-shot irradiation of matrix with dyes by nonamplified USLP is employed. In our present experiments the 1.5% transformation of nonamplified Ti:Sapphire laser radiation (wavelength 770nm, repetition rate 70MHz, pulse duration 200fs, pulse energy 2nJ) into the SH has been obtained by means of BBO crystal with thickness of 300μm.

Due to material loss and crosslinking, the material undergoes a shrinkage, while the radiation-induced decomposition generates gases expanding the polymer matrix.

The volumetric method was evaluated using measurements from a well-instrumented thermal storage system. The baseline for the evaluation was an energy balance method that is highly accurate but prohibitively expensive for commercial use. The volumetric method of determining state of charge tends to overestimate the `true' state of charge during discharge because it does not account for sensible heating of water trapped between the ice and heat transfer tubes. This sensible effect can lead to errors of up to 8% at the end of tank discharge when it is most important to have an accurate indication of state of charge. A correction factor was developed that accounts for sensible energy storage during discharge and reduces the maximum error to about 2% at the end of discharge. The correction uses volumetric state of charge and secondary fluid inlet and outlet temperatures as inputs and does not significantly increase the complexity or cost. The correction factor is particularly important for high discharge rates that may occur in conjunction with the use of real-time pricing of electricity.",,"Heat transfer; Ice; Ice storage systems; State of charge; Refrigerating machinery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033356199

Toward this goal, an off-line study has been conducted using laser interferometry to measure the electron density produced by a single free-space flashboard. Aspects of the study included a comparison of densities produced by `dirty' flashboards (as they came out of service on ACE 4) and cleaned flashboards, and a comparison of cleaned flashboards to new ones. Also, the effect of more carefully controlled routing of the drive cables on the flashboards themselves to produce a more consistent inductance associated with each chain was investigated. Multi-channel measurements were taken in both longitudinal and transverse axes in a plane parallel to the surface of the flashboard at distances from one to five inches. Typical reproducibility was within 10%, although some shots deviated as much as 20%. A consistent density profile was obtained between the cleaned, used flashboards and the new flashboards, provided the new boards were first `cleaned' with acetone and Scotch-Brite pads. Cleaning used flashboards was found to restore a `prompt' component of the electron density which arrived at our measurement location 250 ns earlier than the first measurable densities from `dirty' flashboards.

To satisfy this requirement, the inner coaxial diameter of ASO-X and the length in the MPOS are 80 mm and 150 mm, respectively. The operation of the MPOS is strongly affected by the self magnetic field in the coaxial pulsed power generator. Usually, a good MPOS operation has been achieved at a magnetic field of several Tesla. The maximum amplitude of the magnetic field which is induced by the generator current of ASO-X at a charging voltage of 30 kV is less than 1 T. In spite of this low magnetic flux density, the MPOS operation in ASO-X is satisfactory. The magnetic field becomes less important if we use a load with a very low inductance.

Core magnetization is determined by combined action of two orthogonal induction components: the toroidal one Bθ and poloidal Bφ. The toroidal induction component is determined by the switched current and the poloidal one by control current. The core is deeply saturated in its initial state. After switching off the control current producing the field Bφ, and sharp decrease in the Bθ field due to current transition from the switch to the load the core is demagnetized, and switch inductance increases sharply. It is well known that in commonly used switching circuits energy is partly dissipated in the switch. In the examined case this part of energy for an ideal core (excluding hysteresis and eddy current losses) passes into control circuit. It either dissipates in this circuit when the control current is switched off may be transferred into an inductance of the control circuit.

Adjusting the rotor speed makes the generator-motor either release the kinetic energy to the power system or absorb it from the utility grid. Thus, the generator-motor has the capability of achieving not only reactive power control, but also active power control based on the flywheel effect of the rotating parts. This paper proposes a new control strategy for a doubly-fed induction generator-motor, which is characterized by the combination of vector control and decoupling control. The control strategy enables the induction generator-motor to perform active power control independent of reactive power control even in transient states.

During these tests, a number of unusual behaviours were observed in the PRVs (pressure relief valves) installed on the test vessels. Since these valves play a large role in the control of energy accumulation and storage in a pressure vessel, it was decided to study their behaviour using air and steam. Code-compliant air tests demonstrate the valves' behaviour under ambient conditions while steam-based testing involves higher temperatures that more closely mimic the conditions experienced during a fire impingement accident. Experience has shown that PRV behaviour may be dramatically different under these disparate conditions. This paper describes the apparatus, procedures, and results of a study of comparative performance using steam and ambient temperature air using 76 transport vessels PRVs representing new and used samples of 3 manufacturers' equivalent designs for 1 inch, 2 inches, and 3 inches N-PT transport vessel PRVs.",,"Explosions; Fires; Pressure vessels; Steam; Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions (BLEVE); Thermal energy storage; Pressure relief valves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033351675

Using the irradiance as input signal, the network models the effects of random cloud movement on the electrical variables of the Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) and the variables of the utility-linked inverter over a short period of time. During short time intervals, the irradiance is considered as the only varying input parameter affecting the electrical variables of the system. The advantages of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) simulation over standard linear model is that it does not require the knowledge of internal system parameters, involves less computational effort, and offers a compact solution for multiple-variable problems. The model can be easily integrated into a typical utility system and resulting system behavior can be determined. The viability of the battery-supported PV system as dispatchable unit is also investigated. The simulated results are compared with the experimental results captured during cloudy days.

The aim of this analysis is to gain new insights into the POS opening process and its effect on switch-load coupling, a phenomenon which is not currently well understood. Currents and voltages measured both at the generator and at the load are used to infer load impedance, flow impedance, load power, POS gap size, and the critical POS gap for magnetic insulation. An important finding is that, at the time of peak load power, the inferred POS gap size is equal to the critical POS gap for magnetic insulation in both switch-limited and load-limited operation. This suggests that POS-load coupling is self-regulated to maintain saturated flow in the POS. Generator current and voltage upstream of the POS are used to determine the time varying inductance upstream of the POS current channel. From this inductance calculation, the location of the current channel at the time of switch opening may be inferred and compared with the location where bremsstrahlung emission is observed to begin in side-viewing x-ray pinhole photographs of Hawk. The effect of varying the conduction time, the anode-cathode gap and the POS-to-load distance on the inferred current-channel location at the time of POS opening is studied.",,"Computational methods; Electric current measurement; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric impedance; Electric loads; Electron beams; Plasma diodes; Voltage measurement; Abstract only; Electron-beam diodes; Plasma opening switches (POS); Electric switches",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033351557

It is intended to be an international user facility, providing opportunities for researchers from national laboratories and academic institutions around the world. Emphasizing hydrodynamic experiments, Atlas will provide the capability for achieving steady shock pressures exceeding 10-Mbar in a volume of several cubic centimeters. In addition, the kinetic energy associated with solid liner implosion velocities exceeding 12 km/s is sufficient to drive dense, hydrodynamic targets into the ionized regime, permitting the study of complex issues associated with strongly-coupled plasmas. The primary element of Atlas is a 23-MJ capacitor bank, comprised of 96 separate Marx generators housed in 12 separate oil-filled tanks, surrounding a central target chamber. Each tank will house two, independently-removable maintenance units, with each maintenance unit consisting of four Marx modules. Each Marx module has four capacitors that can each be charged to a maximum of 60 kilovolts. When railgap switches are triggered, the Marx modules erect to a maximum of 240 kV. The parallel discharge of these 96 Marx modules will deliver a 30-MA current pulse with a 4-5-μs risetime to a cylindrical, imploding liner via 24 vertical, tri-plate, oil-insulated transmission lines. An experimental program for testing and certifying all Marx and transmission line components has been completed.

With the beginning of the operation of the B-Factory, PEP-II, the linac will now serve primarily as an injector for the low (LER) and high energy rings (HER) of PEP-II. The different beams are stabilized by a new regional linac energy management (LEM) program, which keeps the magnet strengths and therefore the deflections constant at each of the four extraction points. They are at 3.1 GeV (positrons for LER), 9 GeV (electrons for HER), 25 GeV (electrons for the positron production), and 28.5 GeV (electrons for other purposes such as test beams, plasma experiments, and iris destruction tests). Since many components of the accelerator can be configured on each pulse, it is possible to run these beams with different intensities, bunch length, energies, rates, etc. Only the quadrupole magnet strengths are fixed, producing different lattices for different energy beams, which must be matched at extraction from the linac. Since PEP-II injection does not require all of the full 120 Hz rate, it is possible to run other experiments at the same time. That might include an extension of the SLC run or a high charge, fixed target experiment, which will require some additional pulsed magnets.",,"Accelerator magnets; Colliding beam accelerators; Electron beams; Particle beam extraction; Particle beam injection; Positrons; Storage rings; Quadrupole magnets; Linear accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033348725

The standardized DOE SNF canister has to be capable of handling virtually all of the DOE SNF in a variety of potential storage and transportation systems. It must also be acceptable to the repository, based on current and anticipated future requirements. This expected usage mandates a robust design. The canister design has four unique geometries, with lengths of approximately 10 feet or 15 feet, and an outside nominal diameter of 18 inches or 24 inches. The canister has been developed to withstand a drop from 30 feet onto a rigid (flat) surface, sustaining only minor damage - but no rupture - to the pressure (containment) boundary. The majority of the end drop-induced damage is confined to the skirt and lifting/stiffening ring components, which can be removed if desired after an accidental drop. A canister, with its skirt and stiffening ring removed after an accidental drop, can continue to be used in service with appropriate operational steps being taken. Features of the design concept have been proven through drop testing and finite element analyses of smaller test specimens. Finite element analyses also validated the canister design for drops onto a rigid (flat) surface for a variety of canister orientations at impact, from vertical to 45 degrees off vertical. Actual 30-foot drop testing has also been performed to verify the final design, though limited to just two full-scale test canister drops. In each case, the analytical models accurately predicted the canister response.",,"Computer simulation; Containers; Finite element method; Mathematical models; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste transportation; Spent fuels; Spent nuclear fuel canisters; Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033348324

Further economic improvements could be realized by better management of planned outages, understanding of unplanned outages, resource sharing among several plants, and more efficient use of nuclear fuel. Dry spent-fuel storage has removed the limitation of on-site storage caused by the limited size of the originally designed storage pools. However, delays and uncertainty about the date by which the national U.S. program will receive the spent fuel have significant financial penalties that could be mitigated if a central interim facility were established to receive spent fuel. Furthermore, a higher incentive for spent-fuel minimization could be obtained if the waste fees were based on spent-fuel volume rather than on electricity sales. Introducing thorium into the fuel cycle has the potential to improve the economics of the fuel cycle while reducing the volume of spent fuel and improving its proliferation resistance.",,"Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Fuel storage; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Nuclear power plants; Radioactive wastes; Spent fuels; Waste utilization; Economic performance; Nuclear energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033346719

The successfull experiences obtained on more than 50,000 large filter capacitors have led to transfer this technology to the energy storage field. For this application in which the voltages and the energy are often high, the self-healing process is secured by some other resistivity levels and some different modes of segmentation in order to reduce the inrush energy in the local breakdown and to meet the discharge current requirements.",,"Capacitor storage; Metallizing; Railroad rolling stock; Direct current capacitors; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033346586

Since it would be desirable to minimize this stored energy to reduce hazards, a study was initiated by Transport Canada and Queen's University to quantify the effect of various PRV parameters on the thermal energy storage of a pressure vessel.

At that time, the machine was a synchrotron cycling at 25 Hz and delivering an average beam power of 205 kW at 1.6 GeV. An option to double the power by doubling the frequency was foreseen. Now a more ambitious development of the original concept is proposed that aims at 0.5 MW at 1.6 GeV, pulsed at either 50 Hz or 10 Hz. The slow repetition rate is achieved by the addition of a storage ring holding four consecutive (single bunch) pulses from the 50 Hz synchrotron until a fifth pulse is accelerated and transferred to the target with the four stored ones. In this way, an energy per pulse of 50 kJ (one half of the pulse energy of the 5 MW ESS) is obtained, yielding about 3.5×1016 thermal neutrons/(s cm2). This peak flux matches well a number of innovative instruments and allows unprecedented resolution for some more conventional ones.

The application of PBC in regulation problems of mechanical systems yields controllers that have a clear physical interpretation in terms of interconnection of the system with its environment. In particular the total energy of the closed-loop is the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Furthermore, since the EL structure is preserved in closed-loop, PBC is robust vis a vis unmodeled dissipative effects. Unfortunately, these nice properties are sometimes lost when PBC is used in other applications, for instance, in electrical and electromechanical systems. In this paper we further contribute to develop a new PBC theory encompassing a broader class of systems, and preserving the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance, continuing upon our work in [14], [9] and [17]. Towards this end we consider port-controlled Hamiltonian systems with dissipation (PCHD), which result from the network modeling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models.",,"Closed loop control systems; Energy dissipation; Equations of motion; Invariance; Large scale systems; Mathematical models; Robustness (control systems); Energy shaping; Euler Lagrange operation; Port controlled Hamiltonian systems; Possivity based control; Control system synthesis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033345439

There are sixty-six titanium-getter vacuum pumps at the storage ring. Evacuation of gases in the storage ring is done by controlling the current in the titanium filaments in the vacuum pump (max 50A). A PLC has a TCP/IP network port, 16-bit-digital output ports connected to sixteen solid-state relays (SSR) for current control. The PLC can simultaneously control up to sixteen pumps. These vacuum pumps are connected to SSRs which chop the AC current so as to control the current in the pumps. To operate the pumps, the pump current must have a trapezoidal-shaped current form. The PLC is configured so that the current in the pumps has a trapezoidal form associated with pre-heating, evacuation, and cooling-down phases of the pump. PLCs are connected to a personal computer (PC) through the network. The PC can automatically control the PLCs by sending a set of commands through the TCP/IP network. The commands specify the duration of the current form. Upon receiving a command from a PC running under WindowsNT through the network, the PLC generates pulse-trains through the digital output ports to trigger the SSRs in association with the operating phases.

This heat must be transferred through passive means, limiting the energy transfer mechanisms from the cask to natural convection and radiation heat transfer. Natural convection is essentially independent of the characteristics of the array of casks, provided there is space between casks to permit a convection loop. Radiation heat transfer, however, depends on the geometric arrangement of the array of casks because the peripheral casks will shadow the interior casks and restrict radiant heat transfer from all casks to the environment. The shadowing of one cask by its neighbors is determined by a view factor that represents the fraction of radiant energy that leaves the surface of a cask and reaches the environment. This paper addresses the evaluation of the view factor between a centrally located spent fuel storage cask and the environment. By combining analytic expressions for the view factor of (1) infinitely long cylinders and (2) finite cylinders with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2 to represent spent fuel storage casks, the view factor can be evaluated for any practical array of spent fuel storage casks.",,"Containers; Energy transfer; Heat radiation; Natural convection; Radioactive waste transportation; Spent fuels; Spent nuclear fuel storage casks; Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033342944

In electron storage rings the average effects of synchrotron radiation from the bending magnets cause the beam emittances in all three degrees of freedom to damp towards equilibria, determined by the fluctuating nature of quantum emissions. In this paper, we show that the radiation damping in a focusing system is fundamentally different from that in a bending system. Quantum excitation to the transverse dimensions is absent in a straight, continuous focusing channel, and is exponentially suppressed in a focusing-dominated ring. Thus, the transverse normalized emittances in such systems can in principle be damped to the Compton wavelength of the electron, limited only by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In addition, we investigate methods of rapid damping such as radiative laser cooling. We propose a laser-electron storage ring (LESR) where the electron beam in a compact storage ring repetitively interacts with an intense laser pulse stored in an optical resonator.

The ability to pattern thin film of PVDF, a piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric polymer, has potential applications in the areas of MEMS, nonlinear optics, and nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory technology. Without the use of any reactive chemical gas, a maximum etched depth in excess of 9 μm is achieved. The etched depth for a given photon energy approaches saturation with respect to exposure time. An in situ mass spectrometry revealed the evolution of hydrogen, fluorine, and hydrogen fluoride species. The etched regions turned dark in color indicating a possible increase in the fraction of carbon atoms. The X-ray transmittance of photo etched PVDF approached that of a pure carbon as the exposure time is increased. Upon etching the root mean-square surface roughness of the etched portion increased by more than a factor of two.

The samples were charged by the point-to-grid corona method. At room temperature, the measured surface potential V was stable during a period of almost three years. Isothermal measurements under different environmental conditions showed an improved charge retention compared to a single layer of thermally grown silicon dioxide. After approximately 3 h at 300 °C, the observed voltage drop was &lt;10% for the double layers and approximately 60% for bare SiO2. Similar results were obtained under a humid condition of 95%RH and 60 °C. Besides, thermally stimulated current (TSC) was measured in an open-circuit setup with a temperature ramp of 200 °C/h.

The measured current in the range of 300 to 400 °C, the location of current maxima observed in thermally grown silicon dioxide or APCVD silicon nitride, was negligible.

Operating speed, however, is also reduced by the transmission gear ratio. Some applications require both high speed and high force.

The circuit can be operated from a single phase, three phase, or poly phase prime power source or service. The circuit employs a high-reactance transformer in combination with a phase-programmed switch. The transformer impedance limits the surge current loading on the prime power source. The phase-programmed switch is used to achieve the voltage regulation. The transformer secondary is rectified and is wound to provide the desired charge voltage on the capacitor store. The controller commands the primary switch that begins the charging cycle by closing at a predetermined phase relation to the prime power a.c. (alternating current) source. The predetermined phase is necessary to control the in-rush current to the primary of the transformer. The primary switch may be a fast solid state type such as an SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier). The same primary switch opens, or recovers in the open state at a current zero crossing, to remove the primary voltage when the capacitor store reaches full charge, and thus provides regulation of the charging voltage. The repetition rate of the charging circuit is limited to approximately 25% of the prime power a.c. source frequency for three phase applications and approximately 8% of the a.c. source frequency for single phase applications. The accuracy of the regulation also depends on the maximum repetition rate in relation to the source frequency.",,"Electric network synthesis; Electric transformers; Switching circuits; Voltage control; Silicon controlled rectifier (SCR); Capacitor storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033335444

The contribution to the machine coupling impedance of the 8-mm-gap ID chambers was reported earlier. One 5-mm-gap ID chamber was installed in December 1997. This required changing the lattice to preserve the vertical acceptance. The new lattice reduced the average vertical beta function at the 5-mm chamber as well as at all the other ID chambers and so has also lowered the effect of the vertical coupling impedance. As additional 8-mm and 5-mm chambers are planned, a more detailed characterization of the impedance is essential. This includes separating the effects of the transitions between the small-gap chambers and the standard chambers from the resistive wall impedance of the small-gap chambers themselves.

If the secondary-electron yield (SEY) coefficient of the wall material is greater than one, as is the case with the aluminum chambers in the 7-GeV Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring, a runaway condition can develop. As the electron cloud builds up along a train of stored positron or electron bunches, the possibility exists that a transverse perturbation of the head bunch will be communicated to trailing bunches due to interaction with the cloud. In order to characterize the electron cloud, a special vacuum chamber was built and inserted into the ring. The chamber contains 10 rudimentary electron-energy analyzers, as well as three targets coated with different materials. Measurements show that the intensity and electron energy distribution are highly dependent on the temporal spacing between adjacent bunches and the amount of current contained in each bunch. Furthermore, measurements using the different targets are consistent with what would be expected based on the SEY of the coatings.

Most of the recent- generation light sources are built up by highly optimized lattices of the Double Bend- or Triple Bend Achromat type. There is little room left to further optimize these lattices to even smaller emittances. Only a local adjustment of the optics at the source points might still bring some benefit. With decreasing emittance orbit stability is becoming more and more important. Cures for vibrations, thermal effects and ground motion have to start at the basic design of the building, the storage ring infrastructure and the magnet support system. Beam instabilities are especially harmful as they increase the energy spread and as a consequence deteriorate the higher harmonics of the undulator radiation. Well optimized beams suffer from lifetime problems due to Touschek scattering. Particular problems arise when short bunches are requested, for instance for storage ring based lasers. Medium-energy machines are able to produce high brilliance in the hard X-ray range by means of mini-undulators with small gaps. This, again, has an adverse effect on the beam lifetime due to beam gas scattering. The current trend in storage ring development for future Light Sources is discussed. What are the crucial issues and where is improvement desirable and possible? Is there still room for improving the basic design of a light source? Are there alternatives to the `classical' lattices which could be used for the next generation?

The switches are divided into two categories of the opening and the closing switch. The lack of good repetitive opening switches has inhibited the use of inductive energy storage system despite its high energy density. Being contrasted with the opening switches, the closing switches are relatively simple and can be readily available with capacitive energy storage system. The most popular closing-switches up-to date are spark-gap switches. Theses switches have very limited lifetime due to arc-corrosion resulting from pinch effect and localized arc-heating. To extend the switch lifetime by minimizing electrode-vaporization, rotary arc gap-switches are proposed in the literatures. The rotation of the arc can be achieved by providing rotating magnetic field from outside or by self-induced magnetic field. This study investigates a rotating arc gap (RAG) switch driven by the self-induced magnetic field. The physical dimensions, rotating arc-speed, arc voltage-drop, and its experimental set-up are described in detail.",,"Electric arcs; Electric energy storage; Electric network synthesis; Electric potential; Electric power generation; Magnetic fields; Pulsed power generation; Rotating arc gap (RAG) switches; Voltage drop; Electric switches",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033331450

However, this improvement is usually achieved at the expense of the amount of information conveyed by each detected photon, In this paper, we propose a simple approach to calculate the information loss for a ring Compton camera. We describe this information loss as ""decoding penalty"", defined as the ratio of variance of reconstructed intensity for a pixel of interest for a ring Compton camera to a mechanically collimated camera normalized to a per-detected-photon basis. The uniform Cramér-Rao bound, our mathematical tool, provides a lower bound on the variance that is dependent on the system and data statistics alone rather than the estimator. Results suggest that ring Compton cameras perform comparably to conventional collimated cameras at incident photon energy of 140 keV and substantially outperform their counterparts at 364 keV. ©1999 IEEE.",,"Compton cameras; Cramer-Rao bound; Information loss; Gamma rays; Image reconstruction; Information use; Mathematical models; Optimization; Photons; Storage rings; X ray cameras",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033329493

If the secondary-electron yield (SEY) coefficient of the wall material is greater than one, a runaway condition can develop. In addition to the SEY, the degree of amplification depends on the beam intensity and temporal distribution. As the electron cloud builds up along a train of stored bunches, a transverse perturbation of the head bunch can be communicated to trailing bunches in a wakefield-like interaction with the cloud.

A fast amperometric response oxygen sensor based on PbSnF4 has been constructed and tested. A long life device with time independent response and reliable performance requires the materials used for its construction be stable over the life time of the device in the operating conditions. Since ionic conductivity is thermally activated, possible use at high temperature can be envisaged. Therefore, it is of prime importance to know in details the behavior of the material versus time in the expected temperature range of use and of storage. PbSnF4 can be prepared by many methods that we have investigated, and each method gives a material that is different from the others in one way or another (symmetry, strain, particle randomization, particle dimensions, temperature range of stability). In addition, we have shown that several phase transitions take place versus temperature or when some other treatments are applied. Many of these transitions are very sluggish, and therefore give a false impression of stability, when the phases are actually metastable, and thus changes take place slowly over time. We have studied the stability of tetragonal α-PbSnF4 and o-PbSnF4 by use of X-ray diffraction, in the most probable conditions of use (ambient temperature to 200°C in air). Changes were found to take place, which should be taken into account in the design of devices and when establishing their optimum temperature of use and storage.",,"Activation energy; Amperometric sensors; Ionic conduction in solids; Phase transitions; Temperature; Thermodynamic stability; X ray diffraction analysis; Fluoride ion conductor; Time independent response; Lead compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033328240

The desired lifetime is 24 thousand shots. Typical of high-energy systems, particularly multi-module systems, the primary parameters of interest related to the switch are: 1) reliability, meaning absence of both pre-fires and no-fires, 2) total switch lifetime or number of shots between maintenance, and 3) cost. Cost was given lower priority at this evaluation stage because there are great uncertainties in estimating higher-quantity prices of these devices, most of which have been supplied before in only small quantities. The categories of switches tested are vacuum discharge, high-pressure discharge, and solid-state. Each group varies in terms of triggering ease, ease of maintenance, and tolerance to faults such as excess current and current reversal. We tested at least two variations of each technology group. The total number of shots on the switch test facility is about 50 thousand. We will present the results from the switch testing. The observed lifetime of different switches varied greatly: the shortest life was one shot; one device was still operating after six thousand shots.

The intermolecular interactions that develop between the PFPE lubricant and the carbon overcoat govern the adhesion, coverage, and physical properties of the lubricant, e.g. the lubricant structure and mobility. Consequently, the molecular interactions at the lubricant-carbon interface will contribute to the overall tribological performance of the disk-drive. Due to the ever-increasing demands for storage capacity, pressure exists to reduce the separation distance between the read/write head and disk surface. One means of reducing this separation distance is to use thinner protective overcoats on both the head and disk surfaces. In this study the interactions between Fomblin Zdol and both amorphous hydrogenated (CHx) and nitrogenated (CNx) carbon overcoats were investigated as a function of overcoat thickness from 0-100 angstroms. The Zdol film structure was probed by titrating the magnetic alloy, the CHx and CNx surfaces with Zdol. The molecular weight dependence of the maximum bonded Zdol thickness on these surfaces is used to deduce structural information on the adsorbed Zdol film. In progressing from CHx to CNx to the magnetic alloy, we find the Zdol boundary layer film to be characterized by an increase in average distance between the PFPE backbone and the surface, or equivalently an increase in the average Zdol monolayer thickness. On the CHx overcoat, Zdol preferentially lies more parallel to the surface, whereas on the magnetic layer, Zdol is oriented more perpendicular to the surface. When these experiments were conducted as a function of carbon overcoat thickness, we find that interaction of Zdol with the field of the underlying magnetic film becomes important at carbon film thicknesses <30 angstroms. The dependence of the Zdol adhesion on carbon overcoat thickness was quantified by determining the Zdol film thickness dependence of both the dispersive and polar components of the Helmholtz free energy. The Zdol bonding kinetics were also studied as a function of carbon thickness.",,"Boundary layers; Carbon; Free energy; Interfaces (materials); Lubricants; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic films; Magnetic heads; Molasses; Monolayers; Protective coatings; Wear resistance; Boundary lubricant films; Carbon overcoats; Tribology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033326123

The probe beam was injected across the path of primary relativistic bunch. This type of an electron beam probe is suitable for both circular or linear accelerators.

The RAIL storage system incorporates multiple DVD libraries that consist of dual DVD-RAM drives. Each DVD library utilizes a single mechanical robot picker for media loading and unloading. The current capacity of the single sided and single layered DVD optical media used in that system is 2.6 gigabytes. To increase the reliability of stored data and at the same time to eliminate the need for read after write verification, a process that can double the recording time, a RAID 4 algorithm has been implemented in the control unit of the RAIL storage system. Data sent by the host are transferred to a control unit, that stripes data over five data groups plus one parity unit. The striped and parity data are sent to individual libraries and written to DVD media. This system writes and retrieves storage data with a transfer rate of approximate 6 MB/sec, using write and read control methods that minimize data striping overhead. Other performance factors that affect the transfer rates are the striping size and the number of drives used in the RAIL system. Experimental results indicate that stripe sizes of 32 to 64 KB are sufficient to achieve high throughput. In addition, the transfer rates showed no further increase when the number of 1 drives exceeded eight.

Our design uses a single 3 cm by 3 cm silicon pad detector as the first detector system, and SPRINT, an array of position-sensitive sodium iodide modules, as the second detector. Experimental results with a 99mTc point source show coincidence energy spectra agreeing with theoretical predictions. The coincidence energy spectra for both silicon and SPRINT detectors correspond to the geometry-determined scattering angle range. Recorded energy falls outside of strict geometric limits because of Doppler broadening and detector energy resolution effects. The summed energy peak in the initial data run for a 99mTc source has a FWHM energy resolution of 33 keV, primarily due to energy uncertainty in the SPRINT modules. A second data run showed an improvement to 25 keV in summed energy resolution due to careful calibration of, and correction for, significant first and second detector gain non-uniformities. Images generated from the second acquired data set result in a backprojection image resolution of 1.5 cm at a source distance of 10 cm. Analytical and Monte Carlo calculations show a very close agreement of 1.6 cm. Using a list-mode maximum likelihood EM reconstruction algorithm, the image resolution is improved to 7 mm, although the resolution recovery is at the expense of increased noise in the image. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Computerized tomography; Doppler effect; Image reconstruction; Maximum likelihood estimation; Monte Carlo methods; Phosphors; Photomultipliers; Silicon sensors; Sodium compounds; Storage rings; Compton camera; Single photon ring tomograph; X ray cameras",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033321119

The simulation model indicated that the unequal current sharing is due to small differences between the coupling factors of capacitors batteries at the ends and the middle of the bank.

First, systematic investigation of the role of technology parameters in the PECVD deposition of the SiOj; films is presented. In particular, the effect of the silane dilution parameter on the device performance is investigated and the SiOz film optimized in terms of reliability and electron injection enhancement. Then, investigation of the electrical behavior of n++-poly/SiOi;/SiO2/p-sub MOS capacitors is presented. As a result, a picture of the space defect distribution in the SiO-4 films is proposed. In SiO-4 films, a relevant density of trapped charge adds to ionized impurities. In particular, the net charge is negative in the bulk of the dielectric, indicating that trapped electrons exceed all the other charge contributions. The space distribution of defects is strongly nonuniform and has the maximum in the vicinity of the SiO-4/SiCh interface. After dc current stress, the devices undergo electrical degradation, the dominant mechanism of degradation being the creation of interface hole traps. The trap generation model is based on the release of hydrogen and pairs generation in the SiO-4 films. The time-scale of trap filling during the stress is tens of seconds, which suggests that the stress-induced traps are deep in the energy gap. © 1999 IEEE.","Charge injection; Mos devices; Nonvolatile memory; Semiconductor device reliability; Stress measurements; Tunneling","Electron tunneling; Nonvolatile storage; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Silica; Stress analysis; Semiconductor device reliability; MOS capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033317034

The standardized DOE SNF canister had to be capable of handling virtually all of the DOE SNF in a variety of potential storage and transportation systems and also be acceptable to the repository, based on current and anticipated future requirements.

Operation of the ring close to the slippage factor η1≈10-6, such that synchrotron motion is frozen, minimizes the need for rf to maintain the bunch length. Without appropriate rf compensation, however, the bunch wake induces an intolerable head-to-tail energy spread.

Hydrogen vehicles, heating, and power systems have been technically demonstrated. Key hydrogen end-use technologies such as fuel cells are making rapid progress toward commercialization. If hydrogen were made from renewable or decarbonized fossil sources, it would be possible to have a large-scale energy system with essentially no emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases. Despite these potential benefits, the development of a large-scale hydrogen energy infrastructure is often seen as an insurmountable technical and economic barrier.

The HIC will be approximately 5 3/8 inches (134.38 mm) in outside diameter with 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick walls, and have a removable lid with a metallic seal that is capable of being welded shut. The opening of the can is approximately 4 3/8 inches (111.13 mm). The HIC is primarily designed to contain items in the DOE SNF inventory that do not meet acceptance standards for direct disposal in a geologic repository. This includes fuel in the form of particulate dusts, sectioned pieces of fuel, core rubble, melted or degraded (non-intact) fuel elements, unclad uranium alloys, metallurgical specimens, and chemically reactive fuel components. The HIC is intended to act as a substitute cladding for the spent nuclear fuel, further isolate problematic materials, provide a long-term corrosion barrier, and add an extra internal pressure barrier to the waste package. The HIC will also delay potential fission product release and maintain geometry control for extended periods of time. For the entire disposal package to be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a HIC must effectively eliminate the disposal problems associated with problem SNF including the release of radioactive and/or reactive material and over pressurization of the HIC due to chemical reactions within the can. Two HICs were analyzed to envelop a range of can lengths between 42 and 101 inches. Using Abacus software, the HIC's were analyzed for end, side, and corner drops. Hastelloy C-22 was chosen based upon structural integrity, corrosion resistance, and neutron absorption properties.",,"Computer aided analysis; Computer software; Geological repositories; Radioactive waste disposal; Spent fuels; Standards; Structural analysis; High integrity cans (HIC); Software package ABACUS; Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033309886

Main characteristics, required from the OS, are formulated. General requirements are reliable repetitive operation and compactness. For systems with a long charge time, e.g., for battery-based power supplies intended for driving electrothermal loads, typical parameters are fractions of a second conduction time, peak current of several tens of kA and the opening time less than 0.5 ms at a voltage of several kV. No off-the-shelf OS possessing such characteristics are available. Comparison of switches' types and architectures was made. It brought to a conclusion that the hybrid technology is appropriate for long-charge inductive storage. Mechanical switches, e.g., vacuum and SF6 circuit breakers, are suitable as the first stage, while a stack of semiconductor devices seems to be an optimal solution for the second stage of the OS. A novel approach allowing the enhancement of an order of magnitude of the turn-off capability of fully-controlled semiconductor devices, such as GTOs and GCTs, is offered.

From these trials, we selected an alternative approach employing a rough metallized polypropylene (MPP) dielectric system. This rough MPP dielectric-electrode system yields a >10% gain in energy density, which results in a substantial cost reduction over the qualification KM type.

The two-in-one magnet design, with the two magnetic channels integrated into a common yoke, has proved to be an economical alternative to two separate rings and allows enough free space in the existing (LEP) tunnel for a possible future re-installation of a lepton ring for e-p physics. In order to achieve the design energy of 7 TeV per beam, with a dipole field of 8.3 T, the superconducting magnet system must operate in superfluid helium at 1.9 K. This requires further development of cold compressors similar to those first used at CEBAF. The LHC will be the first hadron machine to produce appreciable synchrotron radiation which, together with the heat load due to image currents, has to be absorbed at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, the LHC is the first major CERN accelerator project built in collaboration with other laboratories. A brief review of the machine design is given and some of the main technological and accelerator physics issues are discussed.",,"Accelerator magnets; Storage rings; Superconducting magnets; Superfluid helium; Synchrotron radiation; Electron-proton colliders; Hadron colliders; Colliding beam accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033307205

Insulated pressure vessels offer the advantages of liquid hydrogen tanks (low weight and volume), with reduced disadvantages (lower energy requirement for hydrogen liquefaction and reduced evaporative losses). The purpose of this work is to verify that commercially available aluminum-lined, fiber-wrapped vessels can be used for cryogenic hydrogen storage. The paper reports on previous and ongoing tests and analyses that have the purpose of improving the system design and assure its safety.

As part of our investigation for an International Clean Energy Network Using Hydrogen Conversion (WE-NET), we have been studying to establish a safety scheme to ensure that both existing and new hydrogen technologies are implemented without endangering public safety. In this plan, we consider the transport and storage of a large quantity of hydrogen in a large tank. First we must evaluate the consequence of the postulated accident of liquid hydrogen. Since we have developed the multi-phase hydrodynamics analysis code (CHAMPAGNE), we apply the code to simulate the formation and dispersion of hydrogen vapor clouds. In the present paper we have improved the calculation model in two ways. We added a function to CHAMPANGE for solving evaporation phenomena realistically, made many parametric calculations and planned the small-scale hydrogen dispersion experiments for the validation of this model. Another improvement is the turbulent mixing of evaporated liquid hydrogen. Now we have completed the basic functions of our simulation code.

Extrapolating current trends, this portion is likely to increase in the near future, since the devices devoted to the caches occupy an increasingly larger percentage of the total area of the chip. In this paper we extend the work proposed in [1], in which an extra, small cache (called filter cache) is inserted between the CPU data path and the L1 cache and serves to filter most of the references initiated from the CPU. In our scheme, the compiler is used to generate code that exploits the new memory hierarchy and reduces the possibility of a miss in the extra cache. Experimental results across a wide range of SPEC95 benchmarks show that this cache, which we call L-Cache from now on, has a small performance overhead with respect to the scheme without any extra caches, and provides substantial energy savings. The L-Cache is placed between the CPU and the I-Cache. The D-Cache subsystem is not modified. Since the L-Cache is much smaller, and, thus, has a smaller access time than the I-Cache, this scheme can also be used for performance improvements provided that the hit rate in the L-Cache is very high. In our experimental results, we show that the L-Cache does indeed improve performance in some cases.",,"Buffer storage; Computer aided network analysis; Computer simulation; Electric network synthesis; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Integrated circuit layout; Integrated circuit testing; Microprocessor chips; Response time (computer systems); Signal filtering and prediction; Storage allocation (computer); Filter caches; On-chip caches; VLSI circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033297639

Both DMAH and DMEAA have the same filling capability such as surface morphology and step coverage. For deposition reproducibility, the smaller activation energy is more suitable for manufacturing. The activation energy of Al deposition is found to be 0.38 [eV] for DMAH and 0.74 [eV] for DMEAA. These results mean the reproducibility of Al thickness using DMAH is superior to that using DMEAA. For safe storage and precise precursor delivery, the precursor should be chemically stable. From the results of measuring the pressure increase in vessel, it has shown that DMAH has superior chemical stability to DMEAA. Manufacturing apparatus such as Al CVD cluster module requires the deposition selectivity that is defined as Al deposition only on the desired areas of wafer surface and not on any parts of cluster module. Using DMAH, Al is deposited on barrier metal surface of silicon wafer, while Al is not deposited on the sealed anodic oxidized aluminum or the synthetic quartz. DMAH has shown excellent selectivity in comparison with DMEAA. Therefore, DMAH is superior to DMEAA as a precursor for the Al CVD technology in ULSI manufacturing.",,"Activation energy; Aluminum; Anodic oxidation; Chemical vapor deposition; Integrated circuit manufacture; Morphology; Silicon wafers; Superior chemical stability; ULSI circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033297349

The analysis illustrates that the energy dissipated within the linear amplifier is a function of four parameters: the driving frequency, the piezoelectric coupling coefficient, the relative stiffness of the actuator and load, and the amplifier supply voltage. The piezoelectric actuator and the mechanical load are assumed to be lossless to highlight the relationship between energy dissipated within the amplifier and the energy stored in the actuator. For a specific frequency, the minimum energy dissipation within the amplifier is equal to twice the stored electrical energy in the piezoelectric when the amplifier voltage is equal to the driving voltage of the actuator. Additional energy is dissipated within the amplifier when the supply voltage is greater than the driving voltage. In the case when the actuator displacement is constant as a function of frequency, the energy dissipation in the amplifier decreases near the resonance of the coupled electromechanical system and reaches a minimum when the piezoelectric charge due to the applied voltage is equal and opposite to the change induced by the load. The steady-state amplitude of the charge, and hence the actuator current, is equal to zero at this frequency. The results illustrate that energy dissipation is minimized when the actuator is operated at near the resonance or antiresonance of the coupled electromechanical system.",,"Amplifiers (electronic); Control systems; Electric energy storage; Electric losses; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electromechanical devices; Finite element method; Natural frequencies; Piezoelectric materials; Resonance; Linear amplifiers; Mechanical load; Piezoelectric actuated structures; Actuators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033296852

Thus, the commercial potential of melt-spun fibers and resulting fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage capabilities is enormous for the apparel and industrial insulation markets. However, at melt spinning temperatures, i.e., at temperatures >200°C, microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) lose their core material, which corrupts the melt spinning process. Before these materials can successfully be incorporated into melt spun fibers, microcapsules <10 microns in size must be available with a more stable wall structure.

Given the foundry availability of these technologies, it is prudent to re-evaluate the prospect of programmable SAW filters whereby IDT finger tap weights can be controlled electronically in order to achieve, for example, an adaptive filter module. To facilitate the design of these programmable SAW filters it is advantageous to use an electronic circuit model for the IDT electrodes. To this end, a SPICE-based circuit model for SAW IDTs is presented which employs the two-transformer model first presented by Ballato in 1972 for Bulk Acoustic Wave devices. The element factor for the IDT electrodes is incorporated via a frequency-dependent transformer turns ratio. Acoustic transmission line velocities and characteristic impedances can be calculated separately by such methods as the Datta-Hunsinger models for scattering coefficients from electrodes. The energy storage term can be incorporated as a velocity perturbation in the acoustic transmission line.

The second layer uses a non-linear programming formulation solved by a Lagrangian relaxation to perform the economic dispatch while meeting all plant and system constraints. In order to deal effectively with the constraints of the problem and prune the search space of the GA in advance, the difficult minimum up/down-time constraints of thermal generation units and the turbine/pump operating constraint of storage power stations are embedded in the binary strings that are coded to represent the on/off-states of the generating units. The other constraints are handled by integrating penalty costs into the fitness function. In order to save execution time, the economic dispatch is only performed if the given unit commitment schedule is able to meet the load balance, energy, and begin/end level constraints, The proposed solution approach was tested on a real scaled hydro-thermal power system over a period of a day in half-hour time-steps for different GA-parameters.

Continued scaling to smaller bit and grain sizes, however, May. prompt spontaneous magnetization reversal processes when the stored energy per particle starts competing with thermal energy, thereby limiting the achievable areal density. Charap et al. have predicted this to occur at about 40 Gbits/in2. This paper discusses thermal effects in the framework of basic Arrhenius-Néel statistical switching models. It is emphasized that magnetization decay is intimately related to high-speed-switching phenomena. Thickness-, temperature- and bit-density-dependent recording experiments reveal the onset of thermal decay at ""stability ratios"" (KuV/kBT)0 ≅ 35 ± 2. The stability requirement is grain size dispersion dependent and shifts to about 60 for projected 40 Gbits/in2 conditions and ten-year storage times. Higher anisotropy and coercivity media with reduced grain sizes are logical extensions of the current technology until write field limitations are reached. Future advancements will rely on deviations from traditional scaling. Squarer bits may reduce destabilizing stray fields inside the bit transitions. Perpendicular recording may shift the onset of thermal effects to higher bit densities. Enhanced signal processing may allow signal retrieval with fewer grains pers bit. Finally, single grain per bit recording may be envisioned in patterned media, with lithographically defined bits. © 1999 IEEE.","Arrhenius-néel model; Dynamic coercivity; High ku alloys; Magnetic recording; Signal decay; Thermal switching","Anisotropy; Coercive force; Magnetic fields; Magnetization; Mathematical models; Signal processing; Statistical methods; Thermal effects; Arrhenius-Neel statistical switching models; Thermal switching; Magnetic recording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033220894

Magnetic time effects become more pronounced as the volume of the switching unit becomes smaller, and thus become of more practical importance as the microstructure of recording media is made finer in the pursuit of greater information storage density. Magnetic time effects taking place on time scales longer than about 10-9 s can be explained by a model of thermally assisted crossing of an energy barrier (Arrhenius-Néel formalism). Many recording phenomena can be explained within this regime. Observation of magnetization changes during exposure to a constant field (""magnetic viscosity"") can be interpreted to yield an estimate of the switching volume; in most cases, this volume is larger than the frequently cited ""activation volume."" The dependence of coercivity on the time scale of the magnetic reversal precess (e.g., on the field sweep rate of a hysteresis loop) can also be used to deduce the volume of the switching unit and to estimate time effects relevant to information storage. A model and procedure for analysis of time-scale dependence of coercivity are described here and applied to typical advanced tape media, of both metal-particulate (MP) and metal-evaporated (ME) composition. The resulting switching volume for the MP tape (where the microstructure is well defined) is in approximate agreement with the particle size seen by electron microscopy. The magnetic time effects are significantly stronger in the ME tape than in the MP tape. Measurement of coercivity on at least two very different time scales (e.g., by vibrating-sample magnetometer and 60-Hz hysteresis loops) provides a convenient means of estimating the effective switching-unit volume, and hence the magnitude of the time effects to be expected in a recording application. The model also allows the estimation of the minimum particle or grain sizes that could be used with adequate stability of magnetic transitions in high-density information storage. The practical lower limit for metal-particle volume is found to be about one-fifth to one-fourth of the volume of current advanced particles. © 1999 IEEE.","Coercivity; Magnetic recording; Magnetic stability; Magnetic viscosity; Metal evaporated; Metal particles; Thermal instability; Time effects","Coercive force; Magnetic recording; Magnetic variables measurement; Thermodynamic stability; Magnetic stability; Magnetic time effects; Magnetic viscosity; Metal-evaporated tapes; Metal-particulate tapes; Magnetic tape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033220891

Changes in flying height modulate both the envelope of the read signal and its mean value. While the envelope is related to the magnetic spacing, the mean value is a function of the thermal spacing. The thermal spacing signal is the result of Joule heating whereby some of the thermal energy generated in the MR head is dissipated into the air film between the head and disk. Changes in head flying height alter the heat transfer and hence the temperature and resistance of the head. The thermal and magnetic signals are separable and give complimentary information about the flying height. To accurately measure flying height changes using the thermal signal when the head is inside a disk drive requires that the signal distortion caused by the head preamplifier and high-pass filter be corrected. The thermal signal, unlike the magnetic signal, is not sensitive to track misregistration making it more accurate for dynamic flying height measurements. In-situ dynamic flying height measurement results using both thermal and magnetic methods are discussed. © 1999 IEEE.","Disk drive; Flying height; Magnetoresistive heads; Thermal spacing","Amplifiers (electronic); Heat losses; Heat transfer; High pass filters; Magnetic heads; Magnetoresistance; Flying height; Magnetoresistive heads; Magnetic disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033184346

The present study characterizes the damping behavior of Ni-Ti SMAs using the complex modulus approach, commonly used in structural dynamics for the characterization of damping materials. Results indicate that as excitation frequency increases, the loss modulus (a measure of the damping) undergoes a rapid initial decrease. The value of loss modulus (and available damping) at 6-10 Hz is approximately 50% of that at low frequencies, but does not show significant reduction thereafter. As the cyclic strain amplitude increases, the storage modulus (a measure of the stiffness) initially undergoes a rapid decrease, implying that the material softens with increasing motion amplitude. As the static strain offset increases, the loss modulus decreases, and the storage modulus increases. The loss modulus decreases at temperatures above 90°F, while the storage modulus shows a significant increase above 130°F associated with the SMA operating outside its ideal pseudoelastic temperature window. The experimental stress/strain hysteresis loops and the idealized loops based on complex modulus characterization compare very well for small cyclic strain amplitudes, but may differ for higher amplitudes. However, the energy dissipation estimates from the idealized and experimental hysteresis loops compare very well over the entire range of cyclic strain amplitudes, indicating that complex modulus characterization is well suited for estimating the damping capability of SMAs. © 1999 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Damping; Elasticity; Nickel alloys; Stiffness; Strain; Stresses; Complex modulus approach; Pseudoelastic damping; Shape memory effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033077772

The improved stability of HTS is due to the increased specific heat and a wider temperature margin between the operating and critical temperature. The quench analysis of HTS magnet system is however quite different from their LTS counterparts because of the slanted E(J) characteristic due to the thermally activated flux creep and macroscopic material inhomogeneities. The comparison of different quench parameters of a 6 T LTS wiggler and a 5 kJ HTS SMES have been evaluated. The former system is installed in a 1.5 GeV electron storage ring in the University of Lund, Sweden, and the latter has been demonstrated to compensate a short term loss of power.

In case of normal conductor, it would suffice if we design the coil to obtain maximum inductance. For superconducting coil, it is essential to maximize (1/2Li2) as a whole since the value of allowable current depends on flux density which in turn is linked with L. This results in the design of a coil, whose inductance is much lower than the maximum possible value and has relatively large diameter as compared to its length and radial thickness. Since such a coil requires a cryostat of unusually large neck, one may choose a sub-optimal design based on commercially available drum type cryostat for transportable micro SMES units.

Therefore, Vref is about 1.25 V, which limits a low supply-voltage operation below 1 V. Conversely, in the proposed BGR circuit, Tref has been converted from the sum of two currents; one is proportional to Vf and the other is proportional to VT. An experimental BGR circuit, which is simply composed of a CMOS op-amp, diodes, and resistors, has been fabricated in a conventional 0.4-μm flash memory process.

In order to solve this problem, we propose a concept of Force-Balanced Coil (FBC) applied to the SMES. The FBC balances the centering force with the hoop force, both of which are exerted in the major radius direction. Moreover, for the optimization of large aspect ratio superconducting coils, we propose a Stress-Balanced Coil (SBC) concept, improving the concept of FBC, which balances magnetic pressures at the coil nose part where the produced magnetic field reaches its maximum value. Comparing the Toroidal magnetic Field Coil (TFC) and FBC with SBC, the last can reduce coil stresses and obtain large stored energy with shorter length conductors and/or lower magnetic fields. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Electric coils; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Electromagnetic waves; Magnetic fields; Force balanced coil; Stress balanced coil; Superconducting coils; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Toroidal magnetic field coil; Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032670161

Flywheel devices need to be of high efficiency and an important source of losses is the bearings. In addition, the requirement is for the devices to have long lifetimes with minimal or no maintenance. Conventional rolling element bearings can and have been used, but a non-contact bearing, such as a superconducting magnetic bearing, is expected to have a longer lifetime and lower losses. At Cambridge we have constructed a flywheel system. Designed to run in vacuum this incorporates a 40kg flywheel supported on superconducting magnetic bearings. The production device will be a 5kW device storing 5 kWh of retrievable energy at 50,000 rpm. The Cambridge system is being developed in parallel with a similar device supported on a conventional bearing. This will allow direct performance comparisons. Although superconducting bearings are increasingly well understood, of major importance are the cryogenics and special attention is being paid to methods of packaging and insulating the superconductors to cut down radiation losses.

The properties are from standard Charpy V-notch (CVN), 0.4T planform Compact Tension (C(D), and Tensile (T) specimens machined from archival steel from large water piping. The piping and storage tanks were constructed in the 1950s from semi-killed, hot-rolled carbon steel plate specified as A285 Grade B. Evaluation of potential aging mechanisms at both service conditions shows no loss in fracture resistance of the steel in either case. Site and literature data show that the A285, Grade B steel, at and above approximately 70°F, is in the upper transition to upper shelf region for absorbed energy and is not subject to cleavage cracking or a brittle fracture mode. Furthermore, the tank sidewalls are 1/2 or 5/8-inch thick, and therefore, the J-resistance (JR) curve that characterizes material resistance to stable crack extension under elastic-plastic deformation best defines the material fracture toughness. The JR curves for several heats of A285, Grade B steel tested at 40°F, a temperature near the average ductile-to-brittle (DBTT) transition temperature (CVN @ 15 ft-lb), are presented. This data is applicable to evaluate flaw stability of the storage tanks that are operated above 70°F since, even at 40°F, crack advance is observed to proceed by ductile tearing.

Although the same gene (chromosome 8p22) encodes LPL, the enzyme activity is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Dysfunction of the LPL enzyme has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia (high triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol), early arteriosclerosis, and the pathogenesis of obesity. Treatment with growth hormone (GH) both in vivo and in vitro results in a pronounced reduction (often up to 50%) of LPL activity in adipose tissue in humans. The specific level of messenger ribonucleic acid, however, is not generally affected by GH treatment in adipose tissue, indicating that the effect of GH is mediated at a post-translational level. The GH-mediated reduction in adipose tissue LPL activity may be involved in the reduction in adipose tissue mass commonly seen after prolonged GH treatment in GH-deficient adults and GH treatment in obese subjects. LPL activity in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue is generally regulated in a reciprocal manner by, for example, fasting, feeding, insulin and epinephrine. A high level of LPL activity, particularly in skeletal muscle tissue, has been found to be associated with a beneficial lipoprotein profile (low triglyceride and high HDL cholesterol). In investigations where obese but otherwise healthy women were treated with GH, and in another study where adults with GH deficiency were treated for 4 months with GH, we found no effects of GH on either skeletal muscle LPL activity nor on skeletal muscle LPL gene expression. In conclusion, GH has a pronounced inhibitory effect on adipose tissue LPL activity, which is mediated at a post-translational level. The GH-induced reduction in adipose tissue mass may be partly mediated by this effect on adipose tissue LPL. GH has no effects on LPL activity in skeletal muscle, which may be related to the fact that GH has no or only minor effects on plasma triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels. Finally, GH is not, unlike for example insulin and catecholamines, involved in antagonistic regulation of LPL in muscle and adipose tissue. © 1999, Editrice Kurtis.","Adipose tissue; Growth hormone; Growth hormone deficiency; Lipoprotein lipase activity; Skeletal muscle","human growth hormone; lipoprotein lipase; adipose tissue; adult; drug effect; enzymology; female; human; review; skeletal muscle; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Female; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Lipoprotein Lipase; Muscle, Skeletal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032612115

It was established that PbS forms the nanocrystals of 4 nm highly dispersed in amorphous regions of poly-p-xylylene (PPX). It has been shown that the arrangement of nanocrystals in composite films is determined by poly-p-xylylene supramolecular structure: PbS nanocrystals are localized in the poly-p-xylylene amorphous regions characterized by high free volume. Dark conductivity decreases at long-term storage of film that probably results from the diffusion and rearrangement of PbS clusters in amorphous regions. Synthesized PbS composites reveal the essential photoconductive effect. Low energy of excited light, the temperature and voltage dependence of observed photoconductivity lead to the conclusion that the conductivity is determined by the photostimulated tunnel electron transfer between semiconductor-nanocrystals.","Nanocomposite films; PbS clusters; Photoconductivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000433482

Mammalian pinealocytes contain more 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) than any other cells and are expected to contain VMAT, although no information is available so far. Upon the addition of ATP, radiolabeled 5-HT was taken up by a particulate fraction prepared from cultured rat pinealocytes. The 5-HT uptake was inhibited significantly by bafilomycin A1 (an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase), 3,5-di-tert-butyl- 4-hydroxybenzylidenemalononitrile (a proton conductor), or reserpine (an inhibitor of VMAT). RT-PCR analysis suggested that VMAT type 1 (VMAT1), but not type 2, is expressed. Antibodies against VMAT1 recognized a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of ~55 kDa, and specifically immunostained pinealocytes. VMAT1 immunoreactivity was high in the vesicular structures in the varicosities of long branching processes and was associated with 5-HT, but not with synaptophysin, a marker protein for microvesicles. The 5-HT immunoreactivity in the long branching processes disappeared upon incubation with reserpine. These results indicate that 5-HT, at least in part, is stored in vesicles other than microvesicles in pinealocytes through a mechanism similar to that of various secretory vesicles.","5- Hydroxytryptamine; Exocytosis; Melatonin; Microvesicles; Pinealocytes; Vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT)","3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzylidenemalononitrile; bafilomycin a1; carrier protein; melatonin; reserpine; serotonin; synaptophysin; unclassified drug; vesicular monoamine transporter 1; animal cell; article; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; nonhuman; pinealocyte; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; rat; regulatory mechanism; serotonin release; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cells, Cultured; Energy Metabolism; Exocytosis; Glutamic Acid; Macrolides; Melatonin; Membrane Glycoproteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Neurons; Neuropeptides; Nitriles; Norepinephrine; PC12 Cells; Pineal Gland; Proton-Translocating ATPases; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reserpine; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Serotonin; Vesicular Biogenic Amine Transport Proteins; Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins; Animalia; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032748150

While the Zr-based alloy electrode is not fully activated before 50 cycles, the ball-milled Zr-based alloy electrode using Ti-based alloy as a surface modifier is fully activated within only 4 cycles. In order to analyze the strikingly improved activation characteristics after ball-milling, the microstructure of ball-milled alloy is examined by TEM, SEM and EDS. It is observed that there is a surface alloying region at the contact points between the two alloy powders from the TEM bright-field image. Furthermore, the local quantitative analysis by EDS clearly reveals that the atomic concentration of the constituting elements in the surface alloying region is gradually changed between the two alloy powders. From the above results, it is suggested that the high kinetic energy applied in the ball-milling process causes cold-welding or surface alloying at the points of impact where Zr-based alloy particles collide with Ti-based alloy particles by the action of steel balls at high speed. The SEM analysis demonstrates that the particle size is decreased as the ball-milling time increases, which implies an increase in the surface area of Zr-based alloy particles touching Ti-based alloy particles. Eventually, it can be suggested that Ti-alloy powder serves as a window for hydrogen to penetrate into the Zr-based alloy, which leads to easy absorption-desorption of hydrogen and also to improvement in the activation properties of the Zr-based alloy electrode.",,"Ball milling; Catalyst activity; Desorption; Electrochemical electrodes; Gas absorption; Hydrogen; Kinetic energy; Particle size analysis; Surface treatment; Titanium alloys; Electrocatalytic activity; Hydrogen storage alloys; Zirconium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033359257

At varying times, membrane phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography. AA labeled phospholipids similarly at both 4 °C and 37 °C. Analysis of the ratios of [3H] AA and [14C] glycerol incorporated into phosphatidic acid or other phospholipids in dual-labeled cells indicated that the deacylation/reacylation cycle was the major route of AA incorporation at hypothermia. This was supported by showing that blocking phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity by trifluoperazine suppressed AA incorporation into phospholipids. PLA2 activity, measured by determining the release of AA, was slow during 48-hour cold storage, but increased significantly when ATP was depleted by inhibition of mitochondria and glycolysis. In the whole rat liver, there was no significant loss of phospholipids during 48-hour storage (total phospholipids [μmol phosphorus/L/mg]: 0.197 ± .001 at 0 hours) unless energy blockers were used (0.155 ± .005 at 48 hours) or glycogen depleted by fasting the rat (0.167 ± .001 at 48 hours). This study shows that a net PLA2 stimulated hydrolysis of phospholipids is seen only when ATP is depleted and its generation from anaerobic glycolysis inhibited. Thus, PLA2 hydrolysis of phospholipids is not a significant cause of liver cell injury during cold storage when livers are obtained in optimal condition. However, conditions affecting the generation of ATP during cold storage could alter PLA2 leading to membrane damage.",,"animal tissue; article; cell isolation; cryopreservation; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; hydrolysis; lipid analysis; liver cell; male; membrane damage; nonhuman; phospholipid metabolism; priority journal; rat; thin layer chromatography; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animals; Arachidonic Acid; Carbon Radioisotopes; Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells, Cultured; Cold; Glutathione; Glycerol; Insulin; Kinetics; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Liver; Male; Melitten; Organ Preservation Solutions; Phospholipids; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Temperature; Time Factors; Tissue Preservation; Tritium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032712236

At the regional scale, we suggest that attention can be focused more dearly on understanding the relative strengths of predicted net primary productivity (NPP) limitation by energy, water, and nutrients. We evaluate the sources of variability among model predictions of NPP with a regional-scale comparison between estimates made by PnET-II (a forest ecosystem process model previously applied to the northeastern region) and TEM 4.0 (a terrestrial biosphere model typically applied to the globe) for the northeastern US. When the same climate, vegetation, and soil data sets were used to drive both models, regional average NPP predictions made by PnET-II and TEM were remarkably similar, and at the biome level, model predictions agreed fairly well with NPP estimates developed from field measurements. However, TEM 4.0 predictions were more sensitive to regional variations in temperature as a result of feedbacks between temperature and belowground N availability. In PnET-II, the direct link between transpiration and photosynthesis caused substantial water stress in hardwood and pine forest types with increases in solar radiation; predicted water stress was relieved substantially when soil water holding capacity (WHC) was increased. Increasing soil WHC had little effect on TEM 4.0 predictions because soil water storage was already sufficient to meet plant demand with baseline WHC values, and because predicted N availability under baseline conditions in this region was not limited by water. Because NPP predictions were closely keyed to forest cover type, the relative coverage of low- versus high-productivity forests at both fine and coarse resolutions was an important determinant of regional NPP predictions. Therefore, changes in grid cell size and differences in the methods used to aggregate from fine to coarse resolution were important to NPP predictions insofar as they changed the relative proportions of forest cover. We suggest that because the small patches of high-elevation spruce-fir forest in this region are substantially less productive than forests in the remainder of the region, more accurate NPP predictions will result if models applied to this region use land cover input data sets that retain as much fine-resolution forest type variability as possible. The differences among model responses to variations in climate and soil WHC data sets suggest that the models will respond quite differently to scenarios of future climate. A better understanding of the dynamic interactions between water stress, N availability, and forest productivity in this region will enable models to make more accurate predictions of future carbon stocks and fluxes.","Climate; Ecosystem process modeling; Modeling uncertainty; Net primary production; Northeastern US; PnET; Soil water holding capacity; Spatial resolution; TEM; Vegetation representation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033450939

Results of a series of systematic property characterizations pertinent for this application are presented in this paper. These include Laue diffraction patterns and high-precision lattice-constant determination, etch rate, stoichiometry, thermal expansion, soft X-ray reflectivity and rocking-curve measurements, thermal load effects on monochromator performance, nature of intrinsic positive glitches and their reduction. The 004 reflection of YB66 has a reflectance of ∼3% in this spectral region. The width of the rocking curve varies from 0.25 eV at 1.1 keV to 1.0 eV at 2 keV, which is a factor of two better than that of beryl(1010) in the same energy range, and enables measurements of high-resolution XANES spectra at the Mg, Al and Si K-edges. The thermal bump on the first crystal arising from the low thermal conductivity of YB66 causes an energy drift of a few eVs with storage-ring current and necessitates periodic energy calibration with metal foils. The positive glitches in the transmission function just above the Mg K-edge have substantially been reduced using an Si or SiC mirror which suppresses the sharp reflectivity increases associated with anomalous scattering for the YB66 006 reflection at the Y L3- and L2-edges. Continual operation over the past five years of a YB66 double-crystal monochromator installed on the JUMBO beamline at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) indeed proves the long-term stability of this material in synchrotron radiation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions as indicated by the invariance in rocking-curve characteristics after being exposed to an accumulative power level of ∼3 × 108 J over this period of time.","1-2 keV spectroscopy; Soft X-ray monochromators; YB66",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033432006

With the thickness of these coatings decreasing to below 5 nm for high areal density magnetic storage, it is important to understand the fundamental growth mechanism and properties of very thin films. The present work provides results of the properties of DLC overcoats deposited on n-type silicon (100) substrates, which were characterized in terms of residual stress, Raman spectroscopy, electrical resistivity and surface energy as a function of film thickness. An ion beam chemical vapor deposition (IBCVD) process using methane (CH4) as the precursor was used to deposit the DLC. The results indicate that there is considerable change in the film properties as the film grows. The residual stress gradually decreases with an increase in film thickness up to 10 nm where the stress is about 2.5 GPa. Above 10 nm film thickness, the stress increases again. The Raman intensity ratios on these films follow a similar pattern. Data on surface energy, and electrical resistivity are also presented. Implications of these measurements on the thin film growth mechanism are discussed.

Due to the attractive performance characteristics, lithium-ion batteries have been identified as the battery chemistry of choice for a number of future applications, including Mars rovers and landers. The Mars 2001 Lander (Mars Surveyor Program MSP 01) will be one of the first missions which will utilize lithium-ion technology. This application will require two lithium-ion batteries, each being 28 V (eight cells), 25 Ah and 8 kg.

Performance tests were carried out at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) in 1996. After that, the coil was installed in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) facility and tested in 1998, in collaboration between Japan and the United States. The AC losses measured at LLNL were in good agreement with those measured at JAERI. It was reconfirmed that the coupling loss of the coil could be expressed in two components: one with a short and another with a long coupling time constant. We found out from the Hall probe signals that the loop currents with long decay times were induced in the CIC conductor by varying magnetic field. These currents resulted in additional AC loss in the coil. To develop a concept of CIC with low AC loss, we made a sub-scale CIC conductor of strands coated with CuNi. We fabricated a small coil out of this conductor and measured the AC loss. The measured AC loss in this coil was about 1/6 of that in the SMES model coil conductor per strand volume. Thus, the CuNi coating of the strands was demonstrated to be effective to reduce the AC loss in the coil.",,"Electric coils; Electric conduits; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric losses; Magnetic field effects; Superconducting cables; Cable-in-conduit conductors; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033355266

In this paper, the flow reduction by rapid heating is described for forced flow superconducting coil with a CIC conductor. The phenomenon of flow reduction of the forced flow coil has been applied for coil quench detection and has been developed by Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI). It is named the `fluid method' and essential technology for quench detection of large-scale forced flow superconducting coil as fusion magnets and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) coil. In the fluid method, the inlet flow reduction is caused by Joule heating on the normal zone of superconducting coil. The fluid method has no electric noise in its detection. This is an advantage for pulsed operation in comparison with other electrical quench detection systems. On the other hand, there are no quantitative considerations between the inlet flow reduction and Joule heating of the coil inside in previous studies. The flow reduction for the quench detection has been determined by the operation experience of forced flow superconducting coil. The purpose of this paper is an estimation of the relation between the inlet flow reduction and Joule heating at coil quench. First, the inlet flow reduction was obtained by experiment in which the sample has an inductive heater for the quench emulation. Second, the evaluation model was proposed and its model showed good agreement between the inlet flow reduction and heat generation of the coil inside by rapid heating as coil quench.",,"Electric coils; Electric conduits; Heating; Superconducting cables; Cable-in-conduit conductors; Superconducting coils; Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033347481

Toroidicity, plasma shaping, uneven distances between the resonant surfaces and detectors, and non-circular conducting wall geometry have made mode identification difficult and complex, especially in terms of the conventional toroidal and poloidal mode numbers, which we call (m, n)-identification. Singular value decomposition (SVD), without any assumption of the basis vectors, determines its own basis vectors representing the fluctuation data in the directions of maximum coherence. Factorization of a synchronized set of spatially distributed data leads to eigenvectors of time- and spatial-covariance matrices, with the energy content of each eigenvector. SVD minimizes the number of significant basis vectors, reducing noise, and minimizes the data storage required to restore the fluctuation data. For sinusoidal signals, SVD is essentially the same as spectral analysis. When the mode has non-smooth structures the advantage of not having to treat all its spectral components is significant in analyzing mode dynamics and in data storage. From time SVD vectors, we can see the evolution of each coherent structure. Therefore, sporadic or intermittent events can be recognized, while such events would be ignored with spectral analysis. We present the use of SVD to analyze tokamak magnetic fluctuation data, time evolution of MHD modes, spatial structure of each time vector, and the energy content of each mode. If desired, the spatial SVD vectors can be least-square fit to specific numerical predictions for the (m, n) identification. A phase-fitting method for (m, n) mode identification is presented for comparison. Applications of these methods to mode locking analysis are presented.",,"Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Magnetohydrodynamics; Tokamak devices; Mode locking Analysis; Phase-fitting method; Singular value decomposition (SVD); Magnetoplasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033276690

Lactation performance of the female in turn influences the rate and pattern of pup growth. We examined variation in and patterns of milk composition and production, maternal energy output, and pup growth and energy deposition over the entire lactation period in 18 grey seal mother-pup pairs using hydrogen isotope (3H2O and D2O) dilution. Milk composition was independent of maternal mass and nutrient stores, indicating dependence on other physiological and genetic factors. Heavier females lactated longer (r2 = 0.653, P &lt; 0.001), had higher total milk outputs (r2 = 0.652, P &lt; 0.001), and produced larger pups at weaning (r2 = 0.417, P = 0.005).

Total milk energy output was the strongest predictor of pup weaning mass, which, along with the pup's efficiency of energy storage, accounted for 91% of the variation in weaning mass. Nevertheless, there was sufficient plasticity in milk composition and energy output that some smaller females produced relatively large pups.

Here we report on the biosynthesis of [14C]β-poly(L-malate) from injected L-[14C]malate in the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. The effects of KCN, arsenate, adenosine 5'-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate, adenosine 5'-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate, guanosine 5'-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate, desulfo coenzyme A and phenylarsinoxid on β-poly(L-malate) synthesis were studied after their coinjection with L-[14C]malate. The synthesis was not affected by KCN or desulfo coenzyme A, but was blocked by arsenate and adenosine 5'-(α,β- methylene)triphosphate. The plasmodium lysate catalysed an L-malate-dependent ATP-[32P]pyrophosphate exchange, but was devoid of β-poly(L-malate) synthetic activity under all experimental conditions tested. The results suggested an extramitochondrial synthesis of β-poly(L-malate), involving the polymerization of β-L-malyl-AMP. It is assumed that the lack of synthesis in the lysate is caused by the inactivation of β-poly(L-malate) polymerase involving a cell injury kinase pathway.

It can thus he used to define the storage efficiency for sensible heat storage devices. A new parameter that isolates the stratification component of the exergy is defined and called the stratification efficiency. The effect of temperature distribution, delivery temperature and tank cross-section on exergy and stratification efficiency is investigated. The advantage that stratification offers over a mixed tank is examined in terms of the storage efficiency and overall solar water heating system performance. Exergy is used to assess the operation of mantle heat exchangers in solar water heating systems and it is shown that exergy and stratification efficiency, as well as energy, should be used to ascertain the performance of such heat exchangers. © 1999 by ASME.",,"Hot water storage systems; Energy efficiency; Heat exchangers; Hot water distribution systems; Temperature distribution; Thermal stratification; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033223958

The heart must be protected during this ischemic period to avoid additional injury, and techniques have been developed that delay ischemic injury and minimize reperfusion injury. Almost universally, this involves using a hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution and these solutions have become the gold standard for myocardial protection for more than 20 years. Despite the extensive and continued research aimed at improving these basic hyperkalemic cardioplegic solutions, patients undergoing surgery almost invariably experience some degree of postoperative dysfunction. It is likely that this relates to the depolarizing nature of hyperkalemic solutions, which results in ionic imbalance caused by continuing transmembrane fluxes and the consequent maintenance of high energy phosphate metabolism, even during hypothermic ischemia. A potentially beneficial alternative to hyperkalemic cardioplegia is to arrest the heart in a 'hyperpolarized' or 'polarized' state, which maintains the membrane potential of the arrested myocardium at or near to the resting membrane potential. At these potentials, transmembrane fluxes will be minimized and there should be little metabolic demand, resulting in improved myocardial protection. Recent studies have explored these alternative concepts for myocardial protection. The use of compounds such as adenosine or potassium channel openers, which are thought to induce hyperpolarized arrest, have demonstrated improved protection after normothermic, or short periods of hypothermic, ischemia when compared to hyperkalemic (depolarized) arrest. Similarly, studies from our own laboratory, in which the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin, was used to induce polarized arrest (demonstrated by direct measurement of membrane potential during ischemia) was also shown to provide better recovery of function after 5 hours of long-term hypothermic (7.5°C) storage. These promising initial studies need to be consolidated before experimental promise becomes clinical reality.",,"tetrodotoxin; acid base balance; cardioplegia; conference paper; cryopreservation; heart depolarization; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle potential; heart muscle reperfusion; heart preservation; human; priority journal; reperfusion injury; Adenosine; Animals; Cardioplegic Solutions; Electrocardiography; Heart Arrest, Induced; Humans; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Organ Preservation; Picolines; Pinacidil; Potassium Channels; Pyrans; Sodium Channel Blockers; Vasodilator Agents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032729534

Dissociation rates as a function of bath gas temperature were measured along with product ion spectra. Studies were conducted to show that dissociation rates were independent of ion storage conditions and bath gas pressure. These studies indicate that good approximations to true Arrhenius parameters could be determined from Arrhenius plots using the bath gas temperature as a measure of the internal energy distribution of the parent ion population. Arrhenius parameters derived in this work agree with those reported recently using blackbody-induced radiative dissociation for the singly and doubly charged ions within experimental error. The spectrum of dissociation products were also very similar, reflecting the equivalency of the two methods for deriving Arrhenius parameters. Arrhenius parameters for the triply charged ion (Ea= 0.79 ± 0.03 eV; log A = 9.3 ± 0.36 s-1) are reported for the first time.

Thiolases can function either degradatively, in the β-oxidation pathway of fatty acids, or biosynthetically. Biosynthetic thiolases catalyze the biological Claisen condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA. This is one of the fundamental categories of carbon skeletal assembly patterns in biological systems and is the first step in a wide range of biosynthetic pathways, including those that generate cholesterol, steroid hormones, and various energy-storage molecules. Results: The crystal structure of the tetrameric biosynthetic thiolase from Zoogloea ramigera has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure contains a striking and novel 'cage-like' tetramerization motif, which allows for some hinge motion of the two tight dimers with respect to each other. The protein crystals were flash-frozen after a short soak with the enzyme's substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA. A reaction intermediate was thus trapped: the enzyme tetramer is acetylated at Cys89 and has a CoA molecule bound in each of its active-site pockets. Conclusions: The shape of the substrate-binding pocket reveals the basis for the short-chain substrate specificity of the enzyme. The active-site architecture, and in particular the position of the covalently attached acetyl group, allow a more detailed reaction mechanism to be proposed in which Cys378 is involved in both steps of the reaction. The structure also suggests an important role for the thioester oxygen atom of the acetylated enzyme in catalysis.","Biosynthetic; CoA; Reaction intermediate; Tetramer; Thiolase","acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase; article; biosynthesis; catalysis; crystal structure; enzyme active site; enzyme analysis; enzyme mechanism; enzyme specificity; enzyme structure; enzyme substrate; nonhuman; priority journal; Zoogloea ramigera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033569705

These differences may result in the reduction of focusing efficiency of diffraction-limited SR, if the focusing is performed by conventional optical components optimized for point sources. We show that by applying a phase correction locally, one may transform the phase of SR electric field at a desired polarization to that of a point source. Such corrections are computed for undulator radiation (planar and helical) and bending magnet radiation (central part and edges). The focusing of the corrected SR wavefront can result in the increase of peak intensity in the focused spot up to several times compared to the focusing without correction. For non-diffraction-limited radiation, the effect of the phase corrections is reduced. Due to this reason, the use of the proposed phase corrections in existing electron storage rings is essentially of interest in the photon energy range from infrared to VUV.

Applying this method to transversely isotropic and anisotropic beams, the effects of simultaneous excitation of two normal modes on halo development mechanism have been explored. We find that, in isotropic cases with the same emittance and external focusing strength in the two transverse directions, single-particle motion exhibits strong chaosity in wide parameter space due to the resonance overlap of two 2:1 particle-core resonances. The strong chaosity is expected to result in an increase of halo intensity enhancing the chance for the particles to gain excess energy through resonant interaction with the core. Of particular importance is the result that the resonance overlap can be avoided by introducing appropriate anisotropy provided that the beam density is lower than a certain threshold. The avoidance of the resonance overlap suppresses chaosity in single-particle motion, which strongly suggests that halo intensity can be reduced in anisotropic situations by choosing appropriate parameters such as beam density and external focusing force strength. This gives us a practical criterion to choose parameters in designing a high-intensity ion synchrotron and storage ring.",,"Anisotropy; Chaos theory; Electric space charge; Mathematical models; Resonance; Storage rings; Synchrotrons; Beam halo formation; Particle core analysis; Particle beam dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033312865

Several cases are considered, including some storages which are homogeneous, and others which undergo phase changes. In some cases the storages are stratified. A full cycle of charging, storing and discharging is considered for each case. Four cold thermal storage cases are presented in an illustrative example. The results demonstrate that exergy analysis provides more realistic and accurate assessments of the efficiency and performance of cold thermal storage systems than those given by the more conventional energy analysis. In addition, exergy analysis is conceptually more direct since it treats cold as a valuable commodity. It is concluded that the potential usefulness of exergy analysis in addressing and solving cold thermal storage problems is substantial.

Moreover, it is involved in the homeostasis of body composition and is linked to the regulation of insulin signaling, thus playing an important role in liver fat storage. Steatosis is a common finding in chronic hepatitis C, and both viral and metabolic factors have been suggested to explain the presence of this histological characteristic. In order to study leptin in chronic liver disease characterized by the presence of steatosis, we evaluated its serum levels in patients with nonalcohoiic steatohepatitis (NASH), in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with no histological findings of steatosis, and CHC patients with steatosis but no risk factors for its development. METHODOLOGY: We studied 6 male patients with NASH whose diagnosis was made on the basis of histological findings and clinical criteria. From among a cohort of 170 CHC patients we put together 2 groups of 6 male patients each (with or without steatosis at liver biopsy examination), who had no risk factors for NASH. Male patients were chosen in order to avoid gender influence on leptin levels. Further criteria for admission were similar impairment of liver metabolic function as assessed by the monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) test and, in patients with CHC, similar body mass index (BMI) and histological staging. Moreover, we evaluated leptin/BMI ratio, in order to rule out BMI influence on leptin levels. Leptin levels were assessed by means of radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: We found that BMI was higher in NASH compared to CHC (27.2 ± 2.9 vs. 23.9 ± 1.8; p = 0.01). Analysis of serum leptin levels showed an increasing trend starting from patients with CHC without steatosis (3.2 ± 0.4ng/ml), through CHC patients with steatosis (4.2 ± 0.7 ng/ml) up to patients with NASH (5.7 ± 2 ng/ml), although the differences observed were not statistically significant. Moreover, the ratio of leptin to BMI also followed the same trend showing increasing values (CHC without steatosis = 0.04 ± 0.02; CHC patients with steatosis = 0.17 ± 0.03; NASH = 0.203 ± 0.07). Leptin levels and BMI showed a significant relationship (n = 18; r = 0.60; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increasing trend observed in leptin serum levels among the different groups of patients showed that in chronic liver disease characterized by the presence of steatosis, leptin signaling is preserved. Moreover, CHC factors different from the metabolic ones should be investigated in order to explain the presence of steatosis. Further studies on broader groups of patients are needed to verify these preliminary results.","Body mass index; Chronic hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; Leptin; Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; Steatosis","deethyllidocaine; insulin; leptin; adult; article; body composition; body mass; chronic hepatitis; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; energy expenditure; food intake; hepatitis c; histology; homeostasis; human; lipid storage; liver; liver biopsy; liver metabolism; male; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; risk factor; signal transduction; steatosis; Adult; Biopsy; Body Mass Index; Fatty Liver; Hepatitis; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Leptin; Liver; Male; Middle Aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032828272

The charge density, the spin density and the orbital moment become anisotropic. These effects can be studied by the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) technique which senses the local anisotropy of charge, spin and angular momentum around an atom that is excited by the absorption of polarized X-rays. Here we briefly review the principles of the technique and then apply it to the study of the thickness-dependent electronic and magnetic properties of a Co film sandwiched between Au. The experimental results are compared to those obtained by electronic structure calculations for a free Co monolayer and a Co monolayer sandwiched between Au. In particular, a simple ligand field model is developed which allows one to visualize the origin of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in terms of the preferred direction of the orbital moment, corresponding to the direction of maximum size. The model supports the intuitive picture that the orbital moment on an atom becomes anisotropic through quenching effects by the anisotropic ligand fields of the neighbors. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Anisotropy; Monolayers; Symmetry breaking; X-rays","Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Cobalt; Dichroism; Electronic structure; Gold; Ligands; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Magnetocrystalline anisotropy; Monolayers; Spectroscopy; Transition metals; X rays; Electron energy levels; Electronic properties; Magnetic moments; Microscopic examination; Multilayers; Thin films; X ray spectroscopy; Electronic and magnetic properties; Electronic structure calculations; Ligand field models; Orbital moment; Polarized x-ray; Quenching effect; Symmetry-breaking; X-ray magnetic circular dichroism; Angular momentum; Charge density; Ligand field model; Magnetocrystalline anisotropy; Spin density; Symmetry breaking; X ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy; Anisotropy; Magnetic anisotropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038237201

It is a mild estrogen that induces increases in body weight in experimental animals. The relative abundance of estrone esters in animal tissues suggests that it may also be found in foods, from which it may alter the mechanisms of body weight control. Aim of the study: To measure the total estrone content in food and to determine whether this may affect body weight. Methods: In the first part of the study, a method was devised for the measurement of total estrone content in food. This was applied to the analysis of estrone content in a variety of food. Finally, hyperlipidic diets (18.6 MJ/kg) with a total estrone content 0.89 ± 0.21 μmol/kg (control group) and 1.37 ± 0.13 μmol/kg (laced with estrone fatty esters) were given to rats during 15 days, in order to determine the influence of dietary estrone on the body mass. Zucker lean (Fa/?) rats weighing initially 200-215 g were used. The total estrone (essentially as fatty esters) content of food was investigated by combining a dried methanol extraction with saponification and measurement of the free estrone evolved through radioimmunoassay. Result: The content of estrone was zero in some vegetables, but significant in fruits, meats, and especially fats, both of plant and animal origin. The application of these analyses to a standard recommended diet for humans may result in intakes of more than 1 μmol of estrone per day, a figure comparable to the estrogen production by women. When rats were exposed to a raised estrone content in a fat-rich diet, they significantly increased their body weights, doubling their rate of growth (1.99 g/day) compared with controls (0.81 g/day), but maintaining their plasma composition and the proportions of lipid, water, and protein in their carcasses. Conclusion: The widely distributed estrone esters in food and their relatively high concentrations may result in high free hormone intakes in humans. The continued and massive intake of estrone may enhance tissue deposition and lead to obesity.","Dietary estrogen; Estrogen; Estrone; Obesity","estrone; lipid; animal experiment; article; body mass; body weight; controlled study; female; food composition; lipid diet; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; rat; Animals; Body Mass Index; Energy Metabolism; Estrone; Female; Food Analysis; Humans; Obesity; Rats; Rats, Zucker; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033429091

An in vitro method was utilized to evaluate the effects of chemical modification on the rate and extent of raw and cooked starch digestion. The extent of starch digestion was significantly reduced by dextrinization, etherification, and oxidation. However, the rate of starch digestion was not significantly affected by chemical modification. For most modified starches, as the degree of modification increased, the extent of digestion decreased, suggesting an increase in the amount of resistant starch. The results of this study suggest that chemically modified starch has a metabolizable energy value of <16.7 kJ/g.

Field studies were undertaken at Steinkopf, an arid site in the Northern Cape, South Africa. The resource biomass and the total available energy here were amongst the highest recorded for any bathyergids, but geophytes were sparse and widely distributed. The low probability of locating these widely dispersed resources should promote co-operative foraging in these mole-rats. All common geophyte species were consumed, probably because high burrowing costs favour dietary generalism. The mole-rat biomass per metre of burrow system (0.5-1.5 g.m1) remains the lowest of any subterranean mammal. Burrow depths and diameters were positively correlated to the average mass of the mole-rats in each colony, apparently minimizing energetic costs and maximizing foraging success. Bulbs were stored in central food caches, and both field and laboratory data indicated size-based selectivity in their storage and consumption. As predicted by central place foraging theory, large bulbs were preferentially stored, and small bulbs preferentially consumed. However, factors other than energetic considerations may also influence these storage decisions. Total consumption time of bulbs was negatively correlated to animal size, and furthermore smaller bulbs were consumed more rapidly than larger ones. In addition to geophyte-storing, C. h. hottentotus also exhibited an alternative foraging strategy, termed 'geophyte farming', in which large bulbs were left and eaten in situ, and served as a renewable resource. Together with these foraging specializations, the evolution of sociality in mole-rats is a key factor which enables them to live in some of the most formidable habitats in Africa.","Central place foraging; Common mole-rats; Food caching; Resource characteristics","captive population; comparative study; foraging behavior; resource availability; rodent; wild population; South Africa; Cryptomys hottentotus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033212720

In deep lakes that thermally stratify, M. r]elicta spends most of the time on or near the lake bottom in cold water where food resources are low; but, M. relicta migrates daily into warmer layers to feed where food resources are more abundant. Hence, in deep lakes M. relicta traverses steep temperature and prey density gradients while migrating through the water column to forage. We conducted a laboratory growth experiment of factorial design that simulated the range of temperatures and densities of natural zooplankton forage encountered by M. relicta during DVM. Somatic growth, measured as change in total length and lipid-free biomass, was not significantly different among experimental treatments. Analysis of variance showed that M. relicta stored energy in the form of lipid instead of using the energy mainly to drive increased somatic growth, but only at the colder temperatures. Lipid storage was 24% (± 4.3 sd) in 4 °C-high forage treatment compared to 6% (± 1.1) at 14 °C-high forage treatment. Energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of M. relicta was highest (21.3% ± 5.8) at 4 °C and lowest (3.3% ± 0.9) at 14 °C, regardless of prey density. The experiment showed that Mysis relicta feeds at high food densities where ECE is low, but spends most of the time in colder water where ECE is high. These results support McLaren's metabolic efficiency hypothesis, which predicts that feeding in the more productive surface waters and then migrating to colder waters is reproductively advantageous. Moreover, owing to high metabolic efficiency in the coldest waters and rapid DVM, M. relicta is able to sequester much of the epilimnetic zooplankton production near or on the lake bottom, thereby forcing the lake food web toward a configuration dominated by mysids, benthic or deepwater fishes and small, agile zooplankton.","Ecology; Food webs; Lakes; Mysis relicta; Temperature; Zooplankton","biochemical composition; ecophysiology; growth; lipid; prey availability; temperature effect; Decapoda; Mysis relicta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033208151

Direct observation of the net radiation, sensible and latent heat flux densities above roof-top in the old city district of Mexico City allow the heat storage flux density to be found by residual. The most important finding is that during daytime, when evaporation is very small (<4% of net radiation), and therefore sensible heat uses dominate (Bowen ratio >8), the uptake of heat by the buildings and substrate is so large (58%) that convective heating of the atmosphere is reduced to a smaller role than expected (38%). The nocturnal release of heat from storage is equal to or larger than the net radiation and sufficient to maintain an upward convective heat flux throughout most nights. It is important to see if this pattern is repeated at other central city, or dry urban sites, or whether it is only found in districts dominated by massive stone structures.

The brain can sense the energy status of the body by using neural afferent signals and metabolic cues such as glucose. A variety of experimental evidences have been put forth to support the postulate that there are 'glucoreceptors', sensitive to blood glucose and glucose utilisation, in the hypothalamus. Gastrointestinal afferents, which carry information about the energy intake, reach the hypothalamic regions and interact with the glucose sensitive mechanisms. Available evidence suggests that obesity and decreased body weight, resulting from lesions of the hypothalamic 'satiety' and 'feeding' centres respectively, are not only due to altered food intake, but also to derangement in glucose homeostasis. The medial preoptic area does the fine tuning of energy balance (regulation of food intake) in response to alterations in the temperature, locomotor activity and sleep wakefulness. Thus the hypothalamus regulates energy balance through its control of energy intake on the one hand, and its expenditure and storage on the other. Neuroendocrine system and autonomic nervous system deal with storage and expenditure of energy.","Autonomic nervous system; Endocrine; Feeding centre; Food intake; Gastro intestinal afferents; Glucoreceptors; Hypothalamus energy balance; Satiety centre","glucoreceptor; glucose; autonomic nervous system; endocrine system; energy balance; food intake; gastrointestinal tract; glucose homeostasis; glucose utilization; hypothalamus; locomotion; nonhuman; review; satiety; sensory nerve conduction; sleep waking cycle; temperature dependence; Animals; Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Glucose; Brain; Brain Stem; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Humans; Hypothalamus; Insulin; Nervous System Physiology; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032868137

NPY mediates its effects through binding to the Y1, Y2 and Y5 G-protein-coupled receptors. Little is known of the role of the Y2 receptor in mediating the different NPY effects. We inactivated the Y2 receptor subtype in mice and found that these mice developed increased body weight, food intake and fat deposition. The null mutant mice showed an attenuated response to leptin administration but a normal response to NPY-induced food intake and intact regulation of re- feeding and body weight after starvation. An absence of the Y2 receptor subtype also affected the basal control of heart rate, but did not influence blood pressure. These findings indicate an inhibitory role for the Y2 receptor subtype in the central regulation of body weight and control of food intake.",,"leptin; neuropeptide y; neuropeptide y2 receptor; animal tissue; article; blood pressure; body weight; controlled study; energy consumption; feeding behavior; female; heart rate; hemostasis; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; refeeding; starvation; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blood Pressure; Body Weight; Feeding Behavior; Female; Heart Rate; Leptin; Mice; Mice, Mutant Strains; Neuropeptide Y; Protein Binding; Proteins; Receptors, Neuropeptide Y",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032861562

According to the literature, the majority of trauma patients are presenting a core temperature of less than 34°C at admission. In contrast to the benefit of hypothermia in elective surgery, clinical experience with hypothermia in trauma patients has identified hypothermia to be one major cause of severe posttraumatic complications. It was hypothesized that this diverse effect of hypothermia is related to depletion of high- energy phosphates like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in trauma patients. To verify this hypothesis, the relation of ATP plasma levels and hypothermia was examined in a clinical study. Methods: Three different groups of patients were under study. The first group (group A, normothermic control group) included patients (n = 15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower limb with a mean operation time of 113 minutes. The second study group (group B, hypothermic control) was composed of patients (n = 15) who were subjected to elective coronary artery bypass operation under hypothermia (31°C for 48 minutes, mean total operation time being 205 minutes). The third study group (group C) included trauma patients (n = 23, mean Injury Severity Score [ISS] of 24.7). At the time of admission, 10 patients presented a core temperature more than or equal to 34°C (group C1, mean ISS, 25.2; mean T(A), 34.5°C), 13 patients presented a T(A) less than 34°C (group C2, mean ISS, 26.0; mean T(A), 32.9°C). In both groups of surgical patients, the ATP plasma level was measured preoperatively, at 2, 4, and 24 hours postoperatively. For trauma patients, this measurement was performed at admission and 24 hours later. Within the same schedule, body core temperature was recorded and the clinical course was documented as well. Results: Elective limb surgery in normothermic patients resulted only in a transient decrease in ATP plasma levels (preoperative, 87.8 μmol/dL; 4 hours postoperative, 52.0 μmol/dL). At 24 hours, the ATP plasma level (62.6 ± 10.0 μmol/dL) has increased toward baseline level. Elective hypothermia in patients subjected to coronary bypass also resulted only in a transient decrease in ATP plasma levels. During the operation period, including hypothermia, the ATP plasma level was comparable (50.4 μmol/dL) to group A and also returned back toward normal values at 24 hours (58.2 μmol/dL). All trauma patients revealed a significant low ATP plasma level at admission compared with both control groups. Looking at subdivided groups the most significant drop in ATP plasma level (28.5 μmol/dL) was noted in patients presenting an initial core temperature less than 34°C and ISS more than 30. Even 24 hours later, the ATP level of this subgroup was significantly diminished, despite a rise up to 44.4 μmol/dL. In contrast, only a moderate drop in ATP plasma concentration (59.2 μmol/dL) was noted in the group of T(A) more than or equal to 34°C and ISS less than 20. This group revealed almost normal values (68.3 μmol/dL) 24 hours after trauma. In addition to hypothermia, the metabolic state, reflected by the plasma lactate levels, significantly influenced the ATP plasma levels, as high lactate levels were paralleled by low ATP levels. Also, the overall outcome was related to injury severity and hypothermia. Conclusion: Hypothermia in elective surgery, established by active cooling, preserves the ATP storage and maintains an aerobic metabolism, which both contribute to the beneficial effect of hypothermia in ischemia/reperfusion in cardiovascular surgery. However, in trauma patients hypothermia is caused by insufficient heat production due to utilization of ATP under anaerobic metabolic conditions. Low ATP plasma levels combined with hypothermia seem to be a predisposition for posttraumatic complications like organ failure.","Energy phosphates; Hypothermia; Trauma","adenosine triphosphate; lactic acid; adult; article; cardiopulmonary bypass; clinical article; disease severity; elective surgery; energy metabolism; human; induced hypothermia; injury; lactate blood level; priority journal; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adolescent; Adult; Body Temperature; Coronary Artery Bypass; Female; Humans; Hypothermia; Hypothermia, Induced; Injury Severity Score; Lactic Acid; Leg; Male; Multiple Organ Failure; Multiple Trauma; Prospective Studies; Resuscitation; Risk Factors; Surgical Procedures, Elective; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032858832

Intrinsic point defect properties used are taken from a parameterized model of point defect dynamics for predicting OSF-ring dynamics. Entropies of formation for boron-point defect species are obtained by fitting the predictions of the model to experimental data for OSF-ring dynamics. The model successfully predicts OSF-ring dynamics for a variety of doping and growth conditions.

Leptin is an adipocyte-derived satiety factor that plays an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, and its synthesis and secretion are markedly increased in obese subjects. To explore the metabolic consequences of an increased amount of leptin on a long-term basis in vivo, we generated transgenic skinny mice with elevated plasma leptin concentrations comparable to those in obese subjects. Overexpression of leptin in the liver has resulted in complete disappearance of white and brown adipose tissue for a long period of time in mice. Transgenic skinny mice exhibit increased glucose metabolism accompanied by the activation of insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle and liver. They also show small-sized livers with a marked decrease in glycogen and lipid storage. The phenotypes are in striking contrast to those of recently reported animal models of lipoatrophic diabetes and patients with lipoatrophic diabetes with reduced amount of leptin. The present study provides evidence that leptin is an adipocyte-derived antidiabetic hormone in vivo and suggests its pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications in diabetes.",,"glycogen; insulin; leptin; lipid; adolescent; animal tissue; article; female; gene overexpression; glucose metabolism; glucose utilization; glycogen metabolism; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; liver; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; skeletal muscle; transgenic mouse; Animals; Body Weight; Female; Glucose; Insulin Resistance; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Liver Glycogen; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Obesity; Protein Biosynthesis; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032848779

They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant, are able to deal with non-linear problems, and once trained can perform prediction at high speed. ANNs have been used in diverse applications and they have shown to be particularly effective in system modelling as well as for system identification. The objective of this work is to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn to predict the performance of a thermosiphon solar domestic water heating system. This performance is measured in terms of the useful energy extracted and of the stored water temperature rise. An ANN has been trained using performance data for four types of systems, all employing the same collector panel under varying weather conditions. In this way the network was trained to accept and handle a number of unusual cases. The data presented as input were, the storage tank heat loss coefficient (U-value), the type of system (open or closed), the storage volume, and a total of fifty-four readings from real experiments of total daily solar radiation, total daily diffuse radiation, ambient air temperature, and the water temperature in storage tank at the beginning of the day. The network output is the useful energy extracted from the system and the water temperature rise. The statistical coefficient of multiple determination (R2-value) obtained for the training data set was equal to 0.9914 and 0.9808 for the two output parameters respectively. Both values are satisfactory because the closer R2-value is to unity the better is the mapping. Unknown data for all four systems were subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of prediction. These include performance data for the systems considered for the training of the network at different weather conditions. Predictions with maximum deviations of 1 MJ and 2.2°C were obtained respectively. Random data were also used both with the performance equations obtained from the experimental measurements and with the artificial neural network to predict the above two parameters. The predicted values thus obtained were very comparable. These results indicate that the proposed method can successfully be used for the estimation of the performance of the particular thermosiphon system at any of the different types of configuration used here.

The monthly average wind speeds for Dhahran range from 4.12 to 6.42 m/s. As a case study, the hybrid system considered in the present analysis consists of two 10 kW Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS), together with a battery storage system and a diesel back-up. The yearly and monthly average energy generated from the above hybrid system have been presented. More importantly, the study explores the impact of variation of battery storage capacity on hybrid power generation. The results exhibit a trade-off between size of the storage capacity and diesel power to be generated to cope with specific annual load distribution [41,500], and for given energy generation from WECS. The energy to be generated from the back-up diesel generator and the number of operational hours of the diesel system to meet a specific annual electrical energy demand have also been presented. The diesel back-up system is operated at times when the power generated from WECS fails to satisfy the load and when the battery storage is depleted. The present study shows that for economic considerations, for optimum use of battery storage and for optimum operation of diesel system, storage capacity equivalent to one to three days of maximum monthly average daily demand needs to be used. It has been found that the diesel energy to be generated without any storage is considerably high; however, use of one day of battery storage reduces diesel energy generation by about 35%; also the number of hours of operation of the diesel system are reduced by about 52%.",,"Cost effectiveness; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Energy conversion; Optimization; Wind energy conversion systems (WECS); Wind/diesel power systems; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032640377

Using a similar approach to that suggested by D.M. Lawler in 1992 and 1995, a model is developed to explore how stream power might vary in the downstream direction, based on the assumption that the longitudinal profile of the river has an exponential form. No particular discharge is necessarily specified, but near-bankfull flows are regarded as significant morphologically and one such discharge is the focus here. Total stream power per unit channel length (Ω = γQs) is predicted to peak at an intermediate location, the position of which depends on the ratio b/β, where b and β are the downstream rates of change of discharge and slope respectively. If b is a relatively conservative quantity, then the form of the longitudinal profile and in particular its degree of concavity will have the major influence on the position of maximum stream power. Specific stream power (ω = Ω/w) is even more sensitive to β and is expected to peak closer to the headwaters, about half way between source and the location of the stream power maximum, although this will depend on how channel width (w) varies with distance from source. The model is tested along three connected streams of different size in the catchment of the River Trent, taking advantage of a relationship between mean annual flood and link magnitude which enables this near-bankfull discharge to be estimated at any point within the network. The model is verified in so far as stream power does attain a mid-basin maximum, but the observed and predicted locations of the maxima do not always correspond, largely because of the distinctive variation in discharge and especially slope along individual pathways. For example, maximum power lies far downstream along the Trent because of the large increase in mid-basin discharge associated with a series of large, closely spaced tributaries. The importance of slope is borne out by the near-headwater locations for specific power maxima, which tend to be further upstream than predicted along all three rivers as a result of the steepness of upper reaches. The variety of geomorphic settings produces deviations from expectation, which has implications for the movement and storage of material in the fluvial system.","Downstream variation; Fluvial system; Stream power","energy; fluvial process; spatial variation; streamflow; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033371304

In weight reducing regimens, the body is energy blind and dietary energy rather than diet composition appears to be the greatest determinant of changes in weight and body composition. However, in overfeeding, both diet composition and excess energy intake are being implicated in obesity. Sixteen healthy adult subjects were overfed, 40% above their maintenance energy requirements, diets high in fat (50%) or carbohydrates (CHO) (60%) for a period of 4 weeks. Eight subjects were assigned to each of the experimental diets. Body weight, body composition, adiposity, serum lipids, insulin and glucose were measured in all subjects before and at the end of the feeding period. An Excess Energy Efficiency Factor (EEEF) was calculated as body energy gain per excess dietary energy. Results showed that adiposity was significantly higher in the high fat as compared to the high CHO fed group. EEEF was higher on the high fat as compared to high CHO diet. HDL-cholesterol was higher in subjects consuming the high fat as compared to those on the high CHO diet. This study shows that under conditions of excess energy intake, a high fat diet is more efficient in increasing adiposity and fat deposition as compared to high carbohydrate diet. The relative efficiency of macronutrients on body composition when fed at maintenance energy requirements remains to be investigated.","Diet composition; Obesity; Overfeeding; Plasma lipids","carbohydrate; cholesterol; fat; glucose; high density lipoprotein; insulin; lipid; adult; article; basal metabolic rate; calculation; caloric intake; cholesterol blood level; energy resource; female; food composition; human; human experiment; lipid blood level; lipid storage; male; obesity; overnutrition; priority journal; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033198363

In Chalcalburnus chalcoides the sperm motility rate, the average path swimming velocity, the motility duration, and the viability of immotile semen were significantly reduced in the presence of inhibitors of respiration (potassium cyanide, 2.4-dinitrophenol, atractyloside). Anaerobic conditions (&lt;1 mg O2/liter) and inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle by malonate and &gt;7.5 mmol/liter succinate had similar effects on the sperm motility parameters and on the viability of immotile spermatozoa. Pyruvate and coenzyme A (an acyl-group carrier during oxidative carboxylation of pyruvate) prolonged the duration of sperm motility and the viability of immotile incubated spermatozoa, and also increased the spermatozoal respiration rate. Glucose levels significantly decreased during motility and during immotile storage and, under anaerobic conditions, the levels of lactate increased indicating that pyruvate derived from glycolysis. The respiration rate and the glycolytic rate significantly increased during motility. Therefore oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and aerobic glycolysis are central energy-supplying pathways for spermatozoa of Chalcalburnus chalcoides. The stimulatory effect of pyruvate and coenzyme A indicated that glycolysis is a rate-controlling pathway. Similar results were obtained for Oncorhynchus mykiss with the only exception that the stimulatory effect of coenzyme A was more significant than the stimulatory effect of pyruvate. When the sperm motility-activating saline solutions were optimized in aspects of energy supply, ionic composition, and osmolality, about 50% of the motile spermatozoa swam progressively (&gt;20 μm/sec) for about 3 min in Chalcalburnus chalcoides and in Oncorhynchus mykiss.

A rapid lipid analysis technique (diagnostic kits for human serum lipids) was used to measure the different lipid components of individual sardine larvae as indicators of their nutritional condition. Size-specific growth trajectories of individual larvae were estimated by the biological intercept method, and the recent daily growth rate of standard length (SL) was calculated from the 3 d outer increment width on the otolith. Relationships between the amount of larval phospholipid (PL; tissue weight indicator) and SL, and the recent daily growth rate of larva (Gr) and SL, could be expressed by the equations PL = 0.459 SL 1.77 and Gr = 0.0809 SL- 0.341, respectively. There was no notable difference in these values between the two survey areas. The relationship between the amount of triglyceride (TG) and SL could be expressed allometrically (TG = 0.013 SL2.63). The relationship between the index of starvation tolerance (TG/PL) and SL could be expressed by the allometric equation TG/PL = 0.0288 SL0.865, suggesting that larger sardine have a higher starvation tolerance than smaller sardine. The TG of the 8 to 9 mm SL size-class larvae in the offshore area was higher than in the main Kuroshio Current. To test whether the TG for each larval sardine in the 8 to 9 mm SL size-class could be correlated with variables (temperature, chlorophyll a and distribution density of the sardine larvae) measured at the sampling stations, correlation analyses were performed. A highly significant negative correlation between TG and distribution density of the sardine larvae was found.

They mediate catecholamine- induced lipolysis and thermogenesis of adipose tissue, which are important for the regulation of energy expenditure and, therefore, body weight. Recently, a Trp64Arg polymorphism of the β3-adrenergic receptor gene was reported to be associated with obesity and obesity-related metabolic complications in some ethnic populations. Leptin, a protein secreted by adipocytes, is proposed as a signal linkage between the central nervous system and peripheral fat storage. It has been shown in rodents that leptin may activate the sympathetic nervous system and, thus, β3-adrenergic receptors in adipose tissue. However, little is known about the relationship between the Trp64Arg polymorphism and plasma leptin in humans. Methods. To determine the effects of the β3-adrenergic receptor gene Trp64Arg mutation on anthropometric measures, metabolic parameters and plasma leptin levels, 188 premenopausal Chinese women (mean age ± standard deviation, 32 ± 10 years) with body mass index (BMI) between 16.1 and 59.8 kg/m2 were investigated. Trp64Arg polymorphism was determined by DNA analysis, body fat mass by bioelectric impedance analysis and plasma leptin by radioimmunoassay. Results. Trp64Arg allele frequency was 15% in this population and there was no homozygous Arg64Arg mutant. When the subjects were divided into three groups based on BMI values (BMI &lt; 22.2, n = 60; 22.2 ≤ BMI ≤ 29.5, n = 63; BMI &gt; 29.5 kg/m2, n = 65), there was no difference in Trp64Arg allele frequency (16% vs 11% vs 18%, p = 0.149). Across the three groups, plasma leptin correlated positively with BMI (r = 0.843, p &lt; 0.0001) and total fat mass (r = 0.824, p &lt; 0.0001). Within each BMI tertile, the waist to hip ratio, fat mass, plasma lipids, glucose and insulin were relatively similar between Trp64Trp homozygotes and Trp64Arg heterozygotes. However, Trp64Arg heterozygotes had higher plasma leptin levels than Trp64Trp homozygotes (35.9 ± 11.0 vs 30.0 ± 12.8 ng/ml, p = 0.0023) in those with BMI above 29.5 kg/m2, a difference which remained after adjustment for body fat mass (p = 0.024). Conclusions. Trp64Arg polymorphism of the β3-adrenergic receptor gene is not associated with obesity in Chinese women. Plasma leptin concentrations correlate well with BMI and total fat mass. For obese Chinese women, the Trp64Arg genotype of the β3-adrenergic receptor gene may contribute to an increased plasma leptin level.","β3-Adrenergic receptor gene polymorphism; Leptin; Obesity","arginine; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; leptin; tryptophan; adrenergic system; adult; allele; article; chinese; controlled study; female; genetic linkage; genetic polymorphism; genotype; human; human cell; human tissue; impedance; major clinical study; obesity; protein expression; radioimmunoassay; receptor gene; Adult; Alleles; Blood Glucose; Female; Humans; Insulin; Leptin; Lipids; Mutation; Obesity; Polymorphism, Genetic; Proteins; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032843048

We developed a new apparatus for preservation combined with simple immersion and continuous coronary perfusion. MethodsThe main characteristics of this apparatus are as follows: (1) hypothermic storage, (2) does not require any energy source, (3) variable perfusion pressure, and (4) portability. The perfusion apparatus is composed of a storage chamber, a cooling chamber, and metal bars from which a perfusate bag is suspended. Adult mongrel dogs were divided into two groups: the coronary perfusion group (CP, n = 6) and the simple immersion group (SI, n = 6). Coronary vascular beds of the dog were washed out with a University of Wisconsin (UW) solution following cardiac arrest obtained using a GIK solution. The hearts were then excised. In the CP group, the heart graft, which was immersed in a 4°C UW solution, was perfused with the same solution at a flow rate of 35 ~ 50 ml/hr. In the SI group, the heart graft was immersed in a 4°C UW solution only. The heart graft was preserved for 12 hours in both groups. β-adenosine triphosphate (β-ATP), phosphocreatine (Pcr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels were measured immediately after excision of the heart, and at 3, 6, and 12 hours after preservation. β-ATP, Pcr, and Pi values were expressed as a percentage of control values, which had been obtained immediately after excision of the heart. Water content of the myocardium was measured prior to and after 12-hour preservation. The preserved graft was then evaluated through orthotopic transplantation.Resultsβ-ATP/Pi levels at 6 and 12 hours after preservation were significantly higher in the CP group than in the SI group (62 ± 5 versus 39 ± 7%, 48 ± 5 versus 22 ± 8%, respectively, p < 0.05). Pcr/Pi levels at 6 and 12 hours after preservation were 30 ± 9% and 22 ± 8%, respectively in the CP group, while Pcr/Pi levels in the SI group were detected in only one case. There was no significant difference in water content either prior to or after 12-hour preservation between the two groups. Histopathologically, irregular expansion and/or contraction of myocardial fibers were more severe in the SI group than in the CP group. The recovery rate of hemodynamic parameters 2 hours after heart transplantation was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the CP group than in the SI group.ConclusionStable and safe long-term canine heart preservation with continuous coronary perfusion associated with immersion is possible using this new apparatus, and may have broad clinical application.

Time span between harvest and energy conversion varied from 1 to 12 months. For a realistic comparison, different supply chains were based on the same initial characteristics (i.e., moisture content 50% wb at harvest)and final fuel specifications at the energy plant (moisture content 20% wb, particle size chips or chunks). Cost calculations were based on the integral cost calculation method and were presented for all process steps. The main conclusion was that the time span between harvest and energy conversion and the size and conversion technology of the energy plant largely influence the design of the supply chain and consequently the supply costs. The fuel supply costs ranged from 17.6 to 26.1 ECU/t DM (where DM stands for oven dry matter) or 0.010 to 0.023 ECU/kWh. The cost reduction which could be achieved by choosing the minimum cost chain design could be as high as 45% or 14.4 ECU/t DM. Generally, the strategy of minimum costs for supply of fuel to an energy plant running all year round on willow was as follows: for farmers who should supply their willow within 6 months after harvest: harvest as chips, forced drying at the farm and transport (if necessary); for farmers who should supply their willow beyond 6 months after harvest: harvest as chunks or stems, natural drying near the willow field, transport (if necessary) and central chipping (if applicable).The main objective of this study was to develop minimum cost supply strategies for willow to energy plants (two plant sizes: 0.5 and 30 MWe, two energy conversion technologies: combustion and gasification).

The ignition of the plasma occurs in a pseudosparklike electrode geometry, which allows for omitting a switch between the storage capacity and the electrode system and for low inductive coupling of the electrically stored energy to the plasma. Thus energies of only a few joules are sufficient to create current pulses in the range of several kiloamperes, which lead to a compression and a heating of the plasmas to electron densities of more than 1017 cm–3 and temperatures of several tens of electron volts, which is necessary for emission in the EUV range. As an example, the emission spectrum of an oxygen plasma in the 11–18–nm range is presented. Transitions of beryllium- and lithium-like oxygen ions can be identified. Current waveform and time-resolved measurements of the EUV emission are discussed. In initial experiments a repetitive operation at nearly 0.2 kHz could be demonstrated.

The two models are the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) and the model developed at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP94). The impacts of including transmission of solar radiation through the canopy in the BATS model are also assessed. The ground heat flux is the energy residual of net radiation minus latent plus sensible heat fluxes at the soil surface (also referred to as the soil heat flux). However, the energy residual above the canopy was used as a surrogate for the ground heat flux by the two models in the PILPS 2c study. The two energy residuals (i.e., above the canopy and at the soil surface) can differ depending on the modeled time step, the order in which the canopy and soil temperatures are computed, and whether canopy heat storage is included or neglected. As expected, reducing the areal coverage of vegetation results in an increased daytime soil heat flux, and increasing LAI leads to decreased soil heat flux and greater above-canopy latent heat flux. Both models show a strong sensitivity to LAI when LAI is small and little sensitivity when LAI is large. Allowing transmission of solar radiation through the canopy in BATS reduces the sensible heat flux above the canopy and enhances all the flux terms at the soil surface, especially when LAI is low. This model behavior is similar to that from IAP94, which uses a two-stream radiation scheme. This modification to BATS also results in a soil heat flux that lies within estimated bounds for a wide range of LAI (0.5-5.5).

Because of their insolubility in biological fluids, their transport between cells and tissues requires that they be assembled into lipoprotein particles. Genetic disruption of the lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway leads to several human disorders associated with malnutrition and developmental abnormalities. In contrast, patients displaying inappropriately high rates of lipoprotein production display increased risk for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Insights provided by diverse experimental approaches describe an elegant biological adaptation of basic chemical interactions required to overcome the thermodynamic dilemma of producing a stable emulsion vehicle for the transport and tissue targeting of triglycerides. The mammalian lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway shows an absolute requirement for: (1) the unique amphipathic protein: apolipoprotein B, in a form that is sufficiently large to assemble a lipoprotein particle containing a neutral lipid core; and, (2) a lipid transfer protein (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein-MTP). In the endoplasmic reticulum apolipoprotein B has two distinct metabolic fates: (1) entrance into the lipoprotein assembly pathway within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum; or, (2) degradation in the cytoplasm by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome. The destiny of apolipoprotein B is determined by the relative availability of individual lipids and level of expression of MTP. The dynamically varied expression of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase indirectly influences the rate of lipid biosynthesis and the assembly and secretion lipoprotein particles by the liver.

The off-gas stream, containing primarily CO2, which is produced during hydrogen purification is used to displace methane from unmineable coalbeds. This methane is then utilized within the gasification-to-hydrogen system. Several processing schemes are being evaluated for maximizing hydrogen production or co-producing hydrogen and electricty. A combination of the following process steps are being used in these analyses: coal gasification, gas clean-up, shift conversion, hydrogen purification, hydrocarbon reforming, power generation, and hydrogen storage and transportation. The lowest cost storage and delivery method will be determined based on several factors including production rate, transport distance, and end use.

We aimed to investigate whether the hormones modulating adipose tissue metabolism could be implicated. SUBJECTS: We investigated twenty-eight HIV-infected patients who had developed abdominal fat, combined with peripheral lipodystrophy in 25 cases and 'buffalo hump' in 2 cases, but who had otherwise improved on antiretroviral therapies. Twelve patients with no change in body fat, matched for age, disease control and treatment, were studied as controls. MEASUREMENTS: Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) compartments of total abdominal adipose tissue (TAT) were measured by computed tomography. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was assessed by indirect calorimetry. Endocrine investigations included plasma thyroid hormones, cortisol, testosterone, oestradiol and 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) and catecholamines. RESULTS: Despite similar body mass index, the patients with body fat alterations showed significantly larger VAT and higher VAT:TAT ratio than controls (P=0.002 and 0.0001, respectively). In these patients, RMR was significantly higher than estimated according to the Harris-Benedict formula (+ 19.7 ± 11.6%, P=0.0001) and correlated with VAT (r=0.58, P=0.003) and 24-hour urinary output of catecholamines (r=0.67, P=0.002), that was significantly increased in comparison with controls (1737±1228 vs 476±292 nmol, P=0.013). We also found a significant correlation between VAT and UFC (r=0.41, P=0.042) that was absent in controls, although levels of UFC were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that body fat redistribution may involve cortisol and catecholamine actions. While high release of catecholamines may enhance RMR through increased lipolysis, cortisol may promote central fat storage. These effects might be related both to persistent hormonal responses to stress becoming inappropriate while disease control improved and to an increased sensitivity of visceral adipose tissue to cortisol in affected patients.",,"catecholamine; estradiol; hydrocortisone; testosterone; triacylglycerol lipase; adipose tissue; article; body fat; body mass; calorimetry; catecholamine blood level; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; disease control; estradiol blood level; human; human immunodeficiency virus infection; hydrocortisone blood level; hypertriglyceridemia; impedance; lipodystrophy; lipolysis; priority journal; testosterone blood level; thyroid hormone blood level; urine volume; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Body Constitution; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Catecholamines; Electric Impedance; Energy Metabolism; HIV Infections; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032798685

It is the major energy source for many cells, which depend on the bloodstream for a steady supply. Blood glucose levels, therefore, are carefully maintained. The liver plays a central role in this process by balancing the uptake and storage of glucose via glycogenesis and the release of glucose via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The several substrate cycles in the major metabolic pathways of the liver play key roles in the regulation of glucose production. In this review, we focus on the short- and long-term regulation glucose-6-phosphatase and its substrate cycle counterpart, glucokinase. The substrate cycle enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the terminal step in both the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways and is opposed by the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase. In addition, we include the regulation of GLUT 2, which facilitates the final step in the transport of glucose out of the liver and into the bloodstream.","Gene expression; Glucokinase; Glucose-6-phosphatase; Glucose-6-phosphate; Glut 2","glucose 6 phosphatase; gene expression; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose transport; glycogenolysis; human; liver metabolism; priority journal; review; Animals; Blood Glucose; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucokinase; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Glucose Transporter Type 2; Glucose-6-Phosphatase; Glycogen; Homeostasis; Humans; Liver; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032797852

Both food hoarding and food intake have been examined in rodents using several energetic challenges including food deprivation, treatment with metabolic fuel blockers, and enhancement of fuel storage. In the present experiment, we examined food hoarding by female jirds (Meriones shawi), a desert rodent species occupying the arid steppes and desert regions of Egypt. Jirds are prodigious hoarders in the field; however, virtually nothing is known about their hoarding within controlled laboratory settings. In the present study, the effects of food deprivation as well as alterations in metabolic fuel utilization (i.e., 2-deoxy-D-glucose and isophane insulin) on food hoarding and food intake were tested in female jirds using a simulated burrow system. Jirds decreased body mass and increased food consumption following either 32 or 56-h food deprivation. Food hoarding, however, was virtually abolished after food deprivation and treatment with 2-DG. In contrast, isophane insulin treatment had no effect on food consumption or hoarding in this species. Taken together, the present results suggest that total body mass (fat), rather than short-term metabolic fuel utilization, regulates both food consumption and hoarding in female jirds. In addition, these results provide a novel set of appetitive responses to these energetic challenges in small mammals.

We used ion beam and sputter profiling techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry and scanning probe techniques to investigate the response of these bi-layers upon annealing up to 300°C in vacuum, air and 10-5 mbar O2. The layered structure remains intact up to 150°C. At 200°C in air and O2, Fe and (some) Ti move towards the Pd surface where they form oxide regions. At higher temperatures thicker oxide regions, presumably along the Pd grains, are formed. These processes are more pronounced for the case of 4 nm Pd. A model is presented to explain the observed phenomena. We conclude that up to 150°C 4 nm of Pd is sufficient to act as a protective layer.

Oxygen carriers based on PFCs are easy to produce, free of biological components, and more rigorously sterilizable than blood. PFCs injected into the body are eliminated by expiration through the lungs. Before reaching the lungs, PFCs accumulate in storage organs such as liver and spleen. In these organs nanoscale PFC droplets reduce their free energy by unifying to microscopic drops, thus indirectly lowering the rate of their expiration. The model of free energy reduction by molecular interface crossing (FERMIC), a novel emulsion breaking mechanism derived from first principles as presented here, leads to a better understanding of the structure formation processes relevant in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) in vivo.",,"dissolved oxygen; fluorocarbon; oxygen; article; expired air; hematology; liver; molecular biology; molecular model; oxygen transport; particle size; plasma; spleen; transport kinetics; Blood Substitutes; Fluorocarbons; Models, Theoretical; Surface Tension; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032818291

Controlled cooling tests using a portable cooling tunnel indicated an important cooling time reduction (reaching 7/8 cooling time) without affecting quality when perforated liners were used instead of solid ones. The use of these vented box liners will result in direct energy savings to packinghouses proportional to the reduction in cooling times. Also, shorter cooling times will allow scheduling operations for the off-peak utility periods. Fruit quality attributes such as fruit firmness, soluble solids, and titratable acidity were not affected by any of the box liner treatments. Kiwifruit weight loss depended on the box liner vented area (V.A.) and storage temperature. After 18 weeks at 0°C kiwifruit packed in the solid (0% V.A.), perforated (0.6% V.A.) and micro-perforated (1.2% V.A.) box liners had water losses of 0.7, 2.4 and 5.2%, respectively. Fruit shrivel was only observed on fruit packaged in the micro-perforated liners when water loss exceeded 4.0% in relation to the harvest fresh weight.

The estimation of their biomasses is thus of importance in order to understand their possible role in soil nutrient processes. For arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi the signature fatty acid 16:1ω5 provides a new and promising tool for the estimation of AM fungal biomass in soil and roots. For ectomycorrhizal fungi 18:2ω6,9 dominates among the fatty acids and can be used as an indicator of mycelial biomass of these fungi in soil in experimental systems. In biomass estimation primarily the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) are suitable. Through the use of specific PLFAs it is possible to study interactions between mycorrhizal mycelia and bacteria in soil as well as between AM fungal mycelia and mycelia of saprophytic and parasitic fungi in soil and in roots. AM fungi, in particular, store a large proportion of their energy as lipids and by using the signature fatty acids it is possible to determine the relation between membrane and storage lipids, which could be an indication of energy storage levels. Various aspects of how the fatty acid signatures can be used for studies related to questions of biomass distribution and nutritional status of mycorrhizal fungi are discussed.

Then we designed and fabricated a small-size superconducting FBC system to demonstrate the FBC concept. It was successfully excited up to near rated current.

A mixture of argon and chlorine plasma was used to etch the platinum electrodes used in this study. Following the etching step the wafers were processed in an oxygen plasma (ashed) to remove the photoresist on the wafer. The effectiveness of various postash-cleaning methods was investigated. Results are presented for wafers that were heated at different temperatures for varying times in different ambients, wafers that were cleaned in aqueous hydrochloric acid of varying concentrations, and wafers that were cleaned in a 40 kHz ultrasonic bath in water, in aqueous hydrochloric acid, and in aqueous ammonium hydroxide. At the conditions studied, it was determined that dissolution of the residues was not the controlling removal mechanism. Rather, a combination of dissolution and physical displacement appeared to control the cleaning process.

ATP resynthesis during reperfusion after liver preservation has been shown to be well correlated with the function of transplanted grafts. Nevertheless, the advantages of a cellular energy charge loading during the preservation period are yet not fully understood. This study evaluates the effects of different nucleotide levels at the end of preservation on metabolic changes and oxidative stress during reperfusion. Methods. Two experimental groups were chosen reflecting different energy charge states after preservation: static cold storage for 10 hr and hypothermic oxygenated oscillating perfusion for 10 hr. In both experimental groups, normothermic ex vivo acellular reperfusion over 40 min was performed. A third group consisted of nonpreserved livers similarly reperfused for 40 min. Superoxide formation was detected by the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c added to the normothermic perfusate. Results. Superoxide formation and lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde were significantly lower during reperfusion after the energy charge loading before reperfusion by the hypothermic oscillating perfusion technique. However, oxygen radical formation, liver cell injury (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] release), and TNFα release were significantly higher in energy charge-depleted groups (nonpreserved and cold stored livers). Conclusions. Hypothermic oscillating oxygenated perfusion led to the elevated energy charge during preservation and led to reduced oxygen radical formation as well as less lipid peroxidation during reperfusion, in contrast to cold stored livers and nonpreserved livers. This suggests a correlation between the energy charge before reperfusion and oxygen radical formation as well as liver injury at reperfusion.",,"adenosine triphosphate; lactate dehydrogenase; malonaldehyde; oxygen radical; superoxide; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell damage; cell energy; cryopreservation; lipid peroxidation; liver injury; liver transplantation; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; rat; reperfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344299166

Sea ice models that parameterize latent heat storage in brine pockets often fail to reduce the energy required for surface ablation in proportion to the internal melting that has already occurred. These models do not conserve energy during the summer melt season. Compared with our energy-conserving model, a nonconserving model underestimates top-surface ablation of multiyear ice by 12-22% and overestimates the equilibrium ice thickness by 50-124 cm. In addition, a nonconserving model is less sensitive to perturbative forcing than our energy-conserving model is: The equilibrium thickness changes 22-44% less owing to surface albedo perturbations and 13-31% less owing to downward longwave radiation perturbations. The smaller differences are associated with a model that has a time-independent, vertically varying salinity profile, and the larger differences are associated with a model that assumes the ice is isosaline with a salinity of 3.2‰. Simulations with a vertically varying salinity profile have low salinity at the top surface compared to isosaline cases, which leads to reduced heat conduction, less internal brine-pocket melting, and more surface ablation.

In this paper we examine the attitudes and perceptions about ecological resources of people living around the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), in South Carolina. Our overall hypothesis is that people who are directly affected by the possible outcomes and consequences of a particular hazard (i.e., those people employed at SRS) will undervalue the risks and overvalue the potential benefits from future land uses that favor continued site activity, compared to people who live near but are not employed at SRS. We interviewed 286 people attending the Aiken Trials horse show on 14 March 1997. There were few gender differences, although men hunted and fished more than women, women ranked three environmental concerns as more severe than did men, and women were more concerned about the effect of SRS on property values. Maintenance of SRS as a National Environmental Research Park ranked first as a future land use; nuclear production ranked second, followed by hunting and hiking. Only residential development ranked very low as a future land use. There were many differences as a function of employment history at SRS: 1) people who work at SRS think that the federal government should spend funds to clean up all nuclear facilities, and they think less money should be spent on other environmental problems than did non-employees, 2) people who work at SRS ranked continued current uses of SRS higher than did people who never worked at SRS, and 3) people who work at SRS are less concerned about the storage of nuclear material or accidents at the site than are people who never worked at the site.","Ecological resources; Gender; Hazardous waste; Land use; Recreation; Risk perception","Environmental assessment; Environmental monitoring; Ecology; Hazardous materials; Health hazards; Health risks; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Social aspects; Land use; attitudinal survey; ecology; hazard assessment; perception; public attitude; adult; article; attitude; environmental monitoring; female; hazardous waste; human; interview; land use; male; normal human; nuclear industry; public opinion; recreation; sex difference; United States; United States; Animalia; Equus caballus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033030165

The architecture is an alternative to existing designs with raw data pipelines as are commonly used in particle physics applications. The chip receives 128 digital input signals from an analog front end chip at a rate of up to 80 MHz. The hit pattern is sparsified in real time and only the addresses and interaction times of hits are stored temporarily in FIFOs. Multiple hits per event are possible.

It is applicable to microtomographic studies of complex samples, and medical imaging. As an alternative, or complement to the elegant KES and DPA-based imaging techniques, it offers the advantages of broad frequency band acceptance, the decoupling of primary and secondary X-ray energies, thereby reducing the absorption of the former by the human body; and avoids the need for monochromatization. These factors contribute to reducing the primary photon intensity required for the same image quality. Also, with this method sharp image quality is compatible with locally quantitative measurements, and (depending on the detector) with a pixel by pixel elemental analysis. Drawbacks are: the beam is to be rastered through the sample along both x and y, the detector area has to be large, timing of secondary photons has to be recorded, and primary photon reflectors must operate at grazing incidence angles. As an example human angiography is considered. It is found that both the APS and PETRA II machines can produce significantly more photons than is required for high-quality medical imaging.",,"Angiography; Medical imaging; Photons; Storage rings; Wigglers; X ray imaging; X rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032671237

It does not feed from the onset of wintering (September-October) in Vestfjorden, northern Norway (68°N), until spawning is completed (March-April). In mid-January it migrates towards spawning grounds within a range of approximately 1500 km along the coast (58°-70°N). The relative weekly energy loss is 3-4 times higher during the spawning migration than during the wintering, and it increases with decreasing fish length. Survival of progeny may increase southwards due to beneficial environmental conditions. It is widely accepted that herring return to spawn at the same spawning grounds year after year (homing). However, this study demonstrated that Norwegian spring spawning herring may deviate from this general homing tendency, due to a trade-off between survival of progeny and physiological migration constraints related to fish length and condition (energy storage). During the spawning seasons in 1995 and 1996 the mature herring were mainly distributed between Sogn and Lofoten (61°-70°N), with the shelf area off Mme (62°-64°N) being most important. Both the fish length, condition and stage of maturity increased southwards, but the condition appeared to be the most important variable influencing the distance migrated and spawning time. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Body length; Condition; Distribution; Herring; Maturation; Spawning","Animalia; Clupea harengus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033538413

Here we describe evidence that brain glycogen contributes to aerobic energy metabolism of the guinea pig brain in vivo. Five min after an intra-arterial bolus injection of D-[U-14C]glucose, 28±11% of the radioactivity in brain tissue was associated with the glycogen fraction, indicating that a significant proportion of labelled glucose taken up by the brain is converted to glycogen shortly after bolus infusion. Incorporation of 13C-label into lactate generated by brains made ischaemic after D-[1-13C]glucose injection confirms that these glucose equivalents can be mobilised for anaerobic glucose metabolism. Aerobic metabolism was monitored by following the time course of 13C-incorporation into glutamate in guinea pig cortex and cerebellum in vivo. After an intra-arterial bolus injection of D-[1-13C]glucose, glutamate labelling reached a maximum 40-60 min after injection, suggesting that a slowly metabolised pool of labelled glucose equivalents was present. As the concentration of 13C-labelled glucose in blood was shown to decrease below detectable levels within 5 min of bolus injection, this late phase of glutamate labelling must occur with mobilisation of a brain storage pool of labelled glucose equivalents. We interpret this as evidence that glucose equivalents in glycogen may contribute to energy metabolism in the aerobic guinea pig brain.

One strategy to avoid early maturity may be to favor muscle growth over fat accumulation. The present article discusses the regulation of food intake and fat storage under conditions of either relative over-abundance or insufficiency of energy intake in salmon. In a series of experiments with chinook salmon of equal size, food intake of fat fish was significantly less than in their lean counterparts. Furthermore, when fat and lean fish were pooled and given access to the same diet, whole body fat levels converged, suggesting a robust mechanism for regulating body fat stores. Growth of the initially fat fish was impaired relative to the initially lean fish. In separate experiments, when chinook and coho salmon were deprived of food, hypothalamic expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like mRNA increased significantly compared to fed controls.

We examined nine species of algae from New Zealand. Five of these species were dietary (i.e. species eaten by herbivorous fish); three chlorophytes Enteromorpha sp., Ulva rigida, and Caulerpa geminata, and two rhodophytes Champia novae-zelandiae, and Gigartina livida. The other four species were nondietary, one chlorophyte Caulerpa flexilis, and three rhodophytes, Osmundaria colensoi, Plocamium costatum, and Asparagopsis armata. This study consisted of three main parts. First, we measured the ash, protein, lipid and starch content of the algae. Second, we examined the susceptibility of the algal starch to hydrolysis by digestive enzymes from four species of New Zealand marine fish. Samples of the dried, ground algae were digested with an extract of digestive enzymes from the herbivores Parma alboscapularis, Aplodactylus arctidens and Aplodactylus etheridgii, and the omnivore Girella tricuspidata. Third, we determined the ability of the enzyme extracts from the fish to hydrolyse the starch components amylose, amylopectin, and maltose. The ash, protein, lipid and starch content varied significantly among the algal species. The rate of starch hydrolysis from all four enzyme extracts also varied significantly among the algal species. Enzyme extracts from all fish species hydrolysed amylose more readily than amylopectin, and maltase activity was found in all enzyme extracts. There was no significant separation between dietary and nondietary algae on the basis of ash, lipid, or starch content, or rate of starch digestion. There was significant separation between dietary and nondietary algae on the basis of two variables: (1) protein content, which was highest in nondietary algae, and (2) when both starch content and the rate of starch digestion (glucose produced g-1 algae h-1) were taken into account, dietary algae was significantly higher than nondietary algae. We draw two main conclusions from this study. First, both starch content and starch digestibility may play a role in structuring the diet choices of marine herbivorous fishes. Second, measurements of either total soluble carbohydrates, or total storage polysaccharides will not reflect assimilable energy in algivorous fish. Estimation of assimilable energy requires an examination of the nutritional components of the algae in relation to the digestive physiology of the herbivore.","Algae; Assimilable energy; Digestion; Herbivorous fish; Starch","alpha glucosidase; amylopectin; amylose; enzyme; maltose; starch; carbohydrate; diet; fish; alga; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; chemical composition; controlled study; digestion; enzyme activity; fish; food preference; hydrolysis; nonhuman; species difference; New Zealand; Asparagopsis armata; Caulerpa flexilis; Caulerpa geminata; Champia novae-zelandiae; Enteromorpha; Gigartina livida; Osmundaria colensoi; Plocamium costatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033166785

This article describes the merits of 103Pd, a low energy x-ray emitter, as a new and potentially superior candidate for intraluminal brachytherapy.103Pd can be ion implanted into different materials, designs, and devices for vascular brachytherapy. Methods. The mass-analyzed ion implantation process has been used to embed the desired activity of 103Pd into the surface of 316L stainless steel stents. The low-energy, 21-keV x-ray from 103Pd delivers reasonably homogeneous radiation to the vessel wall and loses intensity rapidly beyond the immediate vicinity of the source. Shielding for 103Pd x-rays is trivial and the issues regarding safety, health hazards, storage, and handling are easily manageable. Results. Experimental data on 103Pd ion-implanted stents show a clean gamma-ray spectrum devoid of any radioimpurity. Activity measurements within a batch demonstrate little stent-to-stent variation (~2%), excellent axial and radial uniformity (&lt;10%), and minimal dissolution in a saline environment (~0.02%). The dosimetry shows the focused radiation field for 103Pd stents and rapid fall-off beyond a few millimeters of the stent. Furthermore, the 103Pd dosimetry indicates that a 350 μCi stent will deliver approximately 14 Gy at 1-mm distance, over its lifetime. Conclusion. 103Pd is an appropriate source for vascular brachytherapy. It has an appropriate combination of half-life (16.93 days) and energy (21 keV). The half-life of 103Pd delivers the dose with an acceptable dose rate for stent applications while, at the same time, allowing for manageable shipping, storage, and/or disposal. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.","103Pd; 103Pd dosimetry; Ion implantation; Radioactive stents; Stent uniformity; Vascular brachytherapy","palladium; radioisotope; animal; article; beta radiation; brachytherapy; comparative study; gamma radiation; human; instrumentation; isolation and purification; methodology; radiation dose; radiology; stent; Animals; Beta Rays; Brachytherapy; Gamma Rays; Humans; Palladium; Radioisotopes; Radiotherapy Dosage; Stents; Technology, Radiologic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033157132

A comparison of indicator tabulation and evaluation methods finds that reporting an indicator as a fraction of its stress threshold is most effective. Indicator display methods are compared, and the star diagram proves most effective as a visual aggregation technique. Indicators and evaluation methods are applied to the present climate and to one possible climate change scenario assuming economic growth. It is apparent that the primary impacts of global warming occur in the western U.S. and include (1) fewer relative stresses on hydroelectric systems due to an increase in energy supply from other sources, and (2) more stresses on available water resources due to increases in total withdrawals and, in some cases, decreases in flows.

We studied fat storage in a population of greenish leaf warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides) in southern India over four winters (1993-97). This species breeds in temperate regions and overwinters in India from October to April. 2. Diurnal variation in fat scores was comparable to that seen among temperate wintering passerines. Seasonal variation was slight, except for premigratory fattening. There was significant annual variation: in drier winters, which were also winters of low food supplies, fat scores were higher. 3. Energy metabolized overnight is unlikely to vary across winters, and annual variation in fat scores is considered a response to uncertainty of food intake on a given day. Fat scores varied inversely with short-term rainfall, which drives the abundance of arthropod prey. 4. Annual variation in fat scores was not accompanied by changes in total body mass. This suggests that protein reserves were being compromised by increased fat deposition in dry years and offers an explanation for the observed delay in moult during drier winters. These results suggest that strategies for maximizing short-term probability of survival translate into future fitness costs, and may shape long-term life-history strategies through simple physiological processes.","Diurnal variation; Energy reserves; Phylloscopus; Timing of moult; Winter survival strategies","fat reserve; overwintering; passerine; temporal variation; India; Phylloscopus trochiloides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032815170

Force-distance relationships of the sound-producing in-out cycle of tymbal movement were measured. The largest forces were measured when the push occurred at the apodeme pit on the tymbal plate at angles similar to the angles of internal pull of the tymbal muscle. Initially, inward movement was opposed by the elasticity of the tymbal, which stored energy. At a mean force of 0.38 N after a mean inward strain of 368 μm, the tymbal ribs buckled, the mean energy release being 45.1 μJ. The energy release occurred over 2-10 ms in three or four sound-producing steps as successive tymbal ribs buckled inwards. After the ribs had buckled, the force decreased to a mean value of 0.17 N. The force returned to zero during the outward movement, during which the tymbal ribs buckled outwards. The mean energy dissipated in the outward movement was 32.8 μJ. During contraction, the tymbal muscle produced mean values for the peak active force of 0.31 N over 295 μm, which gave mean values for the area of the work loops of 47.0 μJ.

The environmental impacts of a specific intensive US feedlot system and a traditional African pastoral system are calculated using a methodology that includes the major land-use and energy-related emissions. Although assessments of carbon dioxide emissions find much greater impacts related to the US feedlot mode, the methane intensity of the pastoral mode is much larger because of the lower productivity of these systems. It is found that when indirect sources, which include emissions from fossil fuels and foregone carbon storage on appropriated land, are considered as well as emissions from enteric fermentation and wastes, the social costs of the feedlot system at 15 kg CO2 equivalent/kg beef are more than double that of the pastoralist system. Accordingly, the results of the more complete greenhouse gas emissions analysis were found to converge somewhat with the biophysical capital alteration approach in this example, although it is also argued that the entropy-based environmental indicators may have limited use in evaluating agro-ecosystems' contribution to climate change. Given an assumed, albeit uncertain, climate change impact value, a tax on beef production of about 9% of the unit price would represent the upper limit of the shadow costs of the associated greenhouse gas emissions flux from feedlot systems as estimated here, and a central value would correspond to a tax of about 4%.","Agricultural emissions; Climate change costs; Environmental indicators; Livestock assessments; Methane","africa; beef; carbon dioxide; environmental economics; environmental fate; environmental impact assessment; fermentation; food production; fuel; gas emission; methane; United States; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; land use; livestock farming; Africa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032770442

With regard to its rotary mechanics, this energy transducing molecular machine assumes a unique position among all enzymes. In the work presented here we put forward a detailed functional model which is based on experimental results obtained with ATP synthase from spinach chloroplasts. We focus on the role of the elastic element, realized by the stalk-like subunit γ, whose function is energy transduction between F0 and F1 taking into account the H+/ATP coupling ratio of four. Fitting parameters are the rate constants and the torsional rigidity of γ, which have been adjusted according to the experimental results where the influence of transmembrane ΔpH on the rates of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis is put to the test. We show that the input and output of torsional energy are regulated by purely statistical principles, giving rise to the amount of transiently stored energy to be sliding, depending on ΔpH. During conditions of maximal turnover γ turns out to be wound up towards 102°which corresponds to a torque of 5.3·10-20 N·m.

Magnesium-nickel alloys are the most promising lightweight materials which offer a favorable volumetric hydrogen storage density. For a vehicular application, a prime consideration is the stability of the hydrogen absorbing/desorbing capacity of the hydride when it is subjected to a large number of absorption/desorption cycles. In order to estimate if magnesium-nickel alloys would be attractive candidates for practical hydrogen storage systems, a new and rapid experimental device was designed for fast continuous evaluation of the cyclic charge and discharge stability of the intermetallic compound Mg2Ni over a relatively large number of cycles. Repetitive hydriding and dehydriding of a metal alloy is simply performed by cycling the sample from the high-pressure circuit used for absorption to the low pressure circuit having enough volume to receive the hydrogen discharge. Simultaneously the sample holder containing the hydride may be alternated from the low temperature furnace for absorption to the high temperature furnace for desorption. The cycling stability of commercial crystalline Mg2Ni alloy was tested at 300°C over up to 2700 cycles. Periodically during the cycling experiments, we have also performed measurements of the dynamic hydrogen absorption/desorption; these were done at the reaction temperatures of 250°C and 300°C, respectively. Moreover, pressure composition isotherms at 300°C measurements were also carried out. The cycling effect was also evaluated via additional experiments involving SEM, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area, specific heat and X-ray crystal structure analysis.",,"Absorption; Crystal structure; Dehydration; Desorption; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Hydration; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Isotherms; Stability; Thermal cycling; Thermodynamic properties; Cyclic charge; Cycling effect; Discharge stability; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Pressure composition isotherms; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032688362

Repetitive hydriding and dehydriding of nanocrystalline Mg2Ni alloy is performed at different cycling temperatures and pressures of absorption and desorption. It was found that the cycling did not affect the kinetic rates of absorption/desorption. X-ray crystal structure analysis and pressure concentration isotherms of the alloy, after initial activation and after 2100 cycles, reveal significant changes in the dynamic phase structure and the thermodynamic properties. In addition to these experiments, we have also performed scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and specific heat characterizations. These have indicated that the changes in volume during the 2100 hydriding/dehydriding cycles do not produce severe decrepitation.

This study examined the effect of sepsis on total glucose utilization, oxidation and storage, and the energetic costs of these metabolic processes. Methods: Glucose infusion rate (GIR), glucose oxidation rate (GOR), non-oxidative disposal rate and the energetic cost of glucose storage were studied in 24 patients with abdominal sepsis and in 26 healthy controls, using indirect calorimetry and the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp with insulin infusion rates of 40 and 240 mU m-2 min-1. Results: Basal GOR was significantly lower in septic patients than in controls (1.5 versus 2.3 mg per kg fat-free mass (FFM) per min, P &lt; 0.001). Septic patients had a significantly lower GIR at 40 mU m-2 min-1 (4.2 versus 9.1 mg per kg FFM per min) and at 240 mU m-2 min-1 (7.5 versus 11.8 mg per kg FFM per min), relative to controls (P &lt; 0.001). GOR was similar in septic and control subjects at both rates of insulin infusion whereas non-oxidative disposal was significantly lower in septic patients (P &lt; 0.001) and accounted entirely for the reduction in GIR.

Leptin synthesis is markedly reduced by oleoyl-estrone. However, this effect is not observed in the obese Zucker fa/fa rats; these rats do not fully respond to leptin but they lose fat under oleoyl-estrone treatment. Aim of the study: To determine the role of leptin in the conversion of estrone to fatty-acyl estrone in white adipose tissue both in vivo in Zucker lean and obese rats, and in vitro. Methods: Two series of experiments were performed: a) Growth and differentiation of 3T3L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes followed by incubation with tritium-labeled estrone in the medium in the presence / absence of 1 nM leptin, and estimation of the incorporation of label into estrone and estrone ester fractions of cell extracts, b) Zucker lean (Fa/?) [ZL] and obese (fa/fa) [ZO] rats were injected i.v. with carrier-free oleoyl- estrone in chylomicra-sized liposomes, then euthanized after 10 min. Free and esterified estrone were measured in blood, liver, muscle, skin, white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Results: In the first study, in a 72-h incubation, adipocytes took up 20-27 % of the medium estrone. In the leptin(-) controls, 47 % of the label in the cell fraction was in the form of estrone esters and 45 % as free estrone; in the leptin(+) cells, 71 % of the label was in the estrone ester fraction and 24 % was free estrone. In the second study, a large part of the injected tritium-label remained in the ZO blood, with only a small part remaining in ZL. In ZL 39 % of the label was found in the tissues in the form of free estrone, and in ZO only 22 %; in both cases about half of it was in WAT. Plasma free estrone levels were 0.3±0.1 nM in ZL and 0.5±0.3 nM in ZO, and esterified estrone was 242±99 nM for ZL and 201±29 nM for ZO. Plasma leptin levels were 1.73±0.16 ng/ml in ZL and 61.0±1.4 ng/ml in ZO. Conclusion: The presence of an intact leptin pathway is critical for the uptake and synthesis of estrone esters as well as for the plasma acyl-estrone turnover. The presented results show a direct relationship between oleoyl-estrone and leptin in the WAT. A fully functional leptin pathway is needed for the synthesis of acyl-estrone and the removal of free estrone from the bloodstream, as well as for the disposal of excess circulating oleoyl-estrone. This has a direct bearing on human and animal obesity, since estrone induces increases in fat deposition.","Leptin; Obesity; Oleoyl-estrone; White adipose tissue; Zucker fa/fa rat","estrone; leptin; animal experiment; appetite; article; energy expenditure; estrogen metabolism; hormonal regulation; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; rat; weight reduction; white adipose tissue; 3T3 Cells; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Estrone; Female; Leptin; Liver; Mice; Muscles; Obesity; Oleic Acids; Proteins; Radioimmunoassay; Rats; Rats, Zucker; Reference Values; Scintillation Counting; Skin; Animalia; Tritium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032980584

The IC50 values for inhibiting the generation of the membrane potential were even lower, i.e. 0.19±0.06 μM (n=6) and 0.15±0.01 μM (n=4) for cinnarizine and flunarizine, respectively.

Cinnarizine (10 μM) increased the MgATPase activity of the granule ghosts by 47±26% (n=4) compatible with an uncoupling of the vacuolar H+-ATPase activity. The IC50-values observed for the two compounds are in the same range as their reported therapeutic plasma concentrations in vivo, suggesting that cinnarizine and flunarizine may well inhibit proton pumping and catecholamine uptake in storage vesicles also in vivo.

It is a low storage method, i.e., only four real vectors are required to calculate all bound states of the system. In the MINRES FD step, the finite Krylov subspace is built up by a Lanczos iteration using a spectral transform operator which is expanded in a series of Chebyshev polynomials. A guided spectral transform method is suggested to achieve high efficiency of this new algorithm. As an example, all even parity bound states of NO2 have been calculated on the adiabatic ground state potential energy surface of NO2 by a single propagation using a hyperbolic tangent function guided filter operator. The results show that the method is accurate and highly efficient.

Two classes of heat storage systems are investigated: heat storage systems based on first sensible heat storage and second latent heat storage. Both classes of heat storage systems are evaluated both from a thermodynamic point of view, inquiring whether the irreversibility of the system stays limited or not, and from an economic point of view, examining whether the system makes proper use of the heat storage capacity present. It is shown that an unambiguous conclusion that one is superior to the other is not possible and that the operating conditions and the configuration of the phase-changing materials play an important role.

The correlation between the structure and properties of RuO2·xH2O materials is not well understood due to their amorphous nature and compositional variability. In this study, ruthenium oxides with the compositions RuO2·2.32H2O, RuO2·0.29H2O, and anhydrous RuO2 are characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) analyses. XANES cannot be used to distinguish between Ru(III) and Ru(IV) in the hydrous oxides, but the EXAFS analyses show large differences in the short-range structures of the materials. Whereas anhydrous RuO2 has the rutile structure comprising chains of RuO6 octahedra linked in three dimensions, the structure of RuO2·0.29H2O is rutile-like at the RuO6 core, but less connected and progressively disordered beyond the RuO6 core. The structure of RuO2·2.32H2O is composed of chains of disordered RuO6 octahedra that exhibit no chain-to-chain linking or three-dimensional order. Although the local structures of RuO2· 0.29H2O and RuO2·2.32H2O markedly differ, their specific capacitances are large and essentially equivalent, so nonunique local structures can balance effective electron transport (along dioxo bridges) with the effective proton transport (through structural water) necessary for charge storage. © 1999 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001626338

Mantle muscle tissue growth in cephalopods is a function of both the production of muscle fibres and the growth of existing fibres. After seven days, captive animals had thicker mantles, a greater proportion of mitochondria-rich tissue, muscle fibres with smaller mitochondrial cores and fewer small muscle fibres. This suggests a reduced rate of new fibre generation, indicating an alteration to the cellular growth mechanisms and not simply a change in the physiological rate of growth. Smaller individuals were affected to a greater extent. Such modifications to the actual mechanisms of growth may have the potential to alter the shape of an individual's growth curve and can also affect final body size. Alterations to the proportion and structure of mantle components may impact upon many critical aspects of an individual's biology as the muscular mantle is central to locomotion, ventilation of gills, energy storage and possibly subcutaneous oxygen extraction.","Captivity; Cephalopod; Growth; Mantle; Muscle fibre","oxygen; animal tissue; article; body growth; body size; cell growth; cephalopod; controlled study; gill; growth curve; locomotion; muscle cell; muscle mitochondrion; muscle tissue; nonhuman; priority journal; wildlife; Animalia; Cephalopoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033532574

As a result, several works have been devoted to modeling and predicting the transient response of both sensible and latent heat storage devices, over a variety of geometric forms. Following the current trend, latent heat storage on encapsulated phase change material (PCM) was chosen as the object of the present work. Since the main feature is to take advantage of the high storage capacity offered by the latent heat, this work only deals with situations with small values of the Stefan number (Ste) which allow the solidification to be predicted by a quasi-stationary model. To obtain more general results, all the physical variables are arranged in non-dimensional groups, the influence of which on the response of the storage unit is evaluated in order to provide guidelines to the design and operation of those devices. Several assumptions are made with a view to maintain the model as simple as possible, without disregarding a careful reflection about its accuracy and impact on the reliability of the solution. The transient behavior of the storage unit is described by the evolution of the outlet temperature, as well as the thermal resistance ratio (TRR) through the discharge process. To ratify the model, some comparisons with previously published works are provided, showing not only qualitative but quantitative concurrency as well.",,"Diffusion; Heat resistance; Mathematical models; Numerical analysis; Phase transitions; Temperature; Tubes (components); Encapsulated phase change materials; Latent heat; Stefan number; Thermal resistance ratio; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343526741

Alkylphenothiazines (PC(n) where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16) were synthesized and used to study the effects of the alkyl chain length. Phenothiazine and N-alkylphenothiazines were incorporated into ZrP by impregnation and ion-exchange methods. By both methods N-alkylphenothiazines are only incorporated onto the external surface of zirconium phosphate rather than into the interlayer space. The alkylphenothiazines photooxidize at room temperature to form stable alkylphenothiazine cation radicals (PC(n)+) which are measured by ESR and diffuse reflectance. The framework of ZrP is suggested to be the electron acceptor. Both the photoyield and the decay rate of the alkylphenothiazine cation radical depend on the alkyl chain length. As the alkyl chain length of the PC(n)+ cation radical increases from methyl to hexyl, the photooxidation yield increases; and as the alkyl chain length increases further from hexyl to hexadecyl, the photooxidation yield decreases. However, the decay rate of the PC(n)+ cation radical gradually increases from methyl to hexadecyl which is explained in terms of a greater inductive effect for longer alkyl chains on the PC(n)+ cation radicals. Also, the resolution of the ESR spectrum decreases with increasing alkyl chain length which is interpreted as being due to decreasing mobility of the radical which should also decrease the decay rate. Both impregnation and ion-exchange methods are reasonably effective for incorporating alkylphenothiazine molecules into ZrP for efficient photooxidation. The photoyields of N-alkylphenothiazines in ZrP are larger than in silica gel which suggests that ZrP assemblies can be utilized for solar energy conversion and storage.",,"phenothiazine derivative; zirconium; article; chemical reaction; electron spin resonance; environmental temperature; ion exchange; photodegradation; photooxidation; temperature sensitivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033152983

The rate of adenosine transport was not decreased after long-term cold storage of the liver. Inhibition of one of the transport systems decreased the rate of adenosine uptake before and after preservation of the liver to about the same extent. The adenosine transport rate was maintained during long-term (100 min) liver perfusion ex vivo. Slight activation of energy-dependent transport in the beginning of reperfusion and the slower recovery of this transport after the second transition from Na+-free to Na+-containing perfusion are not regarded as physiologically important because they were observed after changing the ionic content of the extracellular medium.

Quality parameters of the microwave-treated 'Bing' cherries were compared with control fruit and those subjected to methyl bromide fumigation. When heating cherries to average pit temperatures of 45, 50 and 55°C, the cherry pits heated faster than the surface, and larger cherries heated more quickly than smaller ones. Cherry temperature increased linearly with time with heating rates dependent on the microwave power, sample weight, cherry size and radial location inside the cherry. With a 2 min holding and 5 min hydrocooling protocol after microwave treatments, adjusted percentage 3rd instar codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) mortality ranged from 5 to 62% and 39 to 98% without and with 1-2 days cold storage, respectively. A higher mortality rate was obtained for insects in 'Bing' than 'Rainier' fruit. Firmness, percentage soluble solids content, titratable acidity, fruit weight, and objective fruit colour of microwave-treated 'Bing' fruit were comparable with these properties of control fruit and to those of cherries fumigated with methyl bromide. Stem greenness colour was reduced after the microwave and dry hot air combined treatments. Microwave energy may provide an alternative non-chemical quarantine treatment against codling moth in export cherries, but further study is needed to optimize the treatment protocol for insect control and fruit quality.","Cherries; Codling moth; Heat treatment; Microwave; Quality; Quarantine","Cydia pomonella; Prunus avium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033058199

Stress generally resulted in elevated plasma cortisol, above the control. Fish responded to stress and exercise combined, with elevated lactate and [H+] which was sometimes associated with elevated plasma cortisol. These changes were combined with a depletion of the muscle adenylate pool. Post-mortem, this resulted in an increase in the rate of onset of rigor, and a higher and sometimes sustained muscle proton load. Both species produced predominantly inosine as opposed to hypoxanthine, for up to 72 h of ice storage. This study shows that the physiological disruption in Atlantic Salmon and rainbow trout caused by simulated harvest conditions of stress and exercise, results in mostly transient changes in post-mortem muscle biochemistry. These changes lead to an earlier onset and resolution of rigor, and lower post-mortem muscle pH in comparison to the control.","Cortisol; High-energy phosphates (HEP); Post-mortem; Rigor; Salmon; Stress; Trout","exercise; hydrocortisone blood level; lactic acid; salmon; stress tolerance; water flow; Oncorhynchus mykiss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033058017

Individuals in two size groups were starved at two winter temperatures (4°and 8°C) and sacrificed at a range of time intervals (up to 127 days). Lipid levels and lean tissue were analyzed to estimate somatic energy storage. As predicted, energy depletion was greater at high temperatures, and proportionally greater in small than in large fish. After 60 days of starvation at 4°C, small fish retained an average of 67% of their original energy reserves (vs 53% at 8°C), while large fish retained an average of 80% (vs 66% at 8°C). At 4°C, fish that were fed depleted their energy reserves as rapidly as unfed fish, but at 8°C, fish that were fed maintained reserves at higher levels than unfed fish. A high proportion of unfed fish (56% at 4°C, 27% at 8°C) died before they were to be sacrificed. Survival probability did not vary with size, nor was it influenced by the amount of energy reserves. The rate of energy depletion (equivalent to routine metabolic rate) decreased gradually over time, particularly in small fish. Routine metabolism did not conform to a single scaling relationship. Within each temperature-size group, the routine rate declined more rapidly than metabolically active mass (lean mass). At 8°C, the difference between size groups in energy depletion rate conformed closely to the expected allometry exponent of 0.8. In contrast, at 4°C, the estimated allometry exponent increased over the experiment (-0.19 to 2.5). We conclude that strategies to minimize energy loss may often modify bioenergetic scaling relationships.","Atherinidae; Lipids; Metabolism Selection; Starvation","Menidia menidia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033037249

Freeze-thaw conditions are not well defined yet; the most critical parameters appear to be the choice of the cryoprotectant, composition of the freezing medium, and cooling and thawing rates. Comparable results have been obtained with hepatocytes from various species, including man. Cryopreservation usually results in low cell recovery and early alterations of functional activities. However, both phase I and phase II xenobiotic metabolism is still active after thawing, at least during a short period. Moreover, survival and function of cryopreserved hepatocytes can be improved when these cells have a high energy status, are cryopreserved after immobilization in a gel, separated from dead cells on a Percoll gradient or placed in more favorable culture conditions (e.g. in coculture with liver non parenchymal cells). Additional studies are needed to improve freeze-thaw protocols and to better characterize liver parenchymal cells after storage, including evaluation of their responsiveness to specific inducers.

Methods: Isolated isovolumic rat hearts were arrested with each cardioplegic solution (n = 5) to 8 hearts in each group), submitted to 12 hours of cold storage (4°C) in the same solution and then reperfused for 60 minutes at 37°C. Function was measured during control and reflow. High energy phosphates and intracellular pH were monitored by P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Analyses were performed by biochemical assays and HPLC in coronary effluents (CK, Pi, lactate, purines) and in freeze-clamped hearts (amino acids, nucleotides, CK, LDH) at the end of reperfusion. Results: Functional recovery was significantly improved with the new cardioplegic solution (50 ± 12% recovery for the rate pressure product at the end of reflow vs 8 ± 3% with UW, 0% with B and with ST). This result was correlated with the best metabolic and cellular protection as assessed in particular by higher PCr levels during reflow (30 ± 3% vs 10 ± 3% with UW, 8 ± 4% with B, and 7 ± 1% with ST) as well as reduced creatine kinase leakage during reflow (110 ± 15 IU/60 minute vs 270 ± 57 IU/60 minute with UW, 323 ± 36 IU/60 minute with Broussais solution and 237 ± 18 IU/60 minute with ST).

Flash) was sown in acid-washed vermiculite in a controlled growth chamber. After 1 month of growth, one half of the chicory plants were defoliated whereas the intact chicory plants remained as a control. Twenty-four hours after defoliation, a very sharp decrease in hexose, sucrose, and total fructan concentration was observed in the roots. This coincided with a strong decrease in sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyl transferase (1SST; EC 2.4.1.99) activity and a strong increase in fructan 1-exohydrolase (1-FEH; EC 3.2.1.80) activity. After day 5, 1-SST activity increased and 1-FEH activity decreased. How- ever, from day 5 to 15, both the activities of 1-SST and acid invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) remained significantly lower than in the control plants. From 10 days after defoliation, fructan synthesis resumed and hexose and sucrose concentrations increased. Up to now, 1-FEH activity was believed to occur only in mature tissues (end of the growing season, storage, forcing, or sprouting). Therefore, the rather unexpected finding that 1-FEH can also be induced in very young chicory roots after defoliation suggests that 1-FEH can be considered a 'survival' enzyme that can be induced at any physiological stage when energy demands increase.",,"defoliation; enzyme activity; fructan 1 exohydrolase; fructan; metabolism; sucrose 1 fructosyl transferase; sucrose; Cichorium intybus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032840093

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of two liquid formulas with different macronutrient composition, a high carbohydrate (HC) meal as compared to a high fat (HF) meal, on substrate oxidation and on thermic effect of food (TEF). Eighteen lean and healthy women which were fed a HC diet during the 3 preceding d were studied for a further 4 h after meal intake. The test meals provided fixed energy intake and whose calculated FQ were 0.77 for HF meal, and 0.96 for HC meal. The mean NPRQs were higher (P<0.01) in the HC group than in the HF group, even with values greater than 1.00 indicating net lipid synthesis (NL), and which correlated with metabolic rate (MR) value (P<0.05), glucose (P<0.05), and heart rate (HR) values. Carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation was higher with the HC than with HF meal (P<0.01) and correlated with the MR (P<0.05). Protein oxidation rate rose above baseline (P<0.01); this increase was accompanied by with a negative CHO balance. It is concluded that the change in fuel selection and the increase of TEF is mainly due to CHO intake and metabolism, respectively, and that surplus of dietary CHO of preceding days together with a large load of CHO can exceed the glycogen storage capacity and trigger NL.","Diet composition; Energy balance; Net lipid synthesis; Nutrient oxidation; Respiratory quotient; Sympathetic nervous system; Thermic effect of food","carbohydrate; fat; lipid; adrenergic system; adult; article; carbohydrate intake; controlled study; energy balance; fat intake; female; food composition; heat treatment; human; human experiment; lipogenesis; metabolic rate; normal human; oxidation; Adult; Basal Metabolism; Blood Glucose; Body Temperature Regulation; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Female; Food, Formulated; Heart Rate; Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Postprandial Period; Reference Values; Eragrostis tef",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032781347

ALSM, also referred to as Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), can be performed using a light twin or single engine aircraft. Flying at speeds of 200 to 250 kilometers per hour, at altitudes of 500 to 2,000 meters, with scan angles of ±(10 to 20) degrees, and at laser repetition rates of 2,000 to 25,000 pulses per second, it is possible to blanket the surface of the Earth with accurate elevations every 2 to 3 meters. Swaths exceeding one kilometer in width and hundreds of kilometers in length can be mapped in just a few hours to produce accurate Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) economically and with turn-around times never before possible. Operating costs, exclusive of the 1.2 million purchase of the instrumentation, can be as low as a few dollars per kilometer of single swath coverage, and preliminary DTMs can be produced within hours of collecting the data.

High winds, which are stochastic and turbulent by nature, create a quasi-permanent transitory environment for the WECS, putting the system in a seemingly non-equilibrated state. For instance, the generator current at the system output, besides being dependent upon the current excitation signal at the system input, will also greatly be dependent upon the past history of the system. The feedback in the RNN allows past responses to be fed back to the network input. In this model, the WECS parameters need not be known. After proper training, the known and unknown dynamics of the WECS are captured by the network structure and stored in the connection weights between consecutive layers. For that reason, the neural modeling allows us to circumvent two majors problems faced by conventional linear mathematical modeling of system dynamics: parameter uncertainty and system non-linearity, which could be significant in a difficult dynamic environment as in high winds. Moreover, neural modeling is universal, and involves less computational effort. The viability of the battery supported system as dispatchable unit is also discussed. The simulated values are compared with actual values; excellent results have been achieved.",,"Backpropagation; Computer simulation; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Mathematical models; Nonlinear systems; Recurrent neural networks; Wind power; Grid-linked wind energy conversion; Energy conversion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032632470

The Al2O3.TiB2/Al-Cu composite exhibited an apparent stress exponent of 11.8-12.6 and 22.2-23.3 and an apparent activation energy of 337 and 421 kJ/mol for static and cyclic creep, respectively. The values of apparent stress exponent and activation energy for cyclic creep of the Al2O3.TiB2/Al-Cu composite were much higher than those obtained from the static creep measurements. Cyclic creep retardation (CCR) behavior was observed in the Al2O3.TiB2/Al-Cu composite. Furthermore, the steady state creep rate for cyclic creep tended to decrease with increasing the loading frequency and percentage of unloading amount. The CCR behavior is explained in terms of the storage of anelastic strain delaying nonrecoverable creep during the on-load cycles. Finally, the creep rupture behavior of the Al2O3.TiB2/Al-Cu composite is best described by Monkman-Grant and Dobes-Milicka empirical equations. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.","Al-Cu alloy; Cyclic creep test; Static creep test","Activation energy; Alumina; Binary alloys; Creep testing; Cyclic loads; Particles (particulate matter); Strain; Stress analysis; Titanium compounds; Particle reinforced composite; Titanium diboride; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007605647

It has been developed as a part of a European Community Program INTERREG II∗ and is consisting of three main parts: excitation, detection and control units. The excitation light pulses (10 ns) are produced by a frequency tripled Nd:YAG laser emitting at 355 nm with a variable repetition rate up to approximately equals 22 kHz and a pulse energy typically of 40 (mu) J. The laser spot size is adjusted by means of a variable beam expander. Fluorescence images are recorded via entrance lenses and 10 nm bandpass filters with a gated intensified digital CCD camera operating at 50 frames per second. The 'head of the system' (laser and camera) can be directed in site and azimuth, and can be high until a 6 meters height. All the functions like the system positioning, localization and distance detection, spot size adjustment, focus, sharpness, selection of the filter, laser and camera synchronization, gain of the intensifier, real time visualization of images, acquisition time are controlled by a newly developed software which also allows image storage, analysis and treatment.

Water snakes accumulated high concentrations of trace elements, especially arsenic (As) and selenium (Se), in the polluted habitat. In addition to being exposed to contaminants in water and sediments, snakes in the polluted site are exposed to contaminants by ingesting prey items that have elevated whole-body concentrations of trace elements, including As, cadmium (Cd), and Se. Snakes from the polluted site exhibited mean standard metabolic rates (SMR) 32% higher than snakes from the reference site. As a result, snakes from the polluted site appear to have elevated allocation of energy to maintenance and theoretically should have less energy available for growth, reproduction, and storage. Our findings are consistent with physiological responses recently documented in other organisms, from the polluted site.

Krzanowski (1961) suggested that bats are able to deposit a fat store by manipulating their energy expenditure; specifically by selecting cold roosting locations rather than warm roosts, and depressing their body temperatures during the day roosting period. It was hypothesized that these behavioural changes result in very low daily energy demands, and despite reduced food intake the animals are still able to gain body fat. We made several tests of this hypothesis. First, we explored the thermo-selection behaviour of long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus) in the summer and in the pre- hibernal period. We found that in summer bats preferred temperatures of about 32-35°(about thermoneutral), but in the pre-hibernal period they preferred much colder temperatures of about 10°. Second, using open-flow respirometry we found that in the cold pre-hibernal bats entered torpor for an average of 14 h each day. Compared with bats held at 30°(that did not go torpid), the bats at 7°expended less energy. The extent of saving was sufficient to positively affect their mass balance, despite the fact that bats at lower temperature also had reduced digestive efficiencies. Our findings support the hypothesis that during the pre-hibernal period insectivorous bats manipulate their mass balance primarily by alterations in their energy expenditure, specifically utilizing energy-sparing mechanisms such as torpor.","Energy expenditure; Hibernation; Insectivorous bats; Thermo-selection; Torpor","animal behavior; animal experiment; bat; body fat; body mass; conference paper; controlled study; digestion; energy expenditure; environmental temperature; food intake; hibernation; immobilization; lipid storage; nonhuman; seasonal variation; thermoregulation; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Composition; Chiroptera; Diet; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Hibernation; Humans; Temperature; Animalia; Hexapoda; Plecotus auritus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032946694

However, particular glycogen accumulating microorganisms have been described (GAOs), that compete against PAOs bring able to store anaerobically many substrates into PHAs, by transforming intracellular carbohydrates (glycogen) into PHAs, as the energy source. In this perspective, the paper presents a summary (with new findings) of a long experimental work to study EBPR processes with a lab-scale Sequencing Batch Reactor fed with different organic substrates (peptone, glucose and acetate, separate or in mixtures). Our results show that EBPR can be obtained with substrates other than VFAs with neither their pre-conversion to VFAs nor their storage as PHA. Moreover, in different periods anaerobic uptake of glucose was possible with and without EBPR. In both cases, the stored polymer was glycogen while the energy source was either polyphosphate hydrolysis or lactic fermentation, respectively. These results are not consistent with the reported behaviour of PAOs or GAOs, so showing that many different mechanisms of anaerobic uptake and storage of substrates can act in favour of, or against EBPR.

Use of reduced-time plots to normalize the data allowed the order of the reaction to be confirmed across all treatments for a given drug concentration (above or below the cmc).

The model drug, triamcinolone acetonide (TAA), was subjected to ball milling or air-jet milling prior to formulation of the pMDI. The dose delivery characteristics of the emitted aerosol cloud were monitored for the ball- milled, air-jet-milled, and unmicronized TAA pMDI formulations prior to and after storage at 25 and 40°C. Cascade impactivin was used to determine the aerodynamic particle size distribution of the emitted dose. Both micronization techniques reduced the drug particle size distribution and the polydispersity of the drug particles to a similar extent, but the ball- milling technique reduced the crystallinity of the drug to a greater degree compared to the air-jet-milling technique. The air-jet-milled and unmicronized TAA pMDI displayed similar aerodynamic particle size distributions of the emitted aerosol and respirable fractions over the storage period. The ball-milled TAA resulted in a pMDI formulation with the smallest aerodynamically sized particles and the highest respirable fraction compared to the air-jet-milled or unmicronized TAA pMDI formulations.

Background: 1H MRS allows the brain metabolism to be studied noninvasively in vivo. N- acetyl (NA) is composed primarily of NAA, which is regarded as a neuronal marker. The NA signal in 1H MRS is reduced in several neurodegenerative disorders. Increased NA signal has thus far only been found in Canavan's disease as a result of NAA accumulation in the brain tissue. In Salla disease, an autosomal recessive free sialic acid storage disorder, N- acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), accumulates in lysosomes of brain tissue. Methods: The authors studied eight patients with Salla disease (age range, 6 to 44 years) and eight age-matched healthy volunteers using quantitative 1H MRS. The spectra were obtained from two selected 8-cm3 volumes of interest localized in the basal ganglia and in the parietal white matter using conventional 1.5-T MRI equipment. The spectral resonance lines of NA groups, creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline-containing compounds (Cho) were analyzed quantitatively. All MR images were evaluated to verify the state of myelination. Results: 2H MRS from parietal white matter revealed 34% higher NA and 47% higher Cr concentrations, and a 35% lower Cho concentration in the patients with Salla disease compared with the age- matched control subjects. The patients had a 22% higher water content in their parietal white matter, whereas in the basal ganglia the water concentrations did not differ significantly. In the patients' basal ganglia the Cr concentration was 53% higher. Conclusions: NAA is considered to be a neuronal marker that, except for Canavan's disease, has been found or assumed to be either stable or reduced. However, in Salla disease the high NA signal may have a contribution from accumulated lysosomal NANA, which offsets the possible loss of NAA. The high Cr is in line with the increased glucose uptake found in our earlier 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET study, reflecting increased energy demand. It is worth noting that in a conventional 1H MRS ratio-based analysis these underlying abnormalities would have remained undetected. Our study thus emphasizes the importance of a quantitative assessment of metabolite concentrations in 1H MRS for detecting altered brain metabolism.",,"n acetylaspartic acid; n acetylneuraminic acid; sialic acid; adolescent; adult; article; autosomal recessive disorder; basal ganglion; brain metabolism; Canavan disease; child; clinical article; degenerative disease; human; lysosome; lysosome storage disease; myelination; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; sialic acid storage disease; white matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033549025

The cell feature most closely related to storage protein synthesis, transport, and deposition in the form of aleurone grains were demonstrated. Protein deposition was shown to begin at the 10th day after flowering in actively dividing cells, where the formation of the vacuolar system for storage just begins to function. Then, meristemic cells are converted into storage cells characterized by a large nucleus spreading over a considerable part of the cell, with prominent granulated nucleoli and heterochromatin loci. The apparatus for the synthesis of storage proteins is formed. The cytosol becomes enriched with ribosomes, which, after being associated with mRNA, thus form polysemes. The system of cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the transport system as protein-carrier vesicles are developed during this period. The storage compartment, consisting of numerous vacuoles, is also formed. A protein-synthesizing system and the energy potential of cotyledon cells were shown to retain their activity throughout the entire period of aleurone grain formation (10-30 days). During seed maturation, there is partial degradation of protein-synthesizing system. Transient starch accumulation in plastids was shown to precede lipid accumulation in the cytosol.","Accumulation; Aleurone grains; Cotyledons; Embryogenesis; Helianthus annuus; Storage parenchyma; Ultrastructure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033246815

Commercial production of fuel-celled vehicles could start as early as 2004, according to DaimlerChrysler. As automotive fuel cells are unlikely to use H2 due to storage and delivery problems, methanol is a strongly favored candidate, possibly leading to a massive restructuring of the automotive fuel market.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) imaging was used to obtain quantitative information on the levels of calcium and nitrogen in the cell walls of apple (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. Cox's Orange Pippin) fruits. Samples of fruit cortex were prepared for EELS by high-pressure freezing and molecular distillation drying to minimize loss and redistribution of soluble cell wall components such as calcium. The EELS imaging successfully resolved calcium and nitrogen levels in the middle lamella and primary cell wall. When the elemental compositions of tile cell walls of Cox's apples from two sites; in the UK were compared at harvest or after 6 months storage, the orchard which always produced consistently firmer fruit had significantly lower levels of cell wall calcium and higher levels of cell wall nitrogen. This result was unexpected since firm texture in apples and other fruits has been commonly associated with elevated levels of fruit calcium. The nitrogen-rich material in the sections used for EELS was insoluble in acidified methanol, indicating that it represented a high-molecular-weight component in the cell wall. Furthermore, total tissue hydroxyproline levels were greatest in material with elevated cell wall nitrogen, suggesting enhanced levels of wall structural proteins in the tissue. These data indicate a correlation between increased amounts of cell wall nitrogen and firm fruit texture. The possible role of cell wall proteins in determining the textural properties of fruit tissue is discussed.","Calcium (EELS imaging); Cell wall; Fruit texture; Malus (fruit cell wall); Nitrogen (EELS imaging)","calcium; cell wall; electron energy loss spectroscopy; fruit; nitrogen; spectroscopy; united kingdom; Malus domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033041544

The ultimate cause of myocardial damage during storage is unknown, but oxygen free radicals might be involved. We evaluated the occurrence of oxidative stress and changes in cellular redox potential after different periods of hypothermic storage. Methods: Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to a protocol, mimicking each stage of a cardiac transplantation procedure: explantation, storage and reperfusion. Three periods of storage were considered: Group A = 5 hours, Group B = 15 hours, and Group C = 24 hours. Oxidative stress was determined in terms of myocardial content and release of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, and cellular redox potential as oxidized and reduced pyridine nucleotides ratio (NAD/NADH). Data on mechanical function, cellular integrity and myocardial energetic status were collected. Results: At the end of reperfusion, despite the different timings of storage, recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (46.1 ± 7.0, 54.7 ± 6.7, and 45.7 ± 7.4% of the baseline pre-ischaemic value), energy charge (0.81 ± 0.02, 0.81 ± 0.02, and 0.77 ± 0.01) and NAD/NADH ratio (8.87 ± 1.08, 9.39 ± 1.72, and 10.26 ± 1.98) were similar in all groups (A, B and C). On the contrary, the rise in left ventricular resting pressure (LVRP) and GSH/GSSG ratio were significantly different between Group C, and Groups A and B (p < 0.0001, analyzed by Generalized Estimating Equations model for repeated measures, and p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusions: The pathophysiology of myocardial damage during hypothermic storage cannot be considered as a normothermic ischaemic injury and parameters other than energetic metabolism, such as thiolic redox state, are more predictive of functional recovery upon reperfusion.",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; cardioplegic agent; creatine kinase; glutathione; glutathione disulfide; lactic acid; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; animal tissue; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; heart left ventricle pressure; heart muscle; heart preservation; heart transplantation; high performance liquid chromatography; male; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; oxidative stress; priority journal; rabbit; Animals; Cardioplegic Solutions; Creatine Kinase; Cryopreservation; Disease Models, Animal; Glutathione; Glutathione Disulfide; Heart; Heart Transplantation; Male; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Rabbits; Ventricular Pressure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033029979

The neutral lipid content of individual zoospores during the experiment was measured by flow cytometry using Nile Red, a fluorescent stain that is specific for neutral lipid. Results showed that photosynthesis greatly influenced lipid consumption during zoospore swimming. We found no detectable change in the neutral lipid content of zoospores after 30 h of swimming under conditions where light was near the optimum for photosynthesis. By contrast, neutral lipid declined by ≃43% over 30 h in zoospores kept in the dark. To evaluate whether lipid reserves are generally related to spore motility in macroalgae, we surveyed spore lipid-content and composition in species with motile spores and non-motile spores using thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and flame-ionization detection (FID). We observed substantial differences in lipid content and composition among the 20 species examined. Spores high in total lipid (as estimated by the ratio of lipid:carbon) generally had a large amount of neutral lipid; motile spores had significantly more lipid and a significantly larger neutral lipid fraction than non-motile spores. The kelps as a group had the highest total lipid content and the largest neutral lipid fraction, while non-motile spores of red algae were generally low in total lipid and in the proportional abundance of neutral lipid. Phospholipids accounted for more than half of all lipid in 14 of the 20 species examined, while neutral lipid accounted for the majority of lipid in all five species of kelp examined. Triacylglycerols, which function primarily in energy storage, were the primary form of neutral lipid in all but one species of kelp (Agarum fimbriatum), whereas free fatty acids were the dominant form of neutral lipid in most red algae and in brown algae that had a small neutral lipid fraction. Our results are largely consistent with the hypothesis that macroalgae use endogenous lipid reserves to fuel spore-swimming. The small amounts of triacylglycerols observed in the motile spores of several species of brown and green algae, however, indicate that the amount of lipid reserves needed to fuel spore-swimming may be influenced by a variety of factors including swimming behavior, photosynthetic efficiency, and the light environment inhabited by spores.",,"alga; flow cytometry; fluorescence analysis; lipid analysis; photosynthesis; thin layer chromatography; Agarum fimbriatum; Pterygophora californica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032978480

As lipid contents vary between species, comparisons of reproductive investments should not only include numbers and sizes of eggs, but also their energy content. We estimated the investment in egg material of mature females of the Baltic tellin Macoma balthica (L.) in terms of both mass and energy content. All mass below a minimum body mass (below which no eggs are produced) was defined as structural mass. This threshold amounts to a body mass index (BMI) of 5.6 (ash-free dry mass per cubic shell length in mg cm-3). More than half (55%) of the mass above the structural mass was invested in egg material and 45% in extra somatic tissue and tissue for production and storage of gametes. This means that the amount of eggs spawned ranged from 0 (at BMI = 5.6 mg cm-3) to 33% of the total ash-free dry mass (at a high BMI value of 14 mg cm-3). Eggs contained a relatively large amount of lipids, about 30% of their ash-free dry mass, whereas non-egg material contained only about 7% lipids. Eggs of two other bivalves in the Wadden Sea, the cockle Cerastoderma edule and the mussel Mytilus edulis, were smaller and contained only about 11% and 20% lipids, respectively. Energy content of M. balthica eggs amounted to ~0.006 J, in the other two species to ~.0.002 J. The function of the more expensive eggs in M. balthica may be related to its early spawning in spring, causing slower larval development until first feeding.","Egg mass; Egg size; Fecundity; Marine bivalves; Reproduction; Spawning; Total lipid","Macoma balthica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032918244

Euglycemic insulin clamp studies (180 min) were performed in combination with continuous indirect calorimetry and 1-14C leucine infusion (study I). Postabsorptive glucose oxidation was higher (1.75 ± 0.18 versus 1.42 ± 0.14 mg/kg per min) and lipid oxidation was lower (0.43 ± 0.09 versus 0.61 ± 0.12 mg/kg per min) in CAPD patients than in control subjects (P &lt; 0.05 versus control subjects). During the last 60 min of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, the total rate of glucose metabolism was similar in CAPD and control subjects (6.33 ± 0.51 versus 6.54 ± 0.62 mg/kg per min). Both insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation (2.53 ± 0.27 versus 2.64 ± 0.37 mg/kg per min) and glucose storage (3.70 ± 0.48 versus 3.90 ± 0.58 mg/kg per min) were similar in CAPD and control subjects. Basal leucine flux (an index of endogenous proteolysis) was significantly lower in CAPD patients than in control subjects (1.21 ± 0.15 versus 1.65 ± 0.07 μmol/kg per min). Leucine oxidation (0.13 ± 0.02 versus 0.26 ± 0.02 μmol/kg per min) and nonoxidative leucine disposal (an index of protein synthesis) (1.09 ± 0.16 versus 1.35 ± 0.05 μmol/kg per min) were also reduced in CAPD compared with control subjects (P &lt; 0.01 versus control subjects). In response to insulin (study I), endogenous leucine flux decreased to 0.83 ± 0.08 and 1.05 ± 0.05 μmol/kg per min in CAPD and control subjects, respectively (all P &lt; 0.01 versus basal). Leucine oxidation declined to 0.06 ± 0.01 and to 0.19 ± 0.02 μmol/kg per rain in CAPD and control subjects, respectively (P &lt; 0.01 versus basal). A second insulin clamp was performed in combination with an intravenous amino acid infusion (study II). During insulin plus amino acid administration, nonoxidative leucine disposal rose to 1.23 ± 0.17 and 1.42 ± 0.09 μmol/kg per min in CAPD and control subjects, respectively (both P &lt; 0.05 versus basal, P = NS versus control subjects), and leucine balance, an index of the net amino acid flux into protein, become positive in both groups (0.30 ± 0.05 versus 0.40 ± 0.07 μmol/kg per min in CAPD and control subjects, respectively) (both P &lt; 0.01 versus basal, P = NS versus control subjects). In summary, in CAPD patients: (1) basal glucose oxidation is increased; (2) basal lipid oxidation is decreased; (3) insulin-mediated glucose oxidation and storage are normal; (4) basal leucine flux is reduced; (5) the antiproteolitic action of insulin is normal; and (6) the anabolic response to insulin plus amino acid administration is normal. Uremic patients maintained on CAPD treatment show a preferential utilization of glucose as postabsorptive energy substrate; however, their anabolic response to substrate administration and the sensitivity to insulin are normal.",,"amino acid; glucose; insulin; leucine; adult; amino acid metabolism; amino acid transport; article; clinical article; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; controlled study; female; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; human; hyperinsulinemia; lipid oxidation; male; priority journal; protein metabolism; Adult; Amino Acids; Blood Glucose; Calorimetry, Indirect; Female; Glucose; Hormones; Humans; Insulin; Keto Acids; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Leucine; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Osmolar Concentration; Oxidation-Reduction; Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; Protein Biosynthesis; Reference Values",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032908139

This is performed by detailed temperature measurements in the phase change material (PCM) in eighteen locations forming a grid of six radial and three axial positions. The system constitutes a double pipe configuration, where commercial grade paraffin wax is stored in the annular space between the two pipes and water flows inside the inner pipe. Vertical alignment of the system allowed for reverse of the flow direction of the heat transfer fluid (HTF), which is water. Therefore, the PCM is heated from the bottom for HTF flow from bottom to top and from the top as the HTF flow direction is reversed. For the former case, natural convection affects the melting process. Collected data are used to study variations in the transient temperature distribution at axial and radial positions as well as for the two-dimensional temperature field. The data is used to calculate the PCM heat transfer coefficient and to develop correlations for the melting Fourier number. Results indicate that the PCM heat transfer coefficient is higher for the case of PCM heating from bottom to top. Nusselt number correlations are developed as a function of Rayleigh, Stefan, and Fourier numbers for the HTF flow from bottom to top and as a function of Stefan and Fourier numbers for HTF flow from top to bottom. The enhancement ratio for heat transfer caused by natural convection increases and then levels off as the inlet temperature of the HTF is increased. © 1999 by ASME.",,"Energy storage; Heat transfer coefficients; Natural convection; Nusselt number; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Two dimensional; Fourier number; Heat transfer fluid; Phase change energy storage systems; Phase change material; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032651426

We argue that the retention time, namely log(tR), varies linearly with temperature T rather than with 1/T as commonly assumed, yielding an important reduction in the extrapolated time-to-failure.

Charge-exchange neutral particle measurements show significantly lower tail temperature in negative-shear plasmas than those in positive-shear plasmas. The tail temperature in negative-shear plasmas increases with plasma current and shows improvement of energetic ion confinement. Charge-exchange neutral fluxes are also lower in negative-shear plasmas than in positive-shear plasmas. Meanwhile, tail ion stored energy is comparable between negative- and positive-shear plasmas. In order to understand these experimental results, simple modelled calculations were carried out with an orbit-following Monte Carlo (OFMC) code. The model calculations suggest that the ICRF power absorption is dominant near the 2ω-CH$/ resonance in the negative-shear plasma and in the low-field side away from the 2ω-CH$/ resonance in the positive-shear plasma. A larger scale length of pressure profile in the negative-shear plasma compensates for a lower density of tail ions than that in the positive-shear plasma. Accordingly, negative-shear plasmas can contain comparable stored energy of energetic tail ions to positive-shear plasmas.",,"Computer simulation; Cyclotron resonance; Electric currents; Energy storage; Ions; Magnetoplasma; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Plasma heating; Tokamak devices; Ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heating; Negative shear plasmas; Plasma confinement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032628092

Delayed electron emission is observed on the milliseconds time scale by systematic variation of the storage duration between laser excitation and ion detection. Even if the photon energy exceeds the electron detachment energy, electrons are emitted several milliseconds after laser excitation. The electron emission time constant is determined as a function of the laser pulse energy. An Arrhenius analysis suggests that the observed delayed electron emission is a thermal process in analogy to thermionic emission of bulk materials.

In the present study, this promotion was investigated using model catalysts in which ceria films were vapor deposited onto α-Al2O3, polycrystalline ZrO2, polycrystalline Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), and YSZ(1 0 0), (1 1 1), and (1 1 0) single crystals. Following deposition of Pd, both TPD of CO and steady-state CO-oxidation kinetics suggest that the ceria films on the zirconia-based substrates were much more easily reduced than films on α-Al2O3. Polycrystalline zirconia and YSZ and the YSZ single crystals were equally effective in promoting ceria reducibility. Structural studies of ceria on YSZ(1 0 0), using both TEM and EDSXD (energy-dispersive, surface X-ray diffraction), demonstrate that ceria forms ordered overlayers on YSZ(1 0 0), oriented with respect to the YSZ surface. The lattice parameter for ceria is decreased by only 0.6% compared to bulk CeO2, but the coherence length suggests that the overlayer may have a high defect density. It is suggested that the structure-directing properties of zirconia are responsible for the enhanced properties of ceria-zirconia mixed oxides. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The storage and loss tensile moduli, as well as the complex and dynamic tensile viscosity, are found to obey the time-temperature superposition principle in this temperature range. Structural relaxation times were measured from the position of the maximum in the loss modulus and from the limiting low-frequency value of the complex viscosity and its real component. The three quantities display Arrhenius temperature dependences with similar activation energies and indicate that the metallic alloy has an intermediate fragility strength in the general classification scheme for glass-forming liquids. The master curves obtained by scaling the measured dynamic properties by the appropriate relaxation time reflect a very broad distribution of microscopic relaxation times. A discrete spectrum of relaxation frequencies has been calculated from the master curve for the storage modulus assuming a superposition of intrinsic exponential responses. The resulting distribution is broad and skewed towards high frequencies, a characteristic feature of heterogeneous relaxation. It is found that the high-frequency end of the relaxation spectrum controls the amplitude, whereas the low-frequency end determines the width of the overall macroscopic response. The results presented here indicate a very high degree of dynamic heterogeneity in the tensile relaxation process for supercooled Pt60Ni15P25. © 1999 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342281025

Seasonal changes in nematode composition were related to qualitative and quantitative changes in the sedimentary organic detritus and particle fluxes. Additional coastal sediment samples were collected to evaluate the effects of preservative (4% formalin) on biochemical determinations and to compare nematode body composition in coastal and deep-sea assemblages. Protein represented the major biochemical class of organic compounds in nematodes, accounting for 43.7 and 48.5% of organic matter (on average 24 and 29% of dry weight [DW]) in coastal and deep-sea nematodes, respectively. Carbohydrate levels of nematodes (accounting on average for 8 and 26% of DW and for 16 and 40% of organic matter, respectively, in coastal and deep-sea nematodes] appeared to be rather high when compared to literature values dealing with other taxa. Carbohydrates were the dominant biochemical class both in the sediments and in particle fluxes. Body composition of nematodes revealed rather high lipid levels (on average 11 and 17% of DW and 16 and 35% of organic matter, respectively in coastal and deep-sea nematodes). Such discrepancy appears to indicate a different bioenergetic strategy by deep-sea organisms that develop efficient energy storage systems to be able to cope with long periods of very low food availability. Deep-sea nematode body weight decreased between February-March and September 1995 concomitantly with the decrease in particle flux. Coastal nematodes displayed higher individual biomass than the deep-sea ones (0.44 ± 0.06 vs 0.37 ± 0.06 μg DW ind.-1 respectively), but were characterised by lower caloric values (5.57 vs 6.68 cal mg-1 DW). The caloric value of deep-sea nematodes was close to that of high-energy zooplankton, indicating that nematodes might represent an important high-quality food source for higher trophic levels. The reduced food inputs (especially carbohydrates and proteins) observed from February to September 1995 determined a parallel decrease in the concentration of sedimentary labile compounds and induced a clear decrease of the nematode energy content. However, no equally large seasonal changes in the total energy content (expressed as J m-2) of the nematode assemblages were observed. We hypothesise that deep-sea nematodes might respond to diminished food inputs by changing their bioenergetic strategies to better exploit the available resources.","Body composition; Carbohydrates; Lipids; Nematodes; Pelagic-benthic coupling; Proteins","biochemical composition; nematode; seasonality; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Invertebrata; Nematoda; Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033560956

During the dry period, 16 treated cows were fed a high energy diet to induce overconditioning, while 16 control cows were fed a recommended diet. After parturition, the treated cows entered deeper negative energy balance state, required more days to reach the nadir of negative energy balance, required more days to regain positive value of energy balance, and lost more body weight than the control cows. The treated cows also accumulated greater mounts of triacylglycerols in the liver and had higher concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate post partum than the control cows. Although the number of days to first ovulation did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, the results of pooled data demonstrated that the liver triacylglycerol concentration was positively correlated with the number of days to first ovulation. In conclusion, negative energy balance caused the body fat of cows to mobilize. As a consequence, the cows accumulated greater amounts of triacylglycerols in the liver, and this accumulation was associated with an increase in the interval from parturition to first ovulation.","Dairy cows; Energy balance; First ovulation; Triacylglycerols","3 hydroxybutyric acid; fatty acid; triacylglycerol; animal; animal experiment; article; bioaccumulation; blood; cattle; chemistry; controlled study; disease association; energy balance; energy metabolism; female; glucose blood level; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver; metabolism; nonhuman; ovulation; physiology; puerperium; subfertility; weight reduction; Animalia; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033036424

However, when excised tissue is stored in buffer, the elemental concentrations in the cell may change. In the present study, it was attempted to develop a storage buffer that would retain the cellular elemental concentrations close to their in situ values. To start, the NaCl component in Krebs-Ringer buffer was exchanged for K-gluconate and KCl for NaCl. This buffer was called a '100% high K+ solution'. Starting from this solution, part of the K-gluconate was replaced by an equivalent amount of NaCl. Incubation of excised rat liver (4 °C, 4 h) in 85% high K+ solution resulted in retention of cellular Na, K, Ca, S and Mg concentration most closely to the in situ state, whereas cellular Cl was retained best when the tissue was incubated in 75% high K+ solution. For rat submandibular gland, incubation in 80% high K+ solution resulted in optimal retention of cellular Na, K, Ca, P, S and Mg, while Cl was retained best in a 70% high K+ solution. Based on these results, an optimally modified Krebs-Ringer solution for the liver would consist of 119 mM K+, 26 mM Na+ and 45 mM Cl-. An optimally modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution for the submandibular gland would be composed of 96 mM K+, 53 mM Na+ and 46 mM Cl-. After incubation in the modified solutions (at 4 °C), cellular Na, Mg, S, Cl, K and Ca in both tissues were maintained close to the in situ state throughout a 6-h incubation. The cellular P concentration was reduced after incubation for 1 h; thereafter, in the liver cells it remained at this lower level for the rest of the incubation, whereas in the submandibular gland tissue it increased again after 4 h. The increase in cell volume (oedema) was less in tissue stored in the modified solutions, than in the 100% high K+ solutions. Incubation in high Na+ buffers (4 °C, 6 h) resulted in a progressive increase in the percentage of cells showing trypan blue uptake. A similar increase in trypan blue uptake was seen in the modified solution, but this increase levelled off after 4 h. After cholinergic stimulation in high Na+ solution (25 °C, 1 min), the expected decrease in cellular Cl concentration was seen in submandibular gland cells that had previously been preserved (4 °C, 4 h) in the modified solution, but not in those that had been preserved in the 100% high K+ solution.","Diffusible ions; Liver; Pathology; Submandibular gland; X-ray microanalysis","calcium ion; carbachol; chloride ion; cholinergic receptor stimulating agent; potassium ion; sodium ion; animal tissue; article; cell membrane transport; electron microscopy; female; ion transport; liver; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; scanning electron microscopy; submandibular gland; tissue fixation; X ray microanalysis; Animals; Carbachol; Cell Survival; Chlorides; Electrolytes; Electron Probe Microanalysis; Female; Male; Potassium; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032968090

The similar or overlapping isotope masses makes it difficult to separate the elemental signals using time of flight and energy dispersive elastic recoil detection (ToF-E ERD). In this exploratory study we have investigated the use of Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) measurements to refine the mass dispersive depth profile information from ToF-E ERD. The surfaces of two commercial magnetic media were investigated. One sample was a 3 1/2 ″ double density diskette with a coating of ferrite particles in an organic binder. The other sample was a complex C/Co/Cr/Ni-P/Al multilayer structure taken from a standard hard disc. The Lund nuclear microprobe with a 2.55 MeV proton beam was used for PIXE analysis. ToF-ERD measurements were carried out using a 55 MeV 127I10+ ion beam incident at 67.5° to the surface normal. The time of flight and kinetic energy of recoils ejected at 45° to the ion beam direction was measured in a detector telescope. The findings demonstrate that by detailed analysis of the PIXE spectra it is possible to remove the ambiguities in mass assignment of the ToF-ERD data associated with the ferromagnetic elements.",,"Electromagnetic wave emission; Ferromagnetic materials; Ion beams; Isotopes; Ferromagnetic thin films; Particle induced X ray emission; Time of flight elastic recoil detection; X rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033515140

PHAs are attracting much attention as substitute for non- degradable petrochemically derived plastics because of their similar material properties to conventional plastics and complete biodegradability under natural environment upon disposal. In this paper, PHA production and degradation in waste environment as well as its role in biological phosphorus removal are reviewed. In biological phosphorus removal process, bacteria accumulating polyphosphate (poly P) uptake carbon substrates and accumulate these as PHA by utilizing energy from breaking down poly P under anaerobic condition. In the following aerobic condition, accumulated PHA is utilized for energy generation and for the regeneration of poly P. PHA production from waste has been investigated in order to utilize abundant organic compounds in waste water. Since PHA content and PHA productivity that can be obtained are rather low, PHA production from waste product should be considered as a coupled process for reducing the amount of organic waste.

The formation temperature of LiMn2O4 has been found to be as low as 300°C in this method of preparation. The dependence of crystallinity of LiMn2O4 with heat treatment temperature has been studied. The physical properties of the synthesized product have been investigated by structural (XRD), spectroscopic (FTIR and Raman) and thermal (DTA/TG) analyses. The electrochemical performance of the material has been evaluated by employing it as cathode in Li//LiMn2O4 cells.

This paper includes results from the area covered by Phragmites australis (reedgrass). The Bowen ratio - energy balance method was used to calculate sensible and latent heat fluxes. During daytime, with a water depth of about 0.5 m, the heat storage term (G) consumed 20-30% of the net radiation (R(n)). At night, G was a significant source of energy (on average, about - 40 W m-2). The magnitude of the daily (24 h) averaged G was small. Evapotranspiration (ET) was a major consumer of the incoming solar energy. During early and peak growth, the daily ET ranged between 2.5 and 6.5 mm per day. During senescence, evapotranspiration was between 0.5 and 3.1 mm per day. ET was partitioned into transpiration (E(v)) and evaporation (E(s)) using a dual-source modification of the Penman-Monteith equation. Results indicated that transpiration contributed 40-45% of the total ET in the beginning of the early growth stage. During the second half of the early growth stage and the entire peak growth stage, it contributed 53-62% of ET. The contribution decreased to 50% in the beginning of senescence, and to near zero in late senescence. The daytime variation of E(s) did not follow R(n), and seemed to be controlled by thermal stability and air dryness. Before senescence, the ratio of the actual to equilibrium evapotranspiration (ET/ET(eq)) averaged 1.3. It decreased to about 0.5 during senescence. The McNaughton and Spriggs (1989, IAHS Publ. 177, 86-101) model, developed primarily for dryland vegetation, significantly overestimated the ET/ET(eq) ratio in Phragmites when the canopy stomatal resistance was larger than 150 s m-1. The model prediction improved significantly when the contribution of evaporation was eliminated by substituting the ET/ET(eq) ratio by E(v)/E(veq) (transpiration/equilibrium transpiration).","Evaporation; Heat storage; Radiation; Transpiration; Wetlands","evapotranspiration; heat flux; prairie; surface energy; wetland; United States; Phragmites australis; Scirpus acutus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033118903

At room temperature, the discharge capacity of ZrVxMn0.9-xNi1.1 (x = 0.1-0.8) alloys remains at a high level when x = 0.3-0.5. A C15 main phase alloy has good capacity. ZrV0.5Mn0.3T0.1Ni1.1 (T = Ni, Co, Fe, or Al) alloys exhibit lower discharge ability at room temperature because higher contents of V and Mn (i.e., (V + Mn)/AB2 = 0.8) form more stable hydrides. Al substitution also stabilizes the hydrides effectively. All these alloys have discharge capacities of about 350 mAh g-1 on heating to 328 K. Our further investigation showed that the substitution of Ti for Zr decreases markedly the thermodynamic stability of the hydrides and promotes a promising discharge capacity at room temperature. During cycling, the preferential anodic oxidation of some components, such as Ti and V, degrades the reversible storage ability. An electrochemical method was adopted to evaluate the PcT isotherm for Zr-based alloys. This method is suitable for all hydride electrodes as well.",,"Alloying; Anodic oxidation; Current density; Electric discharges; Electrochemistry; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Phase composition; Scanning electron microscopy; Shape memory effect; Substitution reactions; Thermodynamic properties; X ray diffraction analysis; Cyclic lifetime; Discharge capacity; Electrochemical measurement; Exchange current density; Hydrogen storage alloys; Pressure concentration temperature isotherm; Reversible storage ability; Ternary systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032651992

Hence, this compound could be used as cathode in primary lithium batteries. Besides, we consider the fact that in the low voltage region (1.3-0.5 V) Li28Bi4V2O11 develops about 360 Ahkg-1 at 0.7 V, and, therefore, this material is proposed as a negative electrode in lithium ion batteries.

Using a rabbit cornea model, our recent study demonstrated that Chen Medium (CM), an isotonic media enriched with nonlactate-generating high-energy substrates, is very effective for organ preservation. In the present study, the efficacy of CM is further evaluated with human corneas. Methods. The effectiveness of CM and Optisol for preserving the endothelial integrity of human corneas in vitro was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in a total of 83 patients: 10 patients with keratoconus grafted randomly with either CM- or Optisol-stored cornea of the same donor, and 73 patients with various conditions grafted with CM-stored corneas. After surgery, visual acuity and quality of the graft were monitored for up to 4.6 years. Results. The scanning electron microscopic study revealed that after 11-day storage at 4°C, the CM-stored cornea had only marginal disruptive changes, 9.4±1.1%, in endothelial cells, as opposed to 42.4±4.6% of the Optisol-stored cornea. All 78 CM-stored corneas, including 67 with 12.2- to 17.7-hr death-to-storage time, 3-7.6 days of storage time, and initial marginal quality before storage, were successfully transplanted. These grafts were thin and clear, with an excellent epithelial integrity and without significant changes in endothelial cell density. Five Optisol-stored corneas were also successfully grafted; one of them, however, was edematous for about 4 weeks, and all the grafts were slightly thicker with substantial endothelial cell loss. Conclusion. Using a cornea model, present and recent studies show that CM is very effective for preserving tissue viability and endothelial integrity. Previous study revealed that CM-stored tissues maintained high levels of ATP and metabolic function, with suppression of lactate formation and accumulation. Thus, these findings support the concept that preservation of tissue viability is closely associated with the ability of the tissues to retain metabolic activity, to generate ATP efficiently, and to prevent acidosis effectively during storage.",,"chen medium; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; cornea endothelium; cornea preservation; cornea transplantation; human; human tissue; keratoconus; priority journal; visual acuity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033608799

By theoretical investigation under the assumption of neglecting the sensible heat, the optimum linear PCT distributions which are corresponding to minimum phase change time are derived. To verify the theoretical results of the optimum linear PCT distributions, the finite difference method is adopted to simulate the cyclical freezing and melting processes of composite PCMs. The numerical results in which the sensible heat is taken into account show that: (1) the optimum linear PCT distributions obtained from the theoretical analyses seem to be the optimum ones of composite PCMs in practical latent heat TES systems; (2) the phase change time of composite PCMs with the optimum linear PCT distributions used in practical latent heat TES systems can be decreased by as much as 25-40% by properly selecting the segmented numbers of composite PCMs as compared with that of PCMs of a single PCT.

The system under study operates as an air source heat pump which stores the compressor heat of rejection as domestic hot water or hot water in a storage tank that can be used as a heat source for providing building heating. Although measurements were made to quantify space cooling, space heating, and domestic water heating, this paper emphasizes the space heating performance of the unit. The heat storage system was tested for different indoor and outdoor conditions to determine parameters such as heating charge rate, compressor power, and coefficient of performance (COP). The thermal storage tank was able to store a full charge of heat. The rate of increase of storage tank temperature increased with outdoor temperature. The heating rate during a charge test, best shown by the normalized rate plots, increased with evaporating temperature due to the increasing mass flow rate and refrigerant density. At higher indoor temperature during the discharge tests, the rate of decrease of storage tank temperature was slower. Also, the discharge heating rate decreased with time since the thermal storage tank temperature decreased as less thermal energy became available for use.

Because of the heavily increased intrabeam scattering of heavy ions compared to protons, the achievable luminosity is much smaller than desired by the experiments. A way to increase luminosity could be electron cooling of the heavy ion beam. Because of the high electron energy of 180 MeV necessary for cooling heavy ions in HERA the conventional approach using electrostatic DC sources is not possible. Instead an electron storage ring could be used. For this ring there are special requirements like small damping times, emittances and energy spread. The feasibility of such an electron storage ring has been studied, and the results with a possible solution are presented in this paper.

Biometric measurements revealed that 'spring' conditions favoured gonad growth whereas 'winter' conditions were associated with somatic growth (adductor muscle and digestive gland). Biochemical analysis showed that in parallel with gonad growth, total proteins, carbohydrates and lipids accumulated in the female part of the gonad under 'spring' conditions. The lipid level of the digestive gland, which was more than 40% of the dry weight under both experimental conditions, emphasised the role of this organ in the storage of reserves. Quantitative histological analysis of oogenesis established that experimental conditions did not influence the total number of oocytes in the gonad but affected the partitioning between previtellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes. The contribution of vitellogenic oocytes was higher under 'spring' conditions. Energy partitioning was strongly influenced by experimental conditions: 89% of the production was channelled into the gonad under 'spring' conditions compared with 40% under 'winter' conditions.","Biochemical composition; Energy partitioning; Laboratory experiments; Oocytes; Pecten maximus; Photoperiod; Reproduction; Scallop; Temperature","Pecten maximus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345434812

The low pressure high density plasma (HDP) source is advantageous for the etching of a gate electrode and a small deep contact hole. However, the high temperature electrons in the HDP may induce profile defects, notch and sidewall etching, and may degrade the electrical quality of the gate oxide. By lowering the electron temperature with the pulse plasma technique, the etch profile of the gate electrode was improved. Platinum, the suggested storage electrode for the capacitor of the next generation ULSI, was etched in a magnetically enhanced reactive ion etching (MERIE) plasma. With the etching chemistry of Cl2/O2/Ar, it was etched with the slope of up-to 80°. In SiO2 etching, the HDP is advantageous for less RIE-lag. We also need to control the polymerization for the critical dimension (CD) control and for the selectivities to the resist, silicon, and also to Si3N4 for the self-aligned contact (SAC). It was shown that it is possible to control the dissociation of radicals in the plasma and the surface reaction with a phase-controlled pulse plasma. The chemistry C4F8/CH3F/Ar was shown to achieve the requirements for the SAC hole etching, but the process window was quite narrow. Also, the HDP-CVD SiO2 and SiOF have shown better gap filling capability, film quality and more favorable deposition profiles than conventional CVD oxides. We also discussed the results of the application of HDP-CVD oxide to the trench isolation and the intermetal dielectrics (IMDs). The film characteristics of fluorine doped HDP-CVD SiO2 (SiOF) as a low dielectric material was found to be very stable with uniform film properties even after high temperature stressing at 350°C for 100 h.",,"Capacitors; Chemical vapor deposition; Dielectric materials; Dissociation; Electrodes; Energy gap; Gates (transistor); Plasma etching; Polymerization; Reactive ion etching; Semiconductor plasmas; Critical dimension control; Gate electrode; High density plasma; Intermetal dielectrics; Magnetically enhanced reactive ion etching; Pulse plasma; Self aligned contact; Microelectronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032687859

In this paper, the study is carried out on a single area model representing the whole power system considering generation rate constraint (GRC). An incremental model of BES is proposed and merged into the load frequency control of the power system. Optimum value of integral gain setting is obtained using integral squared technique (ISE). Dynamic responses of the system are presented with and without considering BES facility. Analysis reveals that BES improves the system performance significantly.

The fact that TG content in nonadipocytes normally remains within a narrow range, while that of adipocytes varies enormously with food intake, is consistent with a system of TG homeostasis in normal nonadipocytes. The facts that when leptin receptors are dysfunctional, TG content in nonadipocytes such as islets can increase 100-fold, and that constitutively expressed ectopic hyperleptinemia depletes TG, suggest that leptin controls the homeostatic system for intracellular TG. The fact that the function and viability of nonadipocytes is compromised when their TG content rises above or falls below the normal range suggests that normal homeostasis of their intracellular TG is critical for optimal function and to prevent lipoapoptosis. Thus far, lipotoxic diabetes of fa/fa Zucker diabetic fatty rats is the only proven lipodegenerative disease, but the possibility of lipotoxic disease of skeletal and/or cardiac muscle may require investigation, as does the possible influence of the intracellular TG content on autoimmune and neoplastic processes.",,"leptin; leptin receptor; adipose tissue; apoptosis; article; autoimmunity; cell viability; fatty acid metabolism; heart muscle; homeostasis; hypothesis; lipid analysis; priority journal; survival; Adipocytes; Aged; Animals; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Homeostasis; Humans; Islets of Langerhans; Leptin; Liver Diseases; Models, Biological; Obesity; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Zucker; Risk Factors; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033514956

J1H 1J9, Canada","Nitrogen (N) and energy (E) requirements of the phyllostomid fruit bat, Artibeus jamaicensis, and the pteropodid fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus, were measured in adults that were fed on four experimental diets. Mean daily food intake by A. jamaicensis and R. aegyptiacus ranged from 1.1-1.6 times body mass and 0.8-1.0 times body mass, respectively. Dry matter digestibility and metabolizable E coefficient were high (81.1% and 82.4%, respectively) for A. jamaicensis and (77.5% and 78.0%, respectively) for R. aegyptiacus. Across the four diets, bats maintained constant body mass with mean metabolizable E intakes ranging from 1357.3 kJ · kg(-0.75)· day-1 to 1767.3 kJ· kg(-0.75)·day-1 for A. jamaicensis and 1282.6-1545.2 kJ·kg(-0.75)·day-1 for R. aegyptiacus. Maintenance E costs were high, in the order of 3.6-5.4 times the basal metabolic rate (BMR). It is unlikely that the E intakes that we observed represent a true measure of maintenance E requirements. All evidence seems to indicate that fruit bats are E maximizers, ingesting more E than required and regulating storage by adjusting metabolic output. We suggest that true maintenance E requirements are substantially lower than what we observed. If it follows the eutherian norm of two times the BMR, fruit bats must necessarily over-ingest E on low-N fruit diet. Dietary E content did affect N metabolism of A. jamaicensis. On respective low- and high-E diets, metabolic fecal N were 0.492 mg N·g-1 and 0.756 mg N·g-1 dry matter intake and endogenous urinary N losses were 163.31 mg N·kg(-0.75)·day-1 and 71.54 mg N·kg(-0.75)·day-1. A. jamaicensis required 332.3 mg · kg(-0.75)· day-1 and 885.3 mg · kg(-0.75)· day-1 of total N on high- and low-E diets, respectively, and 213.7 mg · kg(-0.75) · day-1 of truly digestible N to achieve N balance. True N digestibilities were low (29% and 49%) for low- and high-E diets, respectively. For R. aegyptiacus, metabolic fecal N and endogenous urinary N losses were 1.27 mg N · g-1 dry matter intake and 96.0 mg N · kg(-0.75) · day-1, respectively, and bats required 529.8 mg · kg(-0.75) · day-1 (total N) or 284.0 mg · kg(-0.75) · day-1- (truly digestible N). True N digestibility was relatively low (50%). Based on direct comparison, we found no evidence that R. aegyptiacus exhibits a greater degree of specialization in digestive function and N retention than A. jamaicensis. When combined with results from previous studies, our results indicate that all fruit bats appear to be specialized in their ability to retain N when faced with low N diet.",,"nitrogen; animal; article; basal metabolic rate; bat; caloric intake; comparative study; digestion; eating; female; male; metabolism; nutritional requirement; physiology; species difference; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Chiroptera; Digestion; Eating; Energy Intake; Female; Male; Nitrogen; Nutritional Requirements; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033103318

Organoleptic scores of zabady were not affected (P>0.05) by storage up to 6 days, then they gradually decreased (P≤0.05) as the storage period proceeded. Zabady made from 2% fat milk and added 2% Simplesse received the highest scores followed by control zabady (made from 4% fat milk) and zabady made from skim milk and added 4% Simplesse, while zabady made from skim milk scored the lowest.

Whether circulating leptin or insulin levels predict subsequent changes in body weight is, however, not known. We examined plasma leptin and insulin at 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age in C57BI/6J mice given a normal diet (n = 12) or a high-fat diet (58% fat on a caloric base; n = 15). Plasma leptin levels increased by age and correlated with body weight in the entire material (r = 0.81, P < 0.001). Also plasma insulin increased by high-fat diet and correlated across all age periods with body weight (r = 0.56, P < 0.001). In mice, given normal diet, plasma leptin or insulin did not correlate to subsequent changes in body weight at any of the time points studied. However, in mice given the high-fat diet, plasma leptin at 6 (r = -0.57, P = 0.027) and 9 months of age (r = -0.56, P = 0.042) as well as plasma insulin at 6 (r = -0.51, P = 0.049) and 9 months (r = -0.58, P = 0.037) correlated inversely to the change in body weight during the subsequent 3-month period. Hence, both leptin and insulin are negative predictors for future weight gain in high-fat fed mice. This suggests that when the regulation of body weight is challenged by a high-fat diet, leptin and insulin act to restrain or prevent future weight gain. This in turn may suggest that impairment of these (probably central) actions of leptin and insulin might underlie excessive increase in body weight under such conditions.","Body weight; High-fat diet; Insulin; Leptin; Mice","insulin; leptin; animal experiment; animal model; article; body weight; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; fat intake; food intake; insulin blood level; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; weight gain; Animals; Biological Markers; Body Weight; Dietary Fats; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Insulin; Leptin; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Predictive Value of Tests; Proteins; Radioimmunoassay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032997068

During the last half of the nestling period, parent swifts made a single foraging trip per day that lasted about 12 hrs.

Traditional views of Malagasy primates posit that high reproductive costs select for female dominance which guarantees to energetically stressed females priority of resource access. I tested predictions regarding reproductive influences on sex differences in time budgets and foraging behavior using two groups of Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus diadema edwardsi) in southeastern Madagascar. Compared to males, females increased neither feeding nor resting time during gestation or lactation. Sex differences were essentially absent in all foraging time variables examined (time, duration, rate). In contrast, dietary composition diverged between the sexes in some months. The possibility that females selected particular food items to boost nutrient and energetic intake to meet increased requirements during reproduction must be further clarified with nutritional analyses. Sex differences in plant part choices coincided with lactation in one of the two study groups. Thus, the timing of sex differences in feeding patterns of P. d. edwardsi only partially supports the prediction that sex differences are most pronounced during the period of greatest female energetic demand. A comparative review indicated no tight association between female dominance and sex differences in foraging among Malagasy primates. Traditional female dominance theory falls short of explaining the observed patterns. The results of my study coupled with recent evidence suggest that nonbehavioral tactics involving energy conservation and storage require further attention as mechanisms by which female lemurs cope with reproductive costs.","Diet; Female dominance; Lemuriformes; Sex differences; Time budgets","female behavior; foraging behavior; Propithecus diadema",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032944643

The relation of weight gain to serum leptin levels in male preterm infants was determined measuring leptin concentration weekly in the first 5 postnatal weeks. Testosterone levels were determined simultaneously to explore a possible relationship between leptin and testosterone concentrations. Fifty-three term newborn infants with mean birth weight and gestational age of 3,419 g (range 2,150-4,480) and 38.9 weeks (range 36-41) and 19 preterm male infants (mean birth weight and gestational age were 1,416 g (770-1,800) and 30.2 weeks (26-35) were enrolled into the study. Leptin and testosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. It was demonstrated that serum leptin levels were markedly elevated in the cord blood without discernible arteriovenous differences. Cord blood leptin was found to correlate with birth weight (r = 0.40, p < 0.002), weight to length ratio (r = 0.40, p < 0.002) and body mass index (r = 0.35, p < 0.005). It was significantly lower in boys as opposed to girls (p < 0.01) and there was an apparent fall by the 5th postnatal day (p < 0.001). Amniotic fluid contained leptin in much less concentration than cord blood and it proved to be independent of intrauterine growth or gender. Serum leptin concentration in preterm infants at 1 week of age was significantly lower compared with term infants (p < 0.002) and it increased progressively with age (p < 0.01). An inverse relationship was found between leptin and testosterone level (r = -0.358, p < 0.01) and a positive correlation between leptin level and weight/height ratio (r = 0.674, p < 0.01). It is concluded that leptin derived either from placenta or fetal adipose tissue may be involved in regulating fetal growth and development and it may be related to energy intake, storage and expenditure. In preterm male infants serum leptin concentration increases with postnatal weight and testosterone may suppress leptin synthesis.","Gender difference; Postnatal changes; Serum leptin","leptin; testosterone; adipose tissue; age; amnion fluid; article; birth weight; blood level; body height; body mass; energy balance; female; fetus development; fetus growth; gender; gestational age; hormone determination; hormone synthesis; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; perinatal period; placenta; prematurity; prenatal growth; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; umbilical cord blood; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Amniotic Fluid; Birth Weight; Body Mass Index; Embryonic and Fetal Development; Female; Fetal Blood; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Leptin; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Pregnancy; Protein Biosynthesis; Proteins; Radioimmunoassay; Sex Characteristics; Testosterone; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032932669

The results of dynamic tissue tests indicate that mean elastic moduli for each of the 35 mantle positions tested ranged from 5.0x105 to 1.2x106N m-2. The elastic modulus varied within a narrow range, in no predictable manner. Mean hysteresis values for each position varied from 19.7 % to 27.3 % with no discernible patterns found either around or along the mantle. In vivo mantle strains peaked in the middle (lengthwise) of the mantle and declined towards both ends, and the absolute strains increased with increasing swimming velocity. Energy storage calculations showed that most energy was stored in the middle of the mantle, with an increase in storage with increased swimming velocity. Microscopic tissue analysis found direct correlations between macroscopic properties and microscopic characteristics, and electron microscopical analysis of all three types of intramuscular fibre revealed that all three types are collagenous in nature.","Collagen; Elastic modulus; Energy storage; Hysteresis; Locomotion; Loligo pealei; Mantle; Muscle; Squid; Swimming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032916071

The thermodynamic model identifies the new contributions to elastic storage due to the liquid crystal orientational order present in discotic mesophase fibres. The two classical radial and onion textures found in discotic fibres are associated with pure splay (K11) and bend (K33) elastic modes, respectively. It is found that the radial texture always promotes the Rayleigh fibre instability because droplet formation decreases the bend energy. On the other hand the onion texture contains two competing elastic modes: the splay mode is stabilizing and the bend mode is destabilizing. The net effect on the fragmentation of the onion texture fibre into an array of droplets thus depends on the elastic anisotropy (K11/K33) of the mesophase.

Proton transfer through ATP-synthase (measured by electrochromic carotenoid bandshift and by pH-indicators) and ATP release (measured by luminescence of luciferin-luciferase) were monitored. The ratio between the amount of protons translocated by F0F1 and the ATP yield decreased with the flash number from an apparent value of 13 after the first flash to about 5 when averaged over three flashes. In the absence of ADP, protons slipped through F0F1. The proton transfer through F0F1 after the first flash contained two kinetic components, of about 6 ms and 20 ms both under the ATP synthesis conditions and under slip. The slower component of proton transfer was substantially suppressed in the absence of ADP. We attribute our observations to the mechanism of energy storage in the ATP-synthase needed to couple the transfer of four protons with the synthesis of one molecule of ATP. Most probably, the transfer of initial protons of each tetrad creates a strain in the enzyme that slows the translocation of the following protons.

The aims were to evaluate whether specific adipose tissue depots were recruited for triacylglycerol (TAG) storage and/or mobilization, and to determine to what extent specific adipose tissue depots exhibited preferences for the source of fatty acid (FA) for TAG storage. Caloric restriction led to a general enhancement of the response of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), FA synthesis and glucose utilization to a meal. Effects were particularly marked in the parametrial, perirenal and interscapular depots compared with mesenteric and subcutaneous depots. There was no evidence that individual depots selectively expressed a preference for the pathways concerned with the generation of FA for storage (the exogenous (LPL) and the endogenous (synthesis) pathway). However, the temporal sequence of activation of these pathways differed in a manner consistent with a switch from preponderant use of FA produced via de novo synthesis during the very early phase of feeding towards later use of FA derived from circulating TAG. The overall excursions in insulin levels observed in the calorie-restricted rats were comparable to those found in free-feeding rats, but the magnitude and the rapidity of the individual metabolic responses of the adipocyte were augmented. The data are consistent with a general enhancement of insulin sensitivity and responsiveness in adipose tissue of calorie-restricted rats, together with adaptive regional specialization of adipocyte function. These adaptations would be predicted to facilitate the immediate conservation of dietary nutrients by promoting their storage as the FA or glycerol moieties of adipose tissue TAG and thereby to ensure the regulated release of FA and glycerol from adipose tissue in accordance with the requirement for glucose conservation and/or production.","Glucose utilization; Insulin; Lipogenesis; Lipoprotein lipase","fatty acid; glucose; insulin; lipoprotein lipase; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; article; caloric restriction; circadian rhythm; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid synthesis; female; glucose transport; glucose utilization; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; lipogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Weight; Eating; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glucose; Insulin; Lipoprotein Lipase; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033602203

We have examined the influence on physical properties of both the weight fraction of POSS - norbornyl monomer and the corner group composition. POSS refers to the polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane inorganic/organic macromer, which is composed of an inorganic Si8O12 spherical core surrounded by seven inert organic corner groups and one reactive norbornyl moiety. It was observed that POSS copolymerization enhances the α-relaxation temperature, Tα, in proportion to the weight fraction of the POSS - norbornyl comonomer. Interestingly, however, the magnitude of this dependence is larger for the POSS - norbornyl comonomer possessing cyclohexyl corner groups (CyPOSS) than for the copolymer with cyclopentyl corner groups (CpPOSS). Although POSS copolymerization yields only slight enhancement of the room temperature storage modulus, at temperatures lower than a strong mechanical relaxation, identified as a β-relaxation, and near T = -78 °C, there is a significant POSS reinforcement of the storage modulus. The position of the β relaxation observed in the CyPOSS series of copolymers is independent of POSS weight fraction, and the frequency dependence of this peak position yields the activation energy, △Hβ = 14.7 (liberation of motion of the cyclohexyl corner groups). A similar effect is observed, to some extent, for the CpPOSS copolymers, although only part of the relaxation is observed. X-ray scattering shows that the CyPOSS copolymerization preserves the amorphous character of the polynorbornene homopolymer but CpPOSS copolymerization leads to significant ordering of the POSS macromers.",,"Anelastic relaxation; Composition effects; Copolymerization; Microstructure; Monomers; Physical properties; Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane; Polynorbornyl; Copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033076590

Fluxes were related to biotic and abiotic phenomena. Carbon accumulation rates calculated from BREB measurements were compared with those determined from plant biomass measurements. Thirty min CO2 fluxes were measured continuously from 22 February to 22 November (days 53-326) in 1993 and from 3 March to 22 November (days 62-326) in 1994. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured periodically in each field and from a bare soil. In all fields, average daily evapotranspiration varied from less than 1 mm day-1 in March and November to about 5 mm day-1 in June and July. The CO2 fluxes, which were affected by leaf area, radiation, and soil water content, were near zero in each field in the fall and spring and were maximum in the summer (positive toward surface). Total annual CO2 flux in the bermudagrass, which was sprigged (planted with grass stolons) in April 1993, was -0.4 and 2.8 kg of CO2 m-2 year-1 (which are equivalent to -0.1 and 0.8 kg of carbon (C) m-2 year-1) in 1993 and 1994, respectively. The larger flux in the second year was due to greater bermudagrass leaf area. Corresponding annual CO2 fluxes were 0.2 and 0.3 kg m-2 year-1 (0.05 and 0.08 kg C m-2 year-1) for the prairie, and 0.9 and -0.3 kg m-2 year-1 (0.2 and -0.09 kg C m-2 year-1) for the sorghum. Bare soil CO2 flux was a small fraction of soil CO2 flux from all fields, suggesting that a considerable amount of soil CO2 flux was due to root respiration. The dry matter accumulation rate calculated for each year and field from CO2 flux measurements was within 20% of the rate calculated from gravimetric biomass measurements. The prairie and sorghum fields were in approximate equilibrium for C storage because estimated annual CO2 fluxes were near zero. By contrast, the bermudagrass field was a large C sink, primarily in the roots, during the second year. This substantiates other evidence that conversion from continuously cultivated cropland to grassland could create a short-term C sink.","Bowen ratio; Carbon flux; CO2; Grassland; Sequestration; Soil CO2 flux","carbon dioxide; vegetation; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033593931

The oscillations depended on calcium release from stores and on calcium influx, partly through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Oscillations required the presence of at least 1 mM glucose, 50 μM alanine, or 50 μM glutamine, but were terminated by higher nutrient concentrations (40 mM glucose, or above 2 mM alanine or glutamine). The effects depended on the metabolism of the nutrients. Glutamine and alanine hyperpolarized the cells. This effect was inhibited (glutamine) or attenuated (alanine) by 1 mM ouabain. Our findings suggest that [Ca2+](i) regulation in α-cells is dominated by slow oscillations induced by a lack of metabolic energy, resulting in decreased calcium export and storage, as well as increased calcium influx, partly due to depolarization caused by reduced sodium pump activity. These processes, leading to an elevated cytosolic calcium concentration, may mediate oscillations by calcium-induced calcium release from intracellular stores.","α-cells; Calcium oscillations; Calcium stores; Glucagon-secreting cells; Nutrients","acinar cell; article; calcium homeostasis; calcium transport; cytosol; glucagon release; hormonal regulation; hyperpolarization; membrane depolarization; membrane potential; nonhuman; nutrient; oscillation; pancreas islet alpha cell; priority journal; Alanine; Animals; Calcium; Carbachol; Cricetinae; Cytosol; Energy Metabolism; Glucagon; Glucagonoma; Glucose; Glutamine; Homeostasis; Islets of Langerhans; Membrane Potentials; Muscarinic Agonists; Na(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Periodicity; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032961585

Every steps of the luminescence mechanism enter in competition with nonradiative losses or undesired luminescence which have to be minimized in order to get a high luminescence efficiency.

We demonstrate the properties of the algorithm by using it to predict structures for several small pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted RNAs.

In addition to accepted models using polyphosphate (PP) hydrolysis to take up acetate and store polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), with EBPR ('PAO-like metabolism') on the one hand, and using glycogen to take up different substrates, storing PHAs as well, without EBPR ('GAO-like metabolism') on the other hand, other pathways have to be considered. Under anaerobic conditions, glucose can be taken up directly and transferred to glycogen as the storage compound. The organisms can use PP hydrolysis (with EBPR) or fermentation (gaining a competitive advantage) as the energy source. A conceptual model of the different anaerobic mechanisms is given at the end. It is worth pointing out that these mechanisms are assumed to be combined in real systems and possibly can explain the phenomena observed after starvation at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant for Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR): after periods of low organic carbon loads the effluent phosphate is significantly increased on the following 1-2 days. This is of both quantitative and qualitative relevance, because the average phosphate load in the effluent is increased by about 60% due to this effect. Periods with low COD inlet load lead to a complete cessation of the anaerobic phosphate release and to a subsequent decreased capacity for phosphate uptake.

The depletion of different metabolic pools, an imbalance in the (storage) pathways during and after the starvation of the phosphate accumulating organisms and the interaction of the EBPR with the denitrification that compete for the usable COD and nitrate are assumed to be responsible for these observations.","Anaerobic storage; Carbon feed; Effluent phosphate load; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal; Metabolic pathways; Sequencing batch reactor; Wastewater treatment plant","acetic acid; carbon; glucose; glycogen; phosphate; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polyphosphate; anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; chemical oxygen demand; conference paper; denitrification; effluent; fermentation; hydrolysis; mathematical model; reactor; time; waste water management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344958686

This intercalation reaction produces a new organic-inorganic composite material with a layer spacing of 13.5 Å, in contrast to the 11.55 Å spacing for the parent V2O5 xerogel. During this oxidative intercalation, the diDMcT is polymerized to produce a polymer with thiadiazole rings linked by disulfides in the polymer main chain (PDTT, see Scheme 1). The composite material is characterized by UV-visible spectroelectrochemistry, X-ray diffraction, FTIR, and electrochemistry. The electrochemical experiments comprised charging (oxidation) and discharging (reduction) of the material, with the bulk of the redox reaction occurring over a broad potential range of 0.5 to -0.6 V versus saturated calomel electrode. The cyclic voltammogram of the composite material shows features that can be attributed to the DMcT-PDTT redox response. However, during or after reduction of the composite, the monomeric DMcT dithiolate appears to be expelled from the V2O5 interlayer region, leading to an evolution of the electrochemical response back to that of the original V2O5 material. Evidence is presented suggesting that the V2O5 host material facilitates the redox reactions of the thiol-disulfide redox couple while it is within the interlayer region.",,"Cyclic voltammetry; Energy storage; Intercalation compounds; Molecular structure; Oxidation; Oxides; Polymerization; Redox reactions; Reduction; Sulfur compounds; Vanadium compounds; Ultraviolet spectroelectrochemistry; Vanadium pentoxide; Xerogels; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033514143

The results presented here demonstrate that under certain conditions, the magnetization and therefore the inductance can be changed abruptly by this orthogonal control field. It is also shown that the switching process can be controlled by fairly small currents. Under favorable geometric conditions, the inductance can vary by a factor between 3 and 10.

Included in this work is resin characterization, kinetics of cure as a function of catalyst concentration, and surface properties of pristine and water-aged films. X-ray spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), dynamic contact angle (DCA) analysis, and ATR- IR were used to characterize cured films. ESCA reveals C and Si peaks in ratios expected for PDMS, but CaCO3 which comprises 32% of the bulk is not detected. The surface of cured RTV11 films is thus predominantly a PDMS network crosslinked by a siliceous domain, the latter comprising about 1.3% by weight. The presence of Ca was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) which probes at micron depth. Stability of films in water was evaluated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM), mass loss, changes in contact angles, ESCA, and optical microscopy. TM-AFM images of films aged in water for three months show an increase in surface roughness due to the formation of micro-pits which occupy about 4% of the surface. Gravimetric analysis showed fully cured films lose mass at a rate of about 0.09%/wk over a three month period in water. The mass loss associated with pitting/surface toughening comprises only 0.85% of that measured gravimetrically and by analysis of immersion water. Analysis of Si and Ca in the storage water was performed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) in order to quantify the products of surface erosion. An unexpected finding was the surface depletion-limited loss of CaCO3 during the first two months of immersion. The results of surface analytical studies are discussed in the context of the use of alkoxysilane cured PDMS resins for nontoxic fouling release applications.","Biofouling; Degradation; Siloxane networks; Surface science","dimeticone; elastomer; silane derivative; analytic method; article; gravimetry; hydrogen bond; polymerization; priority journal; protein degradation; protein domain; roentgen spectroscopy; surface property; X ray analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033080462

The power for the hybrid system comes from PV panels and an engine-generator - that is, a gasoline or diesel engine driving an electrical generator. The combined system is a stand-alone or autonomous system, in the sense that no third energy source is brought in to meet the load. Two parameters were used to characterize the role of the engine-generator: denoted SDM and SAR, they are, respectively, the battery charge threshold at which it is started up, and the storage capacity threshold at which it is stopped, both expressed as a percentage of the nominal battery storage capacity. The methodology developed is applied to designing a PV-hybrid system operating in Corsica, as a case study. Various sizing configurations were simulated, and the optimal configuration that meets the autonomy constraint (no loss of load) was determined, by minimizing of the energy cost. The influence of the battery storage capacity on the solar contribution is also studied. The smallest energy cost per kWh was obtained for a system characterized by an SDM=30% and an SAR=70%.

A team from the Brazilian nuclear research institute Centro de Desenvolvimento da Tecnologia Nuclear (CDTN) was chosen as the expert team to carry out the operations in Latin America; since December 1996 radium sources have been safely conditioned in Uruguay, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Ecuador and Paraguay. A Quality Assurance Program was established, encompassing the qualification of the capsule welding process, written operational procedures referring to all major steps of the operation, calibration of monitors and information retrievability. A 200L carbon steel drum-based packaging concept was used to condition the sources, its cavity being designed to receive the lead shield device containing stainless steel capsules with the radium sources. As a result of these operations, a total amount of 2897 mg (approx. 107 GBq) of needles, tubes, medical applicators, standard sources for calibration, lightning rods, secondary wastes (generated during the operations) and contaminated objects were stored in proper conditions and are now under control of the nuclear authorities of the visited countries.","Packaging; Radioactive waste management; Spent sealed sources; Transport","radioactive material; radioactive waste; radium; waste management; article; developing country; inventory control; packaging material; personnel; priority journal; quality control; radiation monitoring; radiation protection; radioactive waste; radioactive waste storage; sealed container; Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032901770

It is the necessary part of an integrated solid waste system, since all waste treatment processes have residues that cannot be further reused or recovered and are eventually landfilled. Thermal, mechanical and biological pretreatment are used, often in combination, prior to landfilling. The primary aim is the recovery of certain components and energy production. However, pretreatment techniques can also be used with the ultimate objective of controlling landfill behavior, that is the biological and physicochemical processes that take place within a landfill. Two ways a landfill can be managed in the future are: a final storage quality depository, in which environmental emissions are kept to a minimum; or a controlled bioreactor, in which enhanced methane production rates and methane utilization are the goals. Thermal, mechanical and biological pretreatment methods can be combined to achieve either of the above goals. Both financial and environmental issues have to be considered when determining the ways landfills will be managed in the future, as part of an optimized integrated waste management system.","Aerobic pretreatment; Bioreactor landfill; Final storage quality landfill; Landfill; Municipal solid waste; Pretreatment","methane; bioreactor; chemical oxygen demand; landfill; leaching; priority journal; review; solid waste management; waste disposal; Bioreactors; Methane; Solid wastes; Waste treatment; Municipal solid wastes (MSW); Waste management; Land fill",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032586166

The MEn-value was positively correlated with both starch and hectolitre weight but negalively with both total pentosan and extract viscosity. The average MEn-value of wheat was 11.8 MJ/kg (as fed) with a variation of about 7%. The MEn-value was enhanced by 5.4%, on average, by enzyme addition: the corresponding average MEn-equivalency of the enzyme preparation was about 3200 MJ/kg. The enzyme impact was inversely related to the MEn-value of wheat. The MEn-increase of wheat accounted for 20, 12, and 68% from fats, amino acids, and carbohydrates, respectively.

The effect of ageing on hollow fibres spun from low and high shear rate (103 vs. 862s-1) has also been investigated, in terms of their transport properties (permeation flux and separation performance), thermal, mechanical and tensile properties. Hollow fibres in this study were aged for around four months in ambient air at room temperature prior to testing.In general, the gas permeation flux drops steeply during the 40 days following fabrication and levels off thereafter. The O2/N2 selectivity decreases slightly over time. Hollow fibres spun with high shear rate seem to age faster than those spun with low shear rate. The gas fluxes of both membranes were found to follow a log-log relationship with ageing time. For almost all the gases used in this study, the gas flux decay rate, calculated from the slope of the log-log plot of gas flux vs. ageing, is higher for membranes spun with high shear rate. The effect of shear rate on ageing is less significant for smaller gas molecules that travel faster such as He and H2. No significant effect of ageing on gas selectivity was observed. Experimental results also indicate that the storage modulus and loss modulus of the hollow fibres increase with ageing. Hollow fibres spun with high shear rates give a slightly higher increase in these moduli than those spun at low shear rates. Surprisingly, tangent δ (energy dissipation) and glass transitional temperature are not sensitive to ageing. We also found that the tensile yield strength and Young's modulus of the hollow fibres increase slightly with ageing. The hollow fibre membranes spun at high shear rates also show a higher increment in tensile yield stress. However, the change in Young's modulus due to ageing was similar for fibres spun with high and low shear rates.

The lung is particularly susceptible to reperfusion injury, both experimentally and clinically after transplantation. The extracellular- type preservation solution Celsior, which has been predominantly studied in cardiac preservation, has components designed to prevent cell swelling, free radical injury, energy depletion, and calcium overload. Using an isolated blood-perfused rat lung model, we investigated whether Celsior would decrease preservation injury and improve lung function after cold ischemic storage and reperfusion compared to Euro-Collins (EC) and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions. Methods. Lewis rat lungs were isolated, flushed with the respective cold preservation solution, and then stored at 4°C for 6 or 12 hr. After ischemic storage, the lung block was suspended from a force transducer, ventilated with 100% O2, and reperfused for 90 min with fresh blood via a cannula in the pulmonary artery. Lung compliance, alveolar- arterial oxygen difference, and outflow oxygen tension were all measured. The capillary filtration coefficient (K(f)), a sensitive measure of changes in microvascular permeability, was determined. Results. For 6 hr of cold storage, lungs stored in Celsior had lower K(f) values than those stored in EC, indicating decreased microvascular permeability. No other significant differences were noted between Celsior and EC or UW. For 12 hr of cold storage, Celsior provided increased oxygenation, decreased alveolararterial O2 differences, increased compliance, and decreased K(f) values as compared to both EC and UW. Conclusions. Celsior provides better lung preservation than EC or UW as demonstrated by increased oxygenation, decreased capillary permeability, and improved lung compliance, particularly at 12-hr storage times. These results are highly relevant, inasmuch as EC and UW are the most common clinically used lung preservation solutions. Further studies of Celsior in experimental and clinical lung transplantation, as well as in other solid organs, are indicated.",,"celsior; Euro Collins solution; preservative; unclassified drug; University of Wisconsin solution; animal tissue; article; capillary permeability; cell swelling; cryopreservation; drug effect; lung function; lung perfusion; lung transplantation; male; nonhuman; organ preservation; oxygenation; priority journal; rat; reperfusion injury; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animals; Arteries; Capillary Permeability; Disaccharides; Electrolytes; Glutamates; Glutathione; Histidine; Hypertonic Solutions; Insulin; Lung; Lung Compliance; Male; Mannitol; Organ Preservation Solutions; Oxygen; Partial Pressure; Pulmonary Alveoli; Pulmonary Circulation; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew; Reperfusion Injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033556467

The physiological basis of this variation was investigated by measuring changes in energy storage and expenditure in 16 nonobese volunteers who were fed 1000 kilocalories per day in excess of weight-maintenance requirements for 8 weeks. Two-thirds of the increases in total daily energy expenditure was due to increased nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), which is associated with fidgeting, maintenance of posture, and other physical activities of daily life. Changes in NEAT accounted for the 10-fold differences in fat storage that occurred and directly predicted resistance to fat gain with overfeeding (correlation coefficient = 0.77, probability < 0.001).

A one-dimensional, semi-empirical model was developed to predict the dynamic thermal behavior of the storage unit under cyclic melting and solidification. The results show that the storage unit may be charged and discharged more than twice a day with a charge time shorter than the discharge time. The temperature of the plate in contact with the ambient air may be controlled to reach higher values without compromising the unit heating power.

As part of our investigation for an International Clean Energy Network Using Hydrogen Conversion (WE-NET), we have been studying to establish a safety scheme to ensure that both existing and new hydrogen technologies are implemented without endangering public safety. In this plan, we consider the transport and storage of a large quantity of hydrogen in a large tank. First we must evaluate the consequence of the postulated accident of liquid hydrogen. Since we have developed the multiphase hydrodynamics analysis code (CHAMPAGNE), we apply the code to simulate the formation and dispersion of hydrogen vapor clouds. In the present paper we have improved the calculation model in two ways. We added a function to CHAMPANGE for solving evaporation phenomena realistically, made many parametric calculations and planned the small-scale hydrogen dispersion experiments for the validation of this model. Another improvement is the turbulent mixing of evaporated liquid hydrogen. Now we have completed the basic functions of our simulation code. And these models of CHAMPANGE code must be verified by the experimental data. © 1999 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

At the inner stage, the equipment operation of the plant for given energy demands is simulated on the basis of control rules using Lab VIEW.

Insulated pressure vessels offer the advantages of liquid hydrogen tanks (low weight and volume), with reduced disadvantages (lower energy requirement for hydrogen liquefaction and reduced evaporative losses). The purpose of this work is to verify that commercially available aluminum-lined, fiber-wrapped vessels can be used for cryogenic hydrogen storage. The paper reports on previous and ongoing tests and analyses that have the purpose of improving the system design and assure its safety.

However, melt-spun fiber production far exceeds that of acrylic fiber. Thus, the commercial potential of melt-spun fibers and resulting fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage capabilities is enormous for the apparel and industrial insulation markets. However, at melt spinning temperatures, i.e., at temperatures >200° C, microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) lose their core material, which corrupts the melt spinning process. Before these materials can successfully be incorporated into melt spun fibers, microcapsules <10 microns in size must be available with a more stable wall structure.

This mobile oil should be recovered using current technology. A significant amount of this oil is believed to be in reservoirs deposited in fluvial-deltaic (FDD) environments. These FDD reservoirs have low recovery factors because they generally have substantial heterogeneity. This paper presents results of nine case studies of Pennsylvanian FDD reservoirs. The case studies were part of the University of Oklahoma’s U.S. DOE Class I project completed in 1997. The project was funded by the Department of Energy to determine if reservoir management and production strategies could be altered to increase expected recovery from the reservoirs. The FDD reservoirs studied were relatively small and thin. Some of them were associated with aquifers and had water drive. Because of the small reservoir sizes, most were developed with a limited number of wells. The largest reservoir studied had 36 wells. Expected primary recoveries for most of the reservoirs studied were less than 20%. Most wells were producing less than five barrels of oil per day at times of the studies. The simulation studies reviewed in this paper combined available geological and engineering information to develop new geological models for the reservoir. The models were translated into input data files for black-oil reservoir simulators. The models were validated by matching past reservoir behavior. After the models were validated, alternate production strategies were investigated. The alternate strategies generally included an extrapolation of the current strategy (a base case), well completion changes, infill drilling, and water injection. In one case, gas injection was studied. The alternate strategies were compared with the base case. For almost all reservoirs, it appears that recovery could be fifty per cent larger than can be expected from the base case. One reservoir had an estimated recovery eight times larger than the current policy and for one reservoir it did not appear that any alternate exploitation strategy could increase recovery. The authors used commercial, ECLIPSE, and public domain, BOAST3, reservoir simulators in the simulation studies.

It was a project developed through a public/private partnership involving several leading technological and industrial organizations, with primary funding by the Department of Energy (DOE). The primary goals of the project were to gain valuable information on the technical readiness and economic viability of hydrogen fueled buses and to enhance the public awareness and acceptance of emerging hydrogen technologies. The bus completed its field-testing and was placed into public service on September 4, 1998 by Augusta Public Transit in Augusta, Georgia. The bus employs a hybrid Internal Combustion (IC) engine/generator and battery powered electric drive system, with onboard storage of hydrogen in metal hydride beds. The initial operating results demonstrated an overall energy efficiency (miles/BTU) twice the range of a similar diesel-fueled bus, while doubling the range of an all-electric vehicle by providing in-transit recharging of the batteries. Subsequent data showed that the power controller was not optimized for maximum battery life and, therefore, some efficiency was lost. Correction of that condition would provide a daily range of at least 120 miles in a hybrid hydrogen/electric-operating mode. The project developed reduced engine tail-pipe emissions, with NOx measured at less than 0.2 ppm. In addition todemonstrating the inherent safety of a solid-state hydrogen storage system, the project also addressed permit, liability, and safety issues, including a safety risk assessment of the metal hydride storage system. State-of-the-art technology in battery system management was likewise demonstrated.

This has led to a wide acceptance of acceleration patterns that require the power train and storage of an HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle) to operate under unfavorable load conditions. Since the power available from batteries not only depends on the State of Charge (SoC) but even more on the load history it is crucial to understand the relationship between acceleration power requirements and the different vehicle components involved. By means of simulation, it is shown that slight changes in the acceleration profile will have a tremendous impact on the size of the vehicle components and the fuel consumption. The paper examines the power-distribution of the Federal Urban Drive Schedule and the optimization of the schedule to match the requirements of HEV's.

The power subsystem of the Sojourner Rover included a solar panel for power during the day, a non-rechargeable lithium battery for power during the night, and a power electronics board for power conditioning and distribution. Starting with the year 2003 the rover missions to Mars will incorporate a rechargeable energy storage device rather than a non-rechargeable power source.

It will also incorporate a cell bypass circuit to ensure that the individual cells within a battery string are at the same state-of-charge. During the design phase of the power subsystem a breadboard version of a one 4-cell string battery charger was fabricated using discrete electronic components on a circuit board. The breadboard was to be used as proof of concept and was not optimized for weight or volume. The breadboard was tested initially using nickel cadmium cells and subsequently using commercial lithium ion rechargeable cells.

Compared to battery-based energy storage systems, RFCS has received relatively little attention or resources for development because the energy density and electrical efficiency were not sufficiently attractive relative to advanced battery systems. Even today, RFCS remains at a very low technology readiness level (TRL of about 2 indicating feasibility has been demonstrated). Commercial development of the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells for automobiles and other terrestrial applications and improvements in lightweight pressure vessel design to reduce weight and improve performance make possible a high energy density RFCS energy storage system. The results from this study of a lightweight RFCS energy storage system for a remotely piloted, solar-powered, high altitude aircraft indicate an energy density up to 790 w-h/kg with electrical efficiency of 53.4% is attainable. Such an energy storage system would allow a solar-powered aircraft to carry hundreds of kilograms of payload and remain in flight indefinitely for use in atmospheric research, earth observation, resource mapping, and telecommunications. Future developments in the areas of hydrogen and oxygen storage, pressure vessel design, higher temperature and higher-pressure fuel cell operation, unitized regenerative fuel cells, and commercial development of fuel cell technology will improve both the energy density and electrical efficiency of the RFCS.

Consequently, alternative methods to carry out transmutation treatment are being sought. One novel alternative method involves an electrolytic process initially investigated by J. Patterson [2]. Other studies have also demonstrated the possibility of utilizing related electrolytic methods for conducting radioactive amelioration [3].

Ice storage has the advantage of being able to absorb or release heat at a constant temperature of 32 F by using the abundant mass of water as the storage medium. There is no comparable substance that is available for constant temperature storage of space heat. Thus heat storage is typically done much less effectively by sensible heating or cooling of water. Thus, storing cold is more practical than strong heat. Thus, ice for air con-ditioning has been installed at several locations and has been proposed for the expansion of the chiller capacity at Union College to meet the increased demand from two new buildings. The purpose of this project was to research ice storage techniques that are available and operating options and then to develop a model and methodology for evaluation. The mathematical model was developed of the cooling supply in terms of chilled water and cooling tower temperatures, storage and building load requirements. Hourly data of temperatures and demand were obtained from the central process computer that controls the heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment and the temperatures and ventilation in the buildings throughout the campus. The resulting model and data was then used to evaluate the hourly electric power demand and cost for air condition-ing for three defined cases. One case was with no storage, the second case was with storage and constant operation of the central chillers and the third case was with the chillers operating at four times the average demand for six hours each night when the electric power rates may be lower. The operating cost, required chiller and ice mass versus time was calculated for each of these cases and will be presented in this paper.

To improve the energy density of the Li-ion cells we have focused on improving the energy density of its components. In addition to using thin metal foil current collectors, the energy density of the cathode material was improved by utilizing a high capacity Co doped nickel oxide material. Further efforts have focused on developing a more energy dense carbonaceous anode material.

Due to manufacturing, operational and environmental variations, the behavior of individual battery modules in a high voltage series-string will diverge significantly after a number of cycles. It has been proposed that the use of a battery charge management system to maintain charge balance across the modules will limit this divergence and extend the pack life. To evaluate the benefits of battery charge management, a project was undertaken to acquire candidate charge management systems, test these systems on a high voltage series-string of battery modules, and compare the resulting cycle life of charge managed packs to a non-managed (control) pack. This paper summarizes the project results, including a description of the charge management systems tested, the test methodology used, and the results achieved.

The potential damage of sensitive electronic systems by lightning-induced EM transients is of concern to system designers, operators, and maintainers. The OLMS uses broadband sensors to measure free-field radiation (electric and magnetic fields), as well as energy coupled to conductors (current and voltage). Characterization of the measured signals is performed by two subsystems in parallel: an analog transient processor (TPM) and conventional state-of-the-art digitizers. While the digitizers are able to provide the actual high-frequency waveforms desired by many users, they have inherent limitations in duty cycle and large data storage requirements. The companion TPM electronics processes the data in real time to extract parameters of interest, such as peak amplitudes and energy, all in the analog domain and with full signal bandwidth. Unlike digitizer-based systems, the TPM is guaranteed never to miss a transient event and produces a very compact result data stream. The data from the OLMS are available in real time and are accessed by users via the Internet, using a standard web browser interface. The OLMS system is being developed to support spacecraft launches at a number of launch sites in the United States. The OLMS will allow users to monitor accurately the EM threat to their sensitive electronic systems and retest systems only if necessary. This is of value since overtesting not only leads to very expensive delays but also affects schedules, while undertesting may result in the deployment of a damaged system where repair may not be possible.

Natural Gas has clearly risen to the forefront of the alternative fuels industry. More than 50% of all alternative fuel programs in the world today are dry-gas (natural gas & propane). The most common form of natural gas as a transportation fuel has been Compressed natural gas (CNG), and the big three U.S. auto manufacturers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, are currently producing vehicles that run on natural gas. CNG provides limited range between fill-ups and the containment vessels are large and heavy when compared with equal amounts of energy stored by petroleum fuels, which hinders natural gas as a viable transportation fuel in relation to other petroleum fuels. Based on this known fact, there has been renewed interest in redesigning transportation fuel storage systems which can still store natural gas, as liquefied natural gas (LNG) in a smaller, lighter container which also provides the vehicle with a much greater range. The technology to liquefy natural gas is over one hundred years old however one process, a turbo expander technology, is utilized by extremely large production facilities when liquefying and storing LNG in huge quantities. Transportation fleets of medium and heavy duty vehicles desiring to take advantage of deregulated, inexpensive LNG deliveries to their vehicle fleet yards, need different technology more suited for 1,500-15,000 gallons per day.

Since low earth orbit satellites, being battery-heavy, would show greater benefits using the flywheel, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's EOS-AM1 is taken as a case study example.

Many of these applications require a combination of long cycle life, moderate energy storage capability, and periodic high power output. Batteries have been made using high-volume, lowcost, fabrication techniques, described in prior publications. These batteries have been built and evaluated for their electrochemical performance. Power output from both types of cells is impressive; current densities of 80 - 100 and 20 - 50 mA/cm2 have been observed, for discharges of several seconds, for Ni/Zn and Li/Ion cells, respectively. Much higher current densities are observed for discharges lasting a few milliseconds, such as would be needed in many applications. Specific capacities of 2 - 4 C/cm2 are also obtained.

However in this case due to limitations on the amount of heat provided to the solar PPS, the time of the interorbital flight is sharply increased (from a week to a month). Therefore if the nuclear PPS allows overcooling of the cryogenic components (usually hydrogen and oxygen) on the start position, the solar PPS demands the active thermocontrolling. It is shown the optimal decision in this case is the closed Brayton energy conversion system (CBECS). The advantage of this system is high efficiency in GEO and also the possibility to increase significantly its efficiency during the interorbital flight due to CBECS working gas cooling by cryogenic fuel components of the PPS propulsion system. Two versions of the solar closed Brayton power/propulsion system (CBPPS) were considered: first, the thermo-controlling of the cryogenic fuel tanks is realized by the thermodynamic vent system; second, this thermocontrol is provided by the cryogenic machine. The cycles and schemes of this systems are analyzed, the data for their main elements are discussed. Mass-size of these 5 kWe and low constant thrust CBPPS were estimated for a high latitude launch site using a middle class LV. The comparison of these versions showed the significant advantages of the closed Brayton cryogenic/ power/propulsion system (CBCPPS) for the long term storage of the cryogenic fuel in the GEO.

Since the manipulator motion control problem is the problem of finding appropriate torques that will drive the actuators in order for the manipulator to follow a pre-specified trajectory. A microprocessor-based controller is designed to generate these torques based on two controllers. The first controller is an embedded controller while the other is the optimal preview controller. Since the manipulator speed is limited by the mechanical constraints of the robot arm, system's throughput should be optimized for generation of the required control law based on the data received from robot's position sensors. The Mohseni's Proposed Algorithm, MPA, has been incorporated into the embedded controller to reduce the computational efforts and to obtain a ""close-to-optimal"" control law. In the optimal preview controller the optimal problem is solved at an arbitrary operating point of a pre-specified optimal trajectory. In this controller, the end effector's velocity of the manipulator is monitored in a servo loop with integral action to compensate for inaccuracies in the structure and to attain zero steady state tracking error. In addition, the position and velocity of each joint are compelled to track their nominal values through state feedback loop to compensate for the system complexity and nonlinearly. The two controllers are implemented to control the motion of a two-degrees of freedom planar manipulator. Extensive digital computer simulation results are made to demonstrate the tracking ability of the two controllers. Comparison between the performance of the embedded controller and optimal preview controller is also illustrated.

In the process, a cost-effective engineered hybrid drive system was also developed. The HETB made its debut at the 1997 SAE Truck and Bus Conference in Cleveland. After the show, the HETB was prepared to complete the first round of proving ground testing under the scrutiny of NASA scientists. According to a NASA technical memorandum, published in January 1999, this series hybrid vehicle with ultra-capacitors produced 21.2% fuel savings for the ""white book"" central business district drive cycle over a traditional diesel powered vehicle.[1] To prove the viability of the heavy series hybrid with ultra-capacitor storage, the team, lead by NASA scientists, elected to retrofit a veteran 40-foot Flxible transit coach rather than construct an optimized purpose built unit.

Extensive use of vehicle experiments to evaluate design system tradeoffs is far too time consuming and expensive. Imperative to successfully meeting the challenges of future emission regulations and cost constraints is the development of an exhaust system simulation model which offers the ability to sort through major design alternatives quickly while assisting in the interpretation of experimental data. Previously, detailed catalyst models have been developed which require the specification of intricate kinetic mechanisms to determine overall catalyst performance. While yielding extremely valuable results, these models use complex numerical algorithms to solve multiple partial differential equations which are time consuming and occasionally numerically unstable. Furthermore, keeping these kinetic data updated with improvements in catalyst formulations is also a very time consuming process. To resolve these issues, a simple model (SIMTWC, which stands for SIMple Three Way Catalyst) to predict tailpipe exhaust emissions has been developed by combining fundamental conservation expressions for mass and energy with a first order oxygen storage model and an empirical data base of steady-state catalyst performance obtained during engine dynamometer assessments, thus eliminating the need to specify the detailed kinetic mechanisms. Advantages of SIMTWC over more complicated techniques are computational expedience and robustness with comparable accuracy. Updates to SIMTWC as catalyst formulations change are also accomplished in a timelier manner. This paper describes the mathematical formulation of SIMTWC, solution technique, input data requirements, and provides a comparison of model results with vehicle experiments.

In today's global economy where automobile industries are concerned with both local and international markets, it becomes necessary to investigate vehicle performance for driving cycles of different countries and develop vehicle designs which are appropriate to the consumer's market. This paper concentrates on the issues related to designing hybrid electric vehicles. A method of optimizing the size of the principal hardware components of hybrid vehicles such as, electric motors, internal combustion engines, transmissions and energy storage devices based on the demands of different drive cycles is discussed in the paper. Driving cycles of five major countries around the globe were used for investigation: the ECE 15 used by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE), the Japanese 10-15 mode, China's Beijing-11, Australian urban drive cycle and finally, the United States EPA75.

The National Park Service (NPS) operated a truck in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) for 149,408 km (92,838 miles) on 100% biodiesel fuel produced by the University of Idaho. Participants in this project included Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Wyoming Department of Commerce, NPS, Department of Energy's Regional Biomass Energy Program, Koch Agri-Services, Dodge Truck, Cummins Engine Company, J.R. Simplot, Western States Caterpillar, University of California at Davis, and the University of Idaho. This summary report details the fuel production, engine performance, durability, and engine emissions tests performed on the test vehicle. The test vehicle was a 1995 Dodge 2500 four-wheel-drive pickup with a Cummins B 5.9 liter turbocharged, direct injected, diesel engine. Chassis dynamometer tests showed that the vehicle did not experience a reduction in power over time. Oil analyses, compression, injector tests, and engine and fuel pump teardown inspections also indicate that the engine did not experience excessive wear or deterioration as a result of using biodiesel as a fuel. The durability was considered equivalent or better than diesel fuel. Emissions tests were performed at the beginning (1995) and end (1998) of the project. Results from these tests indicated HC and CO decreased and PM increased as the percentage of rapeseed ethyl ester (REE) was increased. NOx generally decreased as the percentage of REE was increased. Fuel use increased by 14% from 1995 to 1998. Cold start emissions data was limited, but it shows that HC, CO, and PM seemed to increase more for diesel cold starts than biodiesel cold starts compared to hot starts with the same fuel. 149,408 km (92,838 miles) of use with 100% biodiesel did not affect the efficiency of the catalytic converter.

The designs feature the electromechanical gear (the Transmotor) in place of traditional mechanical transmissions and/or gearing mechanisms. The transmotor is an electric motor suspended by its shafts, in which both the stator and the rotor are allowed to rotate freely. The motor thus can provide positive or negative rotational energy to its shafts by either consuming or generating electrical energy. A design example is included in which the transmotor is installed on the output shaft of an internal combustion engine. In this arrangement the transmotor can either increase or decrease shaft speed by applying or generating electrical power, allowing the ICE to operate with a constant speed. A torque splitting device is then employed to absorb excess torque produced by the engine or to create supplementary torque when needed, allowing the ICE to operate with constant torque. Thus a constant speed constant torque engine can be directly coupled to the output drive shaft by using electric machines. The governing equations, a control strategy and an analysis corresponding to each operating mode of the architecture are presented. The operating regions and boundaries of individual components are investigated and engine, motor and energy storage system sizing are identified.

The method for determining contributing lash is three-fold. First the lash values are physically measured. Secondly, in-vehicle test data is taken using accelerometers, microphones, and stress gages. The data is taken at a baseline condition and then when various lash interfaces are set at zero. Thirdly, component impact testing can be done to identify noise contributing parts. For the condition of park disengagement clunk this method helps to diagnose the source of the noise. When a vehicle is parked on an incline and the transaxle put in park, there is an energy transfer of the weight of the vehicle through the transmission and onto the suspension of the vehicle. When the transmission is pulled out of park, the released energy results in a loud clunk. The clunk has a high and low frequency content. This study shows how the higher frequency responses of the transaxle internals can be identified. The suggestion that this method makes of grouping components together to find particular NVH contributors is significant for reducing costs and test time. The result is an opportunity for reducing the specific lash(es) that contribute to automatic transaxle noise and vibration. The methodology is demonstrated on the park disengagement clunk problem and can also be used for other transaxle NVH phenomena such as tip-in and back out clunk. It can be used to diagnose noise and vibration for rear wheel drive transmission applications as well.

Some gas-to-liquids products are used as transportation fuels and as blendstocks for upgrading crude-derived fuels. Methylal (CH3-O- CH2-O-CH3), also known as dimethoxymethane or DMM, is a gas-to-liquid chemical that has been evaluated for use as a diesel fuel component. Methylal contains 42% oxygen by weight and is soluble in diesel fuel. The physical and chemical properties of neat methylal and for blends of methylal in conventional diesel fuel are presented. Methylal was found to be more volatile than diesel fuel, and special precautions for distribution and fuel tank storage are discussed. Steady state engine tests were also performed using an unmodified Cummins B5.9 turbocharged diesel engine to examine the effect of methylal blend concentration on performance and emissions. Substantial reductions of particulate matter emissions have been demonstrated for 10 to 30% blends of methylal in diesel fuel. This research indicates that methylal may be an effective blendstock for diesel fuel provided design changes are made to vehicle fuel handling systems.

Basically the ramping process is to increase currents of magnet power supplies. But the real process is never easy because of two requirements; fast ramping and keeping the storage ring optics unchanged. To satisfy these requirements, the energy ramping system took full advantage of the three-layered PLS control system. Twelve machine interface units (MIUs) at the bottom layer synchronously control the magnet power supplies. One subsystem control computer (SCC) at the middle layer generates the synchronization signals and sends them to the MIUs for the synchronous control of the magnet power supplies. Operator computer at the top layer does nothing but simply sending ramping start command to the SCC and MIUs. The broadcasting protocol of MIL-1553B is used for the transmission of the synchronization signals from the SCC to the MIUs. Now we can increase 2.0 GeV beam energy to 2.5 GeV in a few minutes with the ramping control system. This paper describes system structure, synchronization scheme, and control software of the PLS energy ramping control system. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Control systems; Germanium compounds; Magnets; Storage rings; Synchronization; Broadcasting protocols; Machine interfaces; Magnet power supply; Subsystem control; Synchronization scheme; Synchronization signals; Synchronous control; System structures; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041370257

This artificial neuron model is properly characterized in terms of a time-dependent periodic activation function that involves chaotic dynamics as well as the energy steepest-descent strategy. This neural network has a remarkable ability for dynamic memory retrieval, beyond that of the conventional models, by using a nonmonotonic activation function as well as a monotonic one (such as a sigmoidal function). This advantage is found to result from the property of the analogue periodic mapping accompanied by a chaotic behaviour of the neurons. It is also concluded that the present analogue neuron model with periodicity control has an apparently larger memory capacity as compared to the previously proposed association models. © 1999 IEEE.","Associative memory; chaos neuron; Periodic mapping","Associative processing; Associative storage; Chaos theory; Chemical activation; Mapping; Memory architecture; Neurons; Activation functions; Associative memory; Chaos neural network; Chaos neuron; Conventional models; Periodic activation functions; Periodic mapping; Periodicity control; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041365392

The main goal of the approach is to achieve the ac current and dc voltage regulation by shaping the energy of the closed-loop system, similarly to Lyapunov techniques. The proposed non-linear control results in globally stable behaviour and it allows a reduction of dc capacitor storage capability, since the bandwidth of dc voltage regulation can be made comparable to that of ac currents without requiring the conventional decoupling between the dc-link voltage and ac current loops. Finally, an adaptive procedure is presented, which allows estimation of constant - but unknown - parameters and precise reference tracking. Simulation results, obtained using an ATP model of 21-pulse NPC inverters, indicate effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.","FACTS; Non-linear control; Reactive power compensation; Statcom; Voltage-source inverters","Capacitor storage; Closed loop systems; Electric current regulators; Electric inverters; Flexible AC transmission systems; Linear control systems; Reactive power; Speed control; Static synchronous compensators; Voltage regulators; Adaptive procedure; DC voltage regulation; Lyapunov techniques; Non linear control; Reactive power compensation; Reference-tracking; Storage capability; Voltage source inverter; Electric control equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041339431

An enhanced data acquisition, control and trigger system has been developed to manage the almost 5000 electronic channels of the detector. Data acquisition is based on fast data link (FDL) connection between 9U VME crates. FDL is a highly programmable VME device. It performs data readout and transfer to a destination board VME CPU, FIC8243, running the real time OS9 operating system. Data read and transfer is performed by a fast protocol (sparse data scan) whose performances have been improved introducing the chained block transfer mode (CELT) technique. Data collected by the CPU are broadcasted to the analysis stations for on-line data analysis and storage. All commands from and to VME CPU are sent by socket based network protocols. Complete remote control of the electronic front-end is obtained by a system of client-server applications. A first level event selection and control during readout is assured by a trigger system based on a new VME 9U board (MUSE), fully integrated with the FDL readout system. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Data acquisition; Digital storage; Network protocols; Readout systems; Remote control; Trigger circuits; Client-server applications; Data acquisition system; Electronic channels; Fully integrated; High resolution; Intermediate energies; Second generation; Trigger systems; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041286299

The alternative to ESW is a simple sludge wash, a process that does not take advantege of recent dissolution development efforts. During the past several years, studies have been conducted to determine the remediation cost savings derived from the development and deployment of ESW. The tank waste inventory and ESW process performance continues to be revised as waste characterization, and ESW development efforts advance. This study provides a new cost savings estimate based upon the most recent waste inventory and ESW process performance revisions, an estimate of the associated cost savings uncertainty, and an estimate of the rate of return (ROR) on the investment in technology development. The revised remediation cost savings estimate due to ESW of all UST waste at Hanford is $4.8 billion ± $0.7 billion within 95 percent confidence in 1998 dollars. The ROR on investment was estimated to range from 100 percent to 130 percent.

In particular, in the paper we consider heavy ion and proton induced soft and hard errors in DRAM devices. In our work, these errors are mitigated at system level rather at device level. In fact the mass memory is based on a suitable ECC code that improves its tolerance with respect to errors induced in DRAMs. The definition of a SSMM architecture is very complex since the design has to take into account the radiation environment and the different system constraints.

Future kinetic energy missiles must be small, fast, lethal, and maneuverable, which requires the delivery vehicles to operate in a severe loading environment. Innovative designs and manufacturing techniques have been developed to provide an avenue for enhancing propulsion system performance while significantly reducing the missile size and mass requirements. Propulsion units with high strength-to-density ratio filament wound composite motorcases are stronger, stiffer, and more readily producible than their metallic counterparts; however, these structures are susceptible to manufacturing variability and are more easily damaged during handling and storage. This paper will discuss the AMCOM motorcase fabrication approach and its applications as well as development efforts in the area of embedded sensor technology for in-process monitoring, structural characterization, damage detection, and service life monitoring of filament wound composite motorcases. The advanced composite material applications have enabled major improvements in System Applications for Hypervelocity Missile concepts and integration to multiple lightweight launch platforms. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Automobile manufacture; Characterization; Composite materials; Damage detection; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Manufacture; Process monitoring; Propulsion; Advanced composite materials; Hypervel-ocity missile; In-process monitoring; Kinetic energy missiles; Loading environment; Manufacturing techniques; Manufacturing variability; Structural characterization; Missiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039978397

An understanding of energy storage in such fields, which are generally force-free in the sense that the Lorentz force density vanishes, requires an understanding of the concepts of helicity and magnetic energy in multiply connected domains. Because a discussion of the physics of solar prominences can provide such a good introduction to the topological aspects of magnetic energy and helicity, it will be used here to introduce the concepts involved. Conceptually, helicity can be interpreted as a measure of the linkage of the magnetic field lines. Fields having non-vanishing helicity have the common feature of being twisted or knotted, motivating the introduction of some topological results from knot and braid theory. The concepts of linkage and linking number directly lead to the introduction of the Hopf invariant. For magnetic configurations having field lines that do not close, the formalism associated with dynamical systems may be used to introduce the idea of an asymptotic linking number and subsequently the asymptotic Hopf invariant. Unlike the classical Hopf invariant, which is restricted to integer values, the asymptotic Hopf invariant can have any real value. Magnetic helicity can be identified with the average value of the asymptotic linking number of a pair of field lines and is equivalent to the asymptotic Hopf invariant. © 2000 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","Electron tubes; Magnetic confinement; Magnetic domains; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic fields; Magnetic flux","Dynamical systems; Electron tubes; Magnetic domains; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic fields; Magnetic flux; Topology; Electromagnetics; Magnetic configuration; Magnetic confinement; Magnetic energies; Magnetic field line; Magnetic helicity; Multiply connected domain; Solar prominences; Magnetic storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037151729

We give results of calculations of the kaonic deuterium strong interaction shift and width using an [Formula Presented] interaction [Formula Presented] that fits the available low-energy scattering data. The [Formula Presented] level shift in kaonic deuterium comes out negative and both the shift and the width are estimated to be about 1 keV.

A compact and comparatively inexpensive system is discussed based on a low-energy, electron storage ring with undulators that is expected to provide 1011 epithermal n/s and 1015 γ Is. This method could provide a more efficient, cleaner way to produce epithermal neutrons than conventional means.

The study of suspended sediment concentration in terms of temporal evolution, together with sediment deposition in terms of spatial variability, is a way to record the longitudinal evolution of the sediment load, which expresses the available energy gradient from upstream to downstream in hydrosystem. The Saône river is a 480-km-long Rhone tributary, with an oceanic pluvial regime, and an average yearly discharge of 440 ms at Lyons. The watercourse is characterised by very gentle slopes controlled by the neotectonics of the Bresse trough and by Holocene fluvial dynamics. Sediments were sampled during the December 1993-January 1994 flood (2 375 m3 s−1) and the 1995 January-February flood (1 826 m3 s−1). A fine partition into homogeneous sectors, using stream power as well as shear stress, has been realized on a 400 km reach using longitudinal and cross-sections at one kilometre intervals. This partition, compared with the results of the field sampling, shows that the amount of energy is closely connected to the hydromorphological characteristics of the river. © Elsevier, Paris. © 1999 Elsevier, Paris.","Energy gradient; France; Saône river; Sediment load; Stream power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025358079

Computer and process control equipment as well as drive converters are sensitive to deviations of the line voltage from the ideal sinusoidal. Voltage sags, harmonic distortion, flicker and interruption of power supply are the most common problems. In an increasing number of cases, where conventional equipment cannot solve these problems, PWM converter-based shunt- and series connected power conditioners named DSTATCOM (distribution static synchronous compensator) and DVR (dynamic voltage restorer) have been introduced. With energy storage added to the power conditioner even more flexibility in system operation and planning is provided for utilities and industry. This paper describes such a 300 kW power conditioner with a chemical battery and its benefits to an industrial plant. If, for example, load demand exceeds the power rating of the supplying transformer or the negotiated power with the utility only at certain times of day, the excessive active power demand can be provided by the power conditioner. In addition, the power conditioner can be used for reactive power compensation or other tasks, if it is not fully used for charging or discharging. The new technology can therefore be used to postpone or avoid major investments and to optimize energy consumption costs. © 1999 IEEE.","Battery Energy Storage System - BESS; DSTATCOM; IGBT converter; peak-load leveling","Control equipment; Electric batteries; Electric machine control; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Industrial plants; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Power converters; Reactive power; Secondary batteries; Static synchronous compensators; Voltage regulators; Battery energy storage systems; Conventional equipment; Distribution static synchronous compensators; DSTATCOM; Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR); IGBT converters; Peak load; Reactive power compensation; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013851946

The main design feature of the boiler is to use honeycomb heat storage material to heat up the combustion air up to ROO C and use the hightemperature air to combust with the fuel to generate the thermal energy inside the boiler combustion zone. It is known that with the combustion of high-temperature air, the flame temperature is higher and temperature distribution of the combustion zone is more even. Thus the heat transfer efficiency of the boiler can be promoted. Also. with high-temperature air combustion, the combustion can be sustained without much input of excess air, and this combustion feature would also lead to the reduction of the NOx emission during the combustion process. In this study, it is found that this type of boiler can burn all kind of fuel smoothly range from 5000 Kcal/m3 to 10000 Kcal/m3. Also, the heat transfer rate between the flame zone and the water tube can be 25% higher than the traditional boiler. For the NOx emission. this new type of boiler can always keep the flue gas NOx level below that 30 PPM. With the test results. it is believed that this new type boiler is not only can provide good heat transfer character but also low pollutant emission. © 1999 The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Ground vehicles have little information of the terrain beyond the next boulder but an aerobot can detect geological features of interest for the Mars-bound rover to investigate. Several design studies have been performed on autonomous aircraft, free-floating balloons and even blimps for Mars exploration vehicles, but none of these are well suited to the proposed mission. Aircraft tend to have complex articulation mechanisms for storage in small aeroshells, and most are designed to fly in a demanding transonic low-Reynolds number flight regime. In addition, data transmission rate limitations dictate high data link power requirements for typical flight velocities or the aircraft must survive a high-speed landing so that data can be transferred over longer periods of time. Balloons are at the mercy of the winds and cannot intentionally fly directly towards targets of interest. A reasonable compromise, it would seem, is the autonomous blimp. However, the minimum size feasible blimp design has a prohibitive launch mass. Hybrid airships have many strengths of blimps and aircraft and few of their weaknesses. This inflatable vehicle is similar in layout to the Deltoid Aerobody developed by the Aereon Corporation in 1971. It is heavier than air so it generates its lift from both buoyant and aerodynamic means. This configuration's large planform area gives it a light wing loading and ample solar array collection area. Thrust vectoring propulsion pods located laterally from the center of gravity give the vehicle VTOL capabilities much like the V-22 Osprey.

The assigned goal of the variable-speed control algorithm we used was to adjust continuously the turbine rotor speed so that its tip-speed ratio (TSR) stays as close as possible to a precalculated optimum value. To examine the success of the variable-speed control, histograms of tip-speed ratio root-mean-square (rms) error for each data set were calculated and plotted. The resulting histograms of both constant and variable-speed control algorithms were compared. The results validated the expected conclusion that lower rms TSR errors are associated with higher measured wind turbine power coefficients. A second comparison was made between variable-speed histograms and synthesized constant-speed histograms for the same wind. The decrease in rms TSR error of the variable-speed case was used to quantify the observed improvement in TSR tracking brought by the variable-speed control. © l998 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.",,"Aerospace engineering; Digital storage; Equipment testing; Errors; Graphic methods; Speed control; Speed regulators; Wind turbines; Constant speed; Energy productions; Root-mean-square errors; Tip speed ratio; Variable speed; Variable speed control; Variable speed wind turbines; Wind turbine power; Speed",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983143349

As a rocket propulsion system, Water Rocket provides the highest feasible chemical specific impulse (-400 seconds). Even higher specific impulse propulsion can be achieved by combining Water Rocket with other advanced propulsion technologies, such as arcjet or electric thrusters. With innovative pressure tank technology, Water Rocket’s specific energy [wh/kg] can exceed that of the best foreseeable batteries by an order of magnitude, and the tanks can often serve as vehicle structural elements. For pulsed power applications, Water Rocket propellants can be used to drive very high power density generators, such as MHD devices or detonation driven pulse generators.

The power electronics interfaces are discussed. Among the potential performance benefits are improved system reliability, dynamic stability; enhanced power quality; transmission capacity enhancement; and area protection. SMES devices may also have a positive cost and environmental impact by reducing fuel consumption and emissions through reduced losses and reduced generation availability for frequency stabilization. FACTS (flexible AC transmission systems) which handle both real and reactive power to achieve improved transmission and distribution system performance are multi-MW proven electronic devices now being introduced in the utility industry. In this environment, SMES is a logical addition to the expanding family of advanced power devices. The design of the SMES coil and power conversion system are very much dependent on the application. Although coil refrigeration and thermal insulation at low temperature present design challenges, the cryogenic system comprised of a refrigerator and cryostat storage vessel is a function primarily of the coil refrigeration requirements and consequently are sized for each application.

Carbon monoxide molecules absorb the laser radiation and transfer energy to nitrogen and oxygen by vibration-vibration energy exchange. Infrared emission and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy are used for diagnostics of optically pumped gases. The experiments demonstrate that strong vibrational disequilibrium can be sustained in diatomic gas mixtures at pressures up to 1 atm, with only a few Watts laser power available. At these conditions, measured vibrational temperatures of diatomic species are in the range Tv=2000-3000 K for N2, Tv=2500-4000 K for CO, and Tv=2500-3000 K for O2. Translational-rotational temperature of the gases does not exceed T=700 K. Line-of-sight averaged CO vibrational level populations up to v=40 are inferred from infrared emission spectra. Vibrational level populations of CO(v=0-8); N2(v=0-4), and O2(v=0-8) near the axis of the focused CO laser beam are inferred from the Rarnan spectra of these species. Analysis of CO Raman spectra also suggests a possibility of vibrational level population inference up to level v~40. The results demonstrate a possibility of sustaining stable nonequilibrium plasmas in atmospheric pressure air seeded with a few per cent of carbon monoxide. The obtained experimental data are compared with modeling calculations that incorporate both major processes of molecular energy transfer and diffusion of vibrationally excited species across spatially nonuniform excitation region, showing reasonable agreement. © 1999, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A key element of this technology program is development of a liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage and supply system which employs multilayer insulation, liquid acquisition devices, active and passive thermodynamic vent systems, and variable resistance 40W tank heaters to reliably provide near-constant pressure LH2 to a solar thermal engine in the lowgravity environment of space operation. The LH2 storage and supply system is designed to operate as a passive, pressure fed supply system at a near-constant pressure of 45 psia. During operation of the solar thermal engine over a small portion of the orbit, the LH2 storage and supply system propulsively vents through the engine at a controlled flow-rate. During the long coast portion of the orbit, the LH2 tank is locked up (unvented). Thus, all of the vented H2 flow is used in the engine for thrust, and none is wastefiilly vented overboard. The key to managing the tank pressure and therefore the H2 flow to the engine, is to manage and balance the energy flow into the LH2 tank (via the MLI and tank heaters) with the energy flow out of the LH2, tank (to the engine) through the active and passive thermodynamic vent systems. © American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Plasma-jet driven MTF is not only highly amenable to space propulsion, but also has a number of very attractive features it has for this application: 1) The pulsed fusion scheme provides in situ a. very dense hydrogenous liner capable of moderating the neutrons, converting more than 97 % of the neutron energy into charged particle energy of the fusion plasma available for propulsion. 2) The fusion yield per pulse can be maintained at an attractively low level (< 1 GJ) despite a respectable gain in excess of 70. A compact, low-weight engine is the result. An engine with a jet power of 25 GW, a thrust of 66 kN, and a specific impulse of 77, 0 s, can be achieved with an overall engine mass of about 41 metric tons, with a specific power density (α) of 605 kW/kg, and a specific thrust density of 1.6 N/kg. The engine is rep-rated at 40 Hz to provide this power and thrust level. At a practical rep-rate limit of 200 Hz, the engine can deliver 128 GW jet power and 340 kN of thrust, at specific power and thrust density of 1, 141 kW/kg and 3 N/kg respectively. 3) It is possible to operate the magnetic nozzle as a magnetic flux compression generator in this scheme, while attaining a high nozzle efficiency of 80% in converting the spherically radial momentum of the fusion plasma to an axial impulse. 4) A small fraction of the electrical energy generated from the flux compression is used directly to recharge the capacitor bank and other energy storage equipment, without the use of a high- voltage DC power supply. A separate electrical generator is not necessary. 5) Due to the simplicity of the electrical circuit and the components, involving mainly inductors, capacitors, and plasma guns, which are connected directly to each other without any intermediate equipment, a high rep-rate (with a maximum of 200 Hz) appears practicable. 6) All fusion related components are within the current state of the art for pulsed power technology. Experimental facilities with the required pulsed power capabilities already exist. 7) The scheme does not require prefabricated fuel target and liner hardware in any esoteric form or state. All necessary fuel and liner material are introduced into the engine in the form of ordinaiy matter in gaseous state at room temperature, greatly simplifying their handling on board. They are delivered into the fusion reaction chamber in a completely standoff manner. © 1999 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Over the next few decades, humanity will strive to send probes farther and farther into space to establish long baselines for interferometry, to visit the Kuiper Belt, to identify the heliopause, or to map the Oort cloud. In order to solve many of the mysteries of the universe or to explore the solar system and beyond, one single technology must be developed - high performance propulsion. In essence, future missions to deep space will require specific impulses between 50, 0 and 200, 000 seconds and energy densities greater than 1014j/kg in older to accomplish the mission within the career lifetime of an individual, 40 years. Only two technologies available to mankind offer such performance -fusion and antimatter. Currently envisioned fusion systems are too massive. Alternatively, because of the high energy density, antimatter powered systems may be relatively compact The single key technology that is required to enable the revolutionary concept of antimatter propulsion is safe, reliable, high-density storage. Under a grant from the NASA Institute of Advanced Concepts, we have identified two potential mechanisms that may enable high capacity antimatter storage systems to be built. We will describe planned experiments to verify the concepts. Development of a system capable of storing megajoules per gram will allow highly instrumented platforms to make fast missions to great distances.

Gelled propellants provide comparable density impulse to the most capable solid propellant systems while delivering the mission duty cycle flexibility of a liquid system and meeting Insensitive Munitions (IM) requirements-an achievement which no current solid propulsion system has been able to equal. A gelled bipropellant propulsion system provides exceptional mission flexibility by permitting on-off modulation and/or continuous throttling of thrust during missile time-of-flight. When combined with advanced seekers, G&C electronics and (optional) in-flight command targeting updates, a ""smart"" mission capability is achieved with the following benefits: • missile effective range can be extended via energy management (fly longer due to reduced drag at lower speed), • throttling capability enables control of maximum acceleration levels across a range of payload and environmental variables, lessening the requirements on certain types of seekers and guidance units, • enables lock-on-after-launch through re-targeting maneuvers after launch, • higher turning rates are achievable at the same missile approach speed (by thrusting on demand at high sideslip angles), thereby enabling more effective intercepts against moving targets, • terminal velocity can be controlled on demand, and • identical units may be used for training and operational purposes merely by loading less propellant in the training units at the production, with no costly changes to the missile design. A gel propulsion system also results in a deployable missile that is IM-compliant (per MIL-STD-2105B), has improved storage & handling safety and is easily decommissioned/inerted, thereby significantly lowering the overall life-cycle cost of a given missile system. This paper will describe the applications, capabilities, and current state-of-the-art of gelled propulsion systems. A comparative discussion of the most important features of solid, liquid, and gelled propellants will include pertinent technology issues such as toxicity, safety, detonability, packaging, disposal, storability, and materials compatibility. Finally, we will review TRW’s experience and demonstrated capabilities in component testing, system testing, and hardware development with gelled propulsion systems and assess the status and readiness of the current generation of hardware for advanced tactical and strategic defense missiles and interceptors. © 1999 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Most have limitations in accurate discrimination or complexity in time calculation. A first phase is the extraction of texture features and later we classify it. Texture features should have the followings properties: be invariant under Ihe transformations of translation, rotation, and scaling; a good discriminating power; and take the non-stationary nature of texture account. In Our approach we use Orthogonal Associative Neural Networks to Texture identification. It is used in the feature extraction and classification phase (where its energy function is minimized). Due his low computational cost and his regular computational structure the implementation of a real-time texture classifier based on this algorithm is feasible. There are several platforms to implement Artificial Neural Networks (VLSI chips, PC accelerator cards, multiboard computers.,..). The election relies on the type of neural model, their application, the response time, capacity of storage, type of communications, and so on.

For some sentences the intonation is essential to determine the core of a communication, beeing used by a speaker who to emphasize a meaning of a sentence. The prosodic characteristics included in the sentence (features describing fundamental frequency F0, voice energy, the length of a pause behind and before the word, the speaking rate, flags indicating word finality and the lexical word accent) are stored in the database and consequently exploited by the linguistic module as an additional information used for recognizing and understanding the spontaneous speech. In case of storing digital speech signal in database we meet a problem of its high redundancy. Another problem is choosing cut points for segmenting speech. Suitable points are pauses, but they are not often present in the fluent speech. Instead a coarticulation between phonemes makes the placement of the cut points difficult. Their suitably for segmenting speech should be dependent on a context information. Having processed the characteristics by usual methods of statistics the database can also be used to generate answers in the dialog system.

A selling price for electricity was developed for this CASH plant and compared with that for power produced by simple and combined cycle power plants of similar size. At 90°F ambient, where cycling power is most necessary, the specific capital cost of the CASH plant was calculated to be 405 s/kW while the simple and combined cycle were 403 and 489 S/kW respectively. The CASH plant has a much lower incremental cost than does the simple cycle. These factors result in the CASH plant having lower overall costs than the simple cycle for operation of over about 400 hr/yr. and lower than the combined cycle for operation of less than about 4000 hr/yr.

On the other hand, there are many sites favorable for constructing a pumped storage power plant utilizing seawater in Japan, which is surrounded by the sea. Seawater pumped storage power plants have several advantages such as lower civil construction cost and lower power distribution cost due to their proximity to nuclear or steam turbine power plants."" Seawater pump turbines are used under the condition where the corrosion environment is noticeably severe, rather than conventional river water pump turbines. In addition, the pump turbines have many narrow spaces between parts and their major parts are embedded, so that it would be very difficult to apply proper corrosion prevention measures. The problem cannot be solved only by the conventional corrosion preventive engineering.""

The project requires 13,700 megawatt-hours of electricity a year to deliver the water. Because of the amount of energy needed to pump water, the SWP is the largest single user of electricity in California. This has magnified the importance of upgrading and maintaining all pump and turbine units to their peak efficiencies. This paper will present a discussion of design, fabrication, construction, testing and results of replacing vertical centrifugal pumps impellers at six pumping plants. The majority of the original equipment, placed in service from 1968 to 1972, was made of carbon steel with very little or no stainless steel components and 1960's technology. Continuing impeller deterioration, along with dropping efficiencies prompted the Department in the late 1980's to develop a pump modernization program. This program upgraded thirty pumps, with modern more efficient components made of state of art materials, to increase unit efficiencies to the highest extent possible.

Federal Power Act (FPA) requires the owners of downstream hydropower projects to reimburse the owners of headwater project for part of the benefits it receives. This paper summarizes various methods the Commission uses to determine the energy gains and explores methods to simplify the analysis while providing a reasonable estimate of energy gains for small non-complex river basins. The procedures for determining headwater benefits have changed over the years. Prior to 1970, energy gains realized at a downstream hydropower project were assumed to be directly related to increases in usable flow for power generation. After 1970, statistical methods were applied to calculate energy gains. Empirical equations to model the operation of the downstream project were developed from a graphical plot of daily reported generation versus discharge values for a period of record. The Commission developed a Headwater Benefits Energy Gains (HWBEG) computer model to compute energy gains on a daily basis in the 1970's. In the 1990's, the Commission began using a Flow Duration Analysis (FDA) methodology to determine energy gains in non-complex river basins, where the use of the HWBEG model may not result in significant improvements in modeling accuracy. Use of FDA methodology reduced the costs of headwater benefits investigations considerably. To further reduce the costs headwater benefits determinations, the Commission has investigated statistical approaches, with multiple-regression equations relating headwater benefits to stream flow and hydro turbine parameters to determine whether the FDA methodology could be further simplified.

In this paper, a system approach to water resources management in Tehran Metropolitan Area, with its complex system of water supply and demands is discussed. Water resources in this region include water storage in Lar, Latyan, and Karaj reservoirs, Tehran aquifer, as well as water discharge in local rivers and in drainage channels (mainly supplied by urban runoff and wastewater). Framework of a Decision Support System for Tehran reservoir system, as a tool for managers and operators of this multifaceted system are also presented in this paper. The main priority is to provide over 800 million cubic meters of water per year for domestic consumption of 6.7 million population of Tehran. More than 60 percent of this water returns to Tehran aquifer through traditional absorption wells. Some part of this sewage is drained into local Firouz-abad and Sorkheh-hesar rivers and Yakhchi-abad channel. A good portion of these low quality resources are used for irrigation in southern part of Tehran, resulted in a significant rise in water table and considerable environmental problems causing adverse social and sanitation predicaments.

The plasma is produced in aerodynamically stabilized high-pressure glow discharge that forms the plenum of the supersonic nozzle. Experiments in supersonic flowing nitrogen and helium afterglow using this facility demonstrate a novel technique for supersonic flow visualization. It allows identifying all key features of the supersonic flow, including shocks, boundary layers, flow separation regions, and wakes by recording intense visible radiation of the weakly ionized plasmas. Interpretation of radiation intensity distributions in nonequilibrium supersonic flowing afterglow may provide information on key mechanisms of energy storage and ultraviolet radiation in high-altitude rocket plumes.

Concentration of the radionuclides can significantly reduce the final immobilized high-level waste volume and consequent overall remediation cost. Organic and inorganic IX resins each have unique advantages and disadvantages regarding the remediation process. This study presents a comparison of the remediation cost for UST waste at Hanford for a phenol-formaldehyde type organic resin versus crystalline silico-titanate inorganic resin. It was determined that with optimum processing conditions such as waste blending and sludge washing, remediation with the inorganic resin would be less expensive than the organic resin.

A primary purpose of the facility is to demonstrate STTPS, the Single Truss Tomato Production System concept developed at Rutgers University. The main greenhouse is 77 meters wide with 7 bays at 11 m with each bay being 52 m long. The headhouse, 14.6 m wide and 62 m long, is placed between the main greenhouse area and the nursery production facility which is 11 m wide and 27.4 m long. Energy for the heating system will be supplied from methane gas extracted from the adjacent Resource Recovery facility when the methane collection system is completely operational. The gas is now being flared. A floor energy storage system and sidewall and overhead 50 mm hot water steel pipe constitute the heating system for the facility. Ventilation is accomplished through mechanical ventilation provided by electric fans. A screened and calibrated ventilation inlet provides control of incoming air and excludes insects from the growing area. Evaporative cooling is provided by a high pressure fog system with nozzles placed at the inlet window vent and along the central aisle in each greenhouse section. Currently three sections are glazed with glass and four sections are glazed with two layers of polyethylene film. Tomatoes in the STTPS are grown on transportable benches and are moved to the workers for pruning, inspection and harvest. Hives of bees located strategically throughout the growing area provide pollination for the crop.

The fundamentals of hydrothermal-mechanical dewatering of raw brown coal slurry have been studied over a wide range of process-related parameters. The results from batch tests have shown that the hydrothermal-mechanical dewatering process combines the advantages of hydrothermal dewatering and mechanical dewatering and consequently, with low input of energy, produces dry, dense and hydrophobic coal. The slurrification of upgraded coal can lead to a coal-water slurry (CWS) with a solids concentration as high as 60 wt%, which is much higher than that from raw brown coal (below 30 wt%). The reconstituted slurries show a strongly thixotropic behaviour and display good storage properties.

The volumes of data may reach hundreds of terabytes and therefore it is impractical to store them on disk systems. Rather they are stored on robotic tape systems that are managed by some mass storage system (MSS). A major bottleneck in analyzing the simulated/collected data is the retrieval of subsets from the tertiary storage system. In this paper we describe the architecture and implementation of a Storage Access Coordination System (STACS) designed to optimize the use of a disk cache, and thus minimize the number of files read from tape. We achieve this by using a specialized index to locate the relevant data on tapes, and by coordinating file caching over multiple queries. We focus on a specific application area, a high energy physics data management and analysis environment. STACS was implemented and is being incorporated in an operational system, scheduled to go on-line in the end of 1999. We also include the results of various tests that demonstrate the benefits and efficiency gained of using the STACS.",,"Storage access coordination system; Tertiary storage management; Data structures; High energy physics; Indexing (of information); Information management; Information retrieval systems; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic tape storage; Query languages; Buffer storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53949094341

Both the electron transfer and the conformational changes seem to be controlled by an attractor, i.e. by a manifestation of a deterministic chaos. The putative attractor is regular and is, for the reaction involving the inner monomer of ferricytochrome c (I), of the order of 3.03 ± 0.03. The conformational changes involving the outer monomer of ferricytochrome c (O) seem also to be controlled by a regular attractor, but its order is 4.2 ± 0.2. The low order of the coupled reactions of electron transfer and conformational change suggests that it is essential to the electron transfer process in the respiratory chain. Since the order of attractors of other proteins correlates with the vectorial description of the function (1.0 for myoglobin, 2.0 for chymotrypsin and lysozyme, 3.0 for an abenzyme), the value for cyt. c indicates that not only the electron transfer, but also an additional reaction, e.g. the conformational change, are essential for the function of this protein. Hence, the study of protein attractors may yield information on important details, which could not be obtained by other methods.","Conformational changes; Cytochrome c; Deterministic chaos; Molecular dynamics; Protein","chymotrypsin; cytochrome c; lysozyme; myoglobin; article; conformational transition; control; electron transport; enzyme conformation; enzyme mechanism; oxidation reduction reaction; regulatory mechanism; respiratory chain; Bovinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53149153957

We measured changes in the polar cap area and motion of the poleward and equatorward boundary of the auroral oval. It was found that the polar cap boundary is strongly influenced by thinning of the oval, decrease in polar cap structures, the poleward expansion of the substorm at midnight, and the fading of luminosity below the instrument sensitivity threshold. Generally, these effects dominate over the latitudinal motion of the auroral oval at its equatorward edge. A new feature is that the polar cap region clears of precipitation during the substorm growth phase, which expands the size of the polar cap but is not necessarily related to an expansion of the open flux region. Another finding is that the increase in polar cap area prior to onset can be independent of the strength of the southward IMF component. For one case the polar cap area increased while the southward component of the IMF was 0 ±0.5 nT. These observations have strong implications for models that use the polar cap area to estimate the magnitude of energy storage in the lobe magnetic field and loss during substorms.

Resonance-enhanced two photon ionization with a single laser beam leads to the production of the perdeuterio benzene cations without internal energy. By absorption of a third photon from the same laser or a second laser beam the ions are excited to internal energies of 4.64 eV and the decay rate is measured by the time dependent appearance of the C6D5+ and C6D4+ fragment within the electro-magnetic trap (Penning trap) of an ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) mass spectrometer and an electrodynamical ion trap (Paul trap) incorporated in a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

Polarized muons were stored in a superferric ring, and the angular frequency difference, ωabetween the spin precession and orbital frequencies was determined by measuring the time distribution of high-energy decay positrons. The ratio R of ωato the Larmor precession frequency of free protons, ωpin the storage-ring magnetic field was measured. We find R = 3.707220(48) × 10-3. With μμ/μp= 3.18334547(47) this gives aμ+= 1165925(15) × 10-9(±13 ppm), in good agreement with the previous CERN measurements for μ+and μ-and of approximately the same precision. © 1999 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4244126855

The magnitude of the ground-state population after 25 s far exceeds that expected based on the initial ground-state population and its decay.

Such systems either sell electricity to a utility or buy electricity from the utility. Auxiliary devices connected to cogeneration systems include a heat storage tank, an electricity charger, an auxiliary boiler and an independent generator. The auxiliary devices can be effectively operated during the time interval of the thermal peak load or the electrical peak load. Simulation is performed in the case of bottoming cycle which produces preferentially thermal energy over electrical energy. In this paper, the modeling of cogeneration systems and auxiliary devices is described and the effectiveness of the modeling is evaluated by means of detailed simulations. A daily operation scheduling scheme is established under the operation cost of minimum level. Simulations are carried out using fuzzy linear programming. © 1999 IEEE.","Auxiliary boiler; Bottoming cycle; Daily operation scheduling; Electricity charger; Fuzzy linear programming; Heat storage tank; Independent generator; Industrial cogeneration systems","Auxiliary equipment; Boilers; Cogeneration plants; Fuzzy set theory; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Linear programming; Scheduling; Solar equipment; Tanks (containers); Auxiliary boilers; Bottoming cycle; Fuzzy linear programming; Heat storage tanks; Independent generator; Industrial cogeneration; Operation scheduling; Bottoming cycle systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749128411

The sequential execution time is O(N4) where N is the number of basis functions, and most of time is spent to the calculations of electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). The calculation of ERIs have a lot of parallelism of O(N4), and therefore MOE tries to exploit the parallelism. This paper discuss the MOE architecture and examines important aspects of architecture design, which is required to calculate ERIs according to the ""Obara method"". We conclude that n-way parallelization is the most cost-effective, hence we designed the MOE prototype system with a host computer and many processing nodes.

The method is composed of solving two types of problems repeatedly: One is a large- scale MILP master problem with the values of part of integer variables fixed from the results of the other; The latter is a small-scale MILP subproblem with the values of simplex multipliers obtained from the results of the former. The method is applied to the operational planning of a heat supply system with cold and hot water tanks. The validity and effectiveness of the method is evaluated in terms of solution optimality and computation time.

In Córdoba Province there is no research work related to different growing conditions nor to seed storage. The aim of this paper was to determine the influence of two storage conditions over the germinative power, vigour and germinative energy of S. rebaudiana. At the beginning of May 1996, the seeds were harvested in Bower, Santa María, in Córdoba Province, Argentina. Repetitions of one hundred seeds were sown following a completely randomized design at the Seeds Analysis Laboratory of the Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of Cordoba. These were stored for 11 months at 4°C and at environmental temperature and moisture. The normal seedling number was recorded at six dates and, at the end of this study, the fresh and dry weights were obtained. The number of abnormal seedlings was also evaluated. For the six dates studied, there were highly significant differences between the two ways of storage, as to the germinative power, showing that the conservation in the refrigerator at 4°C can be recommended for this species. Differences were observed between the fresh and dry weight of the normal seedlings, showing that the storing condition in the refrigerator, produced higher average values, at the same time presenting more vigorous seeds than those in the other treatment. Concerning the number of abnormal seedlings, significant differences were not found.","Effect; Germination power; Temperature treatments; Time; Vigour",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646857907

Specific feature of this complex is relatively small quantity of DT- mixture circulating in the loop in comparison with installation with separate feeding by deuterium and tritium. Operating scheme of vacuum and technological complex is shown. Operating destination and principal technical parameters of fuel loop elements, providing continual operation of plasma neutron source, are considered. Vacuum and technological complex is destined for providing of plasma neutron source based on gasdynamics trap (VTC GDT-NS) operation using deuterium- tritium mixture (DT-mixture), and for treatment of all gaseous, liquid, and solid wastes, contaminated by tritium. It is one of neutron source component of vital importance and determines its design, peripheral equipment providing safety of operation of installation in the whole. Unlikely analogue systems, which are used now in working tokamaks and scheduled for application in ITER, where deuterium and tritium are delivered to discharge chamber separately, in VTC GDT-NS the following concept is proposed: to use DT-mixture for forming of target plasma in discharge chamber and in system of neutral atoms with high energy injection as well. Using of DT-mixture beams allows eliminating from VTC GDT-NS devices for hydrogen isotopes separation, to combine process of evacuation with process of purification of DT-mixture from admixtures. It will decrease sufficiently cost of complex and duration of DT-mixture circulation in neutron source systems. Therefore it will permit to decrease sufficiently amount of tritium in operation, thus decreasing cost and increase radiation and environmental safety of neutron source. Similar system of DT-mixture circulation was realized by Cyclotron Corporation firm in sealed neutron tube 1, where DT-mixture containing 3.7*103 Ci of tritium provides operation of the tube during 3 hours with flux 8*1012 n/s. Truly saying this flux is by 2000 times less than flux necessary for plasma neutron source. But it is not an obstacle because in proposed installation pumping rates will be about 1000 m3/s and in tube only about 2.1 m3/s. On Fig.1 scheme of VTC GDT-NS operating is shown. All VTC GDT-NS systems may be divided into three groups according to destination and value of DT-mixture flux: I. Systems providing necessary DT-mixture fluxes in discharge chamber and injectors of neutral atoms; its purification and circulation which are necessary for providing continual operation of neutron generator: - System of receiving, storage, and distribution of DT-mixture; - Four systems of DT-mixture supply to the injectors of neutral atoms; - System of DT-mixture supply to ion source for target plasma of discharge chamber; - Vacuum system of discharge chamber; - Two vacuum systems of expanders; - Four vacuum systems of neutral atoms injectors; - Four vacuum systems of neutral atoms receivers;.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31744444357

Energetics of all the intrinsic point defects are determined for a variety of charge states. From the energetics, the concentrations of the anion vacancies and the interstitial anions are found to be larger than those of the yttrium vacancy and the interstitial yttrium atom under practical conditions. It is also found that the oxygen vacancy, the sulfur vacancy, and the interstitial sulfur atom induce relatively deep levels in the energy gap, whereas the interstitial oxygen atom induces relatively shallow acceptor levels. These findings are consistent with observed broad-band blue luminescence in undoped yttrium oxysulfide, existence of shallow acceptor levels in oxysulfides, and are presumably related to persistent phosphorescence and energy storage phenomena in Eu-doped oxysulfides. Furthermore, negative-U characters are found in the oxygen vacancy and the interstitial sulfur.

If the coronal field forms the arcades, and if the magnetic Reynolds number is sufficiently large, the helicity transportation proceeds intermittently, even in the case that the helicity is constantly supplied from the sun. The intermittent transportation is a cyclic process which consists of the helicity storage, magnetic reconnection, and the plasmoid ejection. It is a result of the competition between the destabilization by the photospheric activity and the spontaneous stabilization caused by the magnetic arcade instability. The total helicity is well conserved even in the energy relaxation process, so that Taylor’s hypothesis on the selective dissipation is applicable also to the solar corona. However, the numerical simulations indicate that the energy relaxation is even partial, and that the free energy cannot be exhausted, because the photospheric boundary gives a stronger constraint than Taylor’s theory predicted. The coronal field could evolve around the marginally stable limit, which locates in the intermediate region between the stable and the unstable linear force free solutions. The results suggest that, even if there is no external trigger, the coronal plasma is able to generate intermittent activities like flares. © 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644445162

The new mission called for the development and use of spallation neutron sources for research and applications. As a result, the accelerator complex formerly known as the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) is now called the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). LANSCE, an acronym that formerly referred to the Manuel Lujan Jr. Neutron Scattering Center (now the Lujan Center), consists of a high-power 800–MeV proton linear accelerator (linac), a Proton Storage Ring (PSR), neutron production targets at the Lujan Center and the Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) facility, a Proton Radiography (PRad) Facility, a highpower materials irradiation area (LASREF), and an isotope production facility (IPF). With the ability to produce protons and neutrons, LANSCE is ideal for research in condensed matter science and engineering, accelerator science, nuclear science, and radiography. LANSCE uses these research capabilities to contribute to the Department of Energy Stockpile Stewardship Program and to support a national user program open to scientists from universities, industry, and federal laboratories.

The conversion efficiency, however, declines very steeply for temperatures below about 350°C and is practically zero during the starting and warming-up period. Improving the conversion efficiency under these conditions is important, particularly in large cities, where the number of starlings per vehicle per day tends to be high. Among the more successful solutions are preheating of the catalyst electrically, warming up of the catalyst in an external combustion chamber, installation of an auxiliary small-capacity catalytic converter, and employment of an adsorbing unit between two catalysts. Although these methods are quite effective, their disadvantage lies in the fact that they require an external energy source, an additional component (a control unit) or a three-stage catalyst. In the present work an investigation was made of a solution based on the exploitation of thermal capacitance to keep the catalyst temperature high during off-operation periods. A phase-change material (PCM) with a transition temperature of 352.7°C, which is slightly above the light-off temperature of the metallic catalyst, was specially formulated, and a system comprising a catalytic converter embedded in the PCM was designed and tested. Under normal engine operating conditions, some of the thermal energy of the exhaust gases was stored in the PCM. During the time that the vehicle was not in use, the PCM underwent partial solidification, and the latent heat thus produced was exploited to maintain the catalyst temperature within the desired temperature range for maximum conversion efficiency.

The ion beam has characteristic radius rb and is treated as continuous in the z direction, and the applied transverse focusing force on the beam ions is modeled by Ffocb = -γbmbωβb02x ⊥ in the smooth-focusing approximation. Here, ωβb0 = const is the effective betatron frequency associated with the applied focusing field, x⊥ is the transverse displacement from the beam axis, (γb - 1)m bc2 is the ion kinetic energy, and Vb = βbc is the average axial velocity, where γb = (1 - βb2)-1/2. Furthermore, the ion motion in the beam frame is assumed to be nonrelativistic, and the electron motion in the laboratory frame is assumed to be nonrelativistic. The ion charge and number density are denoted by +Zbe and nb, and the electron charge and number density by -e and ne. For Zbn b &gt; ne, the electrons are electrostatically confined in the transverse direction by the space-charge potential φ produced by the excess ion charge. The equilibrium and stability analysis retains the effects of finite radial geometry transverse to the beam propagation direction, including the presence of a perfectly conducting cylindrical wall located at radius r = rw. In addition, the analysis assumes perturbations with long axial wavelength, kz2rb2 ≪ 1, and sufficiently high frequency that |ω/kz| ≫ υTez and |ω/kz -Vb| ≫ υTbz, where υTez and υTbz are the characteristic axial thermal speeds of the background electrons and beam ions. In this regime, Landau damping (in axial velocity space υz) by resonant ions and electrons is negligibly small. We introduce the ion plasma frequency squared defined by ω̂ pb2 = 4πn̂bZb 2e2/γbmb, and the fractional charge neutralization defined by f = n̂e/Zbn̂ b, where n̂b and n̂e are the characteristic ion and electron densities. The equilibrium and stability analysis is carried out for arbitrary normalized beam intensity ω̂pb2/ωβb02, and arbitrary fractional charge neutralization f, consistent with radial confinement of the beam particles. For the moderately high beam intensities envisioned in the proton linacs and storage rings for the Accelerator for Production of Tritium and the Spallation Neutron Source, the normalized beam intensity is typically ω̂pb2/ ωβb02 ≲ 0.1. For heavy ion fusion applications, however, the transverse beam emittance is very small, and the space-charge-dominated beam intensity is much larger, with ω̂ pb2/ωβb02 ≲ 2γb2. The stability analysis shows that the instability growth rate Imω increases with increasing normalized beam intensity ω̂pb2/ωb 02 and increasing fractional charge neutralization f. In addition, the instability is strongest (largest growth rate) for perturbations with azimuthal mode number ℓ = 1, corresponding to a simple (dipole) transverse displacement of the beam ions and the background electrons. For the case of overlapping step-function density profiles for the beam ions and background electrons, corresponding to monoenergetic ions and electrons, a key result is that there is no threshold in beam intensity ω̂pb 2/ωβb02 or fractional charge neutralization f for the onset of instability. Finally, for the case of continuously varying density profiles with parabolic profile shape, a semiquantitative estimate is made of the effects of the corresponding spread in (depressed) betatron frequency on stability behavior, including an estimate of the instability threshold for the case of weak density nonuniformity. © 1999 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18244369741

However, certain over-constrained structures are not dealt with adequately with this approach. Such a situation arises when several energy storage elements of the same type are directly coupled by a junction structure. In these models, although the representations are legitimate in terms of physical meaning, the resultant excess states cause pitfalls in the inspection of system properties. This paper proposes the use of explicit fields to eliminate such ambiguities. It was found that the excess states caused by the topological structures can be totally eliminated by explicit fields.

Historically, much of this waste, generated during the cold war, is contained in under ground storage tanks. Unfortunately, many of these tanks are showing signs of aging and fatigue. Subsequently, there is an aggressive DOE program directed at identifying existing technologies that can safely remove material from these facilities for storage in more stable environments. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), teaming with industry and other laboratories, has designed, developed, and integrated a remotely operated waste removal system. This manuscript describes this system as well as the modeling and simulation effort performed prior to system integration and operation. The modeling effort includes a novel dynamic model of multiple robots coupled by an elastic hose. The result of a simulation study, presented in the latter part of the manuscript, provides valuable insight into the operational strategies and limitations of the system. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Modeling; Simulation; Teleoperation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347599222

The development towards lower and lower temperatures of electron beams and the availability of brilliant beams of ions up to the highest charge states has opened up a precision atomic spectroscopy through the observation of resonances. The available technology also provides unique new access to very low electron-ion collision energies. There, typically below a few millielectronvolts, an unexpected enhancement is observed in the recombination of atomic ions with electrons. For U28+ ions, where such enhancement was seen for the first time, the measured rate coefficient is roughly a factor of 200 higher than expectation for radiative recombination. The experimental spectrum can be simulated by assuming dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances at very low energies. However, recombination enhancements are also observed with completely stripped ions where no DR resonances can occur. Systematic studies of dependences of the new phenomenon on ion charge state, electron density and temperature, and on external electromagnetic fields are being carried out. So far, however, a satisfactory understanding is still missing.","Field effects; Interference; Ionization; Rate enhancement; Recombination; Spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347507467

During heating the as-quenched Mg2(Ni,Y) alloys crystallize by three dimensional growth of quenched-in nanocrystals (with average size of 2-3 nm), embedded into the amorphous matrix, with an activation energy of 140±7 kJ/mol, which value coincides with the activation energy of Mg self-diffusion.

The influence of hydrogen on the thermal stability and crystallization of the melt-spun alloys was investigated. It was found that hydrogenation of the as-quenched amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys leads to a change in the crystallization mechanism during subsequent annealing, as the microstructure remains nanocrystalline even after heating up to 350°C.

The filling time of the accelerator waveguide structures is 1.3 μs. The large energy variations during the filling time due to transient beam loading are compensated for by a time delay of the RF power of some accelerator stations. In this way, the final energy spread can be minimized but along the accelerator large energy variations still exist. As a consequence the dispersive property of the accelerator mainly due to misalignments causes a substantial increase of emittance during the filling time. This effect showed to be dependent on the location of accelerator stations of which the RF power is delayed in time and on the beam focussing along the accelerator. A recipe has been developed to minimize the emittance increase. For this purpose computer simulations with a variety of alignment errors have been carried out for different beam focussing situations.

There are, however, compelling reasons to search for alternative routes of administration, especially in mass vaccination campaigns. Two key factors are (1) decreased stability of the vaccine upon reconstitution and, (2) the potential risks of contamination associated with needles. Dura has developed a unique inhaler that can deliver a powder dose via the pulmonary route for local or systemic action. The breath-actuated Spiros® inhaler uses electromechanical energy to aerosolize and deliver a consistent dose over a wide range of inspiratory flow rates. To achieve alveolar (deep lung) deposition for subsequent systemic absorption, dry- powder vaccine is size reduced to a mass median diameter between 1 and 5 μm. Small vaccine particles are blended with an inert carrier to improve dispersion. Measles vaccine formulated as a powder blend may be more thermostable than existing reconstituted formulations. The Spiros® technology is available in three powder storage platforms. Two of these formats are designed specifically for moisture and/or light sensitive compounds and may be particularly suitable for delivery of measles vaccines in mass campaigns because their design (1) eliminates the need for powder reconstitution, and (2) reduces the risk of contamination.","Aerosols; Dry powder inhalation; Measles vaccine","measles vaccine; aerosol; child; clinical trial; conference paper; drug delivery system; drug formulation; dry powder; human; infant; inhalation; inhalational drug administration; intramuscular drug administration; particle size; powder inhaler; priority journal; subcutaneous drug administration; thermostability; Administration, Inhalation; Aerosols; Humans; Measles Vaccine; Powders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344141391

The absence of warm garages and the above-average depreciation of automotive machinery, especially urban buses, force maintenance organisations to search for new ways to facilitate engine start-up in cold periods. In this work, a thermal accumulator (HS) working on the effects of absorption and rejection of heat energy at the solid-liquid phase-change of the heat storage substance is discussed. In the theoretical part, a numerical method for calculating heat storage and the characteristics of heat storage devices is described. The experimental part describes the laboratory installation simulating conditions for the working of the HS device and presents the results of laboratory experiments.

It is a special purpose experiment designed to precisely measure the CP violation parameters in the B-B~ system. Triggering poses special problems since the interesting events containing B-mesons are immersed in a large background of inelastic p-p reactions. We therefore decided to implement a 4 level triggering scheme. The LHCb data acquisition (DAQ) system will have to cope with an average trigger rate of ∼40 kHz, after two levels of hardware triggers, and an average event size of ∼100 kB. Thus an event-building network which can sustain an average bandwidth of 4 GB/s is required. A powerful software trigger farm will have to be installed to reduce the rate from the 40 kHz to ∼100 Hz of events written to permanent storage In this paper we will outline the general architecture of the trigger and DAQ system and the readout protocols we plan to implement. First results of simulations of the behavior of the event-building network implementations under the expected traffic patterns will be presented. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; High energy physics; Network architecture; CP-violation parameters; Data acquisition system; Event building; General architectures; Hardware trigger; Traffic pattern; Trigger and data acquisition system; Trigger rate; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343643860

These animals were used to study the effect of chemically treated wheat straw on methane production and energy balance. Wheat straw was treated either with urea (4 kg urea per 100 kg DM) with a storage time of 21 days (treatment I; control) or with urea (1.5 kg per 100 kg DM) without storage time (treatment II) or with urea plus calciUm hydroxide (3 kg urea plus 3 kg calcium hydroxide per 100 kg DM) with a storage time of 21 days (treatment III). All straws were fed ad libitum. The crude protein content of wheat straw during feeding was 7.8%, 7.9% and 7.6% in treatments I-III, respectively. Corresponding dry matter (DM) intake was 43.7, 34.9 and 49.5 g kg-1 W0.75, respectively which was significantly higher in treatment III than that of treatment II. The DM digestibility in treatments I (54.2%) and III (50.9%) was higher than that of treatment II (42.7%). The digestible energy (DE) intake that was measured in kJ kg-1 W0.75 d-1 was higher in treatments I (412) and III (471) than that of treatment II (282). Similar trend was observed in metabolizable energy (ME) intake. Methane production per kg digested organic matter (OM) per d was lower in treatments I (301) and III (291) than that of treatment II (461). The energy balance was measured in kJ kg-1 W0.75 d-1 in treatments I-III, respectively. The energy balance in treatments I (113) and III (170) was higher than that of treatment II (-40). It is concluded that treatment of straw with urea and/or a mixture of urea with calcium hydroxide followed by storage can improve digestibility compared to spraying with Urea Solution prior to feeding and also reduce methane production per kg digested OM and increase energy balance.","Calcium hydroxide; Energy balance; Methane production; Sheep; Urea; Wheat straw","Animalia; Ovis aries; Triticum aestivum; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343067098

One way to alleviate this problem is to store etectricity as thermal energy during off-peak hours and to discharge it during peak hours. In the present study, we examine the thermal behavior of two electric heating floor panels containing respectively water and n-octadecane paraffin in a concrete structure. In the first case, off-peak electricity is stored as sensible heat in the water and concrete, while in the second case it is primarily stored as latent heat in the paraffin. A transient one-dimensional model, validated analytically and experimentally, has been used for parametric studies which led to the choice of dimensions and operating characteristics for each panel. The one containing paraffin is more compact than that with water (134 mm thickness versus 152 mm), stores more energy (2880 kj·m-2 versus 2415 kj·m-2) and provides more comfort since the daily temperature fluctuations at its surface are less important (1.3 °C versus 3.8 °C). © Elsevier, Paris.","Energy storage; Heating panel; Latent heat; Numerical study; Phase change material",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141861103

Sixteen commercial crossbred barrows of about 68 kg BW were randomly allotted to one of four diets. The control diet was formulated using tapioca and rice as basal energy sources. In the other diets, tapioca was replaced by either coconut expellar, rice bran or beer by-product. The diets differed mainly in the amount and compostition of NSP. After a 12-day adaptation period, urine and faeces were collected separately in metabolism cages for 9 days. Urine and faeces from the first four days were used to analyse the nitrogen partitioning. Urine and faeces from the last 5 days were mixed as slurry. The slurry was sampled at the end of the collection period and again after 30 days storage, to analyse for nitrogen to calculate the losses. Increasing dietary NSP reduced urinary nitrogen and nitrogen losses from the slurry during storage. The pigs fed the diet based on beer by-product excreted the most nitrogen via faeces and the least nitrogen via urine.

When subsequently the absorber was withdrawn a significant number of UCN of higher energies emerged from the trap. Their appearance cannot be attributed to heating or cooling of residual UCN. Further experiments were performed to investi gate the origin of these UCN which we call 'late UCN'. We noticed that application of a magnetic field gradient at the trap wall as well as a replacement of Fomblin grease on the surface by Fomblin oil gave rise to small but measurable alterations of storage behavior.

In this study, cytometrical, histological and cytochemical investigations were performed in order to determine the behavior of megagametophyte nuclei during the reproductive cycle. Unexpected nuclear alterations due to a continuous process of nuclear fusion were observed in the megagametophyte, leading to polyploidization and consequently to intense food-reserve synthesis. During the free nuclear stage, the megagametophyte exhibited only sporadic nuclear fusion and limited food-reserve production. When cellularization took place, multinucleated compartments were observed in which nuclei fused, producing odd and even series of DNA contents as proved by flow-cytometric analysis. This polyploidization process considerably increased after fertilization and during embryo development, and was accompanied by increased food-reserve synthesis. During these later stages, fusion mainly involved nuclei of contiguous cells and was preceded by the disintegration of their adjacent walls. Miteses with incomplete phragmoplast differentiation were also observed to yield polyploid nuclei. Finally, in mature seeds the endosperm still exhibited multinucleate cells and fusion nuclei, and contained high amounts of storage products. The results are interpreted as an alteration of DNA contents in the megagametophyte cells in relation to specific metabolic activity during seed development.","Cupressus; Food reserve; Megagametophyte; Nuclear fusion; Polyploidization","cell fusion; fertilization; flow cytometry; megagametophyte; nuclear energy; phragmoplast; plant genetics; polyploidy; Cupressus sempervirens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040370225

It is shown that differences in the local stiffness of the phases in the glass transition regime of unfilled blends lead to characteristic deviations of the local strain from the external strain amplitude. These deviations are governed by a critical phenomenon due to the formation of a phase network above a critical blend ratio. As a result, a strongly nonlinear dependence of the glass transition maxima of the loss modulus on the volume fraction of the phases is observed. By counting the elastically effective bonds of the phase network, the local strain amplitude is estimated by purely geometrical arguments. Based on a consideration of the phase network, the distribution of carbon black in the different phases of filled blends is estimated from the height of the local maxima of the loss modulus in the glass transition regime. Thereby, a linear increase of the maximum value of the loss modulus with rising carbon black concentration is exploited that relates the enhanced energy dissipation of filled rubbers to the internal friction of the filler particles. Results on EPDM/BR/N550 blends indicate that carbon black is preferably located in the BR phase. A somewhat higher concentration of carbon black in the SBR phase is found in the case of NR/SBR(40% Styrene)/N330 blends.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040291992

Carbon dioxide injection under gas-hydrate-filled layers or under permafrost layers can realize the greenhouse gas mitigation and recovery of unused natural gas. Autogenous sealing of CO2 in deep and cool aquifers assures virtually complete and practically unlimited subsurface containment of CO2. Chemoautotrophs fix carbon dioxide in deep aquifers even without sun light. Methanogens can convert CO2 into methane in deep anoxic aquifers. Biogenetic restoration of subsurface hydrocarbon deposits is expected in CO2 injected aquifers after tens or hundreds of years. Microbiological recycling of CO2 in aquifers is an attractive future technology for energy-short countries such as Japan.

In either case, the impedance of the pinch discharge is increased, with the power delivered rising in the same proportion. A magnetically insulated cut is advantageous for three reasons: First, with the ion current comparable to the Alfvèn ion current, the pinch instabilities are reduced. Second, with the energy deposited into fast ions, a non-Maxwellian velocity distribution is established increasing the (σ ν) value for nuclear fusion reactions taking place in the pinch discharge. Third, in a high density z-pinch plasma, the intense ion beam can launch a thermonuclear detonation wave propagating along the pinch discharge channel. For larger cuts the soft x-rays produced by magnetic bremsstrahlung can be used to drive a thermonuclear hohlraum target.

It is ultimately based on G. I. Taylor’s 1934 theory of work hardening wherein he assumed that stress application causes the essentially instantaneous athermal generation of dislocation structures which are in equilibrium with the applied stress and which on stress release and reversal are stable up to the previously highest stress magnitude. As will be shown, at least in principle even though many details are still lacking, the following phenomena of crystal plasticity are readily explained by means of the LEDS theory: (1) the four stages of work hardening; (2) the shape of the stress-strain curve; (3) the temperature dependence of work hardening; (4) the low-temperature strain rate dependence of the flow stress; (5) the difference between ‘planar’ and ‘wavy’ glide materials (as exemplified by a-brass and copper respectively); (6) the empirical relationship D = KGb/r between dislocation cell size and flow stress; (7) grain-boundary hardening; (8) alloy hardening including solid-solution, precipitation and phase-boundary hardening; (9) slip lines and slip bands; (10) the evolution of the dislocation structures from stages I to IV; (11) deformation texture evolution; (12) work softening; (13) the thermodynamics of dislocation storage; (14) recovery, creep and recrystallization; (15) the development of dislocation structures in fatigue. All these are explained effortlessly on the basis of only the known properties of glide dislocations and the second law of thermodynamics, as expressed in the LEDS hypothesis, to wit that, among the structures which are in equilibrium with the applied tractions and accessible to the dislocations, those are formed which most nearly minimize the stored energy. (See Note added in proof at end of this paper.) The alternative ‘self-organizing dislocation’ model of crystal plasticity assumes plastic deformation to be due to individual thermally activated processes, which are treatable by the thermodynamics of energy-flow-through systems. It can be traced back to the early theory by R. Becker in 1925 and 1926 and still has to yield significant results. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040034701

An elementary ATES model is created, and the corresponding expressions are developed for efficiencies and for the quantities of energy and exergy that are injected and recovered. It is demonstrated that ATES performance measures based on exergy often are more useful and meaningful than those based on energy. Exergy efficiencies account for the temperatures associated with energy transfers to and from an ATES, as well as the quantities of energy transferred, and consequently provide a measure of how nearly ATES systems approach ideal thermodynamic performance. Energy efficiencies do not provide a measure of approach to ideal performance and, in fact, are often misleadingly high because some of the energy recovered can be at too low a temperature to be available for a useful purpose.",,"Aquifers; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Thermodynamics; Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) systems; Exergy; Geothermal energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039702707

The methodology uses physically based individual load models and an aggregation procedure that accounts for both statistical reference patterns of the energy service demand and for the random nature of load use. A simulation case study of electric water heaters fed by a single transformer station is presented, to illustrate the effects of load control. The proposed methodology presents the possibility of evaluating - both at individual consumer level and at system level -the impacts of load management (LM) on the quality of service provided, besides anticipating the impact on the system's load curve. It allows an effective design of LM programs through variables such as the number of different load shedding schedules and their frequency of use by the utility.

The migration of oxygen atoms from the matrix to the active centers occurs at a voltage below that expected for the LI2U free energy of formation. Polarization on charge is not due only to oxygen migration but also to metal rearrangement within the electrode material.

Information on the main advective and non-advective heat fluxes were collected during winter and summer periods in 1994 at a site near to a spring source on a tributary of the River Piddle, and at a station situated downstream on the River Bere. Inputs of heat energy were dominated by radiative fluxes, with net radiation receipt accounting on average for around 90% of the non-advective total in both summer and winter. Sensible heat (convective/conductive) transfer from the atmosphere was enhanced in the summer by the lower water temperature of these spring-fed streams, while relatively warm water temperatures during winter enhanced heat losses by evaporation, which was the dominant non-advective heat loss component in this season. Significant heat losses also occurred by sensible transfer and by back radiation. Summer measurements revealed that conduction of heat into the non-vegetated gravel bed of the River Piddle tributary was the dominant form of loss, but this output was strongly reduced in summer by weed cover on the bed of the River Bere. Considerable daily and diel variability was evident in non-advective heat flux components. Heat advected into the study reaches via precipitation was negligible, but groundwater inflows added to the heat storage of the water courses in both winter and summer. This effect was most marked at the headwater site and in the summer season because of lower streamflow discharge.

Experimental results reveal that the Ti49.25-x/2Ni50.75-x/2Vx (x = 0-4 at%) alloys exhibit a B2↔B19′ one stage martensitic transformation. The transformation temperatures will drop down about 10°C by adding 1-2 at% V due to the effect of solid-solution strengthening. There appear many (Ti,V)2Ni second-phase particles within the matrix of Ti47.75Ni49.25V3 and Ti47.25Ni48.75V4 alloys. The oxygen atoms in the matrix will be easily absorbed by the (Ti,V)2Ni second-phase particles to form the (Ti,V)4Ni2O oxide. This decreased oxygen content in the matrix will contribute to raise the transformation temperatures for both Ti47.75Ni49.25V3 and Ti47.25Ni48.75V4 alloys. The shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity of Ti49.25Ni50.75 alloys can be improved by the addition of 1-2 at% V due to solid-solution strengthening. The energy storage efficiency (E2/E1+E2) can also be increased by the addition of V. However, the Ti47.75Ni49.25V3 and Ti47.25Ni48.75V4 alloys exhibit a worse shape memory effect due to the formation of second-phase particles. The wear mechanisms of Ti49.25Ni50.75-x/2Vx alloys are found to be similar to those of TiNi binary alloys.

Temperature-programmed desorption experiments conducted in ultrahigh vacuum using small fluorinated ethers and fluorinated alcohols have measured their desorption energies and have provided insight into the nature of bonding between PFPEs and a-CNx films. Preliminary results indicate that ether linkages interact with a-CNx films through electron donation from the oxygen lone pair electrons. In contrast, alcohol end groups show evidence of hydrogen bonding with a-CNx films.

T., Stockholm, Sweden","As the demand for refrigeration and air-conditioning has increased during the last decade, district cooling systems have been introduced in some major European cities. In a district cooling system, the combination of central cooling facilities and cool storage systems provides economic advantages over older conventional cooling plants. A cool storage system can meet the same total cooling load as a non-storage system over a given period of time with a smaller chiller. Cool storage systems using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) have a low temperature range and high energy density in the melting solidification of PCMs compared to sensible heat storage. Thus they are advantageous in reducing the storage volume, heat loss, and size of the chilling equipment. In this paper we describe some paraffin waxes and their binary mixtures. We discuss the thermal properties of laboratory-grade tetradecane, hexadecane and their binary mixtures, and we demonstrate their potential for use as PCMs for cool storage. The thermal properties include freezing point, the heat of fusion, thermal stability and volume expansion during the phase change process. In the study, a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) was used to determine the heat of fusion of these materials and to generate thermal data for study and analysis. The results show that these materials are attractive candidates as potential PCMs for cool storage in district cooling systems. However, because of the high cost of laboratory-grade materials, technical-grade materials must be used for cool storage. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Binary mixtures; Differential scanning calorimetry; Freezing; Paraffin waxes; Refrigeration; Thermodynamic stability; District cooling systems; Hexadecane; Phase change materials; Tetradecane; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033513319

The longitudinal cross-sectional area of the nematode (Area), mean grey level (MGL) and perimeter of the nematode image (Perimeter) were measured automatically. Nematode samples having a range of sizes, mean dry weights and lipid contents, as well as a series of samples of different ages were examined. It was found that: i) the index Area x MGL correlates well with the mean dry weight of the nematode, which is in turn a good indicator of the total energy reserve of the nematodes; ii) MGL correlates well with the lipid content (as % dry weight) which is a good indicator of the quality of the energy reserve; and iii) the perimeter of the nematode image can be used to estimate the length of an IJ. Compared to currently available methods, such as direct measurement of mean dry weight or lipid content, computerised image analysis gives more information concerning the samples tested and enables variations in dry weight, lipid content, body size and length between individual IJ to be estimated readily.

This regime is also a function of pore size. We have calculated the overall hydrogen volumetric and gravimetric density within the framework of a typical high-pressure gas storage system. Within the regime of operating conditions where adsorptive storage seems attractive, the storage properties of hydrogen in a carbon nanotube system appear to fall far short of the targets of 62 kg of H2/m3 and 6.5 wt % H2 set by the Department of Energy. The computed gravimetric storage densities also fall short of those reported in the literature (Nature 1997, 386, 377).

Newly harvested wheat generally has poor milling and baking quality. However, after wheat is aged, the bran is easier to separate from the endosperm, flour extraction increases, and ash content drops. These improvements have been related to postharvest maturation and physical changes in the wheat kernel. On the other side of the milling process, freshly milled flour does not perform as well as flour that has been kept in storage. To address this issue, extra flour storage capacity is needed, or millers and bakers must add chemicals to their flours. Flour components change during aging. Aged soft wheat flour behaves similarly to chlorinated flour. Flour hydration rate and batter viscosity increase, and cakes have greater volumes without collapse. Aged hard wheat flour has higher water absorption, better mixing tolerance, and greater gas retention capability and produces bread with greater loaf volume.

The corresponding physical picture is that voltaic cells have two chemical-reaction-driven ""ion pumps"" and an internal resistance within the electrolyte. (These ion pumps can move electric charge; hence the historical terminology of ""electromotive force,"" or emf.) A correct physical picture for the ""seat of emf"" of a voltaic cell gives, not a ""volume pump"" (represented by a linear rise in voltage, as in many introductory physics textbooks), but two ""surface pumps"" (represented by two steplike jumps in voltage). Within this framework, some basic properties of voltaic cells are considered: their emf, maximum current, internal resistance, and energy storage. We also discuss some diffusion effects within voltaic cells, whose manifestations - but not origins - are well known when batteries are charged and discharged. Because of these diffusion effects, treating the electrolyte as an internal resistance is an oversimplification. © 1999 American Association of Physics Teachers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033443455

Hexamerins were originally described as storage proteins that provide amino acids and energy for non-feeding periods. However, in recent years other specific functions like cuticle formation, transport of hormones and other organic compounds, or humoral immune defense have been proposed. During evolution, hexamerins diversified according to the divergence of the insect orders. Within the orders, there is a notable structural diversification of these proteins, which probably reflects specific functions. In this paper, the different possible roles of the hexamerins are reviewed and discussed in the context of hexamerin phylogeny.","Arylphorin; Cuticle; Evolution; Hexamerin; Hexamerin receptor; Hormone transport; Immune response; Insect; Storage protein","evolution; functional role; insect; protein; Hexapoda; Insecta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033427129

Electroporation resulting from increased transmembrane potential is probably the main cause for membrane permeabilization. Equations are presented for this phenomenon. Results from several studies on the inactivation of microorganisms by pulsed electric fields are summarized in tables that relate the rate of inactivation to process conditions. The influence of three sets of parameters is discussed: 1) type and physiological state of the microorganism; 2) chemical composition and electrical resistivity of the microorganism-containing food or medium; 3) process conditions such as field intensity, duration and number of pulses, dissipated energy, final temperature, type of pulse and of treatment chamber. Data can be used to select conditions which produce a 5-6 log cycle inactivation for many yeasts or vegetative bacteria. Bacterial spores generally resist inactivation. Pulsed electric fields of relatively low intensity may be used to permeabilize larger cells from plant or animal tissues in order to facilitate the extraction of specific constituents or to increase the drying rate. Little is known concerning the possible chemical or physico-chemical modifications of food constituents by high voltage electric pulses. Some enzymes appear to be inactivated, even at low temperatures, while others are more resistant. The sensorial characteristics of a number of foods subjected to electric fields do not appear to be significantly altered. Potential food applications are numerous and mainly related to liquid foods (fruit juices, milk, sauces, liquid egg) or to pumpable food pastes (fruit or vegetable purées, minced meat, etc.). Both neutral and acidic foods are likely candidates. The main objectives of microbial inactivation by electric pulses are food sanitation and/or extension of chilled storage. The process should be nonthermal (maximum ΔT of ∼30°C) to preserve food freshness and quality. A low operating cost, estimated at 0.4-0.8 US cents per liter of food (capital investment not included) and continuous operation at high flow rate (>1000 L/h) represent significant industrial advantages for this new technology.",,"Bacteria; Bioelectric potentials; Chemical modification; Digital storage; Electric fields; Energy dissipation; Food processing; Food storage; Fruit juices; Fruits; Investments; Microorganisms; Physiological models; Chemical compositions; Continuous operation; Inactivation of microorganisms; Membrane permeabilization; Microbial inactivation; Physiological state; Pulsed electric field; Transmembrane potentials; Food microbiology; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033421662

This method, also known as dichromatic tomography, can be useful to visualize the distribution of heavy elements, such as actinides, without destroying the sample. One of the problems is to obtain a monochromatic photon beam of sufficiently high energy; the other is to have a way of recording these high-energy photons with a good spatial resolution. Here, the results of a first experiment on uranium mapping with synchrotron radiation are reported. Various natural and artificial samples of a few centimetres in size with uranium concentration between 0.008 g cm-3 and 2 g cm-3 were scanned using photon beams around 115 keV and a specially designed camera. The data were then analysed using a conventional fast reconstruction technique. This yielded excellent results with spatial resolutions down to 50 μm. For the first time it was shown that element-sensitive tomography using synchrotron radiation could be extended to the heaviest natural element. Therefore, in principle, the spatial distribution of any element can now be reconstructed using synchrotron radiation. Extension of this technique to very heavy elements can be important for geology, health physics and nuclear waste storage.","CCD camera; High-energy synchrotron radiation; Imaging; K-edge; Non-destructive analysis; Tomography; Uranium",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033420795

This couple creates and tends to rotate around an axis perpendicular to itself. The location of this axis may vary and depends upon the forces applied to the couple. As ligamentous tension increases in the couple, the sacroiliac joints are drawn tightly together through a mechanism of self-bracing. Self-bracing and its normal release or diminution provides for the storage and release of energy, which enhances the efficiency of normal ambulation and which modifies external forces. Failure of the force couple causes failure of the transverse axis of rotation of the sacroiliac joint and failure of the self-bracing mechanism. Because of the decrease in friction and stability, the innominate bones rotate anteriorly on the sacrum on an acetabular axis with the onset of pain and an alteration in apparent leg length. The resultant dysfunction may range from slight to severe, from minor ligamentous sprains to major sprains, muscle separations, and rents in the joint capsule.

We chose populations representative of the climatic extremes of the species' distribution, within these areas of overlap. Niveoscincus ocellatus maintains the same basic reproductive strategy in both populations: summer gestation, primary autumn mating with obligate sperm storage by females, secondary mating in spring, and predominantly spring vitellogenesis and ovulation. In both populations all females reproduce annually, suggesting that reproductive frequency is not constrained by availability of energy. However, we found distinct differences in the timing of ovulation and parturition. Females from our subalpine site ovulated approximately one month later than those from our warmer, lowland site; parturition was delayed by the same period so gestation length was unchanged. The delay in ovulation results in gestation proceeding over the warmest months at the cold site.

N1G 2W1, Canada","Soil microbial biomass (SMB) measurements are often used in soil biological analysis; however, their interpretation can be problematic. In this review, both the limitations and benefits of indirect (both CHCl3 fumigation incubation and fumigation extraction, and substrate-induced respiration) SMB measurements are outlined, along with their value and interpretation as attributes or indicators to assess some soil quality (SQ) functions (e.g., enhance plant growth, maintain aggregation, regulate energy) for mainly humid, temperate soils, with specific emphasis on research conducted in eastern Canada and New Zealand. Indirect SMB methods are subject to limitations analogous to 'soil test' procedures (e.g., soil sampling and handling, water content, storage prior to treatment), and also the difficulties with establishing an acceptable 'control' and fraction (i.e., k value) of SMB mineralized or extracted. In many cases, such limitations present a need for some degree of standardization (e.g., pre-conditions of 7-to 10-d incubation at 25°C and-0.001MPa water potential) prior to SMB measurement. However, for SQ assessment, where 'comparative' rather than 'absolute' values of SMB are often of interest, use of commonly derived k values seem appropriate for surface soils. Soil ecological factors govern SMB and often underlie much of the spatial and temporal variation in SMB. Plant species composition, mainly through net primary productivity and litter quality, can affect SMB measurements along with trophic cascades in soil, where interactions among soil organisms can influence microbial activity. Benefits of SMB measurements relate mainly to the assessment of both soil C turnover and management induced changes in organic matter. The combination of SMB and δ13C to elucidate the transformations and fate of organic C in cropping and soil management systems has also shown that both temporal and spatial redistribution of C inputs, and soil type (i.e., particle size distribution) are dominant factors in turnover and nutrient flow through the SMB. For SQ assessment, SMB is not a useful indicator for the function of soil as a 'medium for plant growth' in regard to plant productivity for intensively farmed temperate soils. For the function of soil to 'maintain aggregation', where SMB is one agent only of a multi-faceted process, the relationship between SMB and soil aggregation is not always present and tends to be site-specific. In regard to the 'regulate energy' soil function, SMB is related to some degree with decomposition and mineralization processes. The main role of SMB for SQ assessment is to serve within a minimum data set of other indicators (e.g., macroorganic C) to monitor soil organic C storage and change.","Humid climate; Soil microbial biomass; Soil quality","biomass; humid environment; microbial community; soil quality; temperate environment; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033392204

Cold and heat tolerance were negatively correlated among the study species: D. curviceps was the most tolerant to cold but the least tolerant to heat, D. albomicans was the least tolerant to cold but the most tolerant to heat, and D. immigrans had intermediate tolerance to cold and heat. In these species, the percentages of monoenoic acids in phospholipids generally increased but the percentages of dienoic acids decreased with the enhancement of cold tolerance. Concomitantly, the percentage of fatty acids containing 16 carbon atoms increased, while that of fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms decreased. It is considered that these changes in fatty acid composition play important roles in the acquisition of cold tolerance in these Drosophila species. In the species studied, triacylglycerols were major energy reserves. The concentration of triacylglycerols and the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in triacylglycerols were slightly higher in the subtropical species than in the temperate species. In addition, lower rearing temperature elevated the degree of unsaturation of triacylglycerols in D. albomicans, but did not in D. curviceps and D. immigrans. Thus, the notion that insects adapted to cooler climates have a mechanism to lower the transition temperature of triacylglycerols does not fit for these species.","Cold and heat tolerance; Drosophila; Energy storage; Phospholipids; Triacylglycerols","Diptera; Drosophila albomicans; Drosophila albomicans; Drosophila curviceps; Drosophila curviceps; Drosophila immigrans; Drosophila immigrans; Drosophilidae; Hexapoda; Insecta; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033375597

Urine samples from the entire diabetic group showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in IPG A-type, and a fall in the IPG P-type: IPG A-type ratio relative to the control group. Subdivision of the diabetic patients into lean IDDM and obese NIDDM groups revealed significant differences in the IPG P-type:IPG A-type ratio between these groups, this ratio decreasing with increases in the body mass index (BMI). Analysis of the relationships among IPGs and HbA1, blood pressure, and BMI indicated that a fall in the IPG P-type:IPG A-type ratio correlated with a rise in the HbA1 (indicative of impaired glycemic control), with increased systolic blood pressure and increased obesity, all factors linked to Syndrome X. There was a parallism between the profile of the IPG P-type:IPG A-type ratio and the well-established pattern of insulin resistance and BMI. In vitro studies of the effects of alterations in the IPG P-type:IPG A-type ratio on the activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH complex) at the PDH phosphatase reaction demonstrated that IPG A-type forms antagonized the stimulation of the PDH phosphatase by IPG P-type forms, thus having a negative effect on the conversion of PDH to the active, dephosphorylated, form. This observation could provide a mechanism whereby the shifts in the IPG P-type:IPG A-type ratio reported above could change the metabolic pattern from one directed to glucose oxidation to one more directed toward energy conservation and lipid storage.","Blood pressure; Diabetes; HbA1; Inositol phosphoglycans; Lipogenesis; Obesity; Pyruvate dehydrogenase; Syndrome X","hemoglobin A1c; insulin; phosphatidylinositide; pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase; adult; aged; article; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; diabetes control; diabetic obesity; disease association; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; glucose oxidation; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; isomer; lipid storage; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; phosphoinositide metabolism; priority journal; syndrome X; systolic blood pressure; urine level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033372658

The jumping and swimming performance of Rana temporaria was analyzed at 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C. Muscle fiber bundles were isolated from lateral gastrocnemius and subjected to the length and activation patterns thought to occur in vivo. As temperature increased, locomotor performance in R. temporaria improved with a Q10 of 1.2 for both jump take-off velocity and mean swimming velocity. The slope of the relationship between performance and temperature (TE) was similar for both locomotor parameters and was described by the equation z-scores of locomotor performance = 0.127 x TE -1.585. Although some frogs performed better than others relative performance was affected by locomotor type and temperature. Locomotor performance improved with temperature as the power required during take-off and the mean muscle power output increased with Q10 values of 1.7 and 1.6 respectively. The mean muscle power output during take-off was only 34% of the calculated requirements for the whole animal, suggesting the involvement of elastic strain energy storage mechanisms.","Locomotor performance; Muscle fibre; Power; Thermal sensitivity","Rana temporaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033372457

In order to better determine the nature of this direction reversal and the manner in which it is generated, we used a high energy microbeam coupled to a monochrometer to irradiate specific areas of moving diatoms. When the leading end of moving Craticula cuspidata (Kützing) D.G. Mann cells were irradiated with a 1–3 s exposure of high irradiance (about 500 to 2000 μmol photons m−2 s−1), they quickly reversed their direction (100% of cells tested), while unirradiated control cells rarely changed direction. Similar irradiation of the trailing half of the cell caused no change in direction, but greatly reduced the effect of a subsequent irradiation of the leading half. Using a monochrometer to vary the wavelength of irradiation and a shutter to adjust the exposure time, the irradiation time needed to induce a direction change in 50% of the cells (I50) was determined for each of five wavelengths. Concurrent measurement of the energy output of the light source at each wavelength showed the most efficient wavelength to be 500 nm, close to the wavelength previously determined to be most effective in inducing a direction change at low light level light/dark boundaries in C. cuspidata. By adjusting the area of irradiation to a small spot size, we compared the effectiveness of irradiating cells at the tip, middle, and edge of the leading half of the cell. While irradiations at the tip of moving cells still resulted in 100% of cells changing direction, irradiating the edge (where the chloroplast was located) or the middle of the leading half (near the cytoplasmic storage granules) had greatly reduced effect. Such evidence suggests that phototaxis in C. cuspidata requires a photodetection system that is most sensitive to approximately 500 nm light and is located at the tips of the cells. © 1999 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"diatom; irradiance; motility; phototaxis; Craticula cuspidata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033372102

These studies, using the same 2 sets of rats, show that chronic cold also interacts with B and testosterone on signals of energy balance. The two groups of rats differed in weight by 20% and in age by 2 weeks (44-59 days of age). Adrenalectomized rats, replaced with varying doses of B, were exposed to cold or served as controls. Food intake and body weight during the experiments and hormones, metabolites and fat depots were measured on day 5. B, but not cold, affected food intake in the younger rats; by contrast, cold, but not B, affected food intake in the older rats. Testosterone was higher in older control rats and was markedly depressed by cold; younger rats had lower testosterone that was minimally affected by cold. Weight gain decreased in all rats at room temperature with increasing B, whereas they all lost weight in cold independently of B. Cold stimulated and B inhibited interscapular brown adipose tissue DNA content (reflecting sympathetic stimulation of thermogenesis). B stimulated insulin, whereas cold inhibited leptin and insulin; B also increased white adipose tissue weight gain in controls and inhibited its loss in cold. Leptin was unrelated to white adipose tissue depots in older control rats but was strongly related to these stores in younger rats and in all rats in cold. We conclude that: 1. By decreasing signals that act centrally to inhibit food intake (insulin, leptin and testosterone) cold allows B to stimulate food intake; 2. B inhibits weight gain although it causes accrual of fat; 3. Cold, probably through sympathetic stimulation of white adipose tissue, causes fat loss which is modulated by the inhibitory effect of B on sympathetic outflow; and, 4. The slope of the relationship between fat depot size and leptin becomes flatter in cold, possibly because of increased sympathetic outflow to these depots.","Adipose depots; Body weight; Insulin; Leptin; Testosterone","corticosterone; DNA; insulin; leptin; adrenalectomy; age; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body weight; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; cold stress; controlled study; DNA content; energy balance; energy expenditure; hypothalamus hypophysis system; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; priority journal; puberty; rat; thermogenesis; weight gain; weight reduction; white adipose tissue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033367702

It was speculated that removal of cytosolic pyrophoshate would impair sucrose utilization during storage of potato tubers and thereby prevent tuber sprouting. To explore this hypothesis Solanum tuberosum var. Desiree plants were transformed with a chimeric PPa gene. Following Agrobacterium mediated transformation, metabolite and carbohydrate contents of growing and stored tubers were measured. There was a large accumulation of soluble sugars and a decrease of starch at all developmental stages investigated. The PPase activity in PPaII tubers was parallel with a decrease of PPa, an increase of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and an increase of UDP-glucose. As expected the amount of hexose-6-phosphates and glycolytic intermediates decreased. As a consequence PPaII tubers did not sprout even after a prolonged storage period of two years. Since the energy status of PPaII tubers is unaltered inhibition of sprouting is most likely due to reduced sucrose export and its subsequent utilization.","Potato tuber; Pyrophosphate; Sprouting; Transgenic plants","chimeric gene; cytosol; enzyme activity; fructose 2,6 bisphosphate; genetic transformation; growth inhibition; inorganic pyrophosphatase; plant growth; transgenic plant; uridine 5' diphosphate; Agrobacterium; Agrobacterium; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; Rhizobium; Solanum tuberosum; Solanum tuberosum; Tuberosum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033366801

In this work, we propose, implement, and evaluate a series of run-time techniques for dynamic analysis of the program instruction access behavior, which are then used to proactively guide the access of the L0-Cache. The basic idea is that only the most frequently executed portions of the code should be stored in the L0-Cache since this is where the program spends most of its time.

It selectively stores normal or inverted data so to reduce the total number of accessing bits different from the precharging value. In this way, bitline toggling during memory access is minimized and this ultimately contributes to a reduction in power consumption.

The loop cache controller knows precisely whether the next instruction request will hit in the loop cache, well ahead of time. As a result, there is no performance degradation.",,"Buffer storage; Control systems; Energy conservation; Loop caches; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033359006

This latter is basically a regenerative gas cycle operating on CO2 as the working fluid and using O2 as the fuel oxidizer in the combustion chambers. The cycle uses the highest temperatures and pressures compatible with the most advanced materials in the steam and gas turbines and in the heat exchangers. In addition, a reheat and a staged compression and with intercooling are used. Therefore the optimized cycle efficiency is around 45% when operating on natural gas. A big asset of the system is its ability to remove the CO2 produced in the combustion process in liquid or supercritical state and at high pressure, without any costly and energy consuming system like 'end-of-pipe' MEA scrubbers or membranes. CO2 is then ready for transportation, for reuse or for final storage. In this respect, there is a possible integration of the CO2 storage with the MATIANT power generation plant, unlike conventional CO2 capture, providing gaseous CO2 at atmospheric pressure. In the same way, other contaminants like NOx remain under control and are not released to the atmosphere. In this study, the cycle performances are calculated and a sensitivity analysis of the cycle is performed when the free parameters are varied. The optimal design point is then obtained for given internal constrains and boundary conditions.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Combustion; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; High pressure effects; High temperature operations; Oxides; Reheat cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon dioxide cycles; Carbon dioxide removal; Oxide combustion; Zero carbon dioxide release; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033357515

Requiring power-on-demand from an energy system powered by intermittent or seasonal sources may necessitate one-month's energy storage - an expensive proposition using conventional storage technologies. If multiple energy storage devices with complementary performance characteristics are used together, the resulting `hybrid energy-storage system' can dramatically reduce the cost of energy storage over single storage systems. The coupling of conventional storage batteries with emerging hydrogen technologies provides one such hybrid system. Hydrogen energy storage in this context includes an electrolyzer, hydrogen storage tank, and a fuel cell. An additional component that must be considered is the control system that determines when the various components are used. Since the control system has an effect on component sizes and thus system and operating costs, the control algorithm must be carefully considered for any system with energy storage. For this study, a time-dependent model of a stand-alone, solar powered, battery-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system was developed to investigate energy storage options for cases where supply and demand of energy are not well matched daily or seasonally. Simulations were performed for residential use with measured solar fluxes and simulated hourly loads for a site at Yuma, Arizona, USA, a desert climate at 32.7 N latitude. Renewable-based power not needed to satisfy the load is stored for later use. Two hybrid energy-storage algorithms were considered. The first is a conventional `state-of-charge' control system that uses the current state of the storage system for control. The second control system presumes knowledge of future demand through a feed-forward, neural net or other `intelligent' control systems. Both algorithms use battery storage to provide much of the daily energy shifting and hydrogen to provide seasonal energy shifting, thus using each storage technology to its best advantage. The cost of storing energy with a hybrid energy-storage scheme was found to be much less expensive than either single storage method, with a hybrid system storage costing 48% of the cost of a hydrogen-only system and only 9% of the cost of a conventional, battery-only system. In addition, the neural-net control system is compared to a standard battery state-of-charge control scheme, and it is shown that neural-net control systems better utilize expensive components and result in less expensive electric power than state-of-charge control systems.",,"Algorithms; Control system analysis; Cost effectiveness; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Feedforward neural networks; Optimization; Solar energy; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033350763

Initially operated in a parasitic mode at the NIST electron synchrotron, the facility was converted into the SURF II electron storage ring in 1974. Since then, SURF II has been the United States national standard of irradiance in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral region, but the radiometric accuracy of SURF II was limited by the uniformity of the magnetic field encountered by electrons as they traversed their orbit. Variations of up to 0.5% limited the knowledge of the local bending radius at any tangent point and restricted the accuracy of the irradiance calculations. To improve the radiometric accuracy of SURF, an entirely new magnet structure was installed in the summer of 1998. The azimuthal uniformity of the SURF III magnetic field has been improved by a factor of 50 at 388 MeV and a factor of 25 at 260 MeV, allowing irradiance calculations to be made with much higher accuracy than SURF II could achieve. As an additional benefit, the use of improved magnet material, a smaller air gap between the poles, and new magnet windings has increased the magnetic field strength at the electron orbit, allowing SURF III to store electrons at energies as high as 400 MeV, compared to 300 MeV for SURF II. The higher electron energy will extend the usable range of radiation from SURF to shorter wavelengths, enabling experiments in the `water window' from 2.3 nm to 4.4 nm. We present here the major design goals and features of the SURF III magnet, the results of magnet field mapping and other measurements, and the facility performance to date.",,"Magnetic fields; Magnetic materials; Radiometry; Synchrotron radiation; Electron orbit; Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033347292

Betzig and coworkers (1992) demonstrated optical recording by an optical scanning microscope (NSOM) and suggested the possibility of tera byte data storage. One of the authors (K. Goto) proposed (1998) a tera byte optical memory system using a VCSEL array. One of the key issues in the proposed optical disk system is to realize an optical head consisting of a 2-dimensional VCSEL array. In near-field optics memory, there still remains the difficulty in getting a high output power efficiently from a sub-wavelength sized aperture. It is especially important to realize a high efficiency VCSEL for optical heads by reducing the total power consumption in arrays. We proposed a metal aperture VCSEL for producing near field light with high efficiency. In the study, we carried out a near field analysis of a micro-aperture VCSEL and present some basic process technologies for realizing the proposed device. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Near field scanning optical microscopy; Optical microscopy; Surface emitting lasers; Bragg cells; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Electromagnetic wave diffraction; Etching; Finite element method; Laser recording; Optical data storage; Scanning; Semiconducting films; High output power; Near field analysis; Near field optics; Near-field optical data storage; Optical disk system; Optical scanning microscope; Process Technologies; Total power consumption; Optical data storage; Semiconductor lasers; Distributed Bragg reflector; Focus ion beam etching; Gold film; Micro aperture surface emitting laser; Optical scanning microscope; Phase matching; Vertical cavity surface emitting laser",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033346994

Its architecture is reviewed to provide a better understanding of the impact of single event upset (SEU) on the device during operation, The SEU effect of different memories available on the device is evaluated. Heavy ion test data and SPICE simulations are used integrally to extract the threshold LET (linear energy transfer). Together with the saturation cross-section measurement from the layout, a rate prediction is done on each memory type. The SEU in the configuration SRAM is identified as the dominant failure mode and is discussed in detail. The single event transient error in combinational logic is also investigated and simulated by SPICE. SEU mitigation by hardening the memories and employing EDAC (error detection and correction) at the device level are presented. For the configuration SRAM (CSRAM) cell, the trade-off between resistor de-coupling and redundancy hardening techniques are investigated with interesting results.

This scheme uses a switchable architecture that allows HDTV decoding with scalable memory reduction ratios. Depending on the input format and the amount of available memory, the scheme performs 1/4 or 1/2 memory reduction or no memory reduction. The 1/2 memory reduction is achieved by performing a block-based Hadamard transform followed by appropriate scalar quantization. The Hadamard transform has good signal energy compaction and a low computational cost. Appropriately designed nonuniform scalar quantizers take advantage of the statistics of the Hadamard transform coefficients and compress the data to match the 1/2 memory reduction target. The 1/4 memory reduction is achieved by 1/2 horizontal decimation followed by the 1/2 memory reduction scheme. Experimental results show that the proposed memory reduction schemes achieve good performance at very low computational cost, which makes them very attractive for digital TV applications.",,"Algorithms; Computer architecture; Data reduction; Decoding; Digital television; High definition television; Image compression; Mathematical transformations; Signal to noise ratio; Statistical methods; Switching networks; Hadamard transform; Memory reduction scheme; Scalar quantization; Storage allocation (computer)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033343373

Yellow perch were stocked immediately postspawning and subsamples were sacrificed at 5 and 11 months to measure indicators of energy storage and utilization. These indicators included survival, age, spawning periodicity, condition factor, gonad size, fecundity, and liver size. Indicators generally showed patterns consistent with improved energy storage and utilization in the experimental pond yellow perch as compared with yellow perch in the lake from which the stocked fish originated. This was evidenced by increased gonad size, condition factor, and liver size and the disappearance of spawning periodicity. The patterns observed in experimental ponds suggest improved resource availability and (or) reduced intra- and interspecific competition. Yellow perch physiological indicators were also compared with those measured at several remote natural lakes in the area. Fisheries parameters measured in yellow perch from the experimental ponds generally fell within the range of those found in natural lakes.",,"oil sand; percid; physiological response; pond; population characteristics; restoration ecology; water quality; Perca flavescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033341627

Institute of Technology, ETH Zentrum, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","A future alternative for generating winter electricity is the seasonal storage of surplus summer electricity in the form of chemically bound hydrogen in liquid organic hydrocarbons using the MTH-system (Methylcyclohexane-Toluene-Hydrogen). This paper compares the economics of the MTH-system with the conventional production of electricity from fossil fuel sources. Based on numerical modelling of the individual plants, simulations of several design alternatives of the MTH-system were performed for 1000 GWh of stored summer electricity and 80 MW output. The overall efficiencies ηtot and the economic results of these simulations are ηtot = 0.40 and 0.26 $/kWh for the MTH-SOFC system alternative, ηtot = 0.33 and 0.30 $/kWh for the MTH-MCFC and ηtot = 0.25 and 0.36 $/kWh for the MTH-system with gas and steam turbines. Compared with the cost of electricity production using fossil fuels (0.05-0.1 $/kWh), the electricity produced by the MTH-system is expensive. Therefore an economic comparison including an assumed carbon tax was made to account for a possible scarcity of energy or the environmental impact due to the use of fossil energy resources. It concludes that the MTH-system is not competitive for the levels of carbon tax under discussion, but compares with options for providing electricity from new renewables. Due to the disparities in economics and carbon taxes, a best case study of the MTH-system was made to reduce its economic disadvantages. This results in a maximum efficiency of the MTH-system of 0.48 with corresponding winter electricity costs of 0.17 $/kWh.",,"Cost effectiveness; Electric energy storage; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Methylcyclohexane-toluene-hydrogen; Seasonal storage; Synthetic fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033339982

To reduce contention on the limited bandwidth of the wireless channels, frequently accessed data are cached at the mobile clients. However, maintenance of the cache consistency is complicated by the mobile clients' frequent disconnection to conserve energy. One promising approach in the literature is for the server to periodically broadcast invalidation reports from which clients can salvage their cache content that are still valid. This mechanism is, however, not energy efficient as clients are expected to examine the entire invalidation report. In this paper, we reexamine the cache coherency problem and propose three novel cache coherency schemes. While these schemes are based on periodic broadcast of invalidation reports, they allow clients to selectively tune to the portions of the invalidation report that are of interest to them. This allows the clients to minimize the power consumption when invalidating their cache content. We conducted extensive studies based on a simulation model. Our study shows that the proposed schemes are not only effective in salvaging the cache content that are still valid (and hence result in lower access time), but are also efficient in energy utilization. While none of the proposed algorithms is superior in both the access time and energy efficiency, one of the schemes, Selective Cache Invalidation, provides the best overall performance.",,"Buffer storage; Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Database systems; Mathematical models; Mobile computing; Personal computers; Storage allocation (computer); Wireless telecommunication systems; Selective cache invalidation; Mobile radio systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033337241

To shorten the design turn-around-time, the methodology of abutting nine kinds of leaf cells is employed; two-level via-hole programming and the array-address decoder embedded in each control leaf cell present a divided-memory-array structure. A new squashed-memory-cell architecture using trench isolation and stacked-via-holes is proposed to reduce access times and power dissipation. To shorten the time for writing data, per-bitline architecture is proposed, in which every bitline has a personal writing driver. Also, read-out circuitry using a currentsense-type two-stage sense amplifier is designed. The effect of the non-multiplexed bitline scheme for fast read-out is shown in a simulation result. To reduce the noise from the second- to first-stage amplifier due to a feedback loop, current paths are separated so as not to cause common impedance.

In order to increase reliability and accommodate other uses of the injector, APS will run with electrons, eliminating the need for the PAR, provided another method of eliminating rf bucket `pollution' in the APS is found. Satellite bunches captured from an up to 30-ns-long beam from the linac need to be removed in the injector synchrotron and storage ring. The bunch cleaning method considered here relies on driving a stripline kicker with an amplitude modulated (AM) carrier signal where the carrier is at a revolution harmonic sideband corresponding to the vertical tune. The envelope waveform is phased so that all bunches except a single target bunch (eventually to be injected into the storage ring) are resonated vertically into a scraper. The kicker is designed with a large enough shunt impedance to remove satellite bunches from the injection energy of 0.4 GeV up to 1 GeV. Satellite bunch removal in the storage ring relies on the single bunch current tune shift resulting from the machine impedance. Small bunches remaining after initial preparation in the synchrotron may be removed by driving the beam vertically into a scraper using a stripline kicker operating at a sideband corresponding to the vertical tune for small current bunches.

A numerical simulator has been developed from the model. Using different combinations of wellbore and reservoir parameters, the simulator generated curve shapes that differed with wellbore thermal effects. Many of the curve shapes have been observed in the field. Using the results from this paper, engineers can distinguish the difference between general wellbore effects and reservoir behavior in the pressure data, which will make the interpretation more accurate. Also, with the help of the simulator developed from the model, engineers can effectively design gas well pressure buildup tests by running the simulator to determine the minimum time required to obtain the data not distorted by the wellbore effects. The governing equations of the wellbore model were based on mass, momentum, and energy balances for single-phase gas in one-dimensional space. The gas PVT correlation was also used. Different flow regimes (laminar, transitional, and turbulent) inside the wellbore are modeled for calculating the friction factor. As one boundary condition, a simple analytical reservoir model was connected to the wellbore model at the bottomhole using Duhamel's principle. Heat loss effects accounted for forced-convectional heat transfer inside the tubing, heat conduction between tubing and formation, natural convection and radiation heat transfer of annular fluid, and transient heat flow in the formation.

The storage capacity is represented by the stored pages and pixels in each page. Due to the 3-D nature of the holographic medium, many pages of data may be multiplexed by various methods. For optimal use of the dynamic range of the medium, various phase masks are used to uniform the Fourier spectrum. The design of these masks is based on statistical properties of the input pixels. But, the interpixel cross talk, which is dominated by the pixels within the same page, is difficult to reduce owing to the diffraction of the limited aperture size of the medium. In the paper, we expect the spectrum to be uniform and the reconstruction error to be minimal simultaneously. Therefore, we set the targets of the spectral distribution to be constant rho/f and the reconstructed amplitude rho/2 equal to the input rho/1. The desired rho/f should be chosen so that the energy of the spectral plane would be equal to that of the input plane. We can get the transform matrix between input and Fourier plane and between input and output. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Holography; Nonvolatile storage; Pixels; Computer simulation; Diffraction; Diffraction gratings; Fourier optics; Holograms; Holography; Light modulation; Random processes; Statistical methods; Holographic data storage; Input and outputs; Limited aperture; Reconstruction error; Spectral distribution; Statistical properties; Storage capacity; Transform matrices; Digital storage; Optical image storage; High diffraction efficiency; Holographic data storage; Optimized phase mask",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033326612

All interesting parameters of the new readout system like pulse-sequencing and power-up and -down are completely controlled by a front-end system with the help of hardwired interpreters getting their programs from a supervising PC. For adaptation of other CCD devices and optimisation, these parameters can be changed interactively by the PC operator. Coupling of the front-end system to the computer is done via a fiber optic link with PCI bus-interface.

The careful design and synthesis of covalently linked nanoscopic molecular assemblies consisting of three or four porphyrin units are described. The critical choice of the different porphyrin units in the assembly depend on the desired functionality, viz. molecular wire, charge-storage device or optoelectronic device. The presence of redox distinct porphyrin units in the assemblies confers wire- or charge-storage-like functionalities and of spectrally distinct porphyrin units in the assembly leads to optoelectronic devices. It is shown that a judicious combination of both these features can be incorporated into the molecular assembly that displays optoelectronic device-like functionalities.

Gas flow experiments were conducted on 3.8 cm diameter core plugs of these coals using xenon as the gas phase. Dual energy CT imaging technique was used to visualize the flow and storage of gas along the coal core to get qualitative and quantitative data from the images. After storage experiments end, nitrogen injection was performed to recover the stored gas from coal to represent an enhanced gas recovery operation. An analytical solution to this phase of one specific experiment was proposed to be able to calculate the diffusion coefficients from the gas recovery data calculated from CT images. The results of the experiments were analyzed to show the storage capacities of these two coals. The effect of different coal structures on the gas transport and storage and the matrix/fracture interactions were discussed by making a pixel based analysis and coupling it with the microstructure of coal investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results show that, if the coal is structurally heterogeneous in the sense that there will be different layers of mineral and organic matrix, there will be different zones that affect the storage and transport of gas. Due to these heterogeneities, gas recovery by nitrogen injection is not efficient at some regions. On the other hand, the coal that is more homogeneous has a higher storage capacity due to its microporous structure. In this coal, even if there are mineral fillings in the micropores, such mineral inclusions do not have an adverse effect on gas storage and transport as evidenced from CT images.",,"Coal; Computerized tomography; Diffusion; Flow of fluids; Flow visualization; Gas fuel storage; Imaging techniques; Microstructure; Natural gas well production; Nitrogen; Scanning electron microscopy; Xenon; Coal beds; Coal seams; Gas recovery; Microporous structure; Nitrogen injection; Natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033314976

This study examines our hypothesis that leptin has differential effects in regulating glucose utilization among the tissues, i.e. stimulating glucose utilization in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and skeletal muscle but suppressing glucose utilization in white adipose tissue (WAT) in normal male rats (275-350 g BW). The rats were treated with sc infusion of recombinant murine leptin (4 mg/kg·day) or vehicle (V) with Alzet osmotic pumps or with vehicle and pair-feeding (PF) for 7 days. Leptin significantly decreased food intake (leptin, 11.5 ± 0.4 g/day; V, 16.8 ± 1.5 g/day; P &lt; 0.05) and body weight (maximum change, 5.0 ± 0.2%; P &lt; 0.05 vs. V) and lowered plasma triglyceride, insulin, and glucose levels, but raised β-hydroxybutyrate levels. Glucose utilization by individual tissues was determined with an iv bolus of [1-14C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) after a 90-min hyperinsulinemic (2 mU/kg·min) euglycemic clamp. With leptin treatment, the 2-DG-determined glucose utilization in interscapular BAT was almost 3-fold that in V-treated rats and 70% greater than that in PF rats. In contrast, in the epididymal WAT, glucose utilization was reduced by leptin treatment to only 34% that in V-treated rats and 45% that in PF rats. Leptin increased 2-DG uptake by extensor digitorum longus muscle and soleus muscle compared with that in the V and PF groups. With leptin treatment, the GLUT4 glucose transporter mRNA and protein levels were increased in BAT, but decreased in WAT (both P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant change in GLUT4 mRNA and protein expression in extensor digitorum longus muscle and soleus muscle. Oxygen consumption was significantly increased (32.1 ± 7.4%) in BAT (139.0 ± 8.2 nmole O2/30 min·106 cells) of leptin-treated rats vs. that in V control rats (105.3 ± 6.7 nmole O2/30 min·106 cells). In conclusion, leptin has differential, tissue-specific effects on glucose and oxygen utilization, which contribute to the reduction in whole body adiposity by enhancing energy consumption in BAT and muscle while attenuating energy storage in WAT.",,"fluorodeoxyglucose; glucose; glucose transporter; leptin; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; glucose homeostasis; glucose transport; glucose utilization; hormonal regulation; male; muscle metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033306791

In a second experiment, forearm skeletal muscle metabolism was studied during a standardized infusion dose of ISO (19 ng/kg fat-free mass·min). During β-adrenergic stimulation there was an increased carbohydrate oxidation (at an ISO infusion dose of 24 ng/kg fat-free mass·min, 31% vs. 21% of total energy expenditure; P < 0.05) and a decreased fat oxidation (51 vs. 62 of total energy expenditure; P < 0.05) in older compared to young subjects.

Colchicine injected in the DMN did not cause obesity but altered feeding and the normal relationship between leptin, fat, and insulin, suggesting that blockade of signals, for example, from the lateral hypothalamus to DMN may disinhibit the normal medial hypothalamic drive to decrease energy stores. Changes in caloric efficiency with time after colchicine injections suggest that rats with both ARC and PVN disruption respond to signals of obesity, whereas rats with VMN disruption do not. These studies distinguish among functions in the four medial hypothalamic nuclei and suggest that interactions among them normally serve to regulate energy balance through alterations in food acquisition and storage.",,"insulin; leptin; animal experiment; arcuate nucleus; article; controlled study; energy balance; food industry; hypothalamus; hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus; light dark cycle; male; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; thalamus midline nucleus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033304973

In addition, performance requirements were also investigated that highlighted potential barriers and trade-offs for environmentally preferable alternatives. Sensitivity analyses, indicated that material production energy, postconsumer solid waste, and empty container costs were key parameters for predicting life-cycle burdens and costs. Recent trends in recycling rates, tipping fees, and recycled materials market value had minimal effect on the results. Inventory model results for life-cycle solid waste and energy indicated the same rank order as results from previously punished life-cycle inventory studies of container systems, Refillable HDPE and polycarbonate, and the flexible pouch were identified as the most environmentally preferable with respect to life-cycle energy and solid waste. The greater market penetration of these containers may be limited by performance issues such as empty container storage, handling requirements, and deposit fees for refillables, and resealability and puncture resistance for the pouch.","Life-cycle costs; Life-cycle design; Life-cycle energy; Milk packaging; Performance evaluation; Solid waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033304210

The normal thermic and hormonal responses to diet and environment are thought to contribute to the fine regulation of energy balance by modulation of the efficiency of energy utilization or storage [25]. In the obese phenotype, the declines in the above variables may be further complicated by the presence of long-standing insulin resistance, and by perturbations in the normal metabolism and action of thyroid hormones, particularly T3. These may further contribute, individually or in combination with other factors, to an enhancement of energy storage and thereby contribute to maintaining the obese state. Moreover, the effects of progressive increases in obesity further exacerbate the decline in the economy of energy utilization and storage. Thus the impact of these physiologic changes of aging and obesity may impart significant alterations on the efficiency of energy metabolism, which in turn may contribute to some of the pathophysiologic changes associated with longevity, and could influence nutritional indices in affected individuals. As nations become progressively more industrialized, the incidence of overweight conditions--including obesity, NIDDM, and related metabolic disorders--has been shown to become increased and, along with those changes, the metabolic and pathophysiologic sequelae related to those disorders become more common [6-8]. A greater understanding of mechanisms of impaired energy metabolism and energy balance in aging may provide new insight into the nutritional factors that may contribute to obesity in aging, their modulation, and the emergence of a longer, healthier lifestyle.",,"aging; animal; disease model; energy metabolism; hyperlipidemia; hyperphagia; insulin resistance; metabolism; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; rat; review; thermoregulation; Aging; Animals; Body Temperature Regulation; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Hyperlipidemias; Hyperphagia; Insulin Resistance; Obesity; Rats",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033301517

Work relating to the optimisation of the heat recovery part of the system is reported. Experimental investigation has shown a 1-kWchem laboratory-scale ammonia synthesis reactor to operate in a stable and repeatable manner. A two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous packed-bed catalytic reactor model previously used successfully for ammonia dissociation reactors is also confirmed to be valid for ammonia synthesis. Experiments were carried out in a closed-loop configuration and involved pressures from 9.3 to 19 MPa with internal peak reactor temperatures of up to 524°C and a constant mass flow of 0.3 gs-1. A simple adjustment of intrinsic rate parameters was required to calibrate the model and reproduce the experimentally observed effects of the variation of reactor wall boundary condition and operating pressure. The investigation revealed that thermal output strongly depends on reactor wall temperature and linearly increases with operating pressure. It is now possible to predict with confidence the performance of future reactor designs. The calibrated model can also be used for detailed theoretical examination of operating strategics designed to maximise thermal and exergetic output from heat recovery reactors. © Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Solar thermochemical energy storage system; Ammonia; Dissociation; Heat storage; Synthesis (chemical); Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033297132

The first application employs magnetic particles binding a biological effector, which is capable to recognize the target cells specifically. These cells become magnetic and can be sorted in a gradient of magnetic field. We describe first the various steps of the synthesis of a biocompatible ferrofluid and the grafting an effector protein onto the particles. We then describe the use of particles carrying annexin V in the separation and quantification of damaged erythrocytes in blood samples. This very sensitive technique can be used to follow the erythrocytes ageing of normal blood samples during their storage under blood bank conditions or to detect the membrane modifications that are associated with some pathologies such as malaria or Alzheimer's disease. The dependence of the magnetic susceptibility versus the frequency is a way to transform magnetic energy into thermal energy.

We have successfully applied physical vapor deposition technology to greatly increase capacitor energy density. The high dielectric breakdown strength we have achieved in alumina thin films allows high energy density to be achieved with this moderately low dielectric constant material. The small temperature dependence of the dielectric constant, and the high reliability, high resistivity, and low dielectric loss of AI2O3, make it even more appealing. We have constructed single dielectric layer thin film capacitors and shown that they can be stacked to form multilayered structures with no loss in yield for a given capacitance. Control of film growth morphology is critical for achieving the smooth, high quality interfaces between metal and dielectric necessary for device operation at high electric fields. Most importantly, high rate deposition with extremely low particle generation is essential for achieving high energy storage at a reasonable cost. This has been achieved by reactive magnetron sputtering in which the reaction to form the dielectric oxide has been confined to the deposition surface. By this technique we have achieved a yield of over 50% for 1 cm2 devices with an energy density of 14 J per cubic centimeter of A12O3 dielectric material in 1.2 kV, 4 nF devices. By further reducing defect density and increasing the dielectric constant of the material, we will be able to increase capacitance and construct high energy density devices to meet the requirements of applications in power electronics. © 1999 Materials Research Society.",,"Alumina; Capacitance; Dielectric films; Electric field effects; Magnetron sputtering; Multilayers; Permittivity; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor device structures; Sputter deposition; Thin film devices; Dielectric breakdown strength; High energy density capacitors; Ceramic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033279039

This structure has been explored by photoelectron diffraction experiments performed at the ALOISA beamline of the Elettra storage ring in Trieste (Italy). The modulation of the intensities of the two Sn components, caused by the backscattering of the underneath Ge atoms, has been measured as a function of the emission angle at fixed kinetic energies and vice versa. The bond angle between Sn and its nearest neighbor atoms in the first Ge layer (Sn-Ge1) has been measured by taking polar scans along the main symmetry directions and it was found almost equivalent for the two components. The corresponding bond lengths are also quite similar, as obtained by studying the dependence on the photoelectron kinetic energy with the photon polarization and the collection direction parallel to the Sn-Ge1 bond orientation (bond emission). A clear difference between the two bonding sites is observed when studying the energy dependence at normal emission, where the sensitivity to the Sn height above the Ge atom in the second layer is enhanced. The (3 × 3)-Sn/Ge(111) is thus characterized by a structure where the Sn atom and its three nearest neighbor Ge atoms form a rather rigid unit that presents a strong vertical distortion with respect to the underneath atom of the second Ge layer.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033274882

The effect of slice blanching in water and solutions of Na-, Ca-, and Mg-chlorides prior to frying, as well as the effect of storage time of the tubers prior to test were also studied. The deformation curves from a three point bending test were evaluated and Young's modulus (EM), maximum relative deflection (MRD), maximum tensile stress (MTS) and surface energy (SE) were determined. The MRD and MTS correspond to rupture point values of deflection and stress, respectively. The obtained results show that almost all test parameters (MTS is an exception) depend mainly on the blanching solution and the ratio of monovalent (K and Na) to divalent ions (Ca and Mg) in the crisps. Variety dependence was observed mainly in MRD and EM. An increase in the ratio monovalent over divalent cation concentrations led to lower MRD-and SE-values and at the same conditions to higher Young's moduli. EM-values of 320-340 MPa were obtained for the two varieties with higher content of starch (Javor and Panda) while for the two varieties with lower starch content (Agria and Nicola) values of 230-250 MPa were observed.

Information is stored in wave-like excitations which couple to neurons in the thalamus, with the wave-vectors of excitations representing spatial positions. This hybrid of neural and non-neural cognition may have fitness advantages over any purely neural mechanism - in information capacity, geometric accuracy, and fast selective retrieval. The wave excitations may be sustained on a Bose-condensed state of some excitation in the brain, by a mechanism like those investigated by Fröhlich, Umezawa, Vitiello and others. These states, being frictionless, can store information indefinitely at low energy levels, insulated from thermal noise, so are an ideal substrate for memory. If a Bose-condensed state is a 3-D representation of local reality, it may be the basis of phenomenal consciousness (which is also a model of local reality). The resulting theory of consciousness is highly constrained, and agrees well with the main properties of conscious experience. In this account, consciousness arises from a very simple state of matter, rather than from complexity; and it evolved to meet one of the strongest selection pressures on the brain.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033249169

The internal energy includes contributions from the strain energy, the latent energy, the interfacial energy and thermal energy. The entropy of the system includes the ""entropy jump"" associated with the phase transition. The role of the rate of mechanical dissipation as a mechanism for entropy generation and its importance in describing the hysteretic behavior is brought out by considering the difference between hysteretic and non-hysteretic (dissipation-less) behavior. Finally, simple linear or quadratic forms are assumed for the various constitutive functions and the full shape memory response is modeled. A procedure for the determination of the constants is also indicated and the constants for two systems (CuZnAl and NiTi) are calculated from published experimental data (see [2, 3]). The predictions of the theory show remarkable agreement with the experimental data.

This analysis compared long and short-winged morphs, which were derived from predominantly macropterous and brachypterous strains, and allowed to feed but not mate. For both sexes, the levels of TG on a dry weight basis in the long-wing form were 1.6 times higher shortly after adult eclosion for both sexes than those in the short-wing form. The ratios of TG content between the two wing-morphs increased to 2.8 times for females and 3.7 times for males two days after eclosion, the stage estimated to be the most adapted to migration. Thus the macropters apparently store considerably more fuels for flight than the brachypters. In female macropters, TG per dry weight decreased slightly during the pre-feeding period but returned to the initial level two to three days later due to feeding, possibly providing energy for migration. In contrast, TG level per dry weight in brachypters continuously declined, maintaining TG content per individual with gradual weight gain during this period, suggesting the storage of materials other than TG by feeding for ovarian development. In males, TG level declined more in brachypters than in macropters, possibly reflecting greater adaption for copulation in the former and migration in the latter. Fatty acid compositions of TG were essentially the same for both morphs and also both sexes at the time of adult emergence, but the composition in brachypterous males changed greatly after one to two days of adult life.","Flight fuel; Lipid; Nilaparvata lugens; Triacylglycerol; Wing dimorphism","Archaeorrhyncha; Nilaparvata lugens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033241055

Dietary manipulation is not a simple issue; increasing the dietary content of any specific nutrient alters the entire diet composition. High CHO diets are often low fat diets, hence changing the metabolism and storage of both fat and CHO. Acute CHO ingestion increases CHO oxidation and the ""spared"" fats are deposited as fat. Chronic high CHO ingestion (without an active lifestyle) leads to muscle becoming insulin-insensitive, adipose tissue processing CHO to fatty acids, and the liver increasing production of VLDL triglycerides. CHO ingestion prior to and during prolonged exercise can increase endurance. It has been suggested that moderate or low glycemic index forms be used prior to and during the exercise, but there is no consensus as to whether it should be a recommendation. The physiological nature of the regulation of CHO stores is poorly understood, but the recent identification of a key enzyme, glycogenin, and two forms of glycogen (pro- and macroglycogen) show promise of a deeper understanding.","Adipose tissue; De novo lipogenesis; Glycogen; Insulin; Liver; Triglyceride","body composition; carbohydrate diet; energy metabolism; exercise; fat intake; human; metabolism; physiology; review; Body Composition; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033210515

The idea behind this proposal is to overcome the major drawbacks of the previous solution (large oxygen consumption and re-design of the gas turbine unit), by means of a semiclosed cycle using air as the oxidizer. Consequently, combustion gases are largely diluted by nitrogen and cannot be simply compressed to produce liquefied CO2 for storage or disposal. However, CO2concentration remains high enough to make separation possible by a physical absorption process. It requires a re-pressurization of the flow subtracted from the cycle, with relevant consequences on the plant energy balance. The configuration and the thermodynamic performance of this plant concept are extensively addressed in the paper. As in the first part, the influence of the pressure ratio is discussed, but values similar to the ones adopted in commercial heavy-duty machines provide here acceptable performance. Proper attention was paid to the impact of the absorption process on the energy consumption. The resulting net overall efficiency is again in the 38-39 percent range, with assumptions fully comparable to the ones of Part A. Finally, we demonstrated that the present scheme enables the use of unmodified machines, but large additional equipment is required for exhausts treatment and CO2 separation.

A gradient of chemical composition and a gradient of surface free energy cause the transfer of reactive species between dark and illuminated areas. Contrary to conventional lithographic techniques that require wet chemical post-treatment to remove parts of the photoresist material, the fully self-processing character of this technique makes the record available in situ and immediately after exposure.",,"Crosslinking; Diffraction gratings; Free energy; Holograms; Interfacial energy; Lenses; Masks; Microoptics; Optical data storage; Optical materials; Photopolymerization; Relief microoptical elements; Photoresists",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033204877

The calpain, calpastatin, and cathepsin B + L activities and postmortem proteolysis in porcine longissimus muscle were studied. The muscle glycogen stores were depleted in five pigs by s.c. injection of epinephrine (.3 mg/kg) at 15 h antemortem and exercise on a treadmill (5 min, 3.8 km/h) immediately before slaughter. Antemortem injection of epinephrine and treadmill exercise resulted in higher ultimate pH (6.32 vs 5.66 in control) and decreased (P < .05) thaw loss, cooking loss, and shear force values. The muscle energy depletion treatment increased (P < .05) the muscle μ-calpain activity measured 42 min postmortem, and at 24 h μ-calpain activity was still approximately 50% greater in the high ultimate pH group. Also, as the ratio of μ-calpain to calpastatin increased (P < .01), the overall proteolytic potential of the calpain system were greater. These observations suggest that the muscle energy level may influence the activity of the calpain system in the living animal. The high ultimate pH group showed lower (P < .001) cathepsin B + L activity in the myofibrillar and the soluble fractions after 8 d of storage, suggesting that the increased ultimate pH increased the stability of the lysosomal membrane and thereby reduced the release of cathepsins from the lysosomes during storage. The SDS-PAGE showed increased (P < .001) degradation of a 39-kDa band in the epinephrine and exercise-treated samples. Degradation products at 30, 31, and 32 kDa were labeled by troponin-T antibody in western blot. An appearing 24-kDa band was identified as a troponin-I degradation product in western blot. The proteolytic degradation pattern of myofibrillar proteins during storage differed in control and treated samples, supporting the hypothesis that calpain-mediated proteolysis was affected after treatment, resulting in meat with high ultimate pH.","Calpain; Cathepsins; Epinephrine; Pigs; Proteolysis; Tenderness","Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; adrenalin; calcium binding protein; calpain; calpastatin; cathepsin; cathepsin B; cathepsin L; cysteine proteinase; glycogen; proteinase; animal; animal experiment; article; drug effect; energy metabolism; female; meat; metabolism; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; skeletal muscle; standard; swine; Animals; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Calpain; Cathepsin B; Cathepsins; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Endopeptidases; Energy Metabolism; Epinephrine; Female; Glycogen; Meat; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033191165

This basin, which is typical of many Greenland basins, is interesting because of the fast hydrological response to changing conditions. Due to the predominance of exposed bedrock surface and only minor occurrence of sediments and organic soils, there is little restraint to run-off, making the treatment of the snowmelt component of primary importance. Presently a conceptual modelling system, HBV, is applied in Greenland and also in most of the arctic regions of Scandinavia for operational forecasting. A general wish to use hydrological models for other purposes, such as to improve data collection and to gain insight into the hydrological processes has promoted interest in the more physically-based hydrological models. In this paper, two degree-day models, the Danish version of the physically-based SHE distributed hydrological modelling system (MIKE SHE) and the conceptual HBV model are compared with a new model that links MIKE SHE and a distributed energy balance model developed for this study, APUT. The HBV model performs the best overall simulation of discharge, which presently makes it most suited for general forecasting. The combination of MIKE SHE and APUT i.e. a physically based modelling system shows promising results by improving the timing of the initiation of spring flood, but does not perform as well throughout the remaining part of the snowmelt season. The modelling study shows that local parameters such as the snow depletion curve, the temporal snow albedo and perhaps also melt storage need to be more precisely determined from field studies before physically-based modelling can be improved.This paper compares the performance of a conceptual modelling system and several physically-based models for predicting runoff in a large hydrological basin, Tasersuaq, in west Greenland.

These bistable mechanisms, called “Young” bistable mechanisms, obtain their energy storage characteristics from the deflection of two compliant members. They have two pin joints connected to the substrate, and can be constructed of two layers of polysilicon. The pseudo-rigid-body model is used to analyze and design these mechanisms.

It is shown that the injection ratio is a less significant parameter compared to base conductivity modulation if it is necessary to estimate charge storage. Influence of substrate is investigated.

Thus, many farmers have used this system for a long time. On the other hand, design of surface irrigation systems including border irrigation requires many input parameters, and need intensive engineering calculations. The burden of these requirements probably led the users to experimental design of the systems with low efficiencies. However, accurate design and high quality optimization of the border irrigation system that can result in a highly efficient system is possible. In this study, an optimization model for border irrigation system is presented. The Hook Jeev's pattern search optimization method in conjunction with a general mathematical model of border irrigation is used to maximize the irrigation application efficiency. The border irrigation storage and distribution efficiencies, border slope and length, inflow rate, cutoff time, and the Manning's roughness coefficient are selected as constraints. The model is applied to field-measured data. The results show that it is possible to select a suitable combination of the border system's parameters (border's length, inflow rate, and cutoff time) to obtain a maximum application efficiency.An optimization model for border irrigation system is presented.

The metabolic pathways involved and their tissue distribution in different species, including man, are well known. The responses of lipogenesis to diet and to physiological and pathological states have been the subject of many studies. At a molecular level the major rate-controlling enzymes have been identified and their acute, and to a lesser extent chronic, control by hormones have been investigated extensively. However, there is no reason to suppose that all factors regarding lipogenesis have been identified (e.g. the recent discovery of acylation-stimulating protein). Little is known about the movement of newly-synthesized triacylglycerols in cells, either for secretion or storage. The production of leptin and tumour necrosis factor α by adipocytes provides a novel means of feedback control of triacylglycerol production, leptin by decreasing appetite and tumour necrosis factor α by inducing insulin resistance. The synthesis of these peptides appears to vary with the amount of triacylglycerol in adipocytes, but the molecular basis of this process is unknown. Elucidation of the signalling systems involved in the acute and chronic regulation of lipogenesis is also important, both with respect to some homeorhetic adaptations and also in some pathological conditions (e.g. non-insulin-dependent diabetes). Finally, molecular biology is revealing unexpected complexities, such as multiple promoters and different isoforms of enzymes (e.g. acetyl-CoA carboxylase; EC 6.4.1.2) exhibiting tissue specificity. Molecular biology, through . transgenesis, also offers novel and powerful means of manipulating lipogenesis. © Nutrition Society 1999.","Adipocyte; Lipogenesis; Triacylglycerol","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; lipid; triacylglycerol; acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase; adipsin; fatty acid; leptin; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipocyte; animal; biosynthesis; diet; energy metabolism; homeostasis; human; metabolism; review; adipocyte; conference paper; enzyme activity; lipogenesis; metabolic regulation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; protein secretion; tissue specificity; transgenic animal; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Adipocytes; Animals; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Humans; Lipids; Triglycerides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033170063

The mobility of the PFPE on the protective carbon overcoat of the media is widely accepted to be intimately coupled to the resulting tribological performance. The flow properties of molecularly thin films of nonpolar PFPEZ and polar PFPE Zdol fractions on solid surfaces were investigated by measuring the spreading profiles. The spreading of Zdol exhibits terraced profiles with the formation of a molecular foot, a shoulder and a vertical step. To describe these features of Zdol spreading, we measured the Zdol thickness dependence of the surface energy, which is then used to calculate the thickness dependence of the disjoining pressure. The polar component of the Zdol surface energy exhibits oscillations as a function of PFPE thickness. The resulting oscillations in the disjoining pressure can be used to qualitatively describe the origins of terraced spreading. The characteristic Zdol spreading profile and surface energy oscillations of Zdol are attributed to molecular layering induced by polar interactions between the Zdol end-groups and the surface. © 1999 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Magnetic data storage system tribology; Perfluoropolyether; Surface energy, surface films/coatings","Hard disk storage; Interfacial energy; Magnetic recording; Magnetic thin films; Oscillations; Polyethers; Tribology; Perfluoropolyether; Spreading profiles; Surface films; Solid lubricants; lubricant; magnetic disc; perfluoropolyether; surface film",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033165590

The general objective was to determine weak points from the operating experience and measured data obtained, to model the system in a component-oriented manner for simulation, to energetically optimize the plant, to achieve high operational reliability and, above all, to propose and implement cost-reducing and advanced system modifications. With the aid of validated simulation programs, it was possible to carry out optimization analyses for plant operation (annual scenarios) and plant configuration.

Two groups (n = 6) of Thoroughbred fillies were trained at high-intensity on a high-speed equine treadmill for 5 months (short-term study) or 18 months (long-term study). Age-matched groups (n = 6) of horses undertook low-intensity exercise only for the same time period. Throughout the short-term study the SDFT and deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) were ultrasonograpically scanned at mid-metacarpal level and cross-sectional area (CSA) calculated. At the end of the short-term study (horse age = 2 years) and long-term study (horse age = 3 years) the left SDFT, DDFT, suspensory ligament (SL) and common digital extensor tendon (CDET) were harvested and CSA calculated. Comparison of the DDFT from 2- and 3-year-old horses revealed an age-related increase in CSA which was confirmed by ultrasonographs. Post mortem analysis showed a significant hypertrophy of the CDET with high-intensity training in the short-term study (younger horses). CSA did not differ significantly between training groups for any of the structures following long-term training. These results suggest a structure specific hypertrophic response to the imposed training regime.",,"animal; animal disease; animal experiment; article; echography; exercise test; female; horse; hypertrophy; injury; mechanical stress; pathology; tendon; Animals; Exercise Test; Female; Horses; Hypertrophy; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Stress, Mechanical; Tendons; MLCS; MLOWN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033155064

Subcutaneous adipose tissue was biopsied at -1, 0.5, 1, and 3 wk from parturition. The basal in vitro rate of esterification was quantified, as well as the rate of esterification after the addition of glucose or glucose plus insulin. The basal rate in adipose tissue from overfed cows at -1 wk was higher than in adipose tissue from cows that were fed at restricted energy intake and indicated enhanced storage of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue of overfed cows at that time. The rate of esterification after the addition of glucose or glucose plus insulin was increased in both groups at each sampling time, but the mean rates, expressed as a percentage of the basal rates, were lower for overfed cows than for cows that were fed at restricted energy intake at 0.5 and 1 wk. Although the addition of glucose or glucose plus insulin increased esterification rates in adipose tissue from both groups of cows, adipose tissue from overfed cows was less sensitive to the addition of these compounds. In conclusion, overfeeding during the dry period predisposed cows to accumulate fat in adipose tissue during the prepartum period. The smaller increase in esterification rate after the addition of glucose or glucose plus insulin in adipose tissue of overfed cows indicates a lower ability of the adipose tissue to esterify circulating fatty acids or to reesterify mobilized fatty acids, which, combined with higher rates of lipolysis postpartum, contributes to continuously elevated concentrations of circulating nonesterified fatty acids postpartum, leading to a more severe hepatic lipidosis in overfed cows.","Adipose tissue; Dairy cows; Esterification; Overfeeding","Bos taurus; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal; animal food; article; blood; caloric intake; cattle; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug effect; esterification; female; glucose blood level; kinetics; labor; lactation; liver; metabolism; pregnancy; randomized controlled trial; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Animal Feed; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cattle; Energy Intake; Esterification; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glucose; Insulin; Kinetics; Labor, Obstetric; Lactation; Liver; Pregnancy; Triglycerides; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033141843

The dough used in the study had two different water contents, 39.5 and 41.0%, and was made using water and wheat flour. The samples, 15 x 15 x 2 cm in size, were heated from 25 to 80°C in a conventional oven at two different temperatures, 100 and 150°C, to achieve two different heating rates. During the heating the local water content was measured in the centre of the samples with a fibre-optic NIR instrument. The temperature was measured in the centre, halfway to the centre and at the surface. The rheology of the heat-treated samples was studied by means of tensile tests. Young's modulus, stress at maximum load and energy to break point were calculated. The micro structure of the samples was characterised by CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and the microstructural parameters were quantified using image analysis. The changes in rheological properties during heating were studied by means of DMA. Untreated dough samples were heated from 25 to 90°C with a heating rate of 5° C/min and a compressing oscillation of 1 Hz. The changes in phase angle δ and storage modulus E' were measured. The most important results were that no migration of water inside the pasta dough could be found. Both the water content and the heating rate affected the structural and rhelogical properties of the pasta dough. There was a maximum in E' vs. temperature, which shifted towards higher temperatures with decreasing water content. Young's modulus was affected by both the heating rate and the water content. Energy to break point and stress at maximum load were affected by the heating rate. The pore size was affected by the water content.

The dynamics of the instability is described by exploiting a couple of equations which account for the evolution of the instability growth rate and for the consequent e-beam energy spread enhancement.

Their existence could pave the way towards an highly parallel all-optical information processing and storage scheme. The formation of solitary waves is primarily due to saturation of a defocusing nonlinearity, diffusion and induced absorption. Saturation is evoked by prominent many-particle effects like screening and band filling whereas the induced absorption stems from the gap renormalization. It turns out that solitary waves of different topology may exist for the same detuning, thus representing a kind of multistability.",,"Diffusion; Light absorption; Optical bistability; Optical data storage; Optical resonators; Photons; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Multistable spatial solitons; Semiconductor resonators; Solitons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033115035

The glycogen contents of the graft, and the recipient's abdominal muscle and old liver were measured. The plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, lactate, pyruvate and total ketone bodies were determined during and after surgery. In undernourished patients, ketone bodies seemed to be the major fuel available to muscle. The concentration of ketone bodies decreased rapidly after the incision, and remained at a low level after reperfusion. These patients had higher plasma levels of Lactate/pyruvate ratio and aromatic amino acids during the anhepatic phase, followed by an exaggerated response of cytokines. Depletion of energy storage of the recipients may be involved in the deterioration of peri-operative energy metabolism and the exaggerated post-operative cytokine response.","Cytokine response; Energy metabolism; Glycogen; Liver transplantation","aromatic amino acid; cytokine; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; ketone body; lactic acid; pyruvic acid; tumor necrosis factor alpha; abdominal wall musculature; adult; aged; article; blood level; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine production; energy metabolism; glycogen analysis; human; human tissue; hypermetabolism; inflammation; lactate blood level; liver disease; liver transplantation; malnutrition; priority journal; reperfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033103775

Simple formulae are given to estimate the effect of media parameters such as coercivity, magnetization, film thickness as well as grain size on achievable areal density. It is found that reducing the grain size is the most important single factor for achieving higher storage densities. A reduction of grain size leads to a strong time dependence of coercivity and will eventually lead to superparamagnetic behavior. We present experimental data on the time dependence of coercivity in the range from 5 ns up to a few 100 μs. A simple formula, which takes the random grain orientation in the media into account, is derived and shown to describe the experimental results more satisfactory than previous theories. Furthermore, we investigate very thin films and show experimental evidence for transition broadening. A simple theoretical estimation shows that, for current media materials, (cubical) grains in the range of 10-14 nm are predicted to be thermally stable. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Many studies have been conducted on its roles in the regulation of body fat storage, energy expenditure and body weight changes. Thyroid dysfunction is known to have influences on the above changes in humans and these changes may in turn lead to a variation in circulating leptin levels. In addition, a sex dimorphism of plasma leptin levels has been a constant finding in many studies. However, the relationship between body fat mass and gender to plasma leptin levels in patients with various thyroid dysfunction has been rarely discussed together. A total of 134 patients with various thyroid function status were included in this study (hyperthyroidism: n = 50, hypothyroidism: n = 24, and euthyroidism: n = 60). Plasma leptin concentrations were compared between different thyroid function groups, and compared with body fat mass and body mass index (kg/m2) to check if these two parameters affect the circulating leptin levels. There were no significant differences between plasma leptin concentrations in the different thyroid function groups (Mean +/- SD: hyperthyroidism: 8.5 +/- 5.4 ng/ml, range: 1.5-25.8; hypothyroidism: 8.4 +/- 4.7 ng/ml, range: 1.8-20.1, and euthyroidism: 7.3 +/- 4.5 ng/ml, range: 0.6-20.9). Rather, a significant gender difference was found, with female subjects having two-fold higher levels than males when all study subjects were encompassed (female: 8.8 +/- 4.9 ng/ml, range: 11.7-25.8 vs male: 4.1 +/- 2.1 ng/ml, range 0.6-8.1, p < 0.001) or when thyroid function status was analyzed separately (hyperthyroidism: female: 9.7 +/- 5.5 ng/ml vs male: 4.3 +/- 2.1 ng/ml, p < 0.001; hypothyroidism: female: 9.7 +/- 4.6 ng/ml vs male: 4.4 +/- 2.4 ng/ml, p = 0.015; and euthyroidism: female: 7.9 +/- 4.5 ng/ml vs male: 3.6 +/- 1.9 ng/ml, p = 0.013). Plasma leptin concentrations had strong correlation with body fat mass in both females (r = 0.47, p < 0.001) and males (r = 0.71, p < 0.001). Good correlation was also observed between plasma leptin concentrations and body mass index in females (r = 0.51, p < 0.001) and males (r = 0.78, p < 0.001). Plasma leptin concentrations were not different in thyroid dysfunction. A significant gender difference existed and a positive correlation between body fat mass and BMI to plasma leptin was observed.",,"leptin; protein; adipose tissue; adult; aged; article; blood; body mass; female; histology; human; male; middle aged; sex difference; thyroid disease; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Female; Humans; Leptin; Male; Middle Aged; Proteins; Sex Factors; Thyroid Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033093485

The dual aim of this study is to document characteristics of leptin after long-term storage, and to describe its relation to body weight, from birth to old age, in an ongoing prospective study. Research Methods and Procedures: A population-based sample of Swedish women was first examined at the ages of 38 to 60 and re-examined 24 years later. This study used 1358 frozen serum samples that had been stored 29 years for analysis of leptin concentrations and their relation to body weight history. Results. Leptin values obtained from stored samples showed the same correlation with relative weight as that seen in a contemporary sample with similar demographic characteristics. Lower self-reported birth weight was associated with higher leptin levels in adulthood (p = 0.01), controlling for age and adult BMI. Prospective analyses revealed that high leptin in 38 to 46-year-olds predicted subsequent long-term weight gain (p = 0.003), although no significant associations were seen in women initially aged 50 or older. Discussion: It is feasible to use frozen serum for studying leptin in relation to obesity and related developments many years later. High leptin level was a risk factor for subsequent weight gain in 38- and 46-year-old women. Retrospective analyses involving birth weight suggest that leptin resistance in adulthood might have fetal origins.

It is generally accepted that 0 to 4°C is a suitable temperature for organ preservation. The reason for this is based on the premise that at temperatures below 0°C, intracellular ice is likely to form, with subsequent damage to cellular structures. However, it cannot be assumed that subzero temperatures will freeze the cell. In this study, we attempted to confirm the specific freezing point of rat liver and to preserve it at a temperature just above that point. Methods. Rat livers were stored for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h either at 4°C (Group N) or at -0.8°C (just above the temperature ascertained to be the specific freezing point of rat liver; Group H). After cold storage, the livers were perfused for 60 rain using an isolated perfused liver model for assessment of liver function. Results. ATP and TAN (total adenine nucleotides) in reperfused liver tissues were significantly higher in Group H than in Group N for all preservation periods. ADP was significantly higher in Group H than in Group N for 24-, 72-, and 96- h preservation periods. Energy charge was significantly higher in Group H than in Group N for 24-, 48-, and 96-h preservation periods. Conclusions. Regarding the content of ATP, ADP, and TAN and the adenylate energy charge, our results indicate that preservation at -0.8°C is advantageous. This novel preservation technique seems to prolong the period that organs can be stored.","Below 0°C nonfreezing; Graft viability; Hyo-On storage; Liver preservation","DNA; University of Wisconsin solution; animal tissue; article; cryopreservation; freezing; isolated liver; liver function; liver transplantation; male; nonhuman; organ preservation; organ transplantation; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033079610

Box 6086, Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia","In Saudi Arabia, the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system typically accounts for 65% of the total electrical energy consumption in buildings. This is due to a very high ambient temperature which persists for a long period of time in a summer season. Moreover, gas turbines efficiency decrease also with the high ambient temperatures. In the HVAC industry cool storage, or commonly known as Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is the most preferred demand side management (DSM) technology for shifting cooling electrical demand from peak daytime periods to off-peak night-time. The most popular and well-suited TES concept for Saudi Arabia is either chilled water or ice storage system, depending upon the applications and the required storage capacity. This paper shows how TES offers a means of reducing the electrical demand in large commercial buildings. Additionally, it is seen that efficiencies of the air cooled chillers are increased if they run overnight. Similarly efficiencies of gas turbine is also increased when a TES based pre-cooled air is used as an inlet to the turbine. This paper also discusses favouring conditions and other aspects of cool storage applications in Saudi Arabia. TES economics are considered and a cost analysis is presented to illustrate the potential savings that can be achieved by the use of TES in Saudi Arabia.

One of the key elements in the impressive development of vacuum and surface technology is the increased use of plasma processes. Plasma can be used as a tool for heating, evaporation, sputtering, etching and ionization as well as an activator for gaseous atoms and molecules. In the ionized and activated state, the atoms and molecules can react more easily with each other and they provide a higher energy during condensation, ensuring denser films. The impact of vacuum and plasma technology on some important industrial segments is illustrated. The production of storage media such as hard disks as well as of thin film heads shows an enormous growth rate. High-rate planar magnetron sputtering opened the way for dedicated production equipment with high efficiency and high reliability. The huge market of semiconductors and microelectronics would hardly exist without vacuum, plasma and thin-film technology. Planar magnetron sputtering and PECVD equally paved the way for a variety of thin films needed in manufacturing for all kinds of flat panel displays. The numerous variants of ion plating resulted in a huge leap in the quality of optical coatings required by modern optics. Ion plating and arc evaporation made it possible to produce wear-resistant coatings for tools and precision parts, indispensable today in many industries. Also, the architectural glass business and the automotive business depend heavily on modern vacuum-coating techniques.","Coating systems; Plasma technology; Thin films; Vacuum technology","Aerospace applications; Automotive industry; Condensation; Data storage equipment; Display devices; Evaporation; Ionization; Magnetron sputtering; Microelectronics; Plasma etching; Plasma heating; Vacuum applications; Architectural glass; Ion plating; Photonics; Coating techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033075560

Despite worldwide acceptance, these methods of pretreatment are quite expensive considering costs for the reactor, energy, and fractionation. Using peracetic acid is a lignin-oxidation pretreatment with low-energy input by which biomass can be treated in a silo-type system without need for expensive capitalization. Experimentally, ground hybrid poplar and sugar cane bagasse are placed in plastic bags and a peracetic acid solution is added to the biomass in different concentrations based on ovendried biomass. The ratio of solution to biomass is 6:1 and a 7-d storage period at ambient temperature (20°C) has been used. As an auxiliary method, a series of pre-pretreatments using stoichiometric amounts of sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide based on 4-methyl-glucuronic acid and acetyl content in the biomass are performed before addition of peracetic acid. The basic solutions are added to the biomass in a ratio of 14:1 solution to biomass, and mixed for 24 h at the same ambient temperature. Biomass is filtered and washed to a neutral pH before peracetic acid addition. The aforementioned procedures give high xylan content substrates as a function of the selectivity of peracetic acid for lignin oxidation and the mild conditions of the process. Consequently, xylanase/β-glucosidase combinations were more effective than cellulase preparations in hydrolyzing these materials. The pretreatment efficiency was evaluated through enzymatic hydrolysis and simultaneous saccharification and co fermentation (SSCF) tests. Peracetic acid treatment improves enzymatic digestibility of hybrid poplar and sugar cane bagasse with no need of high temperatures. Alkaline treatments are helpful in reducing peracetic acid requirements in the pretreatment.","Enzymatic hydrolysis; Ethanol fuel; Hybrid poplar; Peracetic acid; SSCF; Sugar cane bagasse; Zymomonas mobilis","alcohol; lignin; peracetic acid; biomass; chemical composition; conference paper; cost benefit analysis; digestion; environmental temperature; fermentation; hydrolysis; oxidation; stoichiometry; storage; synthesis; tree; Zymomonas mobilis; Arundinaria; Populus berolinensis; Saccharum; Silo; Zymomonas mobilis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033063665

This perspective is based largely on the results of research carried on concurrently in the field (the Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, acidification study, 1984–1990) and in the laboratory using water tailored to mimic that of Little Rock Lake. We discuss ways in which seasonal changes influence both the environmental challenges encountered by fishes and their ability to deal with those challenges. The vulnerability of a species may be based as much on its life history (e.g., synchrony of sensitive or resistant life stages with maximum pH challenges) as on its anatomy and physiology. The ordering of acid sensitivity of species or of life stages is based on a dynamic balancing of energy and ion uptake, storage, and loss. These processes, in turn, are linked to the length of the growing season (net uptake phase) and the winter fasting period (net loss phase). Each species and each life stage varies in its capacity to achieve this life-sustaining balance of energy and ion flux. The season and environment have an influence both on the acid challenges present and the ability of each species and life stage to cope with those challenges. One consequence of seasonality is that, in northern latitudes, the embryo–larval stage (generally considered to be the most acid sensitive) may not be the stage most susceptible to the effects of low pH. Rather, the first-year overwintering juvenile stage may be the most vulnerable, often as a result of chronic ionoregulatory failure involving damage to gill chloride cells. Anthropogenic factors are bringing about environmental changes at rates that exceed the capacity of many organisms to adjust to them, especially early life history stages. Our results support the view that aquatic toxicological studies would often benefit from increased attention to interactions involving the season, the water chemistry, and the life history stage that is present. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"acidification; climate change; energy metabolism; environmental impact assessment; fish; ion uptake; survival; toxicity testing; United States; acidification; fish; life history; recruitment; vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033058119

As well as providing food for man, they, or fractions derived from processing them, make an important contribution to the diets of farm stock. Cereal grains have a long storage life under favourable conditions because they are harvested at a relatively low moisture content and comprise stable components. The principal energy sources within the grains are protected from infestation by outer coverings that are difficult to penetrate and in some cases unpalatable components in the coverings discourage predation by wild populations. The largest morphological component of all grains is the starchy endosperm, and approximately 80% of this is starch, occurring as microscopical granules with forms characteristic of the species. Also characteristic of the species are the storage proteins, which make the next largest contribution to endosperm dry weight. Proteins are important both as nutrients and by virtue of the fact that the class includes enzymes which, although making a small contribution to grain weight, can have a marked effect on grain quality and hence price. Other chemical components present as minor contributors, but with potential for exerting significant nutritional influence, are phytates and tannins, and current knowledge of these is briefly discussed. The walls of endosperm cells comprise a complex mixture of polysaccharides including cellulose, arabinoxylans, and β-glucans, as well as proteins and esterified phenolic acids. Attention is drawn to the difficulty in defining 'fibre' as it is method- or function-dependent and includes contributions from the endosperm cell wall components as well as the lignified walls of cells in the outer protective pericarp and the contents and cuticle of the testa.","Carbohydrates; Embryo; Endosperm; Enzymes; Fibre; Pericarp; Phytic acid; Proteins; Seed coats; Starch; Tannin","Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033057253

After culture ATP content increased to 265.5 ± 113.3 pg/μg IP (204.2 ± 41.5%) corresponding to 43.7 ± 15.3 pg/IEQ (216.1 ± 34.9%; p<0.05). The coefficient of variation was 129.5%, 96.5% (fresh) and 135.0%, 111.0% (cultured) for ATP/pg IP and ATP/IEQ, respectively. The present data show that: (1) the ATP content of freshly isolated human islets varies enormously; (2) intraislet ATP levels increase significantly during 22°C culture suggesting that the capacity to produce ATP is maintained despite hypothermic environment. More data are necessary to clarify the relevance of intraislet ATP content for graft function and survival after islet transplantation.","ATP; Human islets; Islets of Langerhans; Tissue culture","adenosine triphosphate; adult; cell energy; cell viability; conference paper; controlled study; energy metabolism; glucose oxidation; graft survival; human; human tissue; isolated organ; organ donor; oxygen supply; pancreas islet; pancreas islet transplantation; tissue culture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033048154

So named because of the phenotypes conferred by their animal prototypes, many MRPs are glutathione-conjugate or multi-specific organic anion Mg2+-ATPases active in the transport of glutathionated compounds and other bulky amphipathic anions. Acting downstream of the first two phases of toxin detoxification, typified by, but not limited to the reactions catalysed by the cytochromes P450 and glutathione S-transferases, respectively, processes that likely converge and depend on the MRPs from plants and yeast include the detoxification of herbicides and other organic xenobiotics, the alleviation of oxidative damage, the storage of endotoxins, heavy metal sequestration, and the vacuolation of natural pigments. Distinguished by a unique domain organization and the facility to mediate MgATP-energized transport, the MRPs are of profound significance in two respects. First, the fact that the MRPs, like most ABC transporters, are energized directly by MgATP rather than by, for example, a preformed H+ gradient, offers a new, non-chemiosmotic perspective on the molecular basis of energy-dependent solute transport in plants. Second, given the existence of 29 ABC protein genes in the yeast genome alone, characterization of the MRPs - the first class of ABC transporters from a plant source to have been defined at both the molecular and biochemical levels - indicates that many more ABC transporters and ABC transporter-mediated processes remain to be discovered in plants.","ABC transporters; Detoxification; Glutathione; Vacuolar sequestration; Xenobiotics","Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033047445

The disruption of protein bodies and zein release during extrusion may influence the texture of corn-based extruded foods. In this work, chemical and microscopic studies were conducted on corn flour that had been extruded under mild to extreme conditions to determine the specific mechanical energy (SME) required to break apart protein bodies and release α-zein, and to assess changes in protein-protein interactions. Transmission electron microscopy with immunolocalization of α-zein revealed that starch granules and protein bodies remained intact under mild processing conditions (SME 35-40 kJ/kg), but under harsher conditions, protein bodies were disrupted and α-zein was released. At SME ≃100 kJ/kg, protein bodies appeared highly deformed and fused together with the α-zein released, whereas at higher SME, protein bodies were completely disrupted and α-zein was dispersed and may have formed protein fibrils. Protein in extrudates was less soluble in urea and SDS than in unprocessed corn flour, but it was readily extracted with urea, SDS, and 2-ME. This was likely due to protein aggregation upon processing due to a prevalence of hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between glucose and DA or long-chain triglyceride (LCT) metabolism after oral administration. Methods: Two test meals containing either dodecanedioic acid (C12, the 12-atom DA) or LCT, together with glucose and amino acids, were each administered to five healthy volunteers. Tracer amounts of 14C- dodecanedioic acid were added to the C12 meal to recover expired traced CO2 and estimate the minimum rate of C12 oxidation. Glucose, insulin, and C12 plasma levels were measured for 360 minutes after the test meal. Indirect calorimetry was performed for the duration of the study. Results: LCTs proved ineffective in promoting their own oxidation after oral administration. On the contrary, C12 was promptly oxidized, a minimum of 21.9% ± 8.3% of the administered amount giving rise to the recovered expired CO2. This difference in metabolic fate was reflected in a sparing effect on glucose: suprabasal respiratory quotient and suprabasal carbohydrate oxidation were significantly (p &lt; .05) lower under C12 administration than under LCT administration, with a difference of 0.024 ± 0.015 in respiratory quotient (RQ) and a difference of 0.791 ± 0.197 kJ/min in carbohydrate oxidation. In particular, carbohydrate oxidation increased by 54% over basal with LCT but only by 28% with C12 administration. RQ increased over basal by 5.8% with LCT but only by 3.0% with C12 administration. Conclusions: These results show a fundamental metabolic difference between conventional lipids and DAs, which is the basis for a possible role of DAs in clinical nutrition. The fate of spared glucose is likely to be storage in glycogen form when dodecanedioic acid is made available as an energy source.",,"long chain fatty acid; long chain triacylglycerol; adult; article; caloric intake; controlled study; energy metabolism; enteric feeding; food composition; human; human experiment; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; male; normal human; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033042684

This study focused on microstructural changes and dispersal patterns of corn storage proteins, zeins, that occur during extrusion processing. Model systems were used that consisted of two types of corn protein: commercial zein and corn gluten meal (CGM), combined with corn starch. Commercial zein is not encased in protein bodies, whereas CGM is comprised of zeins encapsulated in protein bodies. Mixtures were extruded under conditions that resulted in different specific mechanical energy (SME). The microstructure of the resulting extrudates was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with immunogold labeling of the ct-zein storage protein. The micrographs showed that the greatest zein dispersal occurred in CGM/starch extrudates, especially under high SME conditions. The micrographs also showed that, at both mild and harsh extrusion conditions, commercial zein/starch extrudates contained large protein aggregates. Under mild extrusion conditions, protein bodies in the CGM/starch extrudates partially retained their spherical shapes, but during harsher processing, protein bodies were disrupted and dispersed zein appeared to form fibrils. Such protein fibrils may influence texture and/or quality of extruded corn-based snacks and breakfast foods.","Corn gluten meal; Extrusion; TEM; Zein","protein; starch; zein; article; corn; energy; immunogold staining; nonhuman; priority journal; protein structure; transmission electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033036209

We studied the effects of 6-wk treatment with the insulin sensitizer troglitazone on substrate storage and utilization in lean control and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Troglitazone prevented development of diabetes and lowered serum triglycerides (TG) in ZDF rats. Soleus muscle glycogen and TG content were elevated twofold in untreated ZDF rats, and both were normalized by troglitazone to lean control levels (P < 0.05). Troglitazone also normalized insulin-stimulated glucose uptake as well as basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, implying increased skeletal muscle glycogen turnover. The proportion of active pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in soleus muscle was reduced in ZDF relative to lean control rat muscle (16 ± 2 vs. 21 ± 2%) but was restored by troglitazone treatment (30 ± 3%). Increased PDH activation was associated with a 70% increase in glucose oxidation. Muscle lipoprotein lipase activity was decreased by 35% in ZDF compared with lean control rats and was increased twofold by troglitazone. Palmitate oxidation and incorporation into TG were higher in ZDF relative to lean control rats but were unaffected by troglitazone treatment. Troglitazone decreased the incorporation of glucose into the acyl group of TG by 60% in ZDF rats. In summary, ZDF rats demonstrate increased skeletal muscle glycogen and TG stores, both of which were reduced by troglitazone treatment. Troglitazone appears to increase both glycogen and TG turnover in skeletal muscle. Normalization of PDH activity and decreased glucose incorporation into acyl TG may underlie the improvements in intracellular substrate utilization and energy stores, which lead to decreased serum TG and glucose.","Free fatty acid metabolism; Glucose metabolism; Insulin resistance; Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; Thiazolidinedione","glycogen; insulin; lipoprotein lipase; palmitic acid; pyruvate dehydrogenase; troglitazone; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme activity; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid transport; glucose oxidation; glucose transport; glucose utilization; glycogen muscle level; glycogen synthesis; insulin release; insulin resistance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; soleus muscle; triacylglycerol blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033032470

Since the unit costs of treatment and disposal are much higher HLW than for LLW, technologies to reduce the amount of HLW are being developed. A key process currently being studied to reduce the volume of HLW sludges is called enhanced sludge washing (ESW). This process removes, by water washes, soluble constituents such as sodium salts, and the washed sludge is then leached with 2-3 M NaOH at 60-100°C to remove nonradioactive metals such as aluminum. The remaining solids are considered to be HLW while the solutions are LLW after radionuclides such as 137Cs have been removed. Results of bench-scale tests have shown that the ESW will probably remove the required amounts of inert constituents. While both experimental and theoretical results have shown that leaching efficiency increases as the time and temperature of the leach are increased, increases in the caustic concentration above 2-3 M will only marginally improve the leach factors. However, these tests were not designed to validate the assumption that the caustic used in the ESW process will generate only a small increase (10 Mkg) in the amount of LLW; instead, the test conditions were selected to maximize leaching in a short period and used more water and caustic than is planned during full-scale operations. Even though calculations indicate that the estimate for the amount of LLW generated by the ESW process appears to be reasonable, a detailed study of the amount of LLW from the ESW process is still required. If the LLW analysis indicates that sodium management is critical, then a more comprehensive evaluation of the clean salt process or caustic recycle would be needed.

These tanks contain nearly 9 million gallons of precipitated salt. To immobilize the waste, the salt is dissolved through water addition, followed by precipitation of the radionuclides through the addition of sodium tetraphenylborate. This precipitate is then concentrated and washed to remove sodium through cross-flow filtration. This waste pretreatment process started radioactive operation in late 1995. During the normal plant operation, the cross-flow filtration system (consisting of two 216-square-foot filter elements) maintains a constant filtrate production rate. This objective is achieved by allowing the operating pressure to increase to maintain a constant filtrate production rate. A maximum pressure differential limit of 40 psig has been imposed on this system. When this maximum is approached, a high-energy backpulse of filtrate removes foulant from the surface of the filter, thereby restoring the filter flux. This laboratory work examined two key aspects of the anticipated facility operating conditions: the efficacy of using pressure differential to control filtrate production rates and the risk posed to filter performance associated with pore plugging of the filter immediately following the backpulse. Tests used simulated tetraphenylborate precipitate and a bench-scale cross-flow filtration unit consisting of two parallel filter units each 4 feet in length. Tests used slurries containing between 1 and 10 wt % tetraphenylborate to cover the anticipated range of operation. Data collected included both initial flux-decline measurements and steady-state filtrate production measurements. Analysis of these data indicates, for the more dilute slurries, pressure was an effective tool in controlling filtrate flux. However, as the slurry became more concentrated, the ability to manipulate filtrate flux by pressure greatly diminished. Analysis of the initial filtrate decline data using first- principle models indicates that the primary mechanism for decreasing filter flux involved development of a surface cake. Given the operating constraints of the facility, these results provide guidance for future filtration operation.In relation to the anticipated operation of the Savannah River Site which has 23 Type III high-level radioactive waste tanks, laboratory tests were carried out to examine two key aspects of the operating conditions: the efficacy of using pressure differential to control filtrate production rates and the risk posed to filter performance associated with pore plugging of the filter immediately following the backpulse.

However, individual nutritional assessment parameters lack sensitivity and specificity in determining energy status of these patients. Recently, serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to reflect the recovery of hepatic energy metabolism after liver transplantation. Aims - The relation between preoperative levels of serum HGF and metabolic variables was investigated to clarify the clinical value of measuring HGF in evaluations of the catabolism. Patients/Methods - Blood samples were obtained from 30 liver transplant recipients, and biopsy specimens were taken from each recipient's rectus muscle and the explanted liver. Preoperative serum concentration of HGF was determined. Whole body energy metabolism was assessed by measuring glycogen contents of biopsy specimens and plasma or serum levels of glucose, insulin, total ketone bodies, total carnitine, and amino acids. Results - Serum HGF concentration was elevated in 22 of 30 patients and correlated with the Child-Pugh score. It showed a negative association with muscle glycogen content, and a positive correlation with serum levels of glucose, total carnitine, and total ketone bodies. Patients with elevated serum HGF concentrations had higher preoperative plasma levels of aromatic amino acids and branched chain amino acids, associated with lower branched chain to aromatic amino acid ratios. Conclusions - The elevated serum concentration of HGF in liver transplant candidates reflected inhibition of peripheral glucose storage, enhanced lipid oxidation, and increased peripheral release of branched chain amino acids, and thus extensive energy catabolism.","Catabolism; Hepatocyte growth factor; Liver; Transplantation","amino acid; aromatic amino acid; branched chain amino acid; carnitine; glucose; glycogen; insulin; ketone body; scatter factor; adult; aged; amino acid metabolism; article; catabolism; clinical article; controlled study; energy metabolism; glucose metabolism; human; human tissue; lipid oxidation; liver biopsy; liver metabolism; liver transplantation; nutritional status; priority journal; rectus abdominis muscle; serum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033019680

METHODS: The correlations and linear relationships between body weight, FM, fat-free mass (FFM) and abdominal fat vs 24 h EE (EE 24) and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) were compared between 65 men and 35 women, and before and after weight loss in 10 men and 10 women. RESULTS: Our results showed that for a given FM, men displayed a higher EE than women, independently of FFM. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that after body weight loss, men displayed a lower SMR for a given FM or FM adjusted for FFM compared to before the treatment, but this was not so in women. However, when FM was adjusted for abdominal fat deposition, the difference between the conditions was no longer observed. CONCLUSIONS: FM has a significant impact on EE only in men. We suggest that abdominal adipose tissue may exert a potent regulatory effect on energy metabolism which would be more detectable in men who generally store more fat in this compartment than women.","Abdominal fat; Energy expenditure; Sympathetic nervous system activity; Weight loss","adipose tissue; adult; article; body composition; body fat; body weight; controlled study; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; female; human; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; metabolic rate; phenotype; priority journal; regression analysis; sex difference; sleep; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033019662

Both methods allow characterization of the inhomogeneity of the horizontal and vertical distribution of cyanobacteria and phototrophic sulfur bacteria. In a vertical profile the yellow top material consisting mainly of exopolymers and a loose net of cyanobacteria is followed by a green layer of filamentous cyanobacteria, and finally a red layer of phototrophic bacteria. Reflectance spectra give insight into chromatic and light intensity adaptation. In cyanobacteria situated in the shadow the phycobilin/chlorophyll-a ratio increases as compared to sites open to the sunlight, it increases as well with depth in the mat. In phototrophic purple bacteria different proportions between reaction-center and light-harvesting bacteriochlorophyll are observed. With CSLM filaments of cyanobacteria close to the mat surface show strong phycobilin fluorescence; conversely in those 10-20 μm deeper in the mat only the fluorescence of chlorophyll-a can be seen. This indicates that the energy coupling between phycobilins and chlorophyll-a in cyanobacteria may depend on the average light intensity in the vicinity of the cells. Since sulfur droplets show a strong reflection of the laser light, the amount of sulfur storage and the size of the sulfur droplets is visualized in phototrophic purple bacteria.

Recently, we found a new glycogenolytic pathway in rat liver in which glycogen is first metabolized to 1,5-anhydrofructose (AnFru) and then to 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AnGlc-ol). Because the amounts of glycogen and AnFru are closely related in various rat organs and the second reaction, AnFru to AnGlc-ol, is strongly inhibited in the presence of glucose, we expected that this pathway might play a regulatory role in glycogen metabolism. Here we evaluate the expected involvement of AnGlc-ol and AnFru in the regulatory mechanism in Escherichia coli C600. Having established the presence of this new glycogenolytic pathway in E. coli C600, we further show that the conversion of AnFru to AnGlc-ol is activated only after the exhaustion of glucose in the medium, and that as little as 5 μM AnGlc-ol in the medium acutely accelerates the degradation of glycogen by 40%. We consider the role of AnGlc-ol in the mechanism that controls glycogen metabolism in E. coli to be as follows. When glucose is abundant, E. coli accumulate glycogen, a fraction of which is steadily degraded so that the amount of AnFru is about 1/1000 of glycogen on a weight basis. When glucose is depleted and the demand for glycogen utilization is elevated, AnFru, which has accumulated mostly in the medium, is promptly taken up and converted to AnGlc-ol, which accelerates glycogen degradation. We also suggest the possibility that AnGlc-ol is one of the extracellular signaling molecules for bacteria.","1,5-anhydro-D-fructose; 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol; E. coli; Glycogenolytic pathway; Regulation of glycogen metabolism","fructose; glucose; glycogen; sorbitol; article; enzyme inhibition; Escherichia coli; extracellular fluid; glycogenolysis; liver; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033007682

In 13 healthy subjects, we studied the influence of acute insulin resistance induced by a lipid infusion on thermogenesis without any glucose load (n = 4) or during a euglycemic- hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 5) and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, n = 8). When substrates were not administered at the same time, the energy cost of storage was significantly (P &lt; .05) lower for lipids (3.9% ± 0.9%) than for glucose (11.9% ± 0.5% during the clamp and 14.9% ± 4.0% during the OGTT, NS).

When lipids were infused, the energy cost of substrate storage was lower during the clamp versus the OGTT (clamp, 3.2% ± 0.8%; OGTT, 7.3% ± 1.0%; P &lt; .05). This effect was attributed to a lipid-induced impairment of glucose tolerance, which overcomes the inhibitory effect of lipid infusion on glucose storage observed in euglycemia.

We evaluated, in male Brown Norway rats, the effects of aging on body composition and the association with serum levels of leptin, insulin, and testosterone. Body composition was assessed cross- sectionally in male rats (3, 8, 17, and 29 months) by a combination of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and dissection of specific muscles and adipose depots. Longitudinal changes in body composition were quantified by DEXA before and after 3 months of ad-libitum feeding. Body weight, lean mass, absolute and percentage fat increased with age, whereas percentage of lean mass decreased. Leptin and insulin levels increased with age in proportion to adiposity; the increase in leptin with age was related to increased total and peripheral but not visceral, fat. Testosterone decreased with age, and was associated with decreased lean and skeletal muscle mass. These findings suggest that alterations in body composition with age may be due to decreased trophic and increased lipogenic hormones. Relative to other rodent models, Brown Norway rats undergo shifts in body composition and in the hormonal milieu that are consistent with changes seen in aging humans.",,"insulin; leptin; testosterone; adipose tissue; aged; aging; article; body composition; body fat; body mass; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lipid storage; male; muscle atrophy; muscle mass; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; rat; testosterone blood level; Rattus norvegicus; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032996822

Grains are fed as concentrated sources of energy. Their quality depends on the energy content of the grain, the amount eaten, and the efficiency, both of extraction of nutrients from the diet and of conversion of nutrients to weight gain. This paper briefly describes the fermentative and digestive processes involved in releasing energy from grain and in ensuring an adequate supply of other essential nutrients to the animal. Methods are then described for measuring net energy storage, nutrient release in various sections of the tract, and storage of energy and protein both directly and indirectly in studies of growth. It is recommended that in vivo assessment of the energy content of grains for ruminants be conducted in stages. Digestibility in the whole tract should be used to rank a range of grains, then comparisons made between grains using growth studies. Discrepancies arising from these assessments should then be investigated using more detailed measurements, particularly starch digestion in the stomach and intestines.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032992608

Sources of variation in the physical and chemical characteristics of grains used in poultry diets include variety, seasonal effects, and growth sites, crop treatment and grain fumigants, and post-harvest storage conditions and period of storage. The available energy and protein contents of grains fed to poultry, which best represent nutritive value, are extremely wide and in consequence there is an urgent need to develop rapid and objective tests for the assessment of nutritive value prior to including grains in poultry diets. Variation in the available energy and protein content of grains can be attributed to a wide range of anti-nutritive factors such as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), enzyme activity, tannins, alkyl resorcinols, protease inhibitors, α-amylase inhibitors, phytohaemagglutinins, alkaloids, saponins, and lathyrogens. The relative importance of such factors will also differ according to the type of grain in question. However, NSP seem to be the predominant factor in Australia over the past few years given the volume of published literature on this topic. This argument is strongly supported by the fact that NSP-degrading enzymes are routinely used in monogastric diets with great success throughout the world. Numerous attempts over a long period have failed to provide unequivocal evidence that nutritive value in grains for poultry can be predicted with sufficient accuracy and precision by simple, low-cost physico-chemical measurements used singly or in combination. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to continue to explore these simple measurements in the expectation that useful statistical relationships with more complex measurements will emerge, or that simple measurements can be used to fine-tune prediction equations based on more powerful techniques such as near infrared spectrophotometry. Finally, the nutritive value of grains for poultry will be determined not only by the chemical and physical properties of grains but also by the way that these interact with the processes of ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism in birds. For this reason it is imperative that plant and animal scientists join forces to improve the nutritive value of plant material as feed for animals for the benefit of grain growers and producers of livestock.","Amino acids; Apparent metabolisable energy; Availability; Grains; Poultry","Animalia; Aves; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032990725

Treatment methods are needed to remove the cesium from the liquid waste and thus concentrate the cesium into high-activity, remote-handled waste forms. The treated liquids could then be processed and disposed of by more cost-effective means with less radiation exposure to workers. A full-scale demonstration of one cesium removal technology has been conducted at ORNL. This demonstration utilizes a modular, mobile ion-exchange system and existing facilities for the off-gas system, secondary containment, and utilities. The ion-exchange material, crystalline silicotitanate (CST), was chosen on the basis of its effectiveness in laboratory tests. The CST, which was developed through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between DOE and private industry, has several advantages over current organic ion-exchange technologies. These advantages include (1) the ability to remove cesium in the presence of high concentrations of potassium, (2) a high affinity for cesium in both alkaline and acidic conditions, (3) physical stability over wide alkaline and acidic ranges, and (4) the elimination of large volumes of secondary waste required for regeneration of organic ion exchangers. Approximately 116,000 L of supernate was processed during the demonstration with ~1,142 Ci of 137Cs removed from the supernate and loaded onto 265L (70 gal) of sorbent. The supernate processed had a high salt content, about 4 M NaNO3, and a pH of 12 to 13. This paper discusses the results of the full- scale demonstration and compares these results with data from the laboratory tests.A full-scale Cesium Removal Demonstration (CsRD) was conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) using actual radioactive supernate from Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs). The sorbent chosen for the demonstration is a crystalline silicotitanate (CST) ion-exchange material. A total of four CsRD runs were completed. During the entire operational period, approx. 115,757 L of supernate was processed and approx. 1,142 Ci of 137Cs was removed from that supernate and loaded onto 265L of CST sorbent. The CST also loaded Sr, U, Pb, Ba and Zn. Laboratory analysis of the spent sorbent showed that it is nonhazardous, and no further stabilization is necessary prior to disposal. Further, data analysis indicated that the cesium breakthrough curves for the bench- and the full-scale columns agreed very well, suggesting that the bench-scale columns can be used to predict scale-up.",,"Cesium; Crystalline materials; Ion exchangers; Organic ion exchangers; Silicon compounds; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Crystalline silicotitanate; Chemicals removal (water treatment); cesium; silicon derivative; sorbent; titanium derivative; alkaline medium; Cesium; Waste disposal; Wastewater; adsorption; binding affinity; conference paper; extraction; ion exchange; molecular stability; nuclear waste; radioactive waste disposal; waste water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032984093

However, errors in predicting processes like evapotranspiration (ET), which is rarely measured during model validation studies, can significantly affect predictions of chemical fate and transport. This study compared approaches and predictions for ET by GLEAMS, Opus, PRZM-2, and RZWQM and determined effects of the predicted ET on simulations of other hydrology components. The ET was investigated for 2 years of various fallow-corn growing seasons under sprinkler irrigation. The comparison included annual cumulative daily potential ET (ET(p)), actual ET, and partitioning of total ET between soil evaporation (E(s)) and crop transpiration (E(t)). When measured pan evaporation was used for calculating ET(p) (the pan evaporation method), Opus, PRZM-2, and RZWQM predicted 74, 65, and 59%, respectively, of the 10-year average ET reported for a nearby site. When the energy-balance equations were used for calculating ET(p) (the combination methods), GLEAMS, Opus, PRZM-2, and RZWQM predicted 84, 105, 60, and 72% of the reported ET, respectively. The pan evaporation method predicted a similar amount of ET to the combination methods for bare soil, but predicted less ET when both E(s) and E(t) occurred. RZWQM reasonably predicted partitioning of ET to E(s), while GLEAMS and Opus over-predicted this partitioning. A close correlation between soil water storage in the root zone and ET suggests that accurate soil water content predictions were fundamental to ET predictions.","Evapotranspiration; Model comparison; Simulation","agrochemical; evapotranspiration; measurement method; modeling; prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032972107

As a means of distinguishing primary from secondary characteristics, we compared levels of fasting plasma leptin and insulin in a cohort of weight-reduced obese women who have attained and maintained a normal BMI for more than I year with the levels in cohorts of never-obese and currently obese women. Weight-reduced obese women showed decreased plasma concentrations of leptin and insulin compared with obese women, but these levels remained significantly higher than those of never- obese women. Plasma leptin levels were highly correlated with plasma insulin levels (r = 0.60, P < 0.001). To further explore relationships with body composition, total body fat was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and body fat distribution by computed tomography in subsets of these groups. Weight-reduced obese women had a significantly greater percent body fat and subcutaneous abdominal fat mass than did the never-obese women, and these were highly correlated with plasma leptin (r = 0.90, P < 0.001, and r = 0.52, P < 0.001, respectively). In these weight-reduced obese women, visceral fat mass was similar to that of the never-obese. The insulin sensitivity index and first-phase insulin response were also comparable. These results demonstrate that higher leptin levels in weight-reduced obese women are related to the higher total fat and particularly the subcutaneous fat masses. Normalization of visceral fat mass in the weight-reduced obese was accompanied by normalization of insulin sensitivity index and first- phase insulin response. This study suggests that increases in plasma leptin and insulin in obesity are secondary features of the obese state.",,"insulin; leptin; adult; article; body fat; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; obesity; priority journal; protein blood level; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032969278

From the rate constant of the initial decrease in DPPH-scavenging ability, the Arrhenius activation energy was calculated to be 15.8 kcal/mol.

The Saone river is a 480-km-long Rhone tributary, with an oceanic pluvial regime, and an average yearly discharge of 440 m3 s-1 at Lyons. The watercourse is characterised by very gentle slopes controlled by the neotectonics of the Bresse trough and by Holocene fluvial dynamics. Sediments were sampled during the December 1993-January 1994 flood (2 375 m3 s-1) and the 1995 January-February flood (1 826 m3 s-1). A fine partition into homogeneous sectors, using stream power as well as shear stress, has been realized on a 400 km reach using longitudinal and cross-sections at one kilometre intervals.

Heat production was also measured because the sum of work and heat is equivalent to the energy cost of the contraction (ATP used). These energy fluxes were evaluated in contractions with constant-velocity shortening either during stimulation or during relaxation. The muscle preparation was tetanized for 0.6 s and shortened by 1 mm (approximately 15% of L0) at 3.5 or 7.0 mms-1 (approximately 15 or 30% of V0), where L0 is the muscle length at which isometric force is greatest and V0 is the maximum velocity of shortening. In separate experiments, the stiffness of the SEC was characterized from measurements of force responses to step changes in the length of contracting muscle. Using the values of SEC stiffness, we evaluated separately the work and heat associated with the CC and with the SEC. The major findings were (1) that work stored in the SEC could be completely recovered as external work when shortening occurred during relaxation (none of the stored work being degraded into heat) and (2) that, when shortening occurred progressively later during the contraction, the total energy cost of the contraction declined towards that of an isometric contraction.","Contraction; Dogfish; Elastic energy; Energetics; Heat production; Muscle; Power; Scyliorhinus canicula; Series elasticity; Work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032936912

Glucose may have been selected, over the other aldohexoses, because of its low propensity for glycation of proteins. That carbohydrate is stored in polymeric form (glycogen) is dictated by osmotic pressure considerations. That stored fat is about eight times more calorically dense than glycogen, when attendant water is factored in, accounts for the predominance of fat as a storage form of calories and, also, for the fact that ingested carbohydrate is oxidized promptly (that is, fuel of the fed state) rather than being extensively stored. That stored glycogen is accompanied by so much water accounts for the fact that the brain only has very small glycogen stores. Carbohydrate has two important advantages, over fat, as a metabolic fuel; it is the only fuel that can produce ATP in the absence of oxygen, and more ATP is produced per O2 consumed when glucose is oxidized, compared with when fat is oxidized. These advantages probably determine the preference of many cell types for carbohydrate. In addition to its use as a metabolic fuel, glucose plays other important roles such as provision of NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway, and as a source material for the synthesis of other key carbohydrates, for example, ribose and deoxyribose for nucleic acid synthesis and substrates for the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans. It can also play a key role in anaplerosis. Although it is widely acknowledged that gluconeogenesis plays a crucial role in starvation it is now apparent that prandial gluconeogenesis occurs, both in the metabolic disposal of dietary amino acids and in the synthesis of glycogen by the indirect pathway. Although there is, strictly speaking, no dietary requirement for carbohydrate it is evident that glucose is a universal fuel for probably all cells in the body and carbohydrate is the cheapest source of calories and the major source of dietary fibre. These observations, together with the fact that glucose is the preferred metabolic fuel for the brain, permit us to recommend appreciable quantities of carbohydrate in all prudent diets. © 1999 Stockton Press.

ACAT from the yolk sac membrane of chicken eggs 16 d after fertilization has higher activity and better stability than its mammalian liver counterpart. During our study of the avian enzyme, ACAT was found to be activated up to twofold during storage at 4°C. The activation was investigated, and data suggest that redistribution of cholesterol within microsomal vesicles leads to the increase. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) increases activation an additional twofold, possibly by facilitating the movement of cholesterol within microsomal fragments and allowing redistribution of cholesterol in lipid bilayers to a greater extent. Treatment of microsomes with MβCD removes cholesterol from the membranes. Controlled amounts of cholesterol can be restored to the membranes by mixing them with cholesterol-phosphatidylcholine liposomes in the presence of MβCD. Under these conditions, the plot of ACAT vs. cholesterol mole fraction in the liposomes is sigmoidal. The finding that MβCD can enhance cholesterol transfer between liposomes and microsomes and reduce the limitation of slow movement of nonpolar molecules in aqueous media should make cyclodextrins more useful in in vitro studies of apolar molecule transport between membrane vesicles.",,"cholesterol; cholesterol acyltransferase; cyclodextrin; liposome; methyl beta cyclodextrin; unclassified drug; animal tissue; article; cholesterol transport; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme regulation; enzyme stability; microsome; nonhuman; vitelline membrane; Animalia; Aves; Gallus gallus; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032935836

Nine species of frogs, represented primarily by small-bodied juveniles, and seven species of lizards, primarily small-bodied adults, composed the leaf litter fauna at the end of the wet season when the study was performed. Eighty-two prey categories, identified to family level, were recognized in the diets of these species of frogs and lizards. Overlaps in diet indicated little similarity among most species in prey types eaten, although a well-defined termite-ant guild composed of two species was identified. Ants, insect larvae, beetles, and termites contributed most to diets of all species combined, but frogs typically consumed more ants than lizards. As a group, frogs ate smaller prey than lizards, even when prey sizes were adjusted for body size. Frogs in general contained more prey than lizards (21.7 items per frog compared to 6.7 items per lizard) and had significantly larger stomach content volumes than lizards, indicating a major divergence in the basic strategy of food gathering between frogs and lizards. Frogs may have evolved relatively larger gut storage capacity to offset extended food shortages associated with prolonged inactivity during drought. However, differences in consumption of ants by frogs and lizards may relate to differences in defense strategies between the two groups. All amphibians have integumentary granular glands, which secrete many different compounds used in defense. Ants produce a variety of toxins, and some evidence in one lineage of frogs suggests that frogs may incorporate toxins into their skin from insects in their diets. Future work may elucidate whether lizard dietary choice has evolved to optimize energy intake whereas frog dietary choice has evolved to optimize uptake of chemicals important for defense.",,"diet; frog; leaf litter; rainforest; Brazil; Roraima State",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032934781

The maximum tolerable fat intake appears to be limited by the minimum requirements of protein, carbohydrates and micronutrients. It is unresolved whether or not there is a minimum metabolic requirement of dietary fat, beyond the requirements of essential fatty acids and lipid soluble vitamins and the effects on energy density and an adequate total energy intake. The first postnatal months of the human infant are characterized by a rapid weight gain and extensive fat deposition. Body fat deposition equals 25% of the total energy intake during the first 2 and 16% during the third and fourth months, respectively. The provision of dietary lipids in amounts at least matching the needs for tissue storage and fat oxidation appears to be of advantage for energy balance and physiological growth. Some reports have associated low fat diets with less than 30% of energy as fat with adverse effects on child growth beyond infancy, but it remains unresolved whether these effects were caused by an associated effect on dietary energy density and total intake of energy and other nutrients. Closely supervised, healthy infants from an affluent population grew normally with a diet providing about 30% of the energy as fat from the seventh month of life onwards, but it is not known to what extent adaptive mechanisms such as a reduction of physical activity may have been required. It is not known whether infants and young children stressed by frequent occurrence of diarrhea and infections may adapt to a 30% fat diet as well or not. No evidence is available for a health benefit of a low total fat intake in infancy. In view of the limited available information, further research is required to define optimal fat intakes in early childhood since this question is of major importance for child health. © 1999 Stockton Press.

This experiment allows partitioning of genetic causes from environmental causes of the differences in adult size found in different populations. Chuckwallas from different home populations showed what appear to be genetic differences in size and patterns of growth. Lizards from populations with small adults grew faster before maturity and slower after maturity than those from populations with larger adults. Size and growth rates were correlated with elevation among sites for chuckwallas both raised in the laboratory and in natural populations. For example, at low-elevation sites, chuckwallas grew comparatively rapidly to reach maturity in a shortened growing season. A high frequency of drought at these hot, dry sites may necessitate storage of energy after maturity as a buffer against the relatively high probability that food will be limited in the following year. Lizards at higher elevation sites, however, are freed from this constraint, allowing them to use energy for growth to reach larger size and therefore to produce larger clutches. Although plant species diversity in the wild showed an increase with increasing elevation, food abundance, measured as the aboveground biomass of annuals, did not. This indicates that the length of time food is available, rather than its abundance, is of primary importance to chuckwallas.","Body size differences; Chuckwallas; Common garden experiment; Effects on lizard growth; Effects on lizard size; Elevation; Geographic variation; Life history; Lizards; Rainfall; Sauromalus obesus; Temperature","body size; comparative study; environmental effect; growth rate; lizard; Iguanidae; Iguanidae; Sauromalus ater; Sauromalus obesus; Squamata; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032930491

In this context, fat gain can be seen as a natural adaptation to deal with a fattening lifestyle, since the hormonal adaptations that accompany fat gain favour the readjustment of energy expenditure to energy intake. Intense physical activity would also seem to facilitate the regulation of energy balance, since it increases the energy cost of exercise, increases post-exercise energy expenditure and the potential of skeletal muscles to utilize lipids, and also favours a decrease in post-exercise intake. Moreover, the effects of intense exercise seem to be mediated by an activation of sympathetic nervous system activity that seems to be specific to skeletal muscle. It is also important to manipulate macronutrient composition in order to reduce fat intake, because unhealthy food habits can favour overfeeding and thus overcome the energy deficit caused by regular physical activity. Under free-living conditions, the combination of vigorous activity and healthy food practices can amount to a substantial weight loss which is comparable with that of other non-surgical approaches to treat obesity. © Nutrition Society 1999.","Energy balance; Exercise; Fat intake; Obesity","insulin; leptin; body fat; conference paper; energy balance; energy expenditure; exercise; fat intake; feeding behavior; food composition; human; lifestyle; lipid storage; muscle metabolism; obesity; physical activity; skeletal muscle; sympathetic tone; Adipose Tissue; Body Composition; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Homeostasis; Humans; Obesity; Weight Gain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032930302

A 7,917-bp fragment of DNA was cloned and shown to carry a 4,104-bp cluster of 5 pha genes, phaP, -Q, -R, -B, and -C. The phaP and -Q genes were shown to be transcribed in one orientation, each from a separate promoter, while immediately upstream, phaR, -B, and -C were divergently transcribed as a tricistronic operon. Transfer of this gene cluster to Escherichia coli and to a PhaC- mutant of Pseudomonas putida gave a Pha+ phenotype in both strains. Translational fusions to the green fluorescent protein localized PhaP and PhaC to the PHA inclusion bodies in living cells. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that the extremely hydrophilic protein PhaP is a storage protein and suggests that PHA inclusion bodies are not only a source of carbon, energy, and reducing equivalents but are also a source of amino acids.",,"green fluorescent protein; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; amino acid sequence; article; Bacillus megaterium; catalysis; cell inclusion; cell proliferation; gene cluster; hydrophilicity; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; operon; priority journal; protein analysis; protein localization; protein synthesis regulation; Archaea; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus megaterium; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas putida; Pseudomonas putida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032901301

PCC 7002 was studied by pulsed, time-resolved photoacoustics (PTRPA). Using 1-μs, 2 μJ or 1013 hυ cm-2 pulses at 695 nm, we observed large (42 ± 2%) Photosystem I (PS I) cyclic energy storage (ES) in the period of 2 to 12 ms after excitation with wild type (WT) intact cells. This cyclic ES was insensitive to flash interval from 0.3 to 10 s and to the presence of 1 μm DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea). At this low flash energy and in the absence of continuous background light (in the dark), antimycin A, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB), DCMU, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO), myxothiazol and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) caused little or no inhibition of PSI cyclic electron flow. When continuous background far-red light (λ &gt; 715 nm) was added during the measurement, strong inhibition by DBMIB and NEM and less by HQNO was observed, the amplitude of which was related to both concentration and the intensity of the background light. Analysis of the data with DBMIB yields its binding constant, 1 μm, and the turnover time of the system (&gt; 20 ms). A turnover time of the uninhibited system of 2-3 ms was obtained by a pump-probe method. A dramatic lifting of the partial inhibition in the presence of far-red light was caused by antimycin A and a smaller effect by myxothiazol. The rescuing effect was assigned to a 'short circuiting' of the electron flow about the cytochrome (cyt) b6/f system. Progressively increasing the laser pulse energy allowed us to calculate the PS I optical cross-section (54 ± Å). Analysis by the sensitive method of convolutions revealed a possible energy loss on the few ms time scale by antimycin A in the dark. The analysis also revealed a similar effect or artifact in uninhibited samples using the same sample illuminated with saturating continuous light, the standard procedure in photoacoustics (PA). A psaE- mutant showed more inhibition in the dark by DBMIB and with far-red light by HQNO, but less inhibition in the far-red light by myxothiazol than the WT. Under normal growth conditions, maximum ES for the psaEmutant (38 ± 2%) was similar to that of the WT (42 ± 2%). However, under mild heat stress, maximum ES for the psaE- mutant dropped to 26% while the WT maximum ES stayed unchanged at 41%, within batch-to-batch variation. These results would indicate that the PsaE protein is not essential for PS I cyclic electron flow under our experimental conditions but plays a stabilizing role in the PSI complex under a mild thermal stress.","Blue-green alga; Cyclic electron flow; Pulsed photoacoustics; Thermal efficiency","Synechococcus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032896535

The pueruli were assayed for total protein, glucose, glycogen, and lipid content. Only the lipid content differed between pueruli caught onshore and offshore (mean difference=3.1 mg or 3.4% of dry mass). The average difference in lipid content measured over this distance was used to calculate the rate of energy consumption and timing for pueruli to actively swim from the continental shelf to shore. These results confirmed previous theoretical estimates and indirect measures. Furthermore, the rate of energy consumption would allow all of the pueruli caught offshore to swim to shore based on their total measured lipids. However, some individuals with low energy stores may be energetically compromised at arrival which may affect their subsequent moulting and survival. The results of this study indicate that lipid is the primary format for energy storage of the nektonic puerulus of the spiny lobster and that these lipid reserves have sufficient energetic capacity to allow the puerulus to actively swim the distance across the shelf to settle on the coast.

The present study attempts to characterize the effect of potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg2+) cardioplegia on these mechanisms. Cellular parameters were measured by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in isolated rat hearts during 12 h of ischemia at 4°C and 2 h of normothermic reperfusion with an isoosmotic Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution. Potassium and magnesium cardioplegia (a) reduced the rate of ATP hydrolysis and cellular acidification during early stages of ischemia; (b) caused an early cessation of the phase of fast sodium influx after 40 min (P &lt; 0.001 vs 120 min with KH); (c) reduced intracellular sodium accumulation to 148-165 μmol/gdw after 12 h (P &lt; 0.01 vs 268 ± 15 μmol/gdw with KH), (d) decreased ischemic volumes to 2.7 ± 0.1 and 2.8 ± 0.1 ml/gdw after 8 and 12 h of storage, respectively (P &lt; 0.005 v 3.0 and 3.3 ml/gdw with KH). Quantitative analysis of these parameters showed that both hypothermia and cardioplegia increased the relative contribution of sodium to intracellular water accumulation by a factor of 2-2.5. In view of the marked reduction in absolute sodium and water contents, the data indicate that cold cardioplegia limits the increase in intracellular osmolarity. Myocardial mechanical and metabolic recoveries, and cellular viability deteriorated during prolongation of the ischemic period from 8 to 12 h in all experimental groups (P &lt; 0.005). Reperfusion was efficient in reversing intracellular sodium and water accumulation in hearts stored with cardioplegia, in contrast to hearts stored in KH. Magnesium, but not potassium cardioplegia, lowered interstitial water contents (P &lt; 0.01 v KH), increased intracellular magnesium concentrations (P &lt; 0.001), improved mechanical and metabolic recoveries (P &lt; 0.01) and cellular viability (P &lt; 0.001). These results indicate (a) cardioplegia reduces intracellular sodium (by ~ 46%) and water accumulation (by 66%) during cold ischemia; (b) both hypothermia and cardioplegia limit the rise in intracellular osmolarity and increase the contribution of sodium to cellular swelling; (c) intracellular sodium and water contents were dissociated from myocardial viability and recovery from cold ischemia in potassium and magnesium cardioplegic solutions. It is concluded that intracellular sodium and water accumulation are not dominant factors in determination of cardiac outcome from ischemia.","Cardiac presentation; Cellular volumes; Edema; Hypothermic ischemia; Magnesium cardioplegia; NMR spectroscopy; Potassium cardioplegia; Sodium ion","adenosine triphosphate; magnesium ion; potassium ion; sodium ion; water; animal tissue; article; cardioplegia; cell pH; cell swelling; cell viability; controlled study; cryopreservation; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle reperfusion; hydrolysis; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; osmolarity; priority journal; rat; sodium cell level; sodium transport; water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032882399

This relationship is caused by a fine matching of the reorganization energy and the free energy gap making the forward processes activationless, and hence very fast, and mismatching of these two quantities for the backreaction, therefore retarding it strongly. In this study, we show that this matching is due to a low dielectric constant of the RC's protein core because a low dielectric affects strongly electrostatic polarization components of both the reorganization energy and the equilibrium free energy of reaction. If the protein and membrane were replaced by a homogeneous medium with a high dielectric constant, the effective energy storage would be impractical.","Activation energy; Charges recombination; Charges separation; Electron transfer; Reorganization energy","Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032877028

Based on the strain energy storage theory, a criterion of pulverization was obtained and computational analysis of deformation using Mooney-type equation for stored energy was performed. The numerical results indicated that combination of compressive and shear deformation on disc of Low-Density Polyethylene stores larger amount of energy onto the sample than shear and compression alone. The experimental work was conducted using the Bridgman Anvil, in which disk-shaped samples were subjected to simultaneous twisting and axial load, at different operating conditions. The experimental data led to an identification of optimum operating conditions in which fine particles are produced with a minimum amount of agglomerates. Using experimental data from the Bridgman Anvil, criteria for pulverization were also evaluated. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

While freezing heat transfer is governed mainly by conduction, melting of a PCM generally invokes free convective currents in the melt phase depending on the orientation and geometry of the heat transfer surfaces. In this paper, a finite element simulation is carried out to predict the flow and temperature fields as well as the rate of heat storage during melting of a PCM in a horizontal cylindrical annulus heated from an isothermal inside surface. A novel yet simple method is suggested and validated numerically to enhance the heat storage rate in a PCM. The technique involves simply flipping the horizontal cylinder, i.e., turning it through 180% about its own axis, at an optimum time during the melting process. It is found that up to 18% enhancement in the energy storage rate can be achieved with this simple technique.

Flood warning systems which fail to take account of melting snow can prove highly misleading. Selected results of a study on methods for improved snowmelt forecasting using trial catchments in upland Britain are presented here. Melt models considered range from a temperature excess formulation, with the option to include wind and rain heating effects, to a full energy budget melt formulation. Storage of melt in the pack is controlled by a store with two outlets, allowing slow release of water followed by rapid release once a critical liquid water content is reached. For shallow snow packs, a partial cover curve determines the proportion of the catchment over which snow extends. The melt, storage and release mechanisms together constitute the PACK snowmelt module which provides inputs to the catchment model. Either a lumped or a distributed catchment model can be used, configured to receive snowmelt inputs from elevation zones within the catchment; a PACK snowmelt module operates independently within each zone and its inputs are controlled by appropriate elevation lapse rates. Measurements of snow depth and/or water equivalent, from snow cores or a snow pillow, are assimilated to correct for a lack of direct snowfall measurements needed to maintain a water balance during snowfall. The updating scheme involves operating a PACK module at the measurement site (the 'point model') in parallel to PACK modules in the catchment model, with point model errors being transferred using a proportioning scheme to adjust the snowpack water contents of the catchment model. The results of the assessment of different model variants broadly favour the simpler model formulations. Hourly automatic monitoring of water equivalent using the snow pillow can help in updating the model but preferential melting from the pillow can be a problem. The energy budget melt formulation proves useful in understanding the energy components of melt typical of upland Britain. It reveals that, during the main melt phase, melt can occur in almost equal measure by sensible heat exchange and by latent heat of condensation, as warm air near saturation in cloud condenses on the snowpack; net radiation makes a negligible contribution. This provides a physical explanation for the success of the simple temperature excess approach to snowmelt estimation.",,"forecasting method; snowmelt; upland region; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032846707

The data obtained lead to the following main conclusions. PolyPs are polyfunctional compounds. The main role of PolyPs is their participation in the regulation of metabolism both at the genetic and metabolic levels. Among the functions of PolyPs known at present, the most important are the following: phosphate and energy storage; regulation of the levels of ATP and other nucleotide and nucleoside- containing coenzymes; participation in the regulation of homeostasis and storage of inorganic cations and other positively charged solutes in an osmotically inert form; participation in membrane transport processes mediated by poly-β-Ca2+-hydroxybutyrate complexes; participation in the formation and functions of cell surface structures; control of gene activity; and regulation of activities of the enzymes and enzyme assemblies involved in the metabolism of nucleic acids and other acid biopolymers. However, the functions of PolyPs vary among organisms of different evolutionary levels. The metabolism and functions of PolyPs in each cellular compartment of procaryotes (cell wall, plasma membrane, cytosol) and eucaryotes (nuclei, vacuoles, mitochondria, plasma membrane, cell wall, mitochondria, cytosol) are unique. The synthesis and degradation of PolyPs in the organelles of eucaryotic cells are possibly mediated by different sets of enzymes. This is consistent with of the endosymbiotic hypothesis of eucaryotic cell origin. Some aspects of the biochemistry of high-molecular PolyPs are considered to be of great significance to the approach to biotechnological, ecological and medical problems.","Enzymes; Eucaryotes; Functions; Inorganic polyphosphates; Metabolism; Procaryotes; Structure","adenosine triphosphate; biopolymer; calcium; cation; hydroxybutyric acid; nucleic acid; nucleoside; nucleotide; polyphosphate; cell function; enzyme activity; gene activity; genetic regulation; homeostasis; membrane transport; metabolic regulation; nucleic acid metabolism; phosphate metabolism; review; Eukaryota; Prokaryota",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032843651

In the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars), female krill produce eggs cyclically. Spawning moult cycles alternate with vitellogenic moult cycles for lipid yolk accumulation. Histology shows that lipids are associated with the R cells of the digestive gland in both sexes, with the yolk platelets of mature oocytes and with the fat body cell membranes and blood lacunae in reproducing females. Mature female krill can have a total lipid content twice as high as males, mostly due to accumulation in the ovary, the fat body and the haemolymph. In contrast, in males, as well as in non-reproducing females, the highest percentage of lipids is found in the digestive gland and the haemolymph. In Meganyctiphanes norvegica, the most abundant lipid fractions are polar lipids and triglycerides, the latter being relatively low in reproducing female gonad and fat body. Triglycerides are believed to be a pure energy source and polar lipids are essential for membrane development in embryos. The fatty acid content and composition of the triglyceride and polar lipid fractions in females are different from males, related to both reproductive and dietary processes. Higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the polar lipid fraction were found in reproductive females. During the non-reproductive season, the converse was found, indicating the specific role PUFA and other fatty acids play in growth and egg production. Adaptive processes linked to reproduction were studied comparatively in three populations of the Northern krill—Clyde Sea (W, Scotland), Kattegat (E, Denmark), Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean)—all differing considerably in climatic and trophic conditions. Such adjustments in lipid synthesis and storage are viewed as reproductive strategies developed by the Northern krill in response to different environmental conditions. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Lipids; Meganyctiphanes norvegica; Northern krill; Reproductive strategies","Meganycthiphanes norvegica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032839238

However, cryoprotectant exposure may induce damage via osmotic stress. Knowledge of cell membrane permeability characteristics and their temperature dependence would facilitate the design of cryopreservation protocols in which osmotic stress is minimized and the incidence of intracellular freezing is reduced. To obtain such data, the volume change of donated human oocytes following exposure to cryoprotectant was measured at a variety of temperatures. After removal of cumulus cells, each oocyte was placed in a 5 μl droplet of phosphate-buffered medium. The oocyte was held in position by suction generated using a fine pipette and perfused with 1 ml 1.5 mol/l dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) at 30, 24 or 10°C. The volume of the oocyte before, during and after perfusion was recorded by videomicroscopy. Oocyte volume was calculated from radius measurements and the Kedem-Katchalsky (K-K) passive coupled transport coefficients, namely L(p) (hydraulic permeability), P(DMSO) (permeability to DMSO) and σ (reflection coefficient) were derived. The resulting coefficients were L(p) = 1.65 ± 0.15, 0.70 ± 0.06 and 0.28 ± 0.04 μm/min.atm; P(DMSO) = 0.79 ± 0.10, 0.25 ± 0.04 and 0.06 ± 0.01 μm/s and σ = 0.97 ± 0.01, 0.94 ± 0.03 and 0.96 ± 0.01 at 30, 24 and 10°C respectively. The activation energy for L(p) was 14.70 and for P(DMSO) was 20.82 kcal/mol. The permeability parameters of human oocytes are higher than those of murine oocytes, suggesting that they require a shorter period of exposure to DMSO with concomitantly reduced toxic effects.","Cryoprotectant; Dimethylsulphoxide; Freezing; Oocyte; Permeability","cryoprotective agent; dimethyl sulfoxide; animal cell; article; cell membrane permeability; cell volume; controlled study; cryopreservation; culture medium; female; freezing; human; human cell; nonhuman; oocyte; osmotic stress; species difference; storage; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032836225

Because sampling these tanks is difficult and expensive, samples have been collected from a single location of the headspaces, based on the supposition that this would provide representative samples. In most tanks, mixing of vapors occurs because of thermally driven convection from heat generated by radioactive decay of the waste. However, in some low-temperature tanks, the ground temperature above the tank may be warmer than the waste, minimizing thermally induced convection, and raising the concern that samples from a single location may not be representative. To resolve this issue, six samples at different vertical and horizontal locations were taken from each of three low-temperature tanks and analyzed for ammonia, water, permanent gases, total non-methane organic compound concentration, and selected organic vapors. Statistical analysis of the data indicated that the tanks did not exhibit significant horizontal or vertical concentration gradients. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"ammonia; organic compound; water; air monitoring; air pollutant; air quality control; air sampling; article; industrial hygiene; priority journal; radioactive waste storage; temperature sensitivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032836011

In order to determine whether there are such phases, we quantified seasonal change in phosphorus content in sheaths of Cenococcum geophilum-Pinus strobus (white pine) ectomycorrhizae. Our field site was a mixed deciduous forest in northern, lower Michigan. White pine needle and root growth, and density of C. geophilum sclerotia were determined weekly. Ectomycorrhizae were collected biweekly, as were buried meshes that served to index hyphal growth. Phosphorus content of sheaths of ectomycorrhizae was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of planed, frozen material. From May to Jun 1994, sheath P content declined 0.9%/d. From Jul to Oct sheath P content was low and varied little; C. geophilum hyphae grew, but needles and roots did not. The following spring from Mar to May 1995, sheath P content increased 1.2%/ d. We suggest, on the basis of synchrony of changes of sheath P content with fungal and tree growth, that three seasonal phases of P dynamics in ectomycorrhizal sheaths can be distinguished: (i) uptake in early spring before tree growth, (ii) translocation to tree and fungus during spring, (iii) depletion during summer, fall, and winter when there was only fungal growth. Phosphorus in ectomycorrhizal sheaths may be shared by tree and fungus.","Ectomycorrhizal sheath function; Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis; P storage","nodulation; phosphorus; ectomycorrhiza; phosphorus; seasonal variation; Animalia; Cenococcum geophilum; Cenococcum geophilum; Fungi; Pinus strobus; Pinus strobus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032824120

Insulin was covalently labeled at the N(ε)-amino group of Lys(B29) by a fluorescence donor and acceptor group, respectively. The labels neither affect the tertiary structure nor interfere with self-association. Equimolar solutions of pure donor and acceptor insulin hexamers were mixed, and the hybridization was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. With the total insulin concentration remaining constant and the association/dissociation equilibria unperturbed, the subunit interchange between hexamers is an entropy-driven relaxation process that ends at statistical distribution of the labels over 16 types of hexamers differing by their composition. The analytical description of the interchange kinetics on the basis of a plausible model has yielded the first experimental values for the lifetime of the hexamers. The lifetime is reciprocal to the product of the concentration of the exchanged species and the interchange rate constant: τ = 1/(c · k). Measured for different concentrations, temperatures, metal ions, and ligand-dependent conformational states, the lifetime was found to cover a range from minutes for T6 to days for R6 hexamers. The approach can be used under an unlimited variety of conditions.

However, studies of its effects on the cortical brush border membrane (BBM) and basolateral membrane (BLM) lipid concentration, which may be pertinent to renal function, have not been reported in detail. We hypothesized that FR would decrease renal work and lower renal membrane lipid concentration. The changes in lipid concentration would be most dramatic in BBM because this membrane is the entry site for the recovery of filtered ions and nutrients. Young male Fischer 344 x Brown- Norway F1 rats consumed food ad libitum (AL) or were food-restricted (FR, 60% of AL consumption) for 6 wk. AL rats had higher fractional excretions of Na+, K+, and Cl- than did the FR group (P &lt; 0.001). Renal Na,K-ATPase activity in AL rats was 100% higher than in FR rats (P 0.001), reflecting greater renal work. The work required for renal proton secretion was lower in FR than in the AL rats. In FR rats, all BBM phospholipid concentrations (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidYlcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin) were ~50% lower than in the AL rats (P &lt; 0.001). In the BLM, food restriction resulted only in lower phosphatidylcholine concentration, while the other phospholipids were unaffected. Plasma and renal membrane (BBM and BLM) cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower in FR than in AL rats. These results show that a nutritionally complete, but energy restricted, diet improves renal function. It also prevents renal membrane lipid deposition and decreases plasma cholesterol. Prolonged food restriction might attenuate the renal injury that occurs in obese humans as a consequence of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.","F344 x BNF1 rats; Food restriction; Renal function; Renal membrane lipids","adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); chloride ion; cholesterol; membrane phospholipid; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylserine; potassium ion; sodium ion; sphingomyelin; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; basolateral membrane; blood chemistry; body mass; brush border; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diet restriction; enzyme activity; food intake; kidney tubule epithelium; lipid composition; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; proton transport; rat; urinary excretion; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032816994

We have now extended the study of the ATP synthase system to an ovine NCL (a model for the late-infantile NCL variant, CLN6) and the infantile NCL (CLN1). In fibroblasts from healthy sheep, active regulation of ATP synthase in response to cellular energy demand was present similar to human cells: ATP synthase was down-regulated under conditions of anoxia or functional uncoupling and was up-regulated in response to calcium. In fibroblasts from NCL sheep, basal ATP synthase activity was slightly elevated and downregulation in response to anoxia or uncoupling of mitochondria also occurred. Calcium produced an unexpected down-regulation to 55% of basal activity. Activities of respiratory chain enzymes did not differ between healthy and NCL sheep. In fibroblasts from CLN1 patients, basal ATP synthase activity was reduced and regulation of the enzyme was absent. Activities of respiratory chain complexes II and IV were reduced. The defect of ATP synthase regulation found in fibroblasts from NCL sheep and infantile NCL patients is different from the ATP synthase deficiencies demonstrated in late-infantile and juvenile NCL, but problems of mitochondrial energy production, if also expressed in brain, would be a common feature of several NCL forms. Deficient ATP supply could result in degeneration of neurons, especially in those with high energy requirements.","ATP synthase; Fibroblast culture; Mitochondrial energy metabolism; Neurodegeneration","calcium; cytochrome c oxidase; mitochondrial enzyme; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; anoxia; cell energy; clinical article; conference paper; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; human; human cell; nerve degeneration; neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory chain; sheep; skin fibroblast",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032811447

This dry matter loss reportedly is hybrid specific. We conducted a 3-yr study at Clay Center, NE, to determine whether corn loses dry matter after R6 as it air dries. In 1995, hand-harvested ears were bagged and stored in two environments and hand-shelled on nine dates to determine kernel moisture and dry weight. In 1996, five hybrids were planted and harvested at eight dates. Six hybrids were used in 1997. In both 1996 and 1997 three storage and sampling methods were used to determine kernel moisture and weight over eight dates: (i) laboratory storage; (ii) field drydown/hand harvest; and (iii) field drydown/machine harvest. Neither processing date nor storage environment affected kernel weight as grain moisture decreased from 30 to 9%. In 1996 and 1997, corn grain yields did not differ among the eight harvest dates nor was there any interaction between hybrid and harvest date. Although corn grain yields and moisture contents differed among hybrids in both years, these differences were similar across all harvest dates. Kernel weights differed among hybrids but were consistent across harvest dates within each hybrid.

High laser performance has been achieved with C2H6: an output energy up to 3 J corresponding to a specific energy of 9.6 J/l at an efficiency of 4.7%, which strengthens the advantage of the photo-triggering technique to energize high-power HF lasers. However the optimum performance achieved with H2, 5.75 J/l and 3.5%, are lower. It is shown, through a time-resolved study of the electrical discharge and spatial dynamics correlated to laser power and energy measurements, that discharge instabilities are responsible for the poor laser performance of the mixture with H2. These instabilities, which lead to arc development, are characteristics of the discharge in Ne/SF6. It is demonstrated for the first time that addition of a heavy hydrocarbon, such as C2H6, to that mixture induces the discharge stabilization so that the laser emission arises in a homogeneous active medium. This effect allows us to achieve better laser performance than with H2. © Springer-Verlag 1999.",,"Capacitance; Electric discharges; Electric potential; Ethane; Hydrofluoric acid; Hydrogen; Ionization; Light emission; Neon; Pumping (laser); Sulfur compounds; X rays; Sulfur hexafluoride; Chemical lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032805108

The main disadvantage of the ICS systems comes from their design, i.e., because the collector absorber is also the storage cylinder it is not possible to insulate it properly and therefore there are significant losses during the night. The main cause of these losses is the convection currents created during the night, circulating around the top glass cover. Another disadvantage of the system is its draw-off characteristics. Because the water cylinder/absorber is horizontal there is very little stratification of the water in the cylinder. It is suggested that a primary 110 mm diameter cylinder is introduced at the space between the main cylinder and the glass. The cold water is introduced directly to the primary cylinder, which feeds the main cylinder. With this modification the convection currents are drastically reduced due to the obstruction created by the primary vessel, thus reducing the night thermal losses. Also as the cold water is introduced first to the primary cylinder there is no direct mixing of the two streams thus greatly improving the system draw-off characteristics This modification creates an 8% increase in the total cost of the system, which is reasonable, if the above benefits are considered © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to gain more insight into a putative role of leptin during midgestation. Therefore we have measured leptin concentrations in maternal serum and amniotic fluid using a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) employing human recombinant leptin for tracer and standard preparation [Blum WF, Kiess W, Rascher W, editors, Leptin - The voice of the adipose tissue.

In addition, estriol, hCG and alphafetoprotein were measured in maternal serum. We have asked whether or not leptin concentrations in maternal serum and amniotic fluid were related to maternal BMI and skinfold thickness. Sixty-three healthy pregnant women who were later found to deliver healthy, term children and as a control group 39 healthy non-pregnant women were included in the study. Maternal age was 35 years (median, range 24-46) and gestational age at amniocentesis 14-17 weeks (range). Leptin concentrations in maternal serum at amniocentesis were 3.2-51.9 ng/ml (range) and in amniotic fluid 2.3-30.2 ng/ml (range). Serum leptin levels from non-pregnant women were 2.7-55.4 ng/ml (range). Maternal leptin serum concentrations at the time of amniocentesis correlated significantly with BMI (r=0.54, P<0.001), and with maternal skinfold measurements (iliac r=0.53, P<0.001, subscapular r=0.44, P<0.001; triceps r=0.39, P<0.002 and biceps r=0.41, P<0.001). Similar relations of leptin serum levels and BMI (r=0.53, P=0.001) and skinfold thickness (iliac r=0.65, P<0.001, subscapular r=0.55, P<0.001, triceps r=0.34, P<0.036 and biceps r=0.38, P<0.016) were found in the non-pregnant control group. In contrast, leptin levels in amniotic fluid did not correlate with maternal BMI, skinfold thickness and leptin levels in maternal serum at midgestation. Interestingly, the amniotic fluid leptin levels of girls were significantly higher than those of boys (2.6-30.2 ng/ml (range) versus 2.3-15.6 ng/ml (range)). In conclusion, high leptin concentrations are found in maternal serum and amniotic fluid at midgestation. Maternal leptin levels and leptin levels in amniotic fluid seem to be derived from different sources. We hypothesize that leptin plays gestation-specific differential roles for the mother and the fetus.

Serum free triiodothyronine, leptin, and free fatty acid concentrations were also measured. Energy balance measurements allowed us to identify a period from 25 to 90 d, characterized by a rapid body growth rate and another from 90 to 180 d, during which body growth rate slowed. From 25 to 180 d, we found decreases in daily energy intake and expenditure, which were faster before 90 d. The first period was characterized by storage of lipid and protein. In the second period, protein deposition approached zero and the excess of ingested energy was entirely stored as fat, so that age-associated obesity began to develop. The inability of rats to maintain a stable body weight after the cessation of growth of lean body mass is not due to decreased resting metabolism but rather to a partial leptin resistance.","Developing rats; Energy balance measurements; Leptin; Resting metabolic rate","fat; fatty acid; leptin; liothyronine; protein; adolescent; animal experiment; article; body composition; body growth; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; development; energy balance; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; growth rate; male; nonhuman; obesity; protein metabolism; rat; Animalia; Rattus norvegicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032789522

Elongation of the tendon and aponeurosis of vastus lateralis muscle (dL) was directly measured by ultrasonography while subjects (n = 31) performed ramp isometric knee extension up to the voluntary maximum (MVC). The relationship between muscle force and dL was fitted to a linear regression above 50% MVC, the slope of which was defined as stiffness of the tendon structures. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between duplicated measurements of stiffness, with an interday reliability of r = 0.88 and a coefficient of variance of 6.1%. Although the stiffness was not significantly related to absolute jump height in either vertical jump, it was inversely correlated with the difference in jump height between the vertical jumps performed with and without countermovement. The results suggested that the stiffness of tendon structures has a favorable effect on stretch-shortening cycle exercise, possibly due to adequate storage and recoil of elastic energy.","In vivo measurement; Stiffness; Stretch-shortening cycle exercise; Ultrasonography; Vastus lateralis muscle","adult; article; body movement; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; jumping; male; muscle force; muscle isometric contraction; muscle stretching; normal human; priority journal; reliability; tendon; vastus lateralis muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032786208

E., Fort Collins, CO 80523, United States","The use of several lignocellulosic materials for ethanol fuel production has been studied exhaustively in the U.S.A.. Strong environmental legislation has been driving efforts by enterprises, state agencies, and universities to make ethanol from biomass economically viable. Production costs for ethanol from biomass have been decreasing year by year as a consequence of this massive effort. Pretreatment, enzyme recovery, and development of efficient microorganisms are some promising areas of study for reducing process costs. Sugar cane bagasse constitutes the most important lignocellulosic material to be considered in Brazil as new technology such as the production of ethanol fuel. At present, most bagasse is burned, and because of its moisture content, has a low value fuel. Ethanol production would result in a value-added product The bagasse is available at the sugar mill site at no additional cost because harvesting, transportation and storage costs are borne by the sugar production. The present paper presents an alternative pretreatment with low energy input where biomass is treated in a silo type system without need for expensive capitalization. Experimentally, ground sugar cane bagasse is placed in plastic bags and a peracetic acid solution is added to the biomass at concentrations of 0,6,9,15,21, 30, and 60% w/w of peracetic acid based on oven dried biomass. The ratio of solution to wood is 6:1; a seven day storage period had been used. Tests using hydrolyzing enzymes as an indicator for SSCF have been performed to evaluate the pretreatment efficiency. As an auxiliary method, a series of pre-pretreatments using stoichiometric amounts of sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide based on 4-methyl-glucuronic acid and acetate content in the sugar cane bagasse have been performed before addition of peracetic acid. The alkaline solutions are added to the raw bagasse in a ratio of 17:1 solution to biomass and mixed for 24 hours at room temperature. Biomass is filtered and washed to a neutral pH before the peracetic acid addition. According to enzymatic hydrolysis results, peracetic acid is a powerful chemical for improving enzymatic digestibility in sugar cane bagasse with no need for using high temperatures. Basic pre-pretreatments are helpful in reducing peracetic acid requirements in the pretreatment. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The values of the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Fo (initial fluorescence yield with the reaction centers in the open state), Fm (maximal fluorescence yield), Ft (steady state fluorescence yield) and the calculated parameters, Φ(o) (maximal quantum yield of Photosystem II photochemistry) and Φ(t) (actual quantum yield of Photosystem II photochemistry), strongly decreased in the presence of the metal ions coinciding with an increase in the non-photochemical deexcitation rate constant k(N). It was observed that photosynthetic energy storage measured by photoacoustic spectroscopy also decreased but a large portion of energy storage remained unaffected even at the highest metal ion concentrations used. A maximal inhibition of photosynthetic energy storage of 80% and 50% was obtained with Hg2+ and Cu2+treated thylakoids, respectively, while energy storage was insensitive to Pb2+. The results are consistent with the known predominant inhibition of the donor side of Photosystem II by the metal ions. The insensitive portion of energy storage is attributed to the possible recurrence of cyclic electron transport around Photosystem II that would depend on the extent of inhibition produced on the acceptor side by the metal ion used.","Cyclic electron transport; Fluorescence; Metal ions; Photosystem II; Thermal dissipation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032784676

In Niger, it covers one third of the Sahelian zone. These natural forests are of considerable economical interest since they are the main source of livestock forage and domestic energy. Its sustainable exploitation needs improved understanding of its dynamics. The redistribution of water between thicket and intervening bare areas is decisive for the water supply of the vegetation. Tiger bush patterning replicates an elementary unit composed of a bare area, the upslope border, the core and the downslope margin of the thicket. (Each zone of tiger bush is characterised by specific soil crusting associated with vegetation). Both water storage and runoff have been monitored after each rain, over a period of 4 yr, including contrasting rainy seasons, on the different zones composing the tiger bush. On the three crusted zones, runoff has a piecewise linear relationship with rain: on closed plots, runoff yield vs. annual rainfall ratio reaches 54% on bare soil, 2% on upslope border and 18% on downslope border. The measured infiltration confirms these rates on independent plots. In the core of the thicket, measured infiltration corresponds with the sum of the contributions of upslope zones, weighted by their relative lengths. This model predicts that bare area contributes up to 62% of the thicket supply, while direct rain is 27%, the senescence zone is 10% and the upslope border contribution is negligible (1%). The average water infiltration in the thicket is equal to 4 x the incident rainfall, but water redistribution is not homogeneous within the core of the thicket. By the most favourable location, infiltration depth is measured to be about 8 x the rainfall. The important runoff, mainly generated on the impervious bare area crosses the upslope border of the thicket without infiltrating, and entirely benefit to the core. Nothing is left to the downslope border, only rainfed. The upslope border, often described as favourable location for young plants is only rainfed most part of the year. By the end of the season, its increasing porosity, due to vegetation and termite activity let it benefit of the last rains. The simple water balance model based on runoff measurement is satisfactorily validated by independent observed infiltration.","Runoff yield; Sahel; Soil moisture storage; Tiger bush; Water balance","runoff; soil crusting; vegetation cover; water budget; (West); Niger",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032775287

Two groups of male Fisher 344 rats 3-4 week old (n = 5 per group) were pair fed for 6 weeks a diet containing 40% of its energy fat derived from either fish oil or corn oil. Epididymal fat pads from rats fed the fish oil diet weighed 25% (P < 0.05) less than those found in rats fed corn oil. The decrease in fat deposition associated with fish oil ingestion was accompanied by a significant increase in the abundance of skeletal muscle UCP-3 mRNA. The level of UCP-2 mRNA skeletal muscle was unaffected by the type of dietary oil, but the abundance of UCP-2 mRNA in the liver and heart were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in rats fed fish oil than in rats fed corn oil. In addition to inducing UCP-3 expression, dietary fish oil induced peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase gene expression 2-3 fold in liver, skeletal muscle and heart.

Flux through the cardiac FAO pathway is tightly controlled in accordance with energy demands dictated by diverse physiologic and dietary conditions. In this report, we demonstrate that the lipid-activated nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), regulates the expression of several key enzymes involved in cardiac mitochondrial FAO. In response to the metabolic stress imposed by pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondria long-chain fatty acid import with etomoxir, PPARa serves as a molecular 'lipostat' factor by inducing the expression of target genes involved in fatty acid utilization including enzymes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation pathways. In mice lacking PPARα (PPARα-/- mice), etomoxir precipitates a cardiac phenotype characterized by myocyte lipid accumulation. Surprisingly, this metabolic regulatory response is influenced by gender as demonstrated by the observation that male PPARα-/- mice are more susceptible to the metabolic stress compared to female animals. These results identify an important role for PPARα in the control of cardiac lipid metabolism.",,"etomoxir; long chain fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; conference paper; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; gene expression regulation; gene induction; heart muscle cell; heart muscle metabolism; intraperitoneal drug administration; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; sex difference; Animalia; Apogon brachygrammus; Mammalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032771096

After this initial period, the energy input and storage derived using existing empirical formulas are shown to be in balance. Based on both empirical model results and MHD simulations for this interval, it is argued that the magnetotail has two active regions that develop during the growth phase: The one in the inner magnetotail is necessary for the substorm pre-conditioning, but it is the one in the midtail region which initiates the global instability growth.

To achieve this goal extensive investigations were carried out to study the effect of presence of secondary phases on the main phase LaNi5 with reference to hydrogenation behaviour and structural-microstructural characterizations using XRD, TEM and SEM techniques. Alloys were synthesized through melt-casting with varying concentrations of secondary phases like La2Ni7, LaNi3, Ni (minor phases), i.e., 55%, 30%, 5% and 0% by a special technique of pellet encapsulation. Structural characterizations using the XRD technique confirmed the formation of secondary phases together with the major phase LaNi5. The diffraction patterns after hydrogenation did not exhibit secondary phase diffraction peaks, instead the resulting phase was found to be single phasic, exhibiting LaNi5 like diffraction patterns with an unusual intensity distribution. TEM investigations showed the presence of two types of modulated phases; one of which corresponds to a≈1.5o, c≈co and the other to a≈1.3ao, c≈co, together with the parent phase (LaNi5), in the as-synthesized and hydrogenated/dehydrogenated versions, corresponding to alloy with secondary phase concentration upto 30%, (ao and Co being lattice constants of the parent LaNi5 structure). The signature of the modulated phases were not present in XRD patterns, but could be seen in the selected area electron diffraction patterns, suggesting that modulation has taken place in local areas of the basal plane, due to ordering of hydrogen atoms. These modulated unit cells can be modeled in terms of the original lattice of LaNi5, by inserting and ordering of hydrogen atoms at viable interstitial sites. Micro structural evaluations through SEM revealed that secondary phases suppressed pulverization. Investigations of the hydrogenation behaviour of these alloys showed that hydrogen storage capacity and desorption kinetics did not decrease for minor concentrations of secondary phases, but a decrease was found for the alloys having higher concentrations of secondary phases. Similar results were obtained for alloy MmNi5, where secondary phases corresponded to Mm2Ni7 and MmNi. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

These effects of leptin bring about decreased body weight. In vivo, leptin potentiates basal and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization, presumably its oxidation, and decreases fat storage. Leptin increases sympathetic-mediated energy dissipation, and the expression of uncoupling proteins-1, -2, and -3. In peripheral tissues (muscles, adipose, others), leptin decreases triglyceride content by increasing fatty acid oxidation, decreasing the activity/expression of esterification and lipogenic enzymes, and favoring lipolysis. It decreases the lipogenic activity of insulin. Ultimately leptin depletes fat stores and promotes leanness. NPY, taken as one example of what an orexigenic agent may produce, increases food intake and body weight. It favors fat storage in adipose tissue by stimulating lipogenic activity. It decreases glucose utilization by muscles, making more glucose carbon available for lipogenesis. Effects of NPY result from vagus nerve-mediated hyperinsulinemia and overactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Thus, NPY factors fat stores, and ultimately obesity. Glucocorticoids are necessary for NPY effects to occur, because central administration of the neuropeptide in adrenalectomized animals is ineffective. Glucocorticoids also have genuine effects when administered centrally to normal rats. They increase the hypothalamic content of NPY and decrease that of CRH. This double neuropeptidic change stimulates food intake, insulin output, adipose tissue storage ability, decreases the expression of uncoupling proteins-1 and -3, and increases body weight. Body weight homeostasis appears to require a finely tuned regulation of both leptin and glucocorticoids, with their respective opposite effects.",,"carbon; corticotropin releasing factor; glucocorticoid; glucose; insulin; leptin; neuropeptide; neuropeptide Y; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein; adipose tissue; adrenalectomy; animal experiment; animal tissue; body weight; calorie; cell stimulation; conference paper; controlled study; enzyme activity; esterification; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; glucose utilization; homeostasis; hyperinsulinemia; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus; insulin release; lean body weight; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; muscle tissue; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; nutrient; obesity; protein expression; rat; sympathetic function; weight reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032763008

Communities composed of more nutritional plants (i.e., higher nutrient concentrations) lose higher percentages of production to herbivores, channel lower percentages as detritus, experience faster decomposition rates, and, as a result, store smaller carbon pools. These results suggest plant palatability as a main limiting factor of consumer metabolical and feeding rates across communities. Hence, across communities, plant nutritional quality may be regarded as a descriptor of the importance of herbivore control on plant biomass ('top-down' control), the rapidity of nutrient and energy recycling, and the magnitude of carbon storage. These results contribute to an understanding of how much and why the trophic routes of carbon flow, and their ecological implications, vary across plant communities. They also offer a basis to predict the effects of widespread enhancement of plant nutritional quality due to large-scale anthropogenic eutrophication on carbon balances in ecosystems.","Carbon storage; Decomposition; Herbivory; Plant community; Primary production","carbon; plant community; primary production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032753812

High-temperature ashing/hydrolysis (Ash/Hydrol.) and Acid Persulfate methods were examined for their ability to quantitatively convert a range of organic-P compounds to orthophosphate. The Ash/Hydrol. method recovered on average 99% of organic-P compounds tested, including phosphonates (compounds with C-P bonds). Contrary to concerns voiced in prior studies, we found no P loss due to volatilization in seawater samples. Poor recovery by the Acid Persulfate method was observed for two compound classes: phosphonates and phospholipids. The Ash/Hydrol. method is recommended for routine TDP analyses. The hydrolysis of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) during the phosphomolybdate-blue reaction and the subsequent overestimation of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) have long been a concern. Extent of hydrolysis of standard DOP compounds was evaluated both during this reaction and over long-term acidified (pH 1.0)/refrigerated and unacidified/frozen storage. Eleven of 12 compounds tested hydrolyzed <2% during the phosphomolybdate-blue reaction. Phospholipid, phosphosugar, and nucleotide mono- and diphosphate standards stored acidified/refrigerated over 2.5 months were <5% hydrolyzed; compounds with higher energy phosphate bonds (e.g., phosphocreatine) hydrolyzed to a greater extent. A natural seawater sample showed no hydrolysis over 80 d, however, suggesting that refrigerated storage of acidified samples is a viable option. Seasonal DOP profiles from the Eel River Shelf quantified by the Ash/Hydrol. and Acid Persulfate methods yielded comparable results, indicating that the DOP pool at this site did not contain significant phospholipids or phosphonates, which are underrecovered by the Persulfate method. Recoveries using a third method, Nitrate Oxidation, were on average 7% lower. Surface-water DOP exceeded DIP in summer and was apparently related to biological productivity, underscoring the need to include organic species when evaluating nutrient limitation and creating nutrient budgets.",,"accuracy assessment; measurement method; phosphorus; Eel River Shelf; Pacific Ocean; Anguilliformes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032746427

A potential effect of increases in nutrient supply to the lake's floating papyrus is increasing of the plants' investment in above-water material and reduction of the amount of energy invested in uptake and storage. Biomass and its allocation between culms, panicles, roots, and rhizomes was measured in 17 sites around the 150-km2 lake. Although above-water biomass was greatest in sites closest to the lake's major nutrient inflow, the River Malewa, there was little evidence of corresponding decreases in the biomass of uptake and storage tissues. In August 1995, the average ± SD biomass of papyrus in the lake was 11,540 ± 3020 g/m2, with the papyrus containing about 4500 ± 1900 g total carbon/m2 and about 100 ± 70 g total nitrogen/m2. Plant nitrogen contents did not vary with distance from the main external nutrient supply. Together with low nitrogen concentrations in the plants (0.60 ± 0.26 in culms and 0.99 ± 0.50% in rhizomes), very high carbon to nitrogen ratios (49 ± 20:1) and nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere explaining only about half of the plants' nitrogen, papyrus is a likely net sink for nitrogen supplied from the lake's increasingly cultivated watershed. Despite this role, clearance of papyrus in favor of agriculture partly explains the reductions in the area of papyrus within the lake basin from 48 km2 in the late 1960s to 14 km2 in 1995.","Assimilation; Carbon; Eichhornia crassipes; Nitrogen; Nitrogen storage; Nitrogen uptake; Rhizomes; Swamps","biomass allocation; lake; nutritional status; Kenya; Lake Naivasha; Cyperus; Cyperus papyrus; Cyperus papyrus; Eichhornia; Eichhornia crassipes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032745986

The seasonal variation of evaporation is shown: lowest in spring when the ground is frozen, highest in summer (although daytime evaporative fractions are only 0.4), and lower again in fall after frost. The surface sensible heat flux in contrast is high in spring, when evaporation is low. Evaporation is much higher when the surface, including the moss layer, is wet. At all temperatures (in summer), evaporative fraction falls with increasing light level, because of the high vegetative resistance of the forest system. Using a Monin-Obukhov formulation and a bulk vegetation model, the vegetative resistance for the boreal spruce forest system is calculated. This bulk vegetative resistance decreases with increasing photosynthetic radiation, decreases sharply with relative humidity, decreases with increasing surface water storage, and is lower on cloudy days than on sunny days with the same incoming photosynthetic radiation. Vegetative resistance at its midmorning minimum is lower by a factor of 4 when the moss surface is very wet. As over grassland sites, the lower surface resistance to evaporation directly influences the diurnal cycle of lifting condensation level and cloud-base height, which are much lower on days with a wet surface. The reduction of vegetative resistance under cloudy skies at the same incoming radiation level presumably reflects the more efficient use of diffuse radiation by the canopy for photosynthesis. Vegetative resistance is roughly doubled in spring, when the ground is frozen, and is higher in fall after frost. About 63% of the observed variance in vegetative resistance can be explained in terms of meteorological variables using multiple linear regression. Some measurement issues are addressed in an appendix. The residual in the energy balance falls with increasing wind speed, which may be due to a small (10%-15%) underestimation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes at low wind speeds. During spring melt, however, this residual has a high daytime value of 30% of net radiation. The residual is also much higher on sunny days than on cloudy days.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Climate control; Condensation; Evapotranspiration; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Boreal spruce forest; Multiple linear regression; Surface energy balance; Vegetative resistance; Forestry; climate modeling; evaporation; heat flux; solar radiation; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032745593

The gains of the controllers are determined from the power system operating conditions and the rating of the SMES unit. Unequal α-mode of firing angle control of the converters is utilized to enforce zero energy transfer in the SMES unit under steady state conditions.

Their utilization first involves mobilization from adipose tissue through lipolysis. The release of individual fatty acids from adipose tissue is selective in vitro and in vivo in animal studies and also in human subjects. Generally, fatty acids are more readily mobilized from fat cells when they are short-chain and unsaturated. This selectivity could affect the storage of individual fatty acids in adipose tissue, and their subsequent supply to tissues. The nature of the dietary fats could affect lipid homeostasis and body fat deposition. Dietary fish oil influences adipose tissue development in a site-specific manner as a function of diet and feeding period. A diet high in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) results in a preferential partitioning of ingested energy towards oxidation at the expense of storage. Fatty acids are important mediators of gene expression in the liver. Indeed, genes encoding both glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes and key metabolic enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation are regulated by dietary PUFA. White adipose tissue could also be a target for PUFA control of gene expression. The treatment of pre-adipose cells by fatty acids induces the expression of numerous genes that encode proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism. The mechanisms of PUFA-mediated repression of gene expression in adipocytes seem to be different, at least partly, from those described in liver. Tissue-specific and site-specific factors are possibly involved in the specific effect of PUFA on gene expression, although other mechanisms cannot be excluded.","Dietary obesity; Gene regulation; Polyunsaturated fatty acids","docosahexaenoic acid; fatty acid synthase; fish oil; icosapentaenoic acid; lipid; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; short chain fatty acid; unsaturated fatty acid; adipocyte; animal experiment; animal tissue; body fat; conference paper; fat intake; gene expression regulation; human; lipid metabolism; lipolysis; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; rat; white adipose tissue",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032732951

A preliminary assessment revealed that methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were the contaminants of most concern. Because these contaminants are persistent, accumulate in tissues, and biomagnify up the food chain, piscivorous wildlife are the biota at greatest risk of exposure. The objective of this study was to estimate the risks posed by methylmercury and PCBs to two piscivorous species: mink and belted kingfishers. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate total daily intakes of each contaminant by each species and then integrated the resulting distributions with their respective dose-response curves to estimate risks. The results indicate that methylmercury poses a moderate risk to female mink (24% probability of at least 15% mortality) and kingfishers (50% probability of at least a 12-28% decline in fecundity depending on location). The PCBs pose a very serious risk to mink (52% probability of at least a 50% decline in reproductive fecundity), a species known to be especially sensitive to the effects of organochlorine substances, but little risk to kingfishers (<5% probability of a decline in reproductive fecundity greater than 10% at any location).","Kingfisher; Mercury; Mink; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Probabilistic risk assessment","methylmercury; polychlorinated biphenyl; bird; fecundity; fish; methylmercury; mortality; PCB; risk assessment; water pollution; article; fertility; mink; nonhuman; nuclear waste; priority journal; risk assessment; United States; waste disposal; water contamination; Oak Ridge; Tennessee; United States; Alcedinidae; Animalia; Aves; cellular organisms; Mustela vison; Populus berolinensis; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032730763

CONCLUSION: At higher BMI levels, Polynesians were significantly leaner than Europeans, implying the need for separate BMI definitions of overweight and obesity for Polynesians. The regression equations using BIA, height and weight or skinfold thicknesses were good predictors of body composition in Polynesians.","Anthropometry; Bioelectrical impedance; Body composition; Body mass index; Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; Maori; Polynesians; Samoans","absorptiometry; adult; aged; article; body composition; body height; body mass; body weight; ethnic group; female; human; human experiment; lipid storage; male; multiple regression; normal human; obesity; Polynesia; priority journal; skin conductance; skinfold; Bia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032730386

A molded polycrystal adhering to one of the vertical walls in the vessel was made to grow by cooling the opposite wall. The behavior of natural convection in the solution was visualized using granulated tracers. In addition, local changes in solution temperature were also measured. In the neighborhood of the growing polycrystal, upward flows develope through the decerase in concentration of solution due to crystal growth, as well as by the increase in temperature due to the latent heat of crystallization. Dilute solution transferred upward is retained at the top of the vessel to form a horizontal rolling cell there. After that, ascending dilute solution is retained above the cell, and forms a second cell. Finally, horizontal multi-layers are established in the liquid phase. Moreover, the effects of cooling rate and flow structure on the crystal growth is discussed.

Feed intake was restricted in the grain-fed group with the intention of producing equivalent growth rates in the two treatment groups, but this resulted in significantly slower weight gain, reduced carcass weight, and reduced subcutaneous and intramuscular fat. Nevertheless, the glycolytic potential (an estimate of pre-slaughter glycogen) in the M. longissimus dorsi lumborum was approximately 20% higher (P < 0.05) in the grain-fed cattle, while the ultimate pH of the meat was equivalent for both groups. The results suggest that grain-based diets can increase muscle glycogen concentrations independent of the higher calorific intake normally associated with grain diets, probably in response to changes in rumen fatty acid production. Compared with grain diet, pasture diet resulted in significantly higher (P < 0.01) muscle tocopherol content, but did not influence meat colour. The dietary treatments influenced fat colour, but both carotene content and energy intake may be responsible for this effect. The microbiological profile of meat during chilled storage was not affected by diet. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Beef; Creatine kinase; Fat colour; Glycogen; Lactate dehydrogenase; Maize; Meat colour; Microbiology; Pasture; PH; Stress; Tocopherol","Animalia; Bos taurus; Lolium; Trifolium; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032727593

However, a specific role for glycogen has not been determined. We have characterized SMEG53, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis that contains a mutation in glgE, encoding a putative glucanase. This mutation causes exponentially growing SMEG53 cells to stop growing at 42°C in response to high levels of glycogen accumulation. The mutation in glgE is also associated with an altered growth rate and colony morphology at permissive temperatures; the severity of these phenotypes correlates with the amount of glycogen accumulated by the mutant. Suppression of the temperature-sensitive phenotype, via a decrease in glycogen accumulation, is mediated by growth in certain media or multicopy expression of garA. The function of GarA is unknown, but the presence of a forkhead-associated domain suggests that this protein is a member of a serine-threonine kinase signal transduction pathway. Our results suggest that in M. smegmatis glycogen is continuously synthesized and then degraded by GlgE throughout exponential growth. In turn, this constant recycling of glycogen controls the downstream availability of carbon and energy. Thus, in addition to its conventional storage role, glycogen may also serve as a carbon capacitor for glycolysis during the exponential growth of M. smegmatis.",,"article; bacterial growth; cell viability; glycogen metabolism; Mycobacterium smegmatis; nonhuman; priority journal; Mycobacterium smegmatis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032724559

The timing of maximum sediment transport can, however, also be related to mixing and routing of water and sediment from different sources. In this study suspended sediment transport was studied in the River Rhine between Kaub and the German-Dutch border. As concentrations decrease over a runoff season and as the relationship between water discharge and suspended sediment concentrations during most floods is characterized by clockwise hysteresis, it is concluded that sediment depletion occurs during a hydrological year and during individual floods. However, analyses of the sediment contribution from the River Mosel indicate that clockwise hysteresis may result from sediment depletion as well as from early sediment supply from a tributary. Thus, although the suspended sediment behaviour in the downstream part of the River Rhine is partly a transport phenomenon related to energy conditions, mixing and routing of water from different sources also plays an important role. Suspended sediment transport during floods was modelled using a 'supply-based' model. Addition of a sediment supply term to the sediment rating curve leads to a model that produces better estimates of instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations during high discharge events. A major constriction of the model is that it cannot be used to predict suspended sediment concentrations as long as the amount of sediment in storage and the timing of sediment supply are unknown.

The review consists of four parts. The first part is an introduction which considers the operational needs for an active neutron personal dosemeter. There does appear to be a need for an electronic neutron personal dosemeter, although it is not established that the demand for such a device is great. The relative magnitude of photon and neutron doses and dose rates in the nuclear industry has changed owing to the increased shielding of the photon component. Changes in fuel burnup and new fuel types have increased neutron exposure. Work on plant refurbishment or decommissioning will also increase neutron dose rates, and for these workplaces there may be sudden dose rate fluctutations in space or time. However, in the UK in 1996 for example, of 12,000 classified workers monitored for neutrons, there were only 100 recorded neutron doses of greater than 1 mSv. In the second part, the physics of personal neutron dosemeters is outlined and summaries are given of detection techniques. It is clear that the development of a practical electronic neutron dosemeter is difficult. Effort has been devoted by many research and development groups over several decades without complete success. The basic difficulty is the requirement to measure very small depositions of energy from neutron radiation which have to be recognised in the presence of photon and electron radiation. This basic difficulty is compounded by the present need to determine lower doses than hitherto. Brief summaries are given of techniques which are being applied to the development of an active neutron personal dosemeter, or are thought to be possible options for the future. The techniques considered are: low pressure (tissue-equivalent) proportional counters (TEPCs), thin semiconductors with event size analysis; two diode devices; multi-diode 'spectrometers'; detector arrays such as charge coupled detector devices; 6Li or 10B sandwich spectrometers; radfets (field effect transistors); direct ion storage devices; memory devices; organic semiconductors; light pipes; GM tubes; organic films; advanced gas detectors; advanced silicon devices; and bubble detectors. Published papers up to mid-1998 have been considered. The third part summarises the performance and metrological requirements which have been proposed for neutron dosemeters by national and international standards and/or regulatory authorities. The fourth part of the review draws conclusions and suggests future action. Of devices presently being studied, it is considered that the more likely candidates for a successful outcome are, in the short term, direct ion storage or bubble detectors, and in the longer term, charge coupled detectors, memory devices or optical fibres.",,"boron 10; fuel; glass fiber; ion; lithium; silicon; diode; electron radiation; film dosimeter; human; isotope labeling; light; meteorology; neutron dosimeter; neutron radiation; nuclear industry; nuclear power plant; occupational exposure; personal monitoring; photon; radiation detector; radiation dose; radiation energy; radiation equipment; radiation exposure; radiation field; radiation shield; review; semiconductor; spectrometer; standard; United Kingdom",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032722494

Objective: We investigated the behavioral and biological consequences of consumption of a 1-MJ snack by subjects in a satiety state. Design: Eleven lean young men were deprived of time cues and subjected to continuous blood withdrawal over each of 4 sessions scheduled 2 wk apart. The first session was a basal session designed to determine the following in each subject: 1) the amount eaten in an ad libitum lunch: 2) the temporal patterns of plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, fatty acids, and triacylglycerols between lunch and the spontaneous dinner request; and 3) the latency of the dinner request. In the 3 other sessions, each subject ingested the same lunch as in the basal session and a nutritionally well- balanced snack either 5 min before his individual peak of hyperglycemia observed in the first session, 40 min after this peak, or 120 min before the time he had requested his dinner in the first session. Results: There was no significant difference in latency of the dinner request or the energy intake at dinner between sessions. Insulin secretion increased but glucose profiles did not change significantly regardless of the time of snack intake. Conclusion: A snack consumed in a satiety state fails to prolong the intermeal interval and would thus tend to favor storage.","Appetite control; Behavioral responses; Fatty acids; Glucose; Hormonal responses; Insulin; Men; Postprandial metabolic responses; Satiety; Snack","glucose; insulin; adult; article; behavior; caloric intake; dietary intake; food composition; food intake; human; human experiment; insulin release; male; normal human; satiety",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032716389

In this study, we focus on issues to attain confidence in the durability of EC devices for energy efficient architectural glazing. The environmental conditions that EC glazing are subjected to, are detailed and discussed. Comparisons are made to actual prototype, real time EC window exposure testing. Testing of EC mirrors and liquid crystal glazing is compared to EC glazing. During testing of glazing in Arizona, surface temperatures of 56-65°C (uncolored-colored) were measured on EC glazing panels, with ambient air temperature of 40°C. The usual panel heating rate ranged from 14.3°C/h to 21°C/h. The steepest swing occurred during a thunderstorm with a 40°C rise in 15 min. In EC testing studies in Yokohama, it was determined that indoor testing and outdoor testing did not achieve the same results, with outdoor testing being more severe. It was also determined that the critical test parameters were temperature, solar intensity (especially UV), depth of coloration, charge capacity and change in transmittance. As a result of this study, we recommend a regimen of testing covering thermal cycling, UV stability, thermal storage and thermal shock. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

These cities have a variety of synoptic-scale climates and surface cover and structural morphologies. In all cases the 'measured' storage heat flux is determined as the energy balance residual from direct observations of net all-wave radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes conducted using the same radiometer and eddy correlation techniques. Databases describing the surface characteristics around each site are developed from analysis of aerial photography and field surveys. Results indicate that storage heat flux is a significant component of the surface energy balance at all sites and is greatest at downtown and light industrial sites. Hysteresis behavior, of varying degrees, is seen at all locations. A simple objective hysteresis model (OHM), which calculates storage heat flux as a function of net all-wave radiation and the surface properties of the site, is found to perform well in the mean for most cases, with the notable exception of Tucson; but considerable scatter is observed at some sites. Some of this is attributed to the moisture, wind, and synoptic controls at each of the sites, and to hour-to-hour variability in the convective fluxes that the OHM does not simulate. Averaging over 2 to 3 h may be a more appropriate way to use the model. Caution should be used when employing the OHM in windy environments.",,"energy balance; heat flux; urban area; urban climate; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032714170

Methods: The subjects were 545 premenopausal (aged 16-55 years; mean ± standard deviation, 37.7 ± 9.1 years) and 219 postmenopausal (aged 45-65 years, 58.0 ± 5.0 years) women. Baseline characteristics included age, body mass index (BMI), and menopausal status (premenopause or postmenopause). The ratio of trunk fat to leg fat (trunk-leg ratio) was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The trunk-leg ratio and baseline characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. In all subjects (n = 764), possible correlations between the trunk-leg ratio and the baseline characteristics were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. In postmenopausal women, the relationsip of the trunk-leg ratio to YSM or age after adjusting for BMI was investigated. Results: The trunk-leg ratio and BMI were significantly higher in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. In all subjects, age and BMI were positively correlated with the trunk-leg ratio (r = 0.445 and 0.587, respectively, p < 0.0001). Menopause was also positively correlated with the trunk-leg ratio on univariate regression analysis (standardized regression coefficient = 0.369, p < 0.0001). On multiple regression analysis, age, BMI, and menopause were independently correlated with the trunk-leg ratio (p < 0.05). In postmenopausal women, age and YSM were positively correlated with the trunk-leg ratio, independent of the BMI (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Menopause contributes to a change in body-fat distribution, irrespective of aging or obesity.","Aging; Body-fat distribution; Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; Menopause; Obesity","adolescent; adult; aged; aging; article; body fat; body mass; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; lipid storage; menopause; multiple regression; multivariate analysis; normal human; obesity; postmenopause",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032708453

During daytime, the heat storage term (S) was a considerably larger sink of energy in open water as compared to the vegetated communities (Phragmites and Scirpus). During nighttime, S was a significant source of energy in all three communities. As compared to the evapotranspiration (ET) from Phragmites and Scirpus, the evaporation (E) from open water (averaged over the measurement period) was about 25% smaller during daytime and three times larger during the night. The diurnal pattern of ET in Phragmites and Scirpus generally followed that of R(n). The diurnal pattern of the open water E, however, did not follow R(n); rather, it seemed to depend on thermal stability conditions and air dryness.

Mechanistic and intervention studies support that fat possesses a lower satiating power than carbohydrate and protein, and a diet low in fat therefore decreases energy intake. The effect of dietary fat on energy balance is enhanced in susceptible subjects, particularly in sedentary individuals with a genetic predisposition to obesity who consume a high fat diet. Dietary carbohydrate promotes its own oxidation by an insulin-mediated stimulation of glucose oxidation. In contrast, high fat meals do not increase fat oxidation acutely. A sedentary life-style and low physical fitness cause a low muscular fat oxidation capacity, and the consumption of a high fat diet by these individuals promotes fat storage in a synergistic fashion. Ad libitum low fat diets cause weight loss proportional to pre-treatment body weight in a dose-dependent way, i.e. weight loss is correlated positively to the reduction in dietary fat content. Increased physical activity prevents relapse after weight loss and studies have shown that those who keep up a higher level of physical activity are more successful in maintaining the reduced body weight. In conclusion, important interactions exist between genetic make up, dietary fat and physical fitness, so that a low fitness level and susceptible genes reduce muscular fat oxidation capacity which may decrease the tolerance of dietary fat. Increasing daily physical activity and reducing dietary fat content may be more effective when combined than when separate in preventing weight gain and obesity.","Body weight; Dietary fat; Exercise; Fitness; Genetics; Macronutrients; Weight loss","body weight; caloric intake; conference paper; controlled study; diet; fat intake; female; fitness; genetic predisposition; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; nutrient; obesity; physical activity; priority journal; weight reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032702731

Female Large White x Landrace pigs (n = 66) were used in this study. To obtain initial body composition, six pigs were slaughtered at 57 kg live weight, whereas the remaining pigs were allocated to one of six dietary treatments (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 g/kg CLA, containing 55% of CLA isomers). The diets, containing 14.3 MJ digestible energy (DE) and 9.3 g available lysine per kg, were fed ad libitum for 8 wk. Dietary CLA had no significant effect on average daily gain (861 vs. 911 g/d for pigs fed diets with and without CLA, P = 0.15) or feed intake (2.83 vs. 2.80 kg/d, P = 0.74). The gain to feed ratio was increased by dietary CLA by 6.3% (0.328 vs. 0.348, P = 0.009).

Similarly, the ratio of fat to lean tissue deposition decreased linearly (-0.093 ± 0.0216 for each gram per kilogram increase in CLA concentration; P < 0.001) with increasing dietary CLA. The carcass lean tissue deposition response to dietary CLA was quadratic in nature and was maximized (+25%) at 5.0 g/kg dietary CLA. Overall, dietary CLA increased the gain to feed ratio and lean tissue deposition and decreased fat deposition in finisher pigs.","Body composition; Conjugated linoleic acid; Growth; Lipid deposition; Pigs","fat; linoleic acid; lysine; animal experiment; article; body composition; controlled study; diet; dose response; female; growth; high performance liquid chromatography; lipid storage; nonhuman; swine; Animalia; Pieris brassicae; Rodentia; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032700772

We cloned the cDNA encoding Lymnaea NPY (LyNPY), purified and sequenced the peptide, and used synthesized peptide for physiological and morphological studies. Increasing the LyNPY titer in nonparasitized snails (mimicking parasitosis) by 1) implantation of slow- release pellets and 2) injections suppressed reproductive activity and reduced growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner without affecting food intake. When the LyNPY titer was back to normal, reproduction and growth were resumed, coinciding with a transient increase of food intake serving to replenish glycogen stores. Observations on double-immunostained whole mount preparations of brains support these data. A close association was found between LyNPY-positive axons and axons both from ovulation hormone-producing neurons and molluscan insulin-like peptide-producing neurons involved in regulation of growth. As no synaptic(-like) contacts were observed, it is supposed that LyNPY acts nonsynaptically. No morphological interaction was found between LyNPY-positive axons and motoneurons innervating the feeding apparatus.

In addition, investigations were performed on the effects of HtR used to restore liver oxidative metabolism in the middle of a prolonged (24 h) hypoxic preservation period. A histidine-lactobionate-raffinose solution was used for the initial cold portal flush in all groups. Results showed that cold hypoxia for either 5 or 10 h yielded livers capable of similar recoveries of ATP, energy charge, and total adenine nucleotides, but that HtR after 24 h cold preservation resulted in reduced regeneration of ATP, a lower energy charge, and a fall in tissue adenine nucleotides. When livers were stored for 24 h but subjected to brief HtR after either 5 or 10 h before return to hypoxic storage, improved recoveries of the energy metabolites were seen over those recorded after 24 h hypoxia alone. The fact that these improvements were not due to an improved supply of adenine nucleotide precursors was demonstrated by studying groups which were given HtR with perfusate containing precursors of adenine nucleotides (adenosine, adenine, and inosine) after 24 h cold hypoxia. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that poor metabolic recovery after long-term hepatic cold preservation results more from decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation than from a lack of precursors for adenine nucleotide resynthesis. In addition, restoring oxidative metabolism at hypothermia for brief periods can to some extent protect final metabolic status after prolonged storage.","Energy metabolism; Hypothermic reperfusion; Interrupted hypoxia; Liver preservation","adenine nucleotide; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cryopreservation; energy metabolism; isolated liver; liver ischemia; liver metabolism; liver transplantation; male; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; rat; reperfusion; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032700675

The nuclear receptor known as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) was found to play a role in regulating mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, suggesting that PPARα may be involved in the transcriptional response to fasting. To investigate this possibility, PPARα-null mice were subjected to a high fat diet or to fasting, and their responses were compared with those of wildtype mice. PPARα-null mice chronically fed a high fat diet showed a massive accumulation of lipid in their livers. A similar phenotype was noted in PPARα-null mice fasted for 24 hours, who also displayed severe hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia, hypothermia, and elevated plasma free fatty acid levels, indicating a dramatic inhibition of fatty acid uptake and oxidation. It is shown that to accommodate the increased requirement for hepatic fatty acid oxidation, PPARα mRNA is induced during fasting in wildtype mice. The data indicate that PPARα plays a pivotal role in the management of energy stores during fasting. By modulating gene expression, PPARα stimulates hepatic fatty acid oxidation to supply substrates that can be metabolized by other tissues.",,"fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; adipose tissue; animal experiment; article; controlled study; diet restriction; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid oxidation; hypoglycemia; hypothermia; lipid storage; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory mechanism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032699670

Its clinical efficacy requires the presence of insulin and involves several therapeutic effects. Of these effects, some are mediated via increased insulin action, and some are not directly insulin dependent. Metformin acts on the liver to suppress gluconeogenesis mainly by potentiating the effect of insulin, reducing hepatic extraction of certain substrates (e.g. lactate) and opposing the effects of glucagon. In addition, metformin can reduce the overall rate of glycogenolysis and decrease the activity of hepatic glucose-6phosphatase. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle is enhanced by metformin. This has been attributed in part to increased movement of insulinsensitive glucose transporters into the cell membrane. Metformin also appears to increase the functional properties of insulin- and glucose-sensitive transporters. The increased cellular uptake of glucose is associated with increased glycogen synthase activity and glycogen storage. Other effects involved in the blood glucose-lowering effect of metformin include an insulin-independent suppression of fatty acid oxidation and a reduction in hypertriglyceridaemia. These effects reduce the energy supply for gluconeogenesis and serve to balance the glucose-fatty acid (Rändle) cycle. Increased glucose turnover, particularly in the splanchnic bed, may also contribute to the blood glucose-lowering capability of metformin. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin-mediated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, which activates post-receptor insulin signalling pathways. Some other effects of metformin may result from changes in membrane fluidity in hyperglycaemic states. Metformin therefore improves hepatic and peripheral sensitivity to insulin, with both direct and indirect effects on liver and muscle. It also exerts effects that are independent of insulin but cannot substitute for this hormone. These effects collectively reduce insulin resistance and glucotoxicity in type 2 diabetes. © Adis International United.

The Bowen ratio - energy balance method was used to calculate latent and sensible heat fluxes. This paper presents results from the open water area. The heat stored in water (G) was found to play a major role in the energy exchange over the water surface. During daytime, G consumed 45-60% of R(n), the net radiation (seasonally averaged daytime G was about 127 W m-2). At night, G was a significant source of energy (seasonally averaged nighttime G was about -135 Wm-2). The diurnal pattern of latent heat flux (λE) did not follow that of R(n). On some days, λE was near zero during midday periods with large R(n). The diurnal variability in λE seemed to be significantly affected by temperature inversions formed over the cool water surface. The daily evaporation rate (E) ranged from 2 to 8 mm during the measurement period, and was generally between 70 and 135% of the equilibrium rate.","Evaporation; Heat storage; Inversion; Marsh","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; energy flux; evaporation; midlatitude environment; prairie; wetland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032697008

In order to establish the kinetics of the reaction, parameters such as linear velocity of the fluid through the reactor, particle size, substrate concentration, substrate molar ratio, temperature and water activity were studied. Operational and storage stability of the enzyme were also assessed. The reaction followed Michaelis-Menton kinetics as observed from the relationship of initial rate of the reaction as a function of substrate concentration. It was found that the optimum substrate concentration was 0.15M palmitic acid and isopropyl alcohol in 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. Inhibition by excess of isopropyl alcohol has been identified. The optimum temperature for the esterification reaction was found to be around 50°C. The activation energy of this process was determined to be 43.67 kJ/mol. The optimum water content was 0.50%. The reaction rates were measured in the absence of any significant external diffusional limitations.

The occurrence of resilin, a rubberlike protein, in mobile joints suggests that the automatic twisting mechanism of the leading edge by aerodynamic force works not by flexibility but by the elasticity of these joints. First, it should result in elastic energy storage in the distal areas of the wing. Second, serial elastic elements of wing presumably act as dampers of an aerodynamic force, which are responsible for gradual twisting of the leading edge.",,"insect protein; resilin; unclassified drug; article; elasticity; flying; insect; joint; joint function; microscopic anatomy; nonhuman; vein",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032694389

Additionally, the RUM method possesses the merits of easy formulation, easy programming and more realistic switch modeling, as well as greater accuracy and higher time efficiency when compared with commonly used state-space approaches.

Measurements of passive ventilation rates are needed for resolution of several safety issues, including rates of flammable gas ventilation, drying rates of organic salt-nitrate salt mixtures, and estimation of organic liquid waste surface area. Both He and SF6 met the criteria of having low background levels in the tank headspaces, being rapidly dispersed in the headspace, and remaining well-mixed for the duration of the experiments. However, SF6 was lost at a faster rate than He from higher-temperature tanks. This accelerated loss was attributed to beta radiolysis of the SF6 associated with its large electron-capture cross-section. Thus, SF6 is not a reliable tracer in these high-level radioactive waste storage tanks. Passive ventilation rates were significantly different among the tanks studied and also exhibited temporal variation within given tanks. Ventilation rates were higher than expected based on modelling of barometric pressure fluctuations.

The ability to store as much energy as possible for the least weight is of paramount importance to these systems. The rotor configurations employed in these machines can vary greatly in shape, physical properties and stress distribution, as defined by the rotor's shape factor. This paper employs a unique approach to discriminate between vastly different rotor configurations based on a completely general derivation for the shape factor of constant thickness spinning rotors. The shape factor is used in conjunction with the rotor's maximum allowable operational stress and effective density to determine the maximum stored energy density of an individual rotating machine. These predictive techniques are then used to compare two composite rotor designs which have been built for electromagnetic pulsed power generation. These two machines are the laminated disk built by Kaman and the rim rotor built by CEM. Our analyses have determined that the true discriminator between these two designs is the allowable stress each can operate at since they both have about the same shape factor and composite density. The laminated disk design is limited by the interlaminar shear strength of the epoxy bond, while the rim rotor design is able to take full advantage of the strength limit of the composite fiber. These predictions are compared to test results for both machines. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Electric vehicles; Laminated composites; Rotating disks; Rotors; All electric combat vehicle; Laminated disk; Rim rotor composite designs; Rotating machinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032681153

They can be trained to predict results from examples, are fault tolerant, are able to deal with non-linear problems, and once trained can perform prediction at high speed. ANNs have been used in diverse applications and they have shown to be particularly useful in system modeling and for system identification. The objective of this work was to train an ANN to learn to predict the useful energy extracted and the temperature rise in the stored water of solar domestic water heating (SDHW) systems with the minimum of input data. An ANN has been trained based on 30 known cases of systems, varying from collector areas between 1.81 m2 and 4.38 m2. Open and closed systems have been considered both with horizontal and vertical storage tanks. In addition to the above, an attempt was made to consider a large variety of weather conditions. In this way the network was trained to accept and handle a number of unusual cases. The data presented as input were the collector area, storage tank heat loss coefficient (U-value), tank type, storage volume, type of system, and ten readings from real experiments of total daily solar radiation, mean ambient air temperature, and the water temperature in the storage tank at the beginning of a day. The network output is the useful energy extracted from the system and the temperature rise in the stored water. The statistical R2-value obtained for the training data set was equal to 0.9722 and 0.9751 for the two output parameters respectively. Unknown data were subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of prediction. These include systems considered for the training of the network at different weather conditions and completely unknown systems. Predictions within 7.1% and 9.7% were obtained respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method can successfully be used for the estimation of the useful energy extracted from the system and the temperature rise in the stored water. The advantages of this approach compared to the conventional algorithmic methods are the speed, the simplicity, and the capacity of the network to learn from examples. This is done by embedding experiential knowledge in the network. Additionally, actual weather data have been used for the training of the network, which leads to more realistic results as compared to other modeling programs, which rely on TMY data that are not necessarily similar to the actual environment in which a system operates. © Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Heat storage; Learning systems; Neural networks; Solar collectors; Weather forecasting; Solar domestic water heating (SDHW) systems; Solar water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032681110

The characteristics and design process involved with current generation systems - as practiced by BII - are also discussed in some detail. Finally, a specific boxed waste assay system and acceptance test results are presented. This system was developed by BII and installed at the Waste Receiving and Packaging (WRAP) facility in Hanford, Washington in early 1997. The WRAP system combines imaging passive/active neutron (IPAN) techniques with gamma-ray energy analysis (GEA) to assay crates up to 2.5 m×2.5 m×6.5 m in size. (Systems that incorporate both these methodologies are usually denoted IPAN/GEA types.) Two separate gamma-ray measurements are accomplished utilizing 16 arrayed NaI detectors and a moveable HPGe detector, while 3He detectors acquire both active and passive neutron data. These neutron measurements employ the differential die-away technique and coincidence analysis, respectively. Both neutron measurements use BII's proprietary imaging methodology. Acceptance testing of the system was conducted at Hanford in January 1998. The system's operating performance was evaluated based on accuracy and sensitivity requirements for three different matrix types. Test results indicate an average 13% active mode accuracy for 10 nCi/g loadings of Pu waste and 5% passive mode accuracy for 10 g loadings of Pu waste. Sensitivity testing demonstrated an active mode lower limit of detection (LLD) of less than 5 nCi/g of 239Pu for the medium matrix and less than 20 pCi/g of fission and activation products at 3σ above background.",,"Assays; Gamma rays; Imaging techniques; Neutron detectors; Nondestructive examination; Plutonium; Boxed transuranic waste assay systems; Coincidence analysis; Detection limit; Differential die-away technique; Gamma-ray energy analysis (GEA); Imaging passive/active neuron (IPAN) techniques; Nondestructive assay (NDA) systems; Waste receiving and packaging (WRAP) systems; Radioactive waste storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032680782

The depleting nature of primary energy resources, negative environmental impact of fossil fuels and low exergetic efficiencies obtained in conventional space heating and cooling are the main incentives for developing alternative heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) techniques which can employ low density and interrupted energy sources. In this respect, in spite of difficulties primarily encountered in coupling wind energy with conventional space heating and cooling equipment, wind energy seems to be an exciting alternative provided that synectic combinations are pursued and applied. In this paper, a new wind turbine coupled hybrid HVAC system is presented, which consists of an optimum combination of convective and radiant heating and cooling systems with in-space thermal energy storage. A design case for a single family home is presented. In this study a 6 kW(e) wind turbine drives a ground source heat pump (GSHP) which is coupled to a hybrid HVAC system to satisfy the thermal loads of a 100 m2 home. In this example, sensible heating and cooling loads are satisfied by the high mass radiant floor which matches the daily peak demand and the available peak wind energy. Latent heating and cooling loads, along with ventilation requirements are satisfied by a forced-air system. Variable radiant and convective split type of control is implemented, and both systems are served by the same GSHP which also satisfies the domestic hot water (DHW) demand.",,"Air conditioning; Cooling; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Heat pump systems; Thermal load; Ventilation; Wind power; Exergetic efficiency; Hybrid panel systems; Space heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032679350

The reproducibility of the gun in subsequent shots is found to be better than 10%, and the gun-to-gun difference is less than 15%. Assuming a symmetry of eight guns, the contour maps of the electron plasma density are plotted as function of time. The plasma density becomes maximum near the gun nozzle and near the inner coaxial electrode. The plasma density is low in the area between the coaxial electrodes during the early time of the discharge. At a later time, the plasma fills the space between the two guns more uniformly.

These signals are used by the control circuit to make the converter inject the proper compensating current and regulate the dc-side current or voltage of the converter. In this paper, a new adaptive linear neuron (ADALINE)- based control scheme for a modular single-phase active power-line conditioner is proposed. Two ADALINEs are used to process the signals obtained from the line. The first ADALINE (the Current ADALINE) estimates the discrete Fourier coefficients of the distorted line current signal which will be used to construct the modulating signals of a number of current-source inverter (CSI) modules, each dedicated to eliminate a specific harmonic. The second ADALINE (the Voltage ADALINE) estimates the fundamental component of the line voltage signal to be used as the synchronizing signal for the regulation of the Idc of the CSI modules. This information can also be used in the compensation of the voltage sags and swells in a more advanced phase of the project. Both ADALINEs have the ability to track the variations in the system frequency. Power losses are reduced by adjusting the Idc in each CSI module according to the magnitude of the corresponding harmonic current. Fast response and accuracy of the ADALINE combined with fast response and low dc energy storage requirement of CSI topology, makes the above scheme a suitable on-line technique for high power applications. The theoretical expectations are verified by digital simulation using EMTDC simulation package.",,"Active filters; Computer simulation; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Electric network topology; Fourier transforms; Harmonic generation; Linear control systems; Neural networks; Online systems; Active power filter; Active power line conditioners; Adaptive linear neuron based controller; Current source inverter; Discrete Fourier coefficients; Distorted line current; Harmonic current; Line voltage signal; Voltage sags; Adaptive control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032676596

The successful experiences obtained with filter capacitors were followed by a technology transfer to the energy storage field, with some different constraints, which necessitated a better knowledge of the performance limits of this new technology.

The results showed that the 30 &lt; Ni &lt; 70 at.% composition could be amorphized with a milling time strongly dependent on the starting chemical compositions. The investigation on the early stage of MA showed that the different compositions amorphized by two different paths. On the magnesium rich side of 30-70 at. % Ni, the as-milled powders first formed the intermetallic compound Mg2Ni, which subsequently destabilized into the amorphous phase.

However, operational optimization of the clinker burning process is still important for reducing emissions. Trials were therefore carried out by the Research Institute of the Cement Industry on several kiln systems to investigate the influence of the method of pulverized coal preparation on the formation of NO in a rotary kiln flame. These showed that the abatement potential of this procedure depends on the adjustment and type of the burner and on the coal fineness normally used. One precondition is that the pulverized coal is burnt in an internally staged flame with a well defined internal recirculation zone of the type which can, for example, be achieved by using modern rotary kiln burners. The results are in agreement with investigations which were carried out as part of the CEMFLAME programme of the International Flame Research Foundation (IFRF). Even if finer grinding of the pulverized coal - which is associated with higher energy consumption - cannot be undertaken for operational reasons the results show that optimization of the coal storage, homogenization and metering systems still provide an opportunity for smoothing the combustion conditions and hence for reducing NO peaks.",,"Cement additives; Coal; Coal combustion; Energy utilization; Exhaust gases; Flame research; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Optimization; Process engineering; Pulverized fuel; Rotary kilns; Clinker burning process; Cement manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032667261

This system includes three different functions: (i) uninterruptible power supply (UPS); (ii) improvement of power quality; (iii) peak-load shaving. The UPS application has a long tradition and is used whenever a reliable power supply is needed. Additionally, nowadays, there is a growing demand for high quality power arising from an increase of system perturbation of electric grids. Peak-load shaving means in this case the use of renewable energy stored in a battery for high peak-load periods. For such a multifunctional application large lead-acid batteries with high power and good charge acceptance, as well as good cycle life are needed. OCSM batteries as with positive tubular plates and negative copper grids have been used successfully for a multitude of utility applications. This paper gives two examples where multifunctional energy storage systems have started operation recently in Germany. One system was installed in combination with a 1 MW solar plant in Herne and another one was installed in combination with a 2 MW wind farm in Bocholt. At each place, a 1.2 MW h (1 h-rate) lead-acid battery has been installed.

The coaxial electrode system consists of cylindrical anode and conic cathode. The discharge is initiated by copper wire in the interelectrode gap of 0.8-2.5 mm. The conditions of multipulsc discharge current appearance, at the pulses number 5-15 (in comparison with usual multipulse regime 2-3 pulses), amplitude 0.5-1.0 MA and single pulse duration 50200 us, are determined. The speeds of arc movement (1.5-3.0 km/s) and arc channel expansion (0.2-0.4 km/s), by means of high-speed camera, were measured. The efficiency of energy transfer from the power supply (capacitor storage) to the arc was about 85% and from the arc to gas-90%. The electrodes erosion 30-40% less, in comparison with usual multipulse regime, was founded. Besides the anode and cathode total erosion was 30-40 mg/C at passed charge up to 800 C. The results estimation of different mechanisms contribution to heat transfer from the arc to surrounding hydrogen are discussed. It was shown that both repeated dissipation of arc plasma internal energy after arc extinction and the shock waves, appearing at the break-downs of interelectrode gap, increase the efficiency of gas heating.

While silicon (Si) based electronic materials and devices continue to play a dominant role in much of the electrical power industry, novel high-power and high-temperature materials are of great interest to the electric combat systems community. The technical interest in silicon carbide (SiC) is mainly due to its ability to operate at greatly elevated power and temperature (>300° C) levels compared to its Si-based counterpart. High-power and temperature pulsed-power electronics can be exploited by future military combat systems, which could potentially provide significantly improved combat vehicle performance including increased lethality through extending the maximum obtainable gun performance using advanced electric weapon concepts such as electrothermal-chemical (ETC) and electromagnetic (EM) gun technologies. The results of recent experiments conducted at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) : and the University of Delaware demonstrate the electrical behavior of SiC and metal ohmic-contact layers as a function of thermal stress. It has been determined from these experiments that both ititanium (Ti) and tantalum (Ta) metalization structures will provide a stable electrical ohmiccontact with n-type SiC at elevated temperatures for short bursts of time that are considered relevant for pulsed-powered electric weapon technologies. The Ti-SiC structure investigated exhibited a stable current-voltage (I-V) characteristic to as much as 800° C for a 10-min burst, while Ta ihetalizations provided a stable I-V characteristic on SiC even after a temperature burst of 1,000° C for as long as a 3-min interval. For samples of n-type, 4H SiC, metalized with (Ti), the standard deviation in resistance (resistivity) of the measured samples is less than 0.17 ohms for a sample having an average resistance of 4.45 ohms. The Ti-SiC sample was exposed to an elevated temperature range of 300-1,120° C. For the Ta contact on SiC, the standard'deviation in resistance is 0.05 ohms for a sample having an average resistance of 4.25 ohms over a temperature range of 600-1,120:° C. The experiments showed that for both Ti and Ta metalized SiC samples, the change in resistivity of annealed samples is between 3.8% and 1.2% compared to the average values of sample resistance based upon the I-V measurement technique used. These results indicate the ability of Ti-SiC and Ta-SiC structures to perform in a stable manner without significant electrical degradation to the metal contact, SiC substrate, or the metal-semiconductor interface as a function of high-temperature burst conditions. © 1999 IEEE.","power conditioning and energy storage","Electromagnetic launchers; Kinetic energy; Ohmic contacts; Semiconductor materials; Substrates; Velocity; Electric weapon; High temperature materials; Power conditioning; Silicon carbide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032664585

Hard X-ray radiation (E = 20...100 keV) generated by the DPF device with energy storage about 3 kJ makes it possible to have an X-ray photo of any fast movable object for example rotating car wheel tire.

The hydrogen reservoir capacity depends on the pretreatment temperature under H2, which has been shown to correspond to the creation of anionic vacancies in the solid by the loss of H2O. In the conditions in which the incorporation of hydrogen in the solids occurs, X-ray diffraction analysis under H2 show shifts depending on the treatment temperature and corresponding to a lattice expansion attributed to the insertion of hydrogen species of hydridic nature in the anionic vacancies. © 1999 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The decay and recovery of Cr3+ signal, with and without CVL illumination respectively, was monitored at different temperatures in 10-300 K region.

It can be used for reflectometry and in-plane diffraction studies of thin films under ambient conditions. Due to the exponential decay of the incident spectrum, the whole useful energy range between 3 keV &lt; E &lt; 35 keV is not available simultaneously. Absorbing the highly-intensive low-energy part of the spectrum, the specular reflectivity can be recorded up to qz &gt; 12.5 nm-1 using maximum angles of incidence and exit of αi, = αj ≈ 2°. Up to qz = 5 nm-1 the intensity is high enough to detect small angle Bragg peaks of a fatty acid salt multilayer separated by ΔE = 2π/(dαi), (d is the multilayer period) in about 15 s with sufficient counting statistics. After normalization by the incident spectrum the energy-dispersive reflectivity spectrum provides information similar to that from an angular-dispersive experiment, but in a much shorter time. Besides the specular reflectivity, our set-up provides the possibility of simultaneous measurement of the in-plane momentum transfer (grazing incidence diffraction). For in-plane lattice parameter measurements a second detector is attached on a circle perpendicular to the plane of incidence. As in the angular-dispersive set-up, it enables investigation of the in-plane arrangement of a fatty acid salt multilayer in about 15 s. Keeping the in-plane Bragg angle (2Θ ≈ 30°) fixed, the respective in-plane Bragg peaks appear for different energies and can be selected by changing αi.","Interface roughness; Lattice parameter; Layer thickness; Process control of thin film covering; Time-resolved structural analysis of thin films and multilayers; X-ray diffraction; X-ray reflectometry","Diffractometers; Fatty acids; Interfaces (materials); Lattice constants; Process control; Spectrum analysis; Storage rings; Thin films; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray reflectometry/diffractometry; Reflectometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032658837

The concrete slab acts as heat accumulator and permits dissipation of the load using, for instance, cooling towers. When using such systems the external climatic conditions limit the achievable water temperature. The convective loads, however, directly affect the room air temperature and reduce the storable part of the load. The ventilation system also has a large influence on the energy related operation of such a system. Moreover, the dimensions of the concrete slab and the layout geometry of the water pipes, especially the spacing, are important factors for the design of the system. A model is described which can be used to illustrate the transient two dimensional heat flow in such a construction. This method is suitable for simple hand calculations, but can also be integrated into existing building simulation programs without having to modify the program code. Thus, the complete system can be designed for practical applications to ensure optimum operation.

Limeil Valenton, Villeneuve St. Georges, France","The large plasma electrode Pockels cell (PEPC), which has originally been developed at LLNL for high energy 4 pass laser amplifier, has been taken up in the megajoule laser project (LMJ) at CEA. Nevertheless, a few alternative technologies and methods have been taken into account to build the first prototype. The frame of both, 2 cm thick, plasma chambers have been cast in one piece of polycarbonate. They are refilled with He+1%O2 at pressure around 1 mbar. Each chamber is equipped with 20 cathodes and 20 anodes. Each cathode is in series with a 10 Ω ballast resistor. Each anode is in series with a 10 Ω or 5 Ω ballast resistor. The electrodes are made of solid graphite plus carbon fiber material. According to the switching function of LMJ, the KDP's electrical driver has to produce 2 pulses of amplitude Vπ = 17 kV, 650 ns apart, with a rise and fall time of 100 ns. After a general description of this PEPC, experimental results and theoretical considerations show how we got 2 plasma electrodes with a very good homogeneity and a low resistivity since the plasma current peaks at 1400 A when the 5 μF energy storage capacitor is charged to 4 kV. Finally, the design of the plasma current supply and the 17 kV pulser is presented.

To achieve a high standard of living the energy supply must be safe, reliable and affordable for everybody. Moreover, the energy supplied to the customers should be usable for various applications. This suggests electrical energy, which can be easily transformed to all the needs of the customer: power, heat, light and communication. Therefore the trend to increase the utilization of electricity in customer applications will continue in the future. Electrical energy, however, suffers from some disadvantages: transportation is only possible over limited distances and needs a network; also direct storage systems for large capacity systems are mainly in the prototype and demonstration phases of development. The introduction of hydrogen will help to overcome these difficulties as it can be easily produced by electrical energy via electrolysis and reconverted to electricity by power plants.

The function of these capacitors is to filter and to store electrical energy. Accelerated aging tests showed that the increase of the internal resistance ESR of the capacitors is a good indicator of their faulty state. The filter function is affected by the capacitors wearout on the one hand. At high frequency, the voltage ripple at the terminals of the capacitors increases according to ESR rise. On the other hand, the storage function is not much influenced by the capacitors aging. As static converters work most of the time at variable load, high transient values of the voltage ripple occur when output current changes that can induce false alarms. These transients are verified theoretically and experimentally. In order to avoid these transients effects, we suggest to monitor the fundamental component of the voltage ripple. This latter waveform is the best signature of the capacitors state. The ESR of the capacitors and the time before their failure are deduced from the processing of this waveform with other converter parameters such as input voltage, output current and ambient temperature. © EDP Sciences 1999.",,"Aging of materials; Electric currents; Electric resistance; Failure analysis; Static converters; Transients; Waveform analysis; Fault prediction method; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032652795

The decay rate of diffusion coefficient in Mg2Ni with DOD is much quicker than that in Mg1.9V0.1Ni0.8Al0.2.

This feature is suitable for memory applications, since the device can be programmed from an unstressed state to a stressed state with a ratio greater than 104. The change in conductivity is attributed to the creation of a large concentration of silicon dangling bond states during current stressing which form a defect band with a low activation energy for current transport. In this paper, we consider the use of current induced conductivity in hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H) multi-layer structures and show that, in principle, highly complex three dimensional circuits could be made.

The easy tunable FEL operation in the whole UV range is mainly limited by the mirrors losses, which should be maintained low even in the very hostile environment generated by the broadband high power spectrum of the undulator, extending to X rays, and which action lead to the mirrors degradation. Dedicated mirror measurements have been then developed in LURE, in the visible and in the UV range, for checking the mirrors performances before insertion in the optical cavity and after degradation. In order to insure a wide tunability range and large output power of the FEL, Low total losses are crucial for FEL oscillation at shorter wavelengths.

The concept pursued in this paper is the generation of syngas low in carbon, where most of the heating value of the coal fuel is carried by hydrogen. Catalytic shift reactors convert most of the CO in the syngas into CO2, which is subsequently removed by physical absorption and then compressed to make it suitable for transport and permanent storage. Energy balances, performance, and cost of electricity are evaluated for two plants based on a Texaco gasifier and a large, heavy-duty gas turbine giving an overall IGCC power output between 350 and 400 MW. In one plant, the raw syngas exiting the gasifier is cooled in a high-temperature, radiative cooler; in the other it is quenched by the injection of liquid water. With respect to ' 'conventional'' Texaco IGCCs, the reduction of specific CO2 emissions by 90 percent reduces LHV efficiency from 5 to 7 percentage points and increases the cost of electricity of about 40 percent.

The principal economical results are described. It is evident that the hydrogen-price is too high for energy-technology. One of the reasons is the high storage-price for pressurized hydrogen. A price-reduction is possible if also the electrolytical oxygen is used, for instance in a waste-water purification plant. The storage problem can be solved if one lets react the hydrogen with carbon dioxide. The reaction product is methanol, a liquid energy-carrier for which exists the distribution infrastructure. The principles of this energy-technology (to store energy by reaction-products of hydrogen and carbon-dioxide) are known, because nature has applied it for millions of years in plants. But a lot of details have to be developed. The introduction of this new technology requires considerable efforts in the development of procedures, catalysts, apparatus, materials.

In this study, optimum reactor control yielded exergetic efficiencies up to 71%, which should translate to overall solar to electric conversion efficiencies of around 20%.",,"Exergy analysis; Exothermic reactor; Solar to electric conversion; Thermochemical power systems; Thermodynamic irreversibility; Ammonia; Dissociation; Electric power systems; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Thermodynamics; Waste heat utilization; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032641498

AECV uses a prime power source, such as a diesel, to provide mechanical energy which is converted to electrical energy and stored in a central energy storage system consisting of flywheels, batteries and/or capacitors. The combination of prime power and stored energy powers the vehicle drive system and also advanced weapons subsystems such as an ETC or EM gun, electrically driven lasers, an EM armor system and an active suspension. Every major system is electrically driven with energy reclamation when possible from braking and gun recoil. Thermal management of such a complicated energy transfer and utilization system is a major design consideration due to the substantial heat rejection requirements. In the present paper, an overall integrated thermal management system (TMS) is described which accounts for energy losses from each subsystem component, accepts the heat using multiple coolant loops and expels the heat from the vehicle. VITMAC simulations are used to design the TMS and to demonstrate that a conventional TMS approach is capable of successfully handling vehicle heat rejection requirements under stressing operational conditions. © 1999 IEEE.","Hybrid electric vehicle; Integrated thermal management; Thermal modeling","Capacitors; Computer simulation; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electromagnetic launchers; Energy dissipation; Flywheels; Military vehicles; Ordnance; Thermal variables control; All electric combat vehicle; Hybrid electric vehicle; Thermal management system; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032634988

In order for these studies to be more than academic exercise, their long term goals and near term objectives must be part of a path toward a system assembly consistent with the efficiency, volume and mass requirements of viable tactical applications. In addition, it is not suitable in this context to pursue techniques, which may be lower risk in their own right, but place unacceptable or unachievable demands on other components within the system. Selection of development alternatives should not be made based on component figures of merit alone, but should consider the interactions and interfaces between components and subsystems such as discharge reaction torque, projectile acceleration profile, charging requirements, heat rejection requirements, parasitic mass and overall system efficiency. When taken in that perspective, approaches considered suboptimal as components can contribute to improved system viability. Evaluation of EM armament characteristics should be conducted ill the technology environment of future systems. Combining electric combat vehicle requirements for energy storage and pulsed power into integrated subsystems dramatically reduces armament space and weight claims. Significant advantages have been quantified for EM armament in that context which are unavailable for other approaches. Achieving these benefits requires development of subsystems which meet aggressive, but attainable goals. Previous analyses have investigated the system impact of EM armament with efficiencies, volumes and auxiliary requirements derived from specific subsystem configurations. This paper presents a portion of an analyses to determine what performance levels EML subsystems must achieve to enable EM armament in future weapons systems. In particular, this paper presents the sensitivity of EML viability to (1) the power per unit volume of a pulsed power supply, (2) the efficiency of that power supply, (3) the launch event efficiency, (4) the number of rounds stowed, and (5) the maximum projectile energy attainable. The result is a definition of the minimum performance levels useful for the tactical application considered. Development of alternatives that do not recognize these high system level requirements will not lead to tactical advantages compared to conventional systems. This analysis indicates that EML technology can provide a viable armament alternative for future armored land combat systems requiring high energy projectiles and high on-board projectile count. In order to achieve that goal pulsed power supplies must realize 8000 kW/m3 with efficiency exceeding 60%. In addition, the pulsed power must support a system including launch efficiency exceeding 70% for large caliber or 55% for medium caliber armament. © 1999 IEEE.","Army after next; Combat vehicles; Electromagnetic launchers; Hybrid electric","Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric vehicles; Military vehicles; Ordnance; Power electronics; Army after next vehicle; Electric combat vehicle; Pulsed power supply; Electromagnetic launchers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032634874

When the plant loses utility power (which typically happens two or three times a year), the BESS will provide up to 5 MW of power at 4160 VAC in support of all the plant loads. Since the critical loads are not isolated, it is necessary to carry the entire plant load (maximum of 5 MVA) for a short period immediately following an incident until non-critical loads have been automatically shed. Plant loading typically peaks at 3.5 MVA with critical loads of about 2.1 MVA. The BESS also provides the manufacturing plant with customer-side-of-the-meter energy management options to reduce its energy demand during peak periods of the day. The BESS has provided a reduction in monthly electric bills through daily peak-shaving. By design, the battery can provide up to 2.5 MWh of energy and still retain 2.5 MWh of capacity in reserve to handle the possibility of a power outage in protecting the critical loads for up to 1 h. By storing energy from the utility during off-peak hours of the night in the batteries when the cost is low (US4.5¢ per kWh), GNB can then discharge this energy during high demand periods of the day (US$14.50 per kW). For example, by reducing its peak demand by 300 kW, the lead-recycling centre can save over US$4000 per month in its electric bills. The BESS at Vernon represents a first large-scale use of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries in such a demanding application.

This testing uses computer-based data acquisition and control equipment, active electronic loads and power supplies, and customized software, to enable sophisticated test regimes which simulate actual use conditions. These simulated-use tests provide more accurate performance and life evaluations than simple constant resistance or current testing regimes. Several organizations are cooperating to develop simulated-use tests for utility-scale storage systems, especially battery energy-storage systems (BESSs). Some of the tests use stepped constant-power charge and discharge regimes to simulate conditions created by electric utility applications such as frequency regulation (FR) and spinning reserve (SR). Other test profiles under development simulate conditions for the energy-storage component of remote-area power supplies (RAPSs) which include renewable and/or fossil-fuelled generators. Various RAPS applications have unique sets of service conditions that require specialized test profiles. Almost all RAPS tests and many tests that represent other stationary applications need, however, to simulate significant time periods that storage devices operate at low-to-medium states-of-charge without full recharge. Consideration of these and similar issues in simulated-use test regimes is necessary to predict effectively the responses of the various types of batteries in specific stationary applications. This paper describes existing and evolving stationary applications for energy-storage technologies and test regimes which are designed to simulate them.

The absolute values of the relative partial molar enthalpy and entropy of the dissolved hydrogen in Ti0.42Zr0.08Fe0.50-H are comparable to TiFe-H. The relative partial molar enthalpy and entropy of hydrogen absorption decreases with the increase of hydrogen content in the α phase of Ti0.42Zr0.08Fe0.50-H and more or less remain constant in the α + β phase. © 1999 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The experimental evidence of the new `T Model' is proved by means of several experimental results. The physical consistency of the `T Model' is shown to reside in the temperature exponential behavior of the Fowler-Nordheim current.

Information storage, update and appropriate retrieval are controlled at the molecular level by the neuronal cytoskeleton which serves as the internal communication network within neurons. Information flow in the highly ordered parallel networks of the filamentous protein polymers which make up the cytoskeleton may be compared to atmospheric flows which exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations, i.e. long-term memory. Such long-range spatiotemporal correlations are ubiquitous to real world dynamical systems and is recently identified as signature of self-organized criticality or chaos. The signatures of self-organized criticality i.e. long-range temporal correlations have recently been identified in the electrical activity of the brain. The physics of self-organized criticality or chaos is not yet identified. A recently developed non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed long-range spatiotemporal correlations as intrinsic to quantum-like mechanics governing flow dynamics. The model visualises large scale circulations to form as the result of spatial integration of enclosed small scale perturbations with intrinsic two-way ordered energy flow between the scales. Such a concept maybe applied for the collection and integration of a multitude of signals at the cytoskeletal level and manifested in activation of neurons in the macroscale. The cytoskeleton networks inside neurons may be the elementary units of a unified dynamic memory circulation network with intrinsic global response to local stimuli. A cell dynamical system model for human memory circulation network analogous to atmospheric circulations network is presented in this paper. The model like the analysis of Koruga et al. make use of certain connections to the concept of Cantorian-Fractal spacetime. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Clermorit-Ferrand/Theix, 63122 Saint-Genès-Champanelle, France","Current research on lipid metabolism in ruminants aims to improve the growth and health of the animals and the muscle characteristics associated with meat quality. This review, therefore, focuses on fatty acid (FA) metabolism from absorption to partitioning between tissues and metabolic pathways. In young calves, which were given high-fat milk diets, lipid absorption is delayed because the coagulation of milk caseins results in the retention of dietary fat as an insoluble clot in the abomasum. After weaning, the calves were fed forage- and cereal-based diets containing low levels of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) but leading to high levels of volatile fatty acid (VFA) production by the rumen microflora. Such differences in dietary FA affect: i) the lipid transport system via the production of lipoproteins by the intestine and the liver; and (ii) the subsequent metabolism of lipids and FA by tissues. In preruminant calves, high-fat feed stimulates the secretion of triacylglycerols (TG)-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL)). Diets rich in polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) stimulate the production of chylomicrons by the intestine (at peak lipid absorption) and of high density lipoproteins by the liver, leading to high blood concentrations of cholesterol. High levels of non-esterified FA (NEFA) uptake by the liver in high-yielding dairy cows in early lactation leads to TG infiltration of the hepatocytes (fatty liver). This is due to the low chronic capacity of the liver to synthesise and secrete VLDL particles. This abnormality in hepatic FA metabolism involves defects in apolipoprotein B synthesis and low availability of apolipoproteins and lipids for VLDL packaging. Fatty liver in calves is also caused by milk diets containing either soybean oil (rich in n-6 PUFA), or coconut oil (rich in C12:0 and C14:0). The ability of muscle tissue to use FA as an energy source depends on its mitochondrial content and, hence, on many physiological factors. The uptake and partitioning of LCFA between oxidation and storage in muscle is regulated by the activity of key intracellular enzymes and binding proteins. One such protein, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) controls the transport of LCFA into mitochondria. Metabolites derived from LCFA inhibit glucose oxidation, decrease the activity of CPT I and decrease the efficiency of ATP production by mitochondria. Most research on tissue lipid metabolism in ruminants is focused on: i) the partitioning of FA oxidation between intracellular peroxisomes and mitochondria in the liver and in muscles; (ii) the regulation of lipid metabolism by leptin, a recently discovered hormone secreted by mature adipocytes; and iii) the effects of activation of the nuclear receptors (PPARs and RXR) by LCFA or by phytol metabolites derived from chlorophyll. © Inra/Elsevier, Paris.","Fatty acid; Lipid nutrition; Liver; Metabolism; Muscles; Preruminant; Ruminant","Animalia; Glycine max; fatty acid; animal; blood; bovids; cattle; comparative study; heart muscle; homeostasis; intestine absorption; lipid metabolism; liver; metabolism; muscle; physiology; rat; review; transport at the cellular level; Animals; Biological Transport; Cattle; Fatty Acids; Homeostasis; Intestinal Absorption; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Muscles; Myocardium; Rats; Ruminants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032601784

However, temperatures of fuel sub-assemblies in power reactors usually cannot be directly measured. A means therefore has been devised to use heat removed by coolant from fuel sub-assemblies following a reactor trip to estimate the pre-trip average fuel temperatures and fuel-to-coolant heat transfer coefficients. Sub-assembly coolant mass flow and outlet temperature measurements are used to determine the heat removed. After accounting for the contribution from release of stored heat from non-fuel components and from decay heat, the contribution due to release of fuel-stored heat alone during the trip transient can be inferred. Average fuel temperatures and fuel-to-coolant heat transfer coefficients of the FBR “MONJU” at 45% thermal power were estimated using this energy balance approach.

Three of the 90Sr methods evaluated at Brookhaven National Laboratory can reduce analysis time by more than 50%. They were (a) an Environmental Measurements Laboratory Cerenkov technique and (b) two commercially available products that utilize strontium-specific crown-ethers supported on either a resin or membrane disk. Method independent inter-laboratory bias was &lt;12% based on 90Sr results obtained using both U.S. Department of Energy/Environmental Measurements Laboratory and U.S. EPA/National Environmental Radiation Laboratory samples of known activity concentration. Brookhaven National Laboratory prepared a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable 90Sr tap-water sample used to quantify test method biases. With gas proportional or liquid scintillation counting, minimum detectable levels (MDLs) of 37 Bq m-3 (1 pCi L-1) were achievable for both crown-ether methods using a 1-L processed sample beta counted for 1 h. The primary radiological contaminants of the Brookhaven National Laboratory groundwater samples were 3H (14.8-518 kBq m-3) and 90Sr/Y (37 Bq m-3-18.5 kBq m-3). Thirty samples were above the ILS. EPA drinking water standard of 300 Bq ni~3 for beta emitting ""Sr. Regression of paired data sets showed that both crown-ether methods quantified ""Sr levels to within 5% of the ""EPA method results"" for samples greater than the drinking water standard and within 30-40% for samples less than the drinking water standard. The Cerenkov method, with a minimum detectable level of 150 Bq m~3, was only useful for samples greater than the drinking water standard and underestimated """"Sr levels by 13%. Precision, as measured by the relative percent difference and mean difference statistics, was acceptable for both crown-ether methods when compared to the paired ""EPA method"" results.

This fast pace in PPARγ research was triggered by two main discoveries. Firstly, that PPARγ was shown to have a key role in adipogenesis and be a master controller of the 'thrifty gene response' leading to efficient energy storage. Secondly, the discovery that its synthetic ligands, the thiazolidinediones, are promising insulin sensitizing drugs, which are currently being developed for the treatment of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. More recently this nuclear receptor emerged from a role limited to metabolism (diabetes and obesity) to a power player in general transcriptional control of numerous cellular processes, with implications in cell cycle control, carcinogenesis, inflammation, atherosclerosis and immunomodulation. This widened role of PPARγ will certainly initiate a new flurry of research, which will not only refine our current often partial knowledge of PPARγ but more importantly also establish that this receptor has a definite role as a primary link adapting cellular, tissue and whole body homeostasis to energy stores.","Adipogenesis; Adipose tissue; Cofactors; Fatty acids; Gene expression; Insulin resistance; Nuclear receptors; Prostaglandin; Thiazolidinediones; Transcription; Type II diabetes","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; leptin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; transcription factor; tumor necrosis factor alpha; cell receptor; insulin; transcription factor; adipose tissue; apoptosis; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; cancer; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; human; immunomodulation; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein protein interaction; review; adipose tissue; animal; cell cycle; energy metabolism; genetics; microbody; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Cycle; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Insulin; Microbodies; Obesity; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Transcription Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032588487

Care System, Baltimore, MD, United States","Digital radiography (DR) has recently emerged as an attractive alternative to computed radiography (CR) for the acquisition of general radiographic studies in a digital environment. It offers the possibility of improved spatial and contrast resolution, decreased radiation dose due to improved efficiency of detection of x-ray photons, and perhaps most importantly, holds out the promise of increased technologist productivity. To achieve maximum efficiency, DR must be completely integrated into existing information systems, including the hospital and radiology information systems (HIS/RIS) and, when present, the picture archival and communication system (PACS). The early experience with the integration of DR at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) has identified several challenges that exist to the successful integration of DR. DR has only recently been defined as a separate Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) modality and images obtained will, at first, be listed under the category of CR. Matrix sizes with some DR products on the market exceed the current size limitations of some PACS. The patient throughput may be substantially greater with DR than with CR, and this in combination with the larger size of image files may result in greater demands for network and computer performance in the process, of communication with the HIS/RIS and PACS. Additionally, in a hybrid department using both CR and DR, new rules must be defined for prefetching and display of general radiographic studies to permit these examinations to be retrieved and compared together. Advanced features that are planned for DR systems, such as dual-energy subtraction, tomosynthesis, and temporal subtraction, will likely require additional workstation tools beyond those currently available for CR.",,"Data acquisition; Digital image storage; Hospital data processing; Image communication systems; Management information systems; Computed radiography (CR); Digital radiography (DR); Picture archival and communication systems (PACS); Diagnostic radiography; article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; computer network; computer system; hospital information system; human; image quality; image subtraction; information processing; productivity; radiation dose; radiology; radiology department; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Systems; Data Display; Efficiency; Hospital Information Systems; Humans; Radiation Dosage; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiology Department, Hospital; Radiology Information Systems; Subtraction Technique; Technology, Radiologic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032588397

The calculations are performed for releases of pressure-liquefied propane; the total mass of fuel released varied in a wide range from 1 g up to 1000 kg and prerelease temperature 268-351 K. Formation and evolution of a two-phase cloud following a short-duration release of pressure-liquefied gas is first considered without ignition.

Any possibility of leakage must be detected before the leakage occurs and a preventive action should be taken in order to avoid losses of oil and ecological disasters. One of the main causes of oil pipelines leakage is the corrosion of the bottom part of the pipeline due to accumulation of water and other corrosive substances. One of the methods used to check the conditions of the oil pipelines is the running of a data acquisition device through all the length of the pipeline (that can be km) to gather information about the corrosion and its position inside the pipeline. This device is commonly referred to as pig. The Brazilian oil company, PETROBRAS, wanting to have the technology of such device to detect corrosion in their oil pipelines proposed to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo a joint project to the development of a pig that could run uninterruptedly in long oil pipelines gathering corrosion data for the preventive maintenance of their oil pipelines. The result of the project was the development of an ultrasonic pig with 16 ultrasonic transducers with on-board energy system and acquisition and storage systems. Also, comprised in the presented solution was the development of a software to analyze the collected data and give the position of the corrosion spots along the pipeline. This paper presents in detail the implementation and design issues related to the development of the ultrasonic pig. Also, some experimental data will be shown as confirmation of the effectiveness of the developed system. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Low loss performance of magnetic bearings in aerospace equipment such as jet engines and flywheel energy storage systems is especially critical. Two basic magnetic bearing designs are employed in industrial practice today: the homopolar design, where the flux paths are of a mixed radial/axial orientation, and the heteropolar design, where the flux paths are primarily radial in nature. The stator geometry and flux path of a specific bearing can have a significant effect on the rotor losses. This paper describes the detailed measurement of rotor losses for experimentally comparable homopolar and heteropolar designs. The two test bearing configurations are identical except for geometric features that determine the direction of the flux path. Both test bearing designs have the same air gap length, tip clearance ratio, surface area under the poles, and bias flux levels. An experimental test apparatus was used where run down tests were performed on a test rotor with both bearing designs to measure power losses. Numerous test runs where made for each bearing configuration by running multiple levels of flux density. The components of the overall measured power loss, due to hysteresis, eddy currents, and windage, were determined based on theoretical expressions for power loss. It was found that the homopolar bearing had significantly lower power losses than the heteropolar bearing.© 1999 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006064496

Frequency dispersion curves of dynamic storage and loss moduli (G′ and G″, respectively) for gellan/ water at 5 wt% showed solidlike behavior at low temperatures. The values of G′ and G″ appeared to decrease with increasing time after gelation. The temperature dispersion curve of G′ on heating showed a shoulder in the transition region, while no shoulder was observed on the cooling curve. This indicated that the effect of aging on the rheological properties of the gels becomes larger at low temperatures. At 2 wt%, where the system remains liquid, little effect of aging on the rheological properties was observed. The activation energy of flow was estimated to be 30 kJ/mol for the gellan/water system in the random-coil conformation from the temperature dependence of the zero-shear viscosity. Two types of concentration dependence have been observed for the gellan/water system: one corresponds to the curve for gellan in the random-coil form at high temperatures, and the other is for the curve in the helical conformation at low temperatures.

One polyurethane-based, spray-on rock lining material, designated Mineguard™, has been developed and tested primarily for use in underground hard rock mines for provision of rapidly-deployable area support coverage. Information is presented which summarizes assessment trials of the pre- and post-yield characteristics of rock and concrete materials subjected to large deformations when tested uncoated and coated using varying layer thicknesses of Mineguard™. Tests were conducted for the purpose of assessing the capabilities of thin support liners to enhance the ultimate strength of rock materials, to stabilize uncontrolled, post-yield deformation behaviour and to enhance strain energy storage capacities of failing rock mass structures. In these laboratory trials, Mineguard™ surface coatings, at thicknesses of 1 to 3 mm, have been shown to beneficially enhance rock strength and other physical properties in medium to strong rock materials. Additional information, obtained from selected mine sites, is presented to validate the significant potential that such surface reinforcement agents have shown in terms of ground support capability. Experience gained by mine operators who are currently investigating the high speed application of Mineguard™ coatings, and comparison of wide-ranging laboratory response tests, indicate that this or other forms of flexible, spray-on, membrane support coverings may be able to add to or replace components of current support technologies that are required for mining safely in hard rock environments. © 1999 Balkema, Rotterdam.",,"Coated materials; Deformation; Failure (mechanical); Ground supports; Hard coatings; Rock mechanics; Strain energy; Strength of materials; Concrete materials; Deformation behaviour; Energy storage capacity; High-speed applications; Membrane supports; Rock mass structure; Support capability; Support technology; Rocks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004546898

T6H 3S5, Canada","Although many factors influencing the forest C cycle are beyond direct human control, decisions made in forestry and the forest product sector (FPS) can either mitigate or aggravate the net C balance of terrestrial ecosystems. The Canadian Budget Model of the Forest Product Sector (CBM-FPS) described here, was designed to work with a national scale model of forest ecosystem dynamics (the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector, CBM-CFS). The CBM-FPS accounts for harvested forest biomass C from the time that it enters the manufacturing process until it is released into the atmosphere. It also accounts for the use and production of energy by the FPS, and emission of CO2 during FPS processing. The CBM-FPS accounting framework uses the characteristics of different forest product types to estimate changes in the storage of C in forest products; it tracks C from the transportation of the harvested raw material through various processing steps in sawmills or pulp mills, to its final destination (product, pulp, landfill, atmosphere or recycled). Because not all harvested biomass C is released into the atmosphere in the year it is harvested, the model tracks C retained in various short- and long-lived products, and in landfills. Model results are in general agreement with available data from 1920-1989. Average changes in net C stocks in the FPS, estimated as the difference between harvest C input to the FPS and total losses from the forest product sector is estimated to be 23.5 Tg C yr-1 for the 1985-1989 period. The total FPS pool size at the end of this period is estimated to be 837 Tg C, of which only a fraction (32%) is retained in Canada. The total FPS C stock is small compared to that in the forest ecosystems from which they derive (estimated to contain 86 Pg C in 1989). Nevertheless, the changes in these C stocks contribute significantly to a reduction of the total net atmospheric exchange of the total forest sector (ecosystem and product sector) for that period.","Bioenergy; Canada; Carbon balance; Emissions; Forestry; Landfill; Model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003166514

The full electromagnetic fields of the diffraction grating system were specified, and, in applying the complex Poynting theorem to the grating system, a full calculation of the diffraction efficiency, the electromagnetic (electric and magnetic) energy, and the real, reactive, dissipative, and evanescent power of the grating was made. A step profile grating was used to test numerical examples, and, in all cases considered, the complex Poynting theorem was obeyed to a high degree of numerical accuracy. In the study the effects that anisotropy and lossiness of the grating system had on the complex power of the system were illustrated. A comparison of the complex power that resulted from scattering from diffraction gratings composed of Hermitian and non-Hermitian anisotropic materials was numerically studied. © 1999 Optical Society of America.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002960784

In the application area of High Energy and Nuclear Physics (HENP) the volume of data reaches hundreds of terabytes per year, and therefore it is impractical to store them on disk systems. Rather they are stored on robotic tape systems that are managed by some mass storage system (MSS). The role of the Storage Access Coordination System (STACS) that we developed is to manage the caching of files from the MSS to a large disk cache that is shared by multiple HENP analysis programs. The system design involved multiple components developed by different people at different sites, and the modules could potentially be distributed as well. We describe the architecture and implementation of the system STACS, emphasizing the inter-module communication requirements. We describe the use of CORBA interfaces between system components, and our experience with using multi-threaded CORBA and moving large objects through the CORBA interfaces. STACS development was recently completed and is being incorporated in an operational environment scheduled to go online in the summer of 1999. © 1999 IEEE.",,"Coordination reactions; Digital storage; Satellites; Application area; Coordination systems; Inter-Module communication; Mass storage system; Multiple components; Operational environments; Software modules; System components; Common object request broker architecture (CORBA)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002937948

A model based on the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation with long-range dispersive interactions (LRI's) between base pairs of DNA is offered for the description of nonlinear dynamics of the DNA molecule. We show that LRI's are responsible for the existence of an interval of bistability where two stable stationary states, a narrow, pinned state and a broad, mobile state, coexist at each value of the total energy. The possibility of controlled switching between pinned and mobile states is demonstrated. The mechanism could be important for controlling energy storage and transport in DNA molecules. Another model is offered for the description of nonlinear excitations in proteins and other anharmonic biomolecules. We show that in the highly anharmonic systems a bound state of Davydov and Boussinesq solitons can exist.","Anharmonic; Bistability; Bound state; Long-range dispersion; Nonlocal; Soliton",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002808982

An energetic permanganate fuel cell is studied:Al+MnO4-+2H2O→Al(OH) 4-+MnO2;Ecell=2.9 V The cell's anodic storage efficiency is enhanced by elevated temperatures, high electrolyte flow rates, and low cathode and anode polarization losses.

Besides work on the parameters of a 3-4 and 0.5 TeV center-of-mass (COM) energy collider, many studies are now concentrating on a machine near 0.1 TeV (COM) that could be a factory for the s-channel production of Higgs particles. We discuss the research on the various components in such muon colliders, starting from the proton accelerator needed to generate pions from a heavy-Z target and proceeding through the phase rotation and decay (π → μ ν μ) channel, muon cooling, acceleration, storage in a collider ring, and the collider detector. We also present theoretical and experimental R&amp;D plans for the next several years that should lead to a better understanding of the design and feasibility issues for all of the components.

It is therefore important to develop a simple DNA diagnostic method which is suitable for processing a large number of samples. We have devised an allele- specific amplification (ASA) method with a fluorogenic probe (TaqMan probe) to detect point mutations. A pairwise PCR amplification with two sets of allele-specific primers was performed in the presence of the TaqMan probe with real-time fluorescence monitoring on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector. The difference in the amplification efficiency between two PCR reactions was determined by 'threshold' cycles to differentiate mutant and normal alleles. The method, TaqMan-ASA, does not require post-PCR processing, thus obviating potential PCR contamination. Since the entire procedure can be carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate format, it is easy to automate. We successfully applied TaqMan-ASA to detect a common g727t mutation in Japanese patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia and a prevalent a985g mutation in Caucasian patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.","Allele specific amplification; DNA diagnosis; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Glycogen storage disease type Ia; Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; TaqMan probe","DNA; glycogen; medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; Caucasian; conference paper; diagnostic procedure; enzyme deficiency; fluorescence; gene amplification; glycogen storage disease type 1; human; Japan; metabolic disorder; newborn screening; point mutation; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001898175

The deceptively straightforward anthropomorphic definition of obesity is the excessive accumulation of body fat. However, obesity is a chronic disease that is much more than excessive fat. It involves genetic predisposition and metabolic, hormonal and behavioural aspects and results in significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, discrimination and early mortality. The development and maintenance of obesity can be considered to result from the integration, or the accumulation, of small daily errors in energy balance over several months and years. The biological factors involved increase the predisposition toward the expansion of adipose tissue mass together with the consequences of an environment that promotes increased food intake and decreased physical activity. Multiple aetiologies may result in similar degrees of obesity.","Energy balance; Energy expenditure; Fat mass; Food intake; Insulin; Insulin resistance; Leptin; OB protein; OB protein pathway; Obesity; Physical activity","adipose tissue; anthropometry; behavior; energy balance; energy expenditure; environmental factor; genetic predisposition; hormonal regulation; human; lipid storage; metabolism; morbidity; mortality; obesity; pathogenesis; physical activity; quality of life; review; social psychology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001769467

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used to catalyze the sol-gel reactions. The effects of HCl concentration on the morphology and distribution of the inorganic phase were investigated. Tensile properties, fracture toughness, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) of the ceramer coatings were evaluated as a function of acid catalyst concentration. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersion X-ray analysis (EDAX) were used to investigate the morphology. The tensile properties showed an optimum acid concentration of 1.0 wt %. The fracture properties indicated that the greatest resistance to crack propagation was obtained with an acid concentration of 0.25 wt %. Thermogravimetric data showed that the thermal stability of the ceramer films increased with increasing acid catalyst. For TEOS/linseed ceramer films, storage modulus and tan δ data suggested that the acid catalyst promoted separation of the inorganic and organic phases.

These two solutions showed similar nanorheological properties that differed from those observed for pure n-alkanes. In static measurements, a ""hard wall"", rather than an oscillatory force, was observed as a function of film thickness. The polar alkane component formed a weakly adsorbed single layer at each mica surface, disrupting the layered structures found in neat n-tetradecane. In dynamic experiments at low shear amplitude, the storage modulus G′ exceeded the loss modulus G″ at low frequencies; above some characteristic frequencies G″ increased such that G′ ≈ G″, indicating significantly more energy loss through viscous modes at higher frequency. When the amplitude was varied at fixed frequency, no stick-slip was observed and the limiting value of the shear stress at high effective shear rate was an order of magnitude less than for unfunctionalized n-alkanes at similar loads. Together, these results show that the addition of a small amount of polar alkane component, by disrupting the layered structures that would have been formed in the neat n-alkane, is effective in suppressing static friction and reducing kinetic friction in the boundary lubrication regime. © J.C.

Such a mission, nicknamed ODISSEE (Orbital Demonstration of an Innovative, Solar Sail driven Expandable structure Experiment), is the recommended approach for the development of this advanced concept using solar radiation pressure for primary propulsion and attitude control. The mission, proposed for launch in 2001, would demonstrate and validate the basic principles of sail fabrication, packaging, storage, deployment, and control. The demonstration mission scenario comprises a low-cost 'piggy back' launch of a sailcraft with a total mass of about 80kg on ARIANE 5 into a geostationary transfer orbit, where a 40m × 40m square sail would be deployed. The aluminized sail film is folded and packaged in small storage containers, upon release the sail would be supported by deployable light-weight carbon fiber booms. A coilable 10m central mast is attached to the center of the sail assembly with a 2DoF gimbal, and connected to the spacecraft. Attitude control is performed passively by gimbaling the central mast to offset the center-of-mass to the center-of-pressure generating an external torque due to solar radiation pressure, or actively using a cold-gas micro-thruster system. By proper orientation of the sail towards the Sun during each orbit, the orbital energy can be increased, such that the solar sail spacecraft raises its orbit. After roughly 550 days a lunar polar flyby would be performed, or the sail might be used for orbit capture about the Moon. On-board cameras are foreseen to observe the sail deployment, and an additional science payload could provide remote: sensing data of the Earth and also of previously not very well explored lunar areas. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Detection of the Ar+ product ions proved to facilitate an almost background free spectroscopic method. Rotational temperatures and Doppler temperatures determined from these spectra show that the internal and translational degrees of freedom of the parent ions are very well coupled to the trap temperature via collisions with the Ar buffer gas. Laser excitation starts a complex reaction kinetics of the finite ensemble of N2+ ions. Various elementary reaction steps have been distinguished and followed in detail by varying laser duration, storage time, and target gas density. For a fixed temperature (90 K), specific rate coefficients have been determined. Pumping only one particular quantum state of ortho-N2+ (X2g, v″ = 0, J″ = 6.5) shows that rate coefficients for the mixing of fine structure states (F1/F2) as well as nuclear spin states (ortho/para) in collisions with Ar are negligible (smaller than 10-12 cm3 s-1). The rate coefficient for transitions between the rotational states of one subset, e.g. ortho-N2+ (F1), are surprisingly small. The results are discussed in the framework of possible dynamical constraints, e.g. imposed by the potential energy surface. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Fine structure changing collisions; Ion traps; Laser induced charge transfer; Rate coefficients; Rotational relaxation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001388979

The method is based on using merged electron and molecular ion beams in a heavy-ion storage ring together with molecular fragment imaging techniques which allow us to probe the vibrational-state population of the stored beam as a function of time as well as the final state of the dissociation. The initial vibrational distribution of the stored ion beam (from a Penning ion source) is found to be in good agreement with a Franck-Condon model of electron impact ionization, apart from slightly larger experimental populations found for low vibrational states; its time evolution in the storage ring reflects the predicted vibrational level lifetimes. Dissociative recombination measurements were performed with the electron and ion beams at matched velocities (corresponding to average collision energies of about 10 meV), and at several well-defined collision energies in the range of 3–11 eV.

Two X-ray-based techniques, synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (μ- RXF) and X-ray microanalysis (SEM/EDX), were utilized in association with induced coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). These techniques allowed the definition of maps showing a preferential accumulation of lead in the root periderm of both plants and a limited translocation of the metal to the stems. Accordingly, estimation of the lead concentration with ICP-OES showed that roots contained, on a dry weight basis, 20 to 40 times more metal than stems. Chromium, supplied to the plants as Cr3+ or Cr6+, was taken up only in the latter case and in limited amounts. In general, walnut was more efficient than maple in the uptake of lead and chromium. The combination of X-ray-based techniques and ICP-OES proved to be a powerful quantitative tool in mapping, with high definition, the sites of metal storage in plant tissues.","Chromium; Induced coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES); Lead; Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer (SEM/EDX); Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (μ-SRXF)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001097981

This approach employs a non-imaging simulated hemispherical electron energy analyser attached to an imaging photoemission electron microscope (FOCUS IS-PEEM) with integrated microarea selector. The photoemission microscope exhibits a lateral resolution of 25 nm (with 4.9 eV UV-excitation), while the resolution with incident synchrotron radiation in the soft X-ray range is about 100-120 nm (mainly due to chromatic aberrations). Photoemission microscopy as well as photoelectron microspectroscopy of selected areas on the sample surface were performed by using the third harmonic of the direct undulator beam which was monochromatized and refocused by a two-element multilayer optic in the 70-95 eV energy range. The multilayer monochromator operating at near-normal incidence consists of a concave spherical multilayer mirror (r = 650 mm) and a plane multilayer grating (blazed grating 1221 L/mm, blaze angle 0.8 deg). Both elements were coated with a Mo/Si multilayer of equal d-spacing (20 doublelayers, d = 10.5 nm) to enhance the reflectivity for EUV radiation at near-normal incidence angles. The characterization of the individual optical components by EUV reflectometry shows a peak reflectance of about 47% at a photon energy of 95 eV in the case of the focusing multilayer mirror while the first order diffraction efficiency of the multilayer blaze grating was measured to be up to 32%. The evaluation of the photoelectron spectra measured with this set-up displays that the spectral resolution of the incident radiation is better than 0.7 eV, while it is about 2-4 eV in the case of a two-multilayer-mirror configuration. Analysis of the surface topography and the chemical composition of inhomogeneities of thin evaporated layers on a mesoscopic scale are the main applications of this experiment. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The surface displacement was measured by a heterodyne interferometer and recorded by a digital storage oscilloscope. Several hundreds of shots were averaged to give smooth displacement curves which could be derived numerically. The experiments show that the highest accelerations, which are thought to be responsible for the cleaning, occur on the time scale of the laser pulse. Simple theoretical models are in good agreement with the experimental data.

In general, both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion are required for the disease to become manifest. Thus, as long as the pancreatic β cells can compensate for the degree of insulin resistance, glucose tolerance remains normal. Clustering of type 2 diabetes in certain families and ethnic populations points to a strong genetic background for the disease. However, environmental factors such as obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are usually required to unmask the genes. Impaired insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (particularly non-oxidative) in skeletal muscle represents a key feature of type 2 diabetes and is observed early in the pre-diabetic state. It is not clear, though, whether this represents an inherited defect in muscle or whether it develops secondarily, for example, to abdominal obesity. In favour of the latter hypothesis are findings that abdominal obesity and a low metabolic rate seem to precede the development of insulin resistance in offspring of type 2 diabetic patients. According to the thrifty gene hypothesis, individuals living in an environment with an unstable food supply could increase their probability of survival if they could maximize storage of surplus energy, for instance, as abdominal fat. Exposing this energy-storing genotype to the abundance of food typical of westernized societies is detrimental, causing insulin resistance and, subsequently, type 2 diabetes. There are a number of potential thrifty genes, including those that regulate lipolysis or code for the β3-adrenergic receptor, the hormone-sensitive lipase, and lipoprotein lipase. Type 2 diabetes develops as a consequence of a collision between thrifty genes and a hostile affluent environment. Insulin resistance is a key trigger for the disease, and optimal management of type 2 diabetes should therefore aim to ameliorate insulin resistance early.",,"beta adrenergic receptor; glycogen synthase; body composition; ethnic group; genetics; human; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; review; Body Composition; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Ethnic Groups; Glycogen Synthase; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000454838

Neutron effects on the x-ray-energy responses of these detectors are studied using synchrotron radiation from a 2.5 GeV positron storage ring at the Photon Factory. Changes in the material properties of the detectors have been investigated using an impedance analyzer to estimate neutron effects on x-ray-sensitive depletion thicknesses. A cyclotron accelerator is employed for well-calibrated neutron irradiation onto these plasma x-ray detectors; a fluence of 2-5 × 1013 neutrons/cm2 is utilized for simulating the effects of fusion-produced neutrons in JET. Modifications of the x-ray responses after neutron exposure due to fusion plasma shots in JET as well as cyclotron-produced neutron irradiations are found to have a functional dependence on x-ray energy. Also, recovery of the detector energy response is found when detector bias is applied.
