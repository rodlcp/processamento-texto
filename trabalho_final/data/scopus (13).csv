The most effective propellants to date have been stoichiometric, aqueous mixtures of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) and the nitrate salt of an organic amine, triethanolammonium nitrate (TEAN). Because these propellants do not burn at atmospheric pressure, but instead react slowly enough to maintain thermal pseudo-equilibrium, such experiments provide information regarding the stability of the mixtures in storage. Thermal stability is directly related to the nitrate ion concentration of the mixtures, and propellant composition can be modified to change energy release rates without affecting thermal stability. Replacement of the TEAN component with N,N-diethylhydroxylammonium nitrate (DEHAN) increases burning rate as much as 17-fold without adversely affecting thermal stability because the total nitrate concentration of the HAN-TEAN and HAN-DEHAN mixtures is the same. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44049111865

Adsorption of a polyelectrolyte/ion-exchange resin on the Daramic separator greatly reduced its hydraulic permeability (Kh) and only a slight decrease in the diffusion coefficient of the membrane was observed. The Daramic with the highest selectivity and an area resistance less than 3 Ω-cm2, was obtained by treatment with Amberlite CG400 and further crosslinking using divinyl benzene (DVB). A coulombic efficiency of greater than 90% was achieved during charge/discharge cycling of a vanadium redox test cell using this membrane, compared with about 77% for the original material. This membrane has been tested for over 8000 hours or 1650 cycles in a vanadium redox cell with no sign of deterioration. Long-term exposure to the vanadium (V) solution has also confirmed the excellent stability of the treated membrane for this application. © 1992.","Daramic; microporous separator; redox flow cell and battery","Adsorption; Chemical modification; Crosslinking; Electrochemistry; Energy storage; Ion exchange resins; Ion selective membranes; Polyelectrolytes; Polymeric membranes; Redox reactions; Charge/discharge cycling; Chemically modified membranes; Coulombic efficiency; Daramic microporous separators; Hydraulic permeability; Ion selectivity enhancement; Redox flow batteries; Vanadium redox cells; Electric batteries; polyelectrolyte; resin; adsorption; article; ion exchange; Diffusion; Ion Exchange; Permeability; Porous Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027010292

The mass of battery systems is related to the energy stored, whereas the masses of regenerative fuel cell systems are mainly determined by their rated power. On the other hand, average power and total energy are not independent variables, since they are correlated by the period of discharge of the electrochemical cells. Thus a comparison of the different approaches to storage can be given, by evaluating system masses as a function of power requirement and period of discharge. Since space power applications are considered, the charging and discharging periods can be expressed in terms of orbit altitudes. © 1992.",,"Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemistry; Geostationary satellites; Space applications; Spacecraft power supplies; Discharge cycles; Electrocatalytic properties; Regenerative fuel cells; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027002988

The program basis is inductive energy storage and Plasma Opening Switches (POS). Inductive energy storage has well known advantages, including increased efficiency and reduced stress on the vacuum interface. The Sandia approach is to retain the reliable and efficient Marx generator and the temporal pulse compression of the water dielectric capacitor. A triggered closing switch, developed at Sandia, transfers the capacitor charge into the energy storage inductor. This approach has several advantages, including relaxed requirements on Marx jitter and inductance, and much faster current risetime in the energy storage inductor. The POS itself is the key to the Sandia program. The switch design uses an auxiliary magnetic field to inject the plasma and hold it in place during conduction. After opening begins, the self magnetic field of the power pulse pushes on the plasma to increase the opened gap. We use magnetic pressure because we desire POS gaps of several cm. Typical plasma opening switches do not achieve large gaps. Improved opening allows more efficient energy transfer to loads. We will present results from recent experiments at Sandia. Our driver will presently supply 650 kA with a 240 ns risetime to the input of the POS. The storage inductor is a 17 Ohm magnetically insulated transmission line (MITL) that is five meters long. We will discuss the ways in which magnetic fields influence the POS, and the ways in which we control the magnetic fields. © 1992 National Technical Information Service.",,"Auxiliary magnetic field; Closing switches; Efficient energy transfer; Inductive energy storage; Magnetic pressure; Magnetically insulated transmission line; Marx generators; Plasma opening switch; Power pulse; Pulsed power drivers; Risetimes; Sandia National Laboratories; Self-magnetic fields; Switch designs; Vacuum interfaces; Water dielectric capacitor; Capacitors; Electric switches; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Experiments; Magnetic fields; Particle beams; Plasma guns; Electric inductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867939150

A canal concept allowing to compare microsecond and nanosecond generators with PCIS and a model of PCIS operation are proposed. Plasma opening switch research [1,2] show that they are prospective for microsecond inductive energy storage systems. The scheme of high power generators including PCIS is prospective for industrial applications. From the other hand physical processes taking place in the rear plasma (concentration of (10 12-10 14) cm 3) with high current (amplitude 100-1000 kA, current rising time (10-100) ns) are interesting for theoretical and experimental research. Further progress in experimental field is connected with both generalization and new results on detailed physical picture of PCIS operation appearance. With generalization of experimental results [3,4] it is worth to outline a certain concept of PCIS operation which proposes plasma volume division onto parallel operating canals (fig. l). They have certain values of impedance on stages of erosion and current interruption and these values are determined by concrete geometry and plasma concentration. Experiments used different variants of plasma guns displacement (at inner and/or outer electrode of PCIS going along a circle or along a cylindrical surface with the length exceeding electrode diameter). It was shown that charge density limit exists and charge goes through inner surface of PCIS outer electrode qlim (1-3) mKl/cm 2. This value limits energy flow density through plasma volume. Attempting to exceed charge density limit with concentration growth makes interruption impossible. If not to take into account plasma gun construction it is possible to divide plasma volume on parallel canals with single square on outer electrode surface. To increase charge value going through PCIS or to increase current drive amplitude or its rising time it is necessary to increase geometrical dimensions: diameter or length. In experiment with wide PCIS it was shown (fig.2) [4] that with current rising more and more PCIS area (and plasma canals) are captured by current. Both current and charging time growth requires more plasma canals that results in impedance decrease. If no more new canals could be created then interruption before drive current maximum occurs. The plasma canal which permits higher current increases its impedance earlier. That results in current redistribution and equalizes the interruption time from each canal. © 1992 National Technical Information Service.",,"Charging time; Current drives; Current increase; Current interruption; Current redistribution; Cylindrical surface; Drive currents; Electrode diameters; Electrode surfaces; Energy flow density; Experimental research; Geometrical dimensions; Gun construction; High currents; High-power generators; Inductive energy storage; Inner surfaces; New results; Physical pictures; Physical process; Plasma concentration; Plasma currents; Plasma erosion opening switches; Plasma opening switch; Plasma volume; Rising time; Dielectric materials; Electric switches; Experiments; Hydraulic structures; Industrial applications; Particle beams; Plasma guns; Plasmas; Canals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867938087

Data from these experiments indicates that we can reproducibly deliver 50 KJ of 5 MeV protons at an average power intensity of 3.5 TW/cm 2 to a 6 mm diameter by 6 mm tall cylindrical target. The implosion of spherical exploding pusher targets and the radiation production from foam-filled cylindrical thermal targets were studied in these experiments. They demonstrated that high quality target data can be obtained on PBFA-II. Specific deposition rates of about 100 TW/g were achieved in these experiments. This deposition rate marks the boundary between the regime where enhanced ion deposition and equation-of-state (EOS) physics are studied (10-100 TW/g) and the regime where radiation-conversion and radiation-transport physics are studied (100-1000 TW/g). Experiments in the radiation-conversion regime are now of primary importance in our program because these experiments will test the target physics basis for ion-driven ICE Experiments using a thin film LiF source have produced an intensity of 1 TW/cm 2 of lithium ions. This beam has a potential specific deposition rate of 300-400 TW/g in hydrocarbon foams. However, radiation conversion experiments will require an increased total energy content of this beam in order to overcome the specific internal energy of the foam. Further increases in ion beam intensity and energy content are being pursued in a multi-pronged attack. Understanding and controlling ion beam divergence is the highest program priority. Present understanding indicates that instabilities in the electron sheath cause significant ion beam divergence. Our understanding suggests that this contribution to the ion divergence can be decreased by operating the diode at a low enhancement through the use of high applied magnetic fields or by modifying the electron distribution near the anode via electron limiters. The new 9 cm radius Compact Diode has the capability of generating 8 T applied magnetic fields which will enable divergence experiments in the low-enhancement, high-B regime. Experiments with the LEVIS (Laser Evaporation Ion Source) lithium source have demonstrated the existence of a preformed plasma, as determined by visible-emission spectroscopy of the anode plasma. Work on improving lithium purity with this source is in progress. This active anode plasma will be used in experiments testing the effectiveness of electron limiters in controlling ion beam divergence. We are also working to understand the interrelation between accelerator coupling, diode physics, and ion beam focusing in order to optimize the diode configuration to maximize the power intensity on target. Success in these experiments will provide an adequate lithium beam for performing target experiments exploring radiation conversion and radiation transport physics in ion-driven ICF. © 1992 National Technical Information Service.",,"Applied magnetic fields; Average power; Beam coupling; Beam divergence; Beam focusing; Beam intensity; Cylindrical target; Electron distributions; Electron sheath; Energy content; Equation-of-state; High quality; Ion beam focusing; Ion deposition; Laser evaporation; Lithium ions; Power intensity; Preformed plasma; Radiation transport; Sandia National Laboratories; Specific internal energy; Target physics; Total energy; Deposition rates; Digital storage; Diodes; Emission spectroscopy; Hydrocarbons; Ion beams; Ion sources; Lithium; Magnetic fields; Plasmas; Radiation; Software testing; Experiments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867924210

The noise amplitude of the total ion current is no more than 10% in this mode of operation. The production of highly charged ions is explained by an increased potential drop in the discharge gap (60-100 V) for currents of 1.5-2.0 kA.

The imaging system will employ two crossed spherical mirrors in a Kirkpatrick-Baez configuration, to eliminate astigmatism. Use of 1:1 imaging will eliminate coma, resulting in an image of the source which is only limited by the residual aberrations of the optics. Real time imaging of the beam is deemed feasible by the use of a high resolution charged coupled device (CCD), and the associated electronics necessary to read the CCD. The design of the imaging system of the diagnostic beamline for ALS and the detection system will be discussed with a view toward applications in other third generation SR sources.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449009434

This paper studies and compares the free-carrier charges stored in the quasineutral regions of the conventional Si homojunction bipolar transistor (Si BJT) and the increasingly important AlGaAs/GaAs and Si/SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). The diffusion capacitances associated with this stored charge, which are used in the Gummel-Poon bipolar transistor model, are also calculated and discussed. It is shown that the AlGaAs/GaAs HBT has the least carrier accumulation in the quasineutral regions among the three devices due primarily to the relatively large energy band gap of GaAs-related materials. Also, the Si/SiGe HBT is expected to operate at a higher switching speed compared to the Si BJT, because the valence band discontinuity at the Si/SiGe base-collector heteroface impedes the minority-carrier injection from the base into the collector.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449006395

This provides useful radiation, e.g., for x-ray fluorescence up to 3.2 keV. An undulator with a periodicity distance of 2.5 cm is planned, to generate radiation of 40 nm. The major ring components are being constructed in the University workshop, including a 70-MeV injector microtron. The main characteristics of the machine and the present status are reported.

This problem is related to the sphere packing problem, which has application in mathematics, the design of codes for data transmission and storage, and other engineering applications. We show here how the Coulomb energy network provides a very natural and elegant solution to this problem. In this novel application, each of the n points on the sphere is modeled as a negatively charged particle in the electrostatic field. The model utilizes an energy function which expresses the potential energy associated with each charged point at its location in space. This function is minimized when points of like charge are as far away from each other as possible. At each time step, a point is moved in a direction proportional to the negative gradient of the energy function, but is confined to remain on the sphere's surface. At equilibrium the n points are as far apart as possible.

Objectives of LT3 were to demonstrate that high-temperature ATES could supply a real heating load and to simplify the water chemistry modeling. For LT3 the Field Test Facility (FTF) was connected to a nearby campus building to demonstrate the FTF's ability to meet a real heating load. For LT3 the wells were modified so that only the most permeable portions of the Ironton-Galesville aquifer were used to simplify water chemistry comparisons and modelling. The campus steam plant was the source for heat stored during LT3. A total volume of 63.2 × 103 m3 of water was injected at a rate of 54.95 m3/hr into the storage well at a mean temperature of 104.7°C from October through December 1989. Tie-in to the Animal Sciences Veterinary Medicine (ASVM) building was not completed until late December. A total volume of 66.0 × 103 m3 of water was recovered at a rate of 44.83 m3/hr from the storage well at a mean temperature of 76.5°C from January through March 1990. Highest and lowest temperatures of recovered water were 100.0 and 47.8°C, respectively. Approximately 66% of the energy added to the aquifer was recovered. The useful minimum temperature for recovered water was 49°C; approximately 50% of the energy added to the aquifer above 49°C (33% of the total energy stored) was delivered to the ASVM building. Approximately 15% of the usable (10% of the total) energy stored was actually used in the ASVM building. Operations during heat recovery with the ASVM building's reheat system were troublefree. Integration into more of the ASVM (or other) building's mechanical system would have resulted in significantly increasing the proportion of energy used during heat recovery. The cost to connect to other ASVM building systems for this experimental cycle was the main reason for not incorporating other building systems into the FTF. The FTF ion-exchange water softener reduced hardness of the source water to &lt;5 mg/L as CaCO3 prior to heating, allowing successful operation. Water chemistry is critical to the operation of the University of Minnesota FTF, or any ATES facility.

The design of traditional groundwater heat pump plants is based on the use of a separate pumping and reinjection well. An alternative design is to use a single-well for both pumping and reinjection. However a minimum distance between well screens is required in order to prevent break-through, caused by short-circuiting of the cooled groundwater. The present paper describes a simplified mathematical model to be used to analyze steady-state operational temperature conditions for a single-well groundwater heat pump plant. The model is based on a finite element solution of the temperature distribution in the pumping and reinjection zones of a groundwater reservoir. Furthermore, a model for the calculation of the ratio of the vertical to the horizontal permeability is presented in the paper. This ratio is one of the important parameters in the design of a single-well groundwater heat pump plant.

Geochemical phenomena that cause problems in ATES systems include formation of scale in heat exchangers, clogging of wells, corrosion in piping and heat exchangers, and degradation of aquifer materials. Preventing such problems frequently requires employing water treatment systems. Individual water treatment methods vary in cost, effectiveness, environmental impact, corrosion potential, and acceptability to regulatory bodies. Evaluating these water treatment options is generally required to determine the feasibility of ATES systems. The H20TREAT software was developed by Pacific Northwest Laboratory for use by engineers with limited or no experience in geochemistry. At the feasibility analysis and design stages, the software utilizes a recently revised geochemical model, MINTEQ, to calculate the saturation indices of selected carbonate, oxide, and hydroxide minerals based on water chemistry and temperature data provided by the user. The saturation index of a specific mineral defines whether that mineral is oversaturated, hence may precipitate at the specified temperature. The saturation indices of key calcium, iron, silica, and manganese carbonates, oxides, and hydroxides (calcite, rhodochrosite, siderite, Fe(OH)3[a], birnessite, chalcedony, and SiO2) are calculated. User input is separated into 'required' and 'optional' data (Table 1). Currently, H2OTREAT does not perform cost calculations; however, treatment capacity requirements are provided. Treatments considered include 1) Na and H ion exchangers and pellet reactors to avoid calcite precipitation, and 2) in situ nitrate addition and cascade precipitators to prevent Fe and Mn oxide precipitation. The H2OTREAT software also provides the user with guidance on other geochemical problems that must be considered, such as SiO2 precipitation, corrosion, and environmental considerations. The sodium adsorption ratio and sodium hazard are calculated to evaluate the likelihood of clay swelling and dispersion caused by high Na concentrations (e.g., as a result of Na ion exchange water treatment used to prevent calcite precipitation).

The most important processes are cation exchange, precipitation/dissolution of carbonates, and dissolution/precipitation of silicates. If the redox condition of the water is changed during the process (e.g., because of contact with oxygen in the air or because of mixing of water with a different redox status) redox reactions will be important as well. In many cases, the water will have to be treated to prevent carbonate scaling during heating. This treatment will influence the reactions in the aquifer. Because the water is (at least partly) reused each cycle, the reactions in the aquifer may cause an increase or a decrease in necessary treatment in subsequent cycles. Also, the treatment and the reactions in the aquifer may have an influence on the environmental impact of the store because the quality of the water lost from the store is changed. To be able to assess the relevance of these processes, a model has been developed that calculates the chemical reactions during transport of groundwater. An example of use of the model is given for the Utrecht University ATES system. At this site, a split treatment of Ca-Na softening is used to prevent carbonate sealing.

Efficient operational wells are, therefore, essential for the system to run at maximum (design) efficiency. Adequate test drilling to accurately predict aquifer properties is essential in the design phase; proper construction and development are crucial; and proper monitoring of performance is necessary to identify the early stages of clogging and to evaluate the adequacy of well rehabilitation. Problems related to hydrology, well, and aquifer properties include 1) loss of permeability resulting from gas exsolution, chemical precipitation, and dispersion and movement of fine-grained particles; 2) loss of recoverable heat caused by excessive regional ground-water gradient, hydrodynamic mixing of injected and native ground water, buoyancy flow (because of temperature-induced differences in water density); 3) leakage up along the well casing; and 4) 'fracturing' of a shallow upper aquiclude as a result of an injection pressure greater than the hydro-static pressure on the aquiclude. The predominant geochemical problems encountered are precipitation of carbonates in some areas and iron plus manganese oxides in others. These precipitation problems can be anticipated, and thus avoided, via geochemical calculations. The likelihood of iron carbonate (FeCO3) precipitation is less certain because of the lack of adequate research. Corrosion is a frequent problem. Most of the hydrochemically related clogging and corrosion problems that have been encountered in ATES systems can be predicted and avoided by appropriate design, construction, and operation of new ATES systems, assuming that a comprehensive and careful site investigation that includes appropriate hydrologic and geochemical modeling is carried out in advance. Because of local variations in hydrology and water chemistry, each project must be carefully examined and the installation planned based on a knowledge of the kind of problems that could be encountered and site conditions. It is prudent to carefully consider the need for water treatment and to anticipate that there will be some increase in injection pressure and decrease of specific capacity over time. Therefore, the design should include 1) the capability to monitor the specific capacity, 2) an injection pressure control, 3) a permanent backflush system, and 4) a safety valve.",,"Aquifers; Energy storage; Geochemistry; Hydrology; Aquifers thermal Energy storage; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027079853

A pumped storage is a hydroelectric project and should be of interest to those who do not have enough information on their applicability. The discussions establish the basic principles of a pumped storage project and its main components, and suggest suitable methods of developing costs of major items at the conceptual and planning level by using cost curves. All cost curves are not presented (for lack of space), but they can be prepared on similar principles. A pumped storage project pumps water from a reservoir at a lower elevation to a reservoir at a higher elevation during off-peak hours when there is unused capacity from base-load generating units in the system. During on-peak hours, water passes from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir to generate electricity and meet the system peaking demand. This operation improves overall system efficiency and reduces the cost of power production. Pumped storage provides dependable capacity, peaking, and shoulder energy production and dynamic benefits to electric utility system. Technology advances have improved the cycle efficiency, turn-around, and regulation capability. The water resource for a pumped storage project can be either natural or artificially stored.

The flow field, with streamlines and stagnation points, is presented graphically on the screen. The motion of the thermal fronts is determined by particle tracking.

The designs are similar to previous receivers having an axial distribution of concentrated solar input flux, and an axial flow of the working fluid. The objective is to study the feasibility of single-phase designs which have comparable weight and thermal performance to existing two-phase designs. Linearized heat transfer equations are formulated for the storage of sensible heat in the receivers. The periodic input solar flux is represented as the sum of steady and oscillating distributions, which results in steady and oscillating components in the one-dimensional, time-dependent thermal model. The steady component is solved analytically to produce the desired receiver steady outlet gas temperature. For the oscillating components the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT) is applied, and the resulting one-dimensional equations solved analytically in the transform space. The complex transfer function of the receiver is obtained and evaluated as a filter for the input spectrum. Convolution of the source and the transfer function, and inverse transformation, results in the amplitudes and mode shapes of the oscillating solid and gas temperatures. By adjustment of design parameters, the amplitude of the oscillating component of the outlet gas temperature is limited to an acceptable magnitude.

Unfortunately, the two categories of analyses are generally not integrated.

In the past, software tools that were suitable for system level studies were not convenient or practical for circuit analysis.

The installation consists of a large central well with a network of horizontal drains in each of two successive sandy aquifers. Water goes from one level to the other during the injection and production cycles. Slight changes in the chemistry of the aquifer have been observed, generally with a low impact. Scaling and clogging by calcium carbonate precipitation are the biggest problem. Many experiments have been performed to find a good solution. Different types of heat exchangers have been tested: tubular, plate, and fluidized bed. Several water treatment methods were also investigated: mechanical, electromagnetic conditioning and injection of chemicals. The fluidized bed heat exchanger is currently running in SPEOS. Continuous injection of HCl (hydrochloric acid) was an effective solution for scaling prevention but it resulted in an increase in chloride concentration and in corrosion of the equipment (including stainless steel). Therefore, a better solution must be chosen, possibly without the use of chemicals, which may lead to environmental impacts. Microbiological studies were performed to help understand the behaviour of the aquifer microflora to an increase in temperature and possible other changes provoked by the aquifer's exploitation as a thermal storage.

The investigation involves the creation of an elementary ATES model, and the development of the corresponding expressions for efficiencies and for the quantities of energy and exergy that are injected and recovered. It is demonstrated that ATES performance measures based on exergy often are more useful and meaningful than those based on energy. Exergy efficiencies account for the temperatures associated with energy transfers to and from an ATES, as well as the quantities of energy transferred, and consequently provide a measure of how nearly ATES systems approach ideal thermodynamic performance. Energy efficiencies only account for energy transfer quantities, and thus do not provide a measure of approach to ideal performance. In fact, energy efficiencies are often misleadingly high because some of the energy recovered can be at too low a temperature to be available for a useful purpose.

These technologies are varied and the applications are diverse. Among these technologies are batteries, high efficiency induction motors, high frequency electric power distribution, dynamic energy storage, and Stirling cycle machines. While the emphasis of the PTD research is the application of these technologies to fulfill space power requirements, terrestrial applications may also exist. Future regulation of vehicular emission levels has prompted a recent increase in interest in electric and hybrid vehicles. Electric vehicles have been limited in range and performance by the storage capability of currently available batteries. As an alternative, the hybrid vehicle may render a more near term solution to provide an environmentally safe, full performance vehicle. With proper optimization and integration of the subsystems, a hybrid vehicle has the potential for reduced emissions and increased fuel economy, with comparable range and performance relative to the present day automobile. This paper describes a study performed to assess the applicability of NASA's advanced power technologies to electric and hybrid vehicles.

Variations in vehicle configuration and subsystem specifications are possible.

Computer models of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) sites have been developed and used to predict site availability. These models describe the connectivity of systems that comprise an oil storage site and are used as a tool for predicting mission success. Prior to implementation of the PC based model, all availability calculations were done on the Department of Energy mainframe computer. The cost of evaluating the models was high. Typical problems included difficulty with access time on the mainframe, a difficult programming language, expensive computer time and an inability to reproduce the results consistently. The mainframe model was very rigorous and thorough, but very difficult to use. A move away from mainframe computers to personal computers began on the SPR project in 1986 with the evaluation of several competing software packages designed to compute availability. After a long evaluation process, the program decided upon was the Reliability Block Diagram Analysis (RBDA) program from Science Applications International Corporation, Inc. (SAIC). The advantages of this product over the mainframe were numerous and included lower costs of operation, ease of use and better support. The software was developed for the PC user and included a more friendly user interface that allowed for easier interaction with the integrated software package. Before any applied modeling could be done with the package, it was necessary to verify and validate the evaluation results produced with the software. A simple sample model was created and evaluated using the three methods of analysis available; hand calculations, personal computer and mainframe computer calculation.",,"Computer simulation; Fuel storage; Mathematical models; Personal computers; Reliability; Mainframe computers; Strategic petroleum reserve; Crude petroleum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027061445

Due to the very high transportation cost associated with the lunar and Mars missions, the mass of these power systems will be a critical factor. Power systems currently being considered for these applications include both nonnuclear and nuclear systems. For lunar applications, the 354-hour-long nighttime presents a formidable challenge to energy storage technology for nonnuclear power systems. Because of their low energy densities, energy storage systems can be prohibitively massive at higher power levels. Consequently, the nonnuclear power systems may be limited to low-power mission applications on the surface of the Moon. Eliminating or greatly reducing the need for energy storage makes these systems competitive with nuclear power systems. A Free Electron Laser (FEL) power system based in lunar orbit was examined for providing power by beaming energy to the lunar surface. The FEL power system was compared with surface-based nuclear and nonnuclear power systems over a range of user power requirements. Preliminary results show the laser power beaming system to be increasingly competitive on a mass basis with the nonnuclear power at power levels above 50 kWe. However, compared with a surface-based nuclear power plant, the laser beaming power system is an unattractive option unless, for some reason, a nuclear plant cannot be situated on the lunar surface.",,"Aerospace engineering; Energy storage; Laser beams; Lunar missions; Moon; Planets; Space applications; Free electron laser power systems; Laser power beaming systems; Lunar surface applications; Mars missions; Space exploration missions; Electric power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027061169

Incorporating the ac link allows the converter in these systems to switch at the zero crossing of every half cycle of the ac waveform. This 'zero loss' switching of the link allows rapid energy variations to be achieved without the usual frequency proportional switching loss. Several field-oriented control systems have been developed by NASA Lewis and General Dynamics Space Systems Division under contract to NASA. This paper will begin with a description of a single motor, electromechanical actuation system and then focus on a conceptual design for an AC electric vehicle. This design will incorporate an induction motor/generator together with a flywheel for peak energy storage. System operation and implications along with the associated circuitry will be addressed. Such a system would greatly improve all-electric vehicle ranges over the Federal Urban Driving Cycle (FUD).",,"Control systems; Electric generators; Electric vehicles; Induction motors; AC links; All-electric vehicles; Resonant AC links; Electromechanical devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027041945

This installation is a pilot facility and is included in the activities of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The experimental heat storage contains all heat exchanger systems that are used for ground stores: direct water exchange and a 4853 m long tube for heat exchange. Heat can be supplied to the store from the solar collectors or from a power station (as waste heat). The store and its behaviour are described. The whole system has worked successfully for 5 years under varied strategies. In the first two heating periods, the heating strategy was aimed to collect as much solar energy as possible. Thus, about 60% of the heat demand could be covered by solar energy; but the yearly heat pump coefficient-of-performance (C.O.P.) was only around 2.76. With an improved heat pump, which was installed during the last 2 months of the second heating cycle, a monthly C.O.P. of 3.6 was obtained.

In that micrometeoroid environment, the cryogenic fuel must be protected from loss due to tank puncture. The tankage must have a sufficiently high probability of survival over the length of the mission that the probability of system failure due to tank puncture is low compared to the other mission risk factors. Assuming that a single meteoroid penetration can cause a storage tank to lose its contents, two means are available to raise the probability of surviving micrometeoroid attack to the desired level. One can armor the tanks to a thickness sufficient to reduce probability of penetration of any tank to the desired level; or add extra capacity, in the form of spare tanks, that results in survival of a given number out of the ensemble at the desired level. In this paper a combination of these strategies (armoring and redundancy) is investigated. The objective is to find the optimum combination which yields the lowest shielding mass per cubic meter of surviving fuel out of the original ensemble. The investigation found that, for the volumes of fuel associated with multikilowatt class cryo storage RFC's and the armoring methodology and meteoroid models used, storage should be fragmented into small individual tanks. Larger installations (more fuel) pay less of a shielding penalty than small installations. For the same survival probability over the same time period, larger volumes will require less armoring mass per unit volume protected.",,"Cryogenics; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Meteor impacts; Tanks (containers); Armored spherical tanks; Micrometeroid armoring mass; Lunar surface analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027035353

The experimental system for this investigation consisted of a vertical cylindrical plexiglass vessel with direct contact heat exchanger for both the charge (freeze) and discharge (melt) of the storage media. The charge cycle of the clathrate system reduced the temperature of the clathrate, forcing it to change phase, thus creating the latent storage of the system. Since the clathrate was slightly heavier than water, solid or frozen material was built up from the bottom toward the top of the tank during the charge cycle. Based on the experimental results obtained in this investigation clathrate may be produced on a reliable basis at 47.6°F. This represents significant improvement over lower temperature storage systems such as ice-water with a freezing temperature of 32°F.",,"Energy storage; Heat storage; Phase transitions; Refrigerants; Cool storage medium; Gas hydrate phase change material; Gas hydrates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027002969

Thus, the search for the best performance at the least cost for such multi-purpose plants is made much more difficult by the fact that such facilities must meet differing goals or demands. Such a facility exists at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) and has been studied in order to find the optimum modes of operation as a function of time for variations in both the heating and electrical demands which this facility must meet. The results of this study are presented below. The plant itself provides heat and electricity for both the EPFL and the University of Lausanne and is projected to supply electricity to the exterior utility grid provided it can be shown to be economically viable. The plant's primary components include two gas turbines, a heat recovery system, two heat pumps, a set of heat storage tanks and both medium and low temperature district heating networks. In order to find the optimum mode of operation, a mixed-integer programming approach was used which balances the competing costs of operation and minimizes these costs subject to the operational constraints placed on the system. The effects of both the cost of the fuel and the costs of electricity sold and bought on the best performance of the system are evaluated.

The Co60 gamma ray tests were performed on devices both biased and unbiased during irradiation and at two dose rates (1 krad/hr and 50 rad/hr). In all cases the biased devices showed a threshold voltage shift of approx.0.09V/krad and significant increases in surface dark current (approx.10nA/cm2/krad at 22°C) which continued after irradiation had ceased. Both threshold voltage and dark current damage were reduced for unbiased devices. Power consumption, charge transfer efficiency (CTE), full well capacity and charge to voltage conversion factor were also measured but did not show large changes. Proton testing was carried out at 1.5 and 10 MeV again for biased and unbiased devices and dark current changes due to bulk damage were observed. These were bias independent. There was significant annealing of bulk damage after 3 months storage (this time the dark current reduced). After annealing a damage constant of roughly 2.4nA/cm2 per MeV of damage energy at 22°C was found. Changes in CTE were too small to be measured, probably because the time constants of the radiation induced traps were long compared with the clock overlap times (approx.50ns) used in this application. Some large dark current spikes (amplitude up to approx.3nA/cm2 at 22°C) were observed and these had somewhat erratic temperature behaviour. These are probably due to field-enhanced emission.",,"Charge coupled devices; Gamma rays; Protons; Space applications; Charge transfer; Dark currents; Treshold voltages; Radiation effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027001608

The analysis is based on a lumped model (the basic model) that allows a broad class of LHSSs to be completely specified, with only two parameters and a set of operating temperatures, while still retaining the main thermodynamic aspects associated with its operation. Characterization of the performance in this manner permits the broad base application potential of such systems to be viewed. This modelling is in contrast to most studies to date, which employ many parameters to include details of specific systems and therefore obscure, to a great extent, this broad based application potential. The basic model is later modified in three ways to analyze operating conditions that either occur in practical units or are desirable for an improved operation of the units. The modifications include, first, the consideration of the LHSS as being formed by many independent phase-change material (PCM) capsules. Second, the possibility of having PCMs with different phase change temperatures filling the capsules. Third, the case when the PCM melts over a temperature range. The results indicate that the efficiency of the basic model represents an upper bound for the efficient operation of LHSSs. The only possibility of obtaining efficiencies higher than those obtained with the basic model is by using PCMs with different phase change temperatures in the heat storage unit.

This leads to conveniently banded matrices for resulting simulators employed by groundwater hydrologists and petroleum engineers alike. Some non-local dependency has been recognized, with the advent of the Biot consolidation theory, in which pore-pressures are induced by stresses which are governed by elliptic rather than parabolic equations. However, an even more dramatic non-local effect involves the presence of fractures: although these are often lumped into dual-porosity and other such simple models, they do in fact change the nature of both the flow and the stress transmission problem. While some basic diffusive features can still be derived, the detailed simulation problem is considerably harder and introduces many new complexities to the numerical modelling process. Sample problems and their solutions give particular application to the important process of underground fracturing, on which the authors have conducted extensive theoretical and laboratory studies, with a broad range of applications to practical field problems.

Within the last decade, several full-scale prototypes and demonstration plants have been built, ranging in size from 20 kWe to 500 kWe, and most of these are still operating. In the economic evaluation presented herein, levelized energy costs are computed for land-based, caisson-based, and offshore wave power plant designs derived from this recent experience. Land-based Tapered Channel technology, developed in Norway, is on the verge of commercialization, with orders placed for two small plants in Australia and Indonesia. Japanese caisson-based systems are expected to enter the Pacific island market during the next five years. The development of offshore wave power is less advanced. Without long-term demonstration, private financing of an offshore project is unlikely, due to large uncertainties in absorber fabrication cost, plant maintenance requirements, component durability, and wave energy absorption efficiency. For plant sizes of 30 MWe or less, the projected cost of wave-generated electricity is lower than that for other ocean energy technologies. At this scale, wave power is also less expensive than small hydropower or diesel generation. Where demand growth is sufficiently high to warrant construction of a coal-fired plant, however, wave power loses its competitiveness with fossil fuels, although it remains the least costly ocean energy option for all but the largest tidal power plants. Several co-products enhance wave power's economic appeal, including seawater pumping for aquaculture, fresh water production by direct reverse osmosis, and breakwater protection. The case is made that for island applications, fresh water may be more valuable than electricity, in terms of both market size and energy impact. Given a scenario of commercial success in island markets, long-term demonstration of offshore components and systems, and the development of an onshore infrastructure for the storage and distribution of hydrogen, wave power can ultimately supply a large fraction of global demand for electricity, heating, and transportation fuel.",,"Caissons; Costs; Design; Economics; Electric power plants; Offshore power plants; Underwater power plants; Land base Tapered Channel technology; Wave generated electricity costs; Wave power",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026989964

The main aim is to evolve an economical design that is not demanding in terms of (overall life-cycle) mission cost, mass, volume, power, or communication/monitoring. This work is motivated by the Space Exploration Initiative, which intends to send Common Lunar Landers as precursors to more extensive missions to the Moon. The fundamental concept revolves around a compact, deployable robot that weighs less than 65 kg and is completely self-contained. The aim is to demonstrate that full-system engineering can be accomplished in small packages. The initial experiment consists of producing oxygen from the lunar soil using solar thermal energy. The 1 kw of thermal energy needed for chemical processing is derived through a low-mass composite reflector that was pioneered at The University of Arizona. The electrical energy needed is minimal (< 0.5 kw) and is generated through an array of photovoltaic cells in conjunction with a small bank of rechargeable batteries. The robot consists of a 6-degrees-of-freedom unit that scoops up the soil, sieves it into ceramic crucibles, mixes the soil with a small mass of imported carbon, positions it at the focal point, monitors and identifies the liberated gases before storing them, and replaces the spent material after converting it into a small briquette. The process is carried out during a lunar day and data storage is through a computer. During the lunar night, the stored data will be extensively processed before the results are communicated to a mother craft, or directly to Earth.",,"Intelligent robots; Lunar landing; Moon bases; Planetary landers; Robot applications; Robotic arms; Space research; Life cycle; Mother craft; Space exploration; Lunar missions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026989720

This situation has lead to the involvement of a number of countries, especially those of the European Community, in heavily funded 'Wealth from the Oceans' projects. A significant element of the research being conducted under the auspices of these projects is concerned with the development of small unmanned and untethered autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To carry out their intended autonomous missions these vehicles will need reliable power systems which have high energy densities. However, although research into navigation, control and command systems has progressed considerably under this development effort, only limited headway has been made in the development of power systems which could be readily integrated into these vessels. Electrochemical power systems have been used in underwater applications for a number of years but those presently available cannot meet the rigorous specifications demanded by AUV missions. Consequently high performance fuel cells and advanced battery systems are being developed which should be generally available within the next ten years. Until then, power systems based on the utilisation of the more mature heat engine technologies appear to offer the possibility of a quicker solution to the energy density problem. Of the heat engine types available the Stirling Engine, already proven in larger submarines, shows considerable promise. One of the main reasons for the selection of the Stirling engine is it's ability to utilise any heat source, such as radioisotopes, thermal energy storage and metallic fuels. In this paper a project is described in which the design requirements for a Stirling engine driven AUV have been examined together with the identification of the most suitable primary energy source for a specific mission. As part of this project a user-friendly PC-based computer program has been developed which allows rapid assessments of the use of different energy sources with a double-acting Stirling for user defined missions.

The degredation of minority carrier lifetime results in changes in semiconductor device properties such as current gain, storage time, saturation voltage and sink current.

Barriers to the transition to alternate fuels include cost of vehicle conversion, cost of production, distribution, and on-board storage of the fuels, and lack of economic refuelling stations. For example, even though natural gas feedstock is relatively inexpensive compared to gasoline, the combined costs of vehicle conversion, conventional liquefaction/compression, distribution, and dispensing result in natural gas fuel prices on an energy equivalent basis only slightly less than the present prices of gasoline or diesel fuel. Similarly, the cost of gaseous hydrogen feedstock is approximately one third the cost of gasoline, but after costs of conventional liquefaction/compression, distribution, and storage are added to hydrogen feedstock costs, the economics for conversion to hydrogen fuel are unattractive in most situations. A major reduction in the liquefaction/compression costs for fleet-size refuelling stations would reduce the price of the fuel to the consumer, increase motivation to install refuelling stations, and therefore provide increased incentive for conversion to natural gas and hydrogen. One technology which offers a potential reduction in life-cycle costs of liquefying equipment for natural gas and hydrogen is magnetic refrigeration. Numerous studies have shown the promise for higher thermodynamic efficiency and lower associated operating costs, but few studies of capital costs of magnetic liquefiers have been done. The objective of this paper is to report an analysis of capital costs for a 1000 gal/day, fleet-size magnetic liquefier for LNG to determine the potential for capital cost reduction using this technology instead of conventional gas-cycle liquefaction technology.",,"Costs; Efficiency; Liquefied natural gas; Refrigeration; Synthetic fuels; Thermodynamics; Fleet size cryofuel refuelling system; Magnetic liquefier; Thermodynamic efficiency; Condensers (liquefiers)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026980969

With such systems, considerable energy savings may be obtained because higher cooling temperatures are adequate owing to the available large cooling surfaces and the radiative heat exchange between people's heads and ceiling. Moreover cool storage within structural elements may decrease peak loads. The panel cooling system examined here uses a solar driven H2O/LiBr absorption refrigeration unit. A thermodynamic and thermal analysis of the whole system is carried out and the expected performance is predicted for operation during the typical summer in Athens using local climatological data. Because of the very high evaporation temperatures (up to 18°C), the theoretical coefficient of performance of the H2O/LiBr unit is much higher than that obtained in usual refrigeration applications, i.e. it reaches 94% with specific cooling capacity 2410-2450 kJ/kg H2O.

A number of notable tidal power developments have been accomplished and energy has been extracted from simple tidal mills throughout the ages. Any constraints that might arise from economic, financial and environmental considerations today are those associated with development of almost all electrical energy sources. Basic concepts, tidal power technology and the practical achievements in this field will be described. The state of the art employed in the engineering design of major proposed tidal power developments is taken as the basis of this chapter. Intensive design consideration has been given to the application of advanced achievements in marine offshore construction and in the manufacture of large hydroelectric generating units and power plants. Experience in these fields allows for convenient transfer of technology to tidal power recovery. Construction method and means of shortening schedules are critical to minimizing cost. The best endeavours on both counts do not yet achieve an economic outcome which meets the criteria for normal financing of power generating facilities. Secondary benefits from ancillary uses are an important factor in planning for tidal power but rarely contribute significantly to reducing energy cost. Future development of tidal power will be dependent on a return to low discount rates combined with a growing recognition of the human value of security from diversity of energy sources benign in their global effects. Environmental and ecological effects are all important factors in considering the acceptability of energy developments.

In one system, a heat pump is applied to provide heating. In the winter, the heat pump extracts heat from the cold store, thus loading the store. In the other system, the store is loaded in the winter by cooling groundwater with cold air from outside. For both generic system configurations, technical and economic results of detailed design studies and projects in operation are given.

Applications range from real-time low bit rate teleconferencing codecs to moderate and high bit-rate coding standards currently being considered for CD-ROM video storage and packet video. Recent research has suggested that blocking artifacts can be reduced by applying block motion compensation on overlapped blocks in image frames. In this paper, we formulate overlapped block motion compensation as an optimal linear estimator of pixel intensities given the neighboring block motion estimate in the frame. Applying this framework, we propose a procedure for designing optimal windows for overlapped block motion compensation. When applying block motion compensation with overlapped blocks, the optimal motion vector to apply at each block in an image depends on values of motion vectors in a non-causal neighborhood of that block. Thus, unlike for standard block-based compensation, optimal motion estimates cannot be computed with exhaustive search block- matching algorithms, even with the overlap window incorporated. Instead, we defined a simple iterative procedure for computing optimal motion estimates for overlapped block motion compensation. The performance gains achieved by both optimal motion estimation and optimal overlapped windows are demonstrated in simulations. Together, reductions of up to 30% in displaced frame difference energy are demonstrated compared with standard block motion compensation.",,"Algorithms; Estimation; Image analysis; Image compression; Motion pictures; ROM; Vectors; Video recording; Video signal processing; Block motion compensation; Codecs; Motion compensation; Motion vectors; Overlapped blocks; Overlapped motion compensation; Video storage; Teleconferencing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026963978

Optimal control results for this system in terms of both minimum energy and demand charges were compared with simple chiller-priority and storage-priority control strategies. Chiller priority is common control method whereby storage is only used to match the difference between the building load and the maximum cooling capacity of the chillers. Although this control tends to minimize the use of storage for off-design days, it is easy to implement and there is a significant reduction in the annual peak electrical demand over conventional systems. Storage-priority strategies involve maximizing the use of storage during the on-peak electrical period. The storage-priority strategy that was investigates in this study is termed ″load-limiting″ and involves operating the chillers at a constant cooling rate during the on-peak period such that the storage is fully depleted (i.e., no ice) at the end of the on-peak period. Load-limiting control tends to minimize the cooling plant peak electrical power use, but it was also found to be nearly optimal in terms of energy costs with the presence of time-of-day electric rates.

The technology has already been demonstrated by Bonneville Power Administration in a 30-MJ SMES test demonstration unit (1). Savings in utility operations from improved system efficiency, increased reliability, and reduced maintenance requirements contribute to the economic justification of SMES. Beyond these benefits, there are additional benefits which in the long run may equal or outweigh the electrical operational benefits. These benefits are the energy conservation and environmental benefits. The technology has the capability of reducing fuel consumption which can in turn reduce emissions. In a regional setting it can shift emissions both in volumes and in physical. With its capability to strategically shift generation and significantly affect emissions and air quality it can ``stretch'' clean energy generation options, thus SMES can be seen as an energy and environmental management technology and tool.",,"Applications; Costs; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Renewable energy resources; Superconducting cables; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Electric utilities",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026962391

Such disconnections can have serious consequences for the users of the electrical power grid. All power plant units involved in the grid frequency control must provide as fast as possible power to the grid in case of disturbances to the grid frequency. The activation of the necessary power is normally provided by fast opening of the turbine control valves. However the valves must be throttled in normal operation in order to be able to supply power in case of frequency disturbances. This causes a loss in efficiency. The use of the condensate stoppage technique in keeping the turbine control valve throttling to a minimum has proved to be successful. In this paper an expanded control concept is proposed, whereby not only in cases of frequency support but also in cases of large load changes the condensate stoppage technique is used. As a result the fuel over firing can be reduced, this in turn producing a smoother and more optimal firing. The testing of the new control concept was carried out on a nonlinear power plant model. The concept has been included in the control design of a coal fired power plant, which is scheduled for commissioning in 1992.",,"Boiler firing; Computer simulation; Dynamic response; Electric energy storage; Electric frequency control; Electric load management; Electric load shedding; Mathematical models; Power control; Steam condensate; Steam turbines; Valves (mechanical); Condensate stoppage; Frequency deviations; Load ramping; Load shedding; Primary electrical grid; Valve throttling; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026958499

Very often the load dispatcher is not aware of the real and momentary response capability of the units he has to commit to providing for short-term reserves. To quantify the governing factors and to provide the necessary data for the load dispatcher several measured response versus time curves were recorded and compiled by a CIGRE working group for various types and sizes of thermal units operating with various control strategies. The resulting data base can be utilized to support the development and evaluation of simplified mathematical models for use in on-line dispatching or operations planning studies. This paper presents characteristics in four categories, three of which are: utilization of stored energy provided in boiler or steam cycle, increased fuel flow and a combination of both. The fourth category of results focusses on the response capability in the first 15 seconds to illustrate the possible rate of reaction when immediate emergency power is required, particularly for small and/or island systems. The measured dynamic performance was compiled and analyzed for 32 fossil-fuelled power plants from seven countries. These include drum and once-through boilers in the 120-800 MW capacity range firing coal, oil or gas.

A unique ""pseudo-logarithmic"" sample storage scheme allows each transient to be sampled at more than 11 different rates, permitting 3 to 5 decades of time constants to be observed in one thermal scan allowing the resolution of closely spaced defect energy levels. The high system flexibility allows weighting times (or transient observation times) to be selected between <200 μs to 3 days.

At the rather modest electron energy of MAX this photon energy range can be reached only by an undulator featuring a fairly short period and the smallest possible magnetic gap. Even then, higher harmonics (up to the 13th) of the radiation spectrum must be utilized. An optimization of the magnetic design resulted in a hybrid configuration of NdFeB magnets and soft iron poles with a period of 24 mm and a minimum magnetic gap of 7-10 mm. A variable-gap vacuum chamber allows reduction of the vacuum gap from a maximum of 20 mm, needed for injection, down to 6 mm during stored beam operation. A special design of this chamber permits a magnetic gap between pole tips that is only 1 mm larger than the vacuum gap. Adequate field uniformity was ensured by calibration of magnets to equal strength at their true operating point and verification of the homogeneity of their magnetization. Magnetic measurements included Hall probe scans of the undulator field and flip coil evaluations of the field integral.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009746426

Four different surfactants containing the same hydrophobic group (C9H19C6H5(CH2CH( CH3)O)13) and increasingly large hydrophilic chains (poly(ethylene oxide) with 27, 48, 79 and 174 ethylene oxide (EO) units) were used. The rheology was studied using steady-state shear stress (τ)-shear rate (γ) measurements as well as oscillatory measurements. From the τ-γ curves, the extrapolated yield stress τβ and plastic viscosity ηpl were obtained as a function of surfactant concentration. From oscillatory measurements, the complex modulus G*, the storage modulus G′ and loss modulus G″ were obtained as a function of frequency at different surfactant concentrations. All results showed a rapid increase in the rheological parameters with increase of surfactant concentration, once the latter reached a critical concentration. This rapid increase (non-Newtonian flow) was considered to be due to depletion flocculation. The latter was thought to occur at a surfactant concentration in excess of that required for maximum random packing of surfactant micelles, which were assumed to be spherical. A simple calculation (using a value of 0.63 for random packing) predicted the surfactant concentration at the onset of depletion flocculation, using the aggregation number of surfactant molecules in the micelle (obtained from surface-tension or light-scattering measurements). The extrapolated yield value was used to calculate the energy of separation Esep between contact points in a floc. Esep was compared with the theoretical free energy of depletion attraction Gdep that was calculated using the Asakura and Oosawa theory. Agreement between the calculated Gdep and experimental Esep values was fair. © 1992.","Depletion flocculation; latex suspensions; micelles.",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344252845

The model analysed includes state variables for somatic and reproductive tissue, energy intake and requirements for physiological maintenance, and iteroparous reproduction. It predicts that female salamanders should spend the first part of their lives growing. After reaching sexual maturity, females should either spend the remainder of their lives reproducing at the expense of decreasing body size, possibly resulting in death by starvation, or maintain approximately constant body size at the expense of low reproductive output. This lack of correspondence to the observed biology of dusky salamanders suggests that not all the appropriate biology has been described.

The materials are subjected to (a) combined static torsion and extension, and (b) small, steady-state torsional oscillations superposed on a large static simple extension. The materials are assumed to be incompressible and isotropic in their undeformed state and a time-strain separable relaxation modulus tensor is employed in order to characterize the steady-state harmonic viscoelastic response. The combined static torsion and extension experiments are used to determine the basic delayed elastic response functions. A Rivlin-type strain energy expression of third-order accuracy is used for the purpose. The two-constant, Mooney-Rivlin form is found to be adequate for both materials in the relatively limited range of deformation magnitudes considered. The torsional storage and loss moduli are determined under quasistatic conditions as functions of frequency and axial static pre-strain.

Stomach and intestine indices increased by 139 and 66%, respectively, with the most growth occurring by Day 16. The stomach had a faster growth rate than the intestine, as indicated by an increase in the stomach: intestine ratio. Gonadal growth did not begin until Day 16, after substantial gut growth. DNA and morphometric analysis revealed that cellular growth in the stomach and intestine was first hyperplastic and then hypertrophic. DNA concentration and histological examination indicated that the stomach was composed of large voluminous cells, and the intestine of small cells. The stomach of starved individuals contained numerous depressions that significantly decreased in number during growth. The number of depressions significantly increased in the intestine. Lipid concentration and amount were higher in the stomach, and increased during growth by 43 and 258%, respectively, by Day 32; little change in lipid occurred in the intestine. The stomach lipid:DNA ratio increased by 66% by Day 16, with little change in the intestine.

The total energy stored in the stomach and the intestine increased by 152 and 66%, respectively, by Day 32. The stomach mucosa increased in thickness and appeared to decrease its surface area. These data suggest that the stomach constitutes the primary storage organ of the gut. The intestinal mucosa also inreased in thickness but remained thinner than the stomich while apparently increasing in surface area, suggesting an enhanced role in residual nutrient absorption and ranslocation, respiration or water ion-transport. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000274524

Fish in the two groups had a similar standard length and body mass at the end of the experimental period. Three muscle fibre types were distinguished in posterior myotomes using histochemical techniques. Tonic fibres which stained weakly for myofibrillar ATPase activity (MATPase) and succinic dehydrogenase activity (SDHase) formed a scattered superficial layer on the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The number of tonic muscle fibres/myotome was 43% higher in fish reared at 17°C (63) than at 22°C (44) (P < 0.01). Superficial red fibres, which stained heavily for SDHase, constituted 10.7% of the myotomal muscle cross-sectional area in 17°C-acclimated turbot compared with only 7.8% in 22°C-acclimated fish (P < 0.01). Red fibres showed an intermediate staining for myofibrillar ATPase at pH 9.4 relative to tonic and white fibres, and were the most stable fibre type following alkaline preincubation (pH 10.4). In this respect the red fibres of juvenile turbot resemble the fast red or intermediate muscle fibre types of adult teleosts. Red and white fibres stained much more heavily for glycogen in turbot reared at 17 than 22°C.

One can, of course, also reduce the hydrostatic load on the dam by reducing the elevation of the reservoir. However, then the reduction of the storage capacity of the reservoir and decrease of head worsen the power capabilities of the hydrostation by an amount far exceeding the expenditures related to creating the air curtain. For example, the one-time expenditures on creating the air curtain for the Chirkey hydrostation in 1984 prices are 10 million rubles, whereas a reduction of the normal pool level would lead to underproduction of energy amounting to about this sum every year. The second direction is the provision of the design seismicity of a dam under construction (planned). Then in the case of using an air curtain it is possible to construct a dam with smaller volumes of concrete.

There is, however, accumulating evidence to suggest that during ad-libitum conditions energy balance is achieved by a separate regulation of carbohydrate, fat and protein balances. Regulation of carbohydrate balance has the highest priority in the hierarchy, which is appropriate because the limited glycogen stores are only capable of covering the carbohydrate oxidation for a few days. Due to the higher satiating power of carbohydrate and protein compared with fat, a reduction in the dietary fat/carbohydrate ratio produces a negative fat balance in normal subjects consuming the diet ad libitum, while an increase in dietary fat/carbohydrate ratio results in a positive fat balance and weight gain. Subjects with a genetically determined predispostion to obesity become obese when they are exposed to a particular range of environmental conditions. The available knowledge suggests that the genetic propensity to weight gain is caused by a susceptibility to dietary fat due to an impaired capacity to increase their lipid/carbohydrate oxidation when fed a high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet. This in turn promotes lipid storage, depletion of carbohydrate stores and increases appetite. By enlarging the fat stores, the accompanying insulin resistance and higher levels of circulating non-esterified fatty acids increase lipid oxidation until it is commensurate with the dietary fat intake. The development of obesity may therefore be viewed as a regulatory mechanism by which the impaired lipid oxidation rate is raised to match a high fat intake. However, by decreasing the dietary ratio of fat to carbohydrate, macronutrient balance may be achieved with a high energy expenditure and a normal body composition. The results support current dietary recommendations, but with less emphasis on carbohydrate source, and they are also applicable for the prevention and treatment of obesity.",,"carbohydrate; fat; glycogen; protein; appetite; carbohydrate intake; carbohydrate metabolism; dietary intake; energy balance; fat intake; genetic predisposition; inborn error of metabolism; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; metabolic regulation; nutrient; obesity; priority journal; protein intake; review; weight gain; Dietary Fats; Human; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026737775

The strongest response to the fertilization was seen in young-of-the-year grayling; the adult response was more variable. Whole-river phosphorus fertilization of the Kuparuk River, Alaska, during 1985-90 resulted in a 1.4- to 1.9-fold increase in the size of age 0+ fish and a 1.5- to 2.4-fold increase in the weight gain of adult grayling in some years. Neutral lipid storage in adult grayling was increased 1.3- to 3.4-fold in the fertilized zone compared with that in fish from the control zone. There was no detectable difference between the zones in gonad mass, percent lipid in eggs, or egg size. These results suggest that autochthonous production is an important energy source for fish in tundra streams and that nutrient limitation of stream ecosystems affects the highest trophic levels.

We found that photoexcited chlorophylls, pheophytins and porphyrins are capable of reversible and irreversible oxido-reduction. The mechanism of the photosensitized electron transfer from donor to acceptor molecule is based on the reversible photochemical oxido-reduction of the pigment-sensitizer. This property of the excited pigments is realized in the reaction centres of photosynthetic cells when photooxidation of bacteriochlorophyll(s) or chlorophyll of Photosystem II is coupled to pheophytin reduction leading to the final charge separation. The studies of the state and function of pigments in the course of chlorophyll biosynthesis in cellular and non-cellular systems revealed different monomeric and aggregated forms of pigments and the phenomenon of self-assembly of various forms of chlorophylls, bacteriochlorophylls and protochlorophylls. The discovery of protochlorophyll photoreduction in non-cellular system allowed the study of the molecular mechanisms of this reaction. In order to construct models of photosynthetic charge separation, we used inorganic photocatalysts-semiconductors, mainly titanium dioxide, and pigments incorporated into detergent micelles or lipid vesicles. To prevent back reactions we used heterogeneous systems where primary unstable products were spatially separated; coupling of solubilized chlorophylls or semiconductor particles with bacterial hydrogenase led to molecular hydrogen photoproduction. Light excitation of some coenzymes, mainly NADH and NADPH, was considered from the point of view of early events of chemical evolution. Now we are interested in the creation of photobiochemical systems using principles of photosynthesis for the conversion and storage of solar energy. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","chlorophyll photochemistry; hydrogen photoproduction; pheophytin; reaction centres; solar energy conversion; titanium dioxide",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041343487

Replacement of HB10 with aspartic acid increased stability while substitutions at B28 and/or B29 were either comparable to insulin or had decreased stability. The principal chemical degradation product of accelerated storage conditions was a disulfidelinked multimer that was formed through a disulfide interchange reaction which resulted from β-elimination of the disulfides. The maintenance of the native state of insulin was shown to be important in protecting the disulfides from reduction by dithiothreitol and implicitly from the disulfide inter change reaction that occurs during storage. To understand how these amino acid changes alter chemical stability, the intramolecular conformational equilibria of each analog was assessed by equilibrium denaturation. The Gibbs free energy of unfolding was compared with the chemical stability during storage for over 20 analogs.

Climatic controls are invoked much less often, and geomorphic controls are rarely considered except for small-scale features. Tectonism is the first-order control on sedimentation at mountain fronts by providing accommodation space for sediment accumulation, and the requisite energy for the system to operate. However, geomorphic controls on sediment yield from source areas, transformation of sediment yield in transfer systems, and feedback mechanisms between source areas and depositional basins may be the secondary controls on sediment dispersal and accumulation near mountain fronts. Drainage basins pass through a series of stages during their evolution. Sediment flux is large during initial stages of basin evolution, allowing fans to prograde rapidly. But as drainage nets in the source area expand, and valleys increase their capacity to store sediment eroded from interfluves, the quantity and caliber of the sediment load at the outlet diminishes, and fan sequences begin to fine upward. Eventually the source area drainage network will expand to its maximum size. Relief is greatest in the source area at this time, and the quantity and calibre of the sediment eroded from valley walls reaches a maximum. Dynamic equilibrium between fan and source area is attained and a period during which spontaneous incision of source area valleys, fanhead entrenchment, and depositional lobe progradation occurs The amount and size of sediment supplied to the fan reaches a maximum at this time, and fan deposits coarsen upward through this period. However, feedback relationships between fan and depositional basin limit the ability of fans to prograde basinward. Fans begin to retrograde as relief in the source area declines and storage capacity increases. Fining-upward sequences arc deposited and basinal facies encroach on the fan during this final phase. Ancient alluvial fans commonly consist of coarsening-then fining-upward stratigraphic sequences consistent with this evolutionary model, and cross-sections of alluvial fan deposits normally show that fan facies stack vertically near their upland sources. A typical first-order fan deposit ranges in thickness between 100 m and 250 m, but those in foreland basins near thrust margins are considerably thicker, possibly in response to increased accommodation space provided by basin subsidence, extended periods of downcutting caused by continued movement on the thrust, and to basinward translation of the source area.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001758213

Appreciable PS I-cyclic ATP formation was shown to occur in both C-3 and C-4 plants. It was also observed that various environmental/experimental conditions leading to a significant inhibition of the linear photosynthetic electron transport were associated with a stimulation of PS I-cyclic energy storage. In contrast, in vivo adaptation of leaves to light-states 1 and 2 did not induce any photoacoustically measurable changes in the capacity of PS I for cyclic electron transfer. Consequently, the presented data do not support the recent hypothesis that the main function of light-induced state transitions is to regulate the balance between linear (PS I+PS II) and cyclic (PS I) electron transport in the chloroplasts. © 1992.

The experiment used a linear thermionic diode detector and monochromatized synchrotron radiation from the DORIS II storage ring with a bandwidth of 0.3 Å. The diode detector allowed for a significant improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio over previous measurements and is described in some detail.

After homogenizing, cooling at a rate of 22 K min-1 (SC22) is sufficient to retain all copper in solid solution. GP-zone formation during subsequent heat treatment is hindered; this is ascribed to an insufficient number of (excess) vacancies. After a water quench (WQ) a large number of GP zones are formed during subsequent storage at room temperature for 1 h. The heat content of the GP-zone dissolution effect can quantitatively be described in terms of the heat of precipitation of GP I zones and the solid solubilities as derived from the GP I zone solvus. The heat content of the combined θ′-/θ-phase precipitation effect appeared to be proportional to the number of copper atoms precipitated, yielding an average value for the heat of copper precipitation of 36 kJ mol-1 copper. The activation energy for θ′-phase formation is 0.75 eV for SC22 specimens and 1.10 ± 0.10 eV for WQ specimens. The differences in reported activation energies for θ′-phase formation are discussed in terms of mobility of dissolve atoms (related to the vacancy concentration), interfacial energy and direction of growth (normal or perpendicular to the θ′-phase plate). © 1992.",,"Aluminum copper alloys; Copper alloys; Heat treatment; Precipitation (chemical); Differential scanning calorimetry; Optical micrographs; X ray diffraction; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026910815

Continuous neutron fluxes at this intensity, which is approximately 100 times larger than is typically available in a large scale thermal reactor, appear practical, owing to recent advances in proton linear accelerator technology and to the spallation target-moderator design presented here. This large flux of thermal neutrons makes possible a waste inventory in the transmutation system which is smaller by about a factor of 100 than competing concepts. The accelerator allows the system to operate well below criticality so that the possibility for a criticality accident is eliminated. No control rods are required. The successful implementation of this new method for energy generation and waste transmutation would eliminate the need for nuclear waste storage on a geologic time scale. The production of nuclear energy from 232Th or 238U is used to illustrate the general principles of commercial nuclear energy, production without long-term high-level waste.

The ability to exploit the high spectral brightness of the ALS was the main criterion for PRT selection. In the XUV spectral regions served by the ALS, a major benefit of high brightness will be the ability to achieve spatial resolution in the neighborhood of 200 Å in X-ray microscopy and holography and in spatially resolved spectroscopy.

Safranek, Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, 1991]. The low emittance lattice is designed to optimize the performance of SPEAR as a synchrotron radiation source while keeping SPEAR hardware changes at a minimum. The horizontal emittance of the electron beam in the low emittance lattice is reduced by a factor of 4 from the previous lattice. This reduces the typical horizontal source size and divergence of the photon beams by a factor of 2 each and increases the photon beam brightness. At 3 GeV the horizontal emittance is 129π nm rad, which makes the low emittance lattice the lowest emittance, running synchrotron radiation source in the world in the 1.5 to 4.0 GeV energy range for the emittance scaled to 3 GeV. The measured vertical emittance was reduced to half that typically seen at SPEAR in the past. The brightness of the photon beams was further increased by reducing βy at the insertion devices to 1.1 m and reducing the energy dispersion at the insertion devices by more than a factor of 2 on average. The horizontal dispersion at the rf cavities was reduced by a factor of nearly 4 which gives much less problems with synchrobetatron resonances. The dynamic and physical apertures of the lattice are large, giving long beam lifetimes and easy injection of electrons. The measurements of the linear optics and intensity dependent phenomena gave reasonable agreement with the design. The overall performance of the machine was very good. Injection rates of 10 to 20 mA/min and larger were achieved routinely, and 100 mA total current was stored. Repeated ramping of stored beam from the injection energy of 2.3 GeV to the running energy of 3.0 GeV was achieved with very little beam loss. This low emittance configuration is expected to be the operating configuration for SPEAR starting in January 1992. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44049119866

We consider self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), in which electron bunches with low emittance, high peak current and small energy spread radiate coherently in a single pass through a long undulator. As the electron beam passes down the undulator, its interaction with the increasingly intense spontaneous radiation causes a bunch density modulation at the optical wavelength, resulting in stimulated emission and exponential growth of coherent power in a single pass. The need for optical-cavity mirrors, which place a lower limit on the wavelength of a conventional FEL oscillator, is avoided. Various combinations of electron-beam and undulator parameters, as well as special undulator designs, are discussed. Saturation and high peak, in-band, coherent power (460 MW) are possible with a 67 m, hybrid permanent-magnet undulator in a ring bypass. A 100 m, cusp-field undulator can achieve high average, in-band, coherent power (0.25 W) in the main ring. The existing, 25.6 m.

It was found that almost all of the emulsifiers tested influence the rheology of the dispersions. The magnitude and the direction of the rheological changes depend on both the type and the amount of emulsifier. In most cases the changes are relatively small, especially for fat crystals. Generally speaking, the largest changes are caused by lecithins and saturated monoglycerides. The magnitudes of colloidal forces and equilibrium distances between the particles have been estimated from the rheological network model of van den Tempel [J. Colloid Sci. 16:284 (1964)] and from the correlation of the yield value to the interaction energy by Gillespie [J.

We suggest that trees are equally effective in preventing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere if they remove a unit of C from the atmosphere or if they supply a sustainable source of energy that substitutes for a unit of C discharged by burning fossil fuels. The model shows that the most effective strategy for using forest land to minimize increases in atmospheric CO2 will depend on the current status of the land, the productivity that can be expected, the efficiency with which the forest harvest is used to substitute for fossil fuels, and the time perspective of the analysis. For forests with large standing biomass and low productivity the most effective strategy is to protect the existing forest. For land with little standing biomass and low productivity, the most effective strategy is to reforest or otherwise manage the land for forest growth and C storage. Where high productivity can be expected, the most effective strategy is to manage the forest for a harvestable crop and to use the harvest with maximum efficiency either for long-lived products or to substitute for fossil fuels. The longer the time perspective, the more likely that harvesting and replanting will result in net C benefits. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"biomass; carbon storage; forest; Carbon - Storage; Environmental Protection; Greenhouse Effect - Reduction; Carbon Uptake; Forest Land; Forestry; carbon; carbon dioxide; air pollution; atmosphere; biomass; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; forest; nonhuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026906092

As previous reports have suggested that NaF becomes incorporated into bone's crystal structure, possibly affecting bone strength, we sought to examine the relationship among bone fluoride content, bone mass, and skeletal fragility. Twenty-one-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with four different doses of NaF. The tibiae were subjected to histomorphometric and biochemical analyses, and the femora were tested in torsion for the properties of strength, stiffness, energy storage capacity, and angular deformation. The results showed that over 50% of the skeleton in these rats was turned over in the presence of NaF. The four different doses resulted in a linear increase in bone F concentration and suggested excellent absorption and incorporation of this drug. No changes in histomorphometric indices of bone formation or turnover were found. Despite the large fraction of bone formed during NaF treatment, and the linear increase in bone fluoride content in relation to dose, there were no changes observed in any of the mechanical properties. These results suggest that, even extensive incorporation of fluoride into bone, in the absence of an effect on bone mass or remodeling, does not significantly alter its capacity to withstand mechanical loads. © 1992 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Bone mass; Cortical bone; Histomorphometry; Mechanical properties; Sodium fluoride","fluoride sodium; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bone deformation; bone mass; bone strength; controlled study; cortical bone; female; femur; morphometrics; nonhuman; oral drug administration; osteoporosis; priority journal; rat; tibia; vertebra fracture; Animal; Bone Matrix; Female; Femur; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium Fluoride; Stress, Mechanical; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026742563

However, although environmental variables undoubtedly play a role in the development of obesity, it is now clear that genetic variation is also involved in the determination of an individual's susceptibility to body fat accumulation. In addition, it is also widely accepted that obesity is not a single homogeneous phenotype. It is also heterogeneous regarding its causes and metabolic complications. The regional distribution of body fat appears to be an important correlate of the metabolic complications that have been related to obesity. Due to their higher accumulation of abdominal fat, men are generally more at risk for the metabolic complications of obesity than women whereas some obese women, with large gluteal-femoral adipose depots may have a cosmetic problem which may not necessarily require medical intervention. Several studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms by which abdominal obesity is related to diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It appears that the increased risk of abdominal obesity is the result of complex hormonal and metabolic interactions. Studies in genetic epidemiology have shown that both total body fatness and the regional distribution of body fat have a significant genetic component. Standardized intervention studies using an identical twin design have shown that individuals that have the same genetic background tend to show similar changes in body fat and in plasma lipoprotein levels when exposed to standardized caloric excess or energy restriction. Finally, although abdominal obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, not every abdominal obese subject will experience metabolic complications, suggesting that some obese individuals may be more susceptible than others. Variation in several genes relevant to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism may alter the relation of abdominal obesity to dyslipoproteinemias. Abdominal obesity should therefore be considered as a factor that exacerbates an individual's susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","cardiovascular disease; lipoproteins; obesity","apolipoprotein b; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; abdomen; adipose tissue; body fat; body weight; cardiovascular disease; conference paper; disease association; dyslipoproteinemia; female; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; human; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoprotein blood level; lipoprotein metabolism; male; menopause; monozygotic twins; obesity; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; Adipose Tissue; Disease Susceptibility; Exercise; Female; Human; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Male; Obesity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Twins, Monozygotic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026670527

The interaction of these photons with atoms and ions in an electron-beam ion trap (EBIT) can generate highly ionized atomic species (predominantly through inner shell ionization) up to and including H-like U, and can be utilized to measure photoionization as well as bound-bound transition cross sections in all ionic species. Those may serve as benchmark measurements to test of confirm theoretical calculations. This method of ion generation has the additional advantage that photon beams are not limited by space charge effects, do not contribute to ion recombination nor directly to beam heating, and may be used as a diagnostic tool to study ion distribution inside the EBIT. Such a mode of operation could further increase the range of EBIT devices, which have already proven themselves to be powerful and versatile research tools.

In a double crystal monochromator, the first crystal must absorb nearly all of this output power, as it diffracts the desired wavelength to the second crystal. Storage rings currently projected or under construction produce heat loads of this intensity and thus require significantly improved optical element cooling methods to preserve the spectral quality of the output radiation. As beam intensities reach these higher levels, analysis of the thermal performance of passive and actively cooled optical elements becomes more and more critical because such elements are a cost effective means for producing a cooled crystal that performs to its design specifications the first time it is installed in the beamline. The Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International is applying the experience gained in high energy laser optics research (the design of cooled IR and UV optical components for free electron lasers) to the problems of cooled X-ray monochromator crystals and grazing incidence VUV optics. In this paper, a set of first order parametric calculations and a second order finite element calculation were performed to determine surface temperature rise, coolant pressure drop and surface distortion in a single crystal silicon heat exchanger with heat loads of 100 to 550 W/cm2. Two different heat exchanger designs (microchannels and pin post cell) and two different coolants (water and liquid gallium) were analyzed to assess performance advantages of each. © 1992.",,"Crystals - Coolants; Crystals - Optical Properties; Crystals - Thermal Effects; Heat Exchangers - Applications; Water Cooled Silicon Crystals; X-Ray Monochromators; Monochromators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026892012

Correlation between the fluorometric analysis, 1-week survival rate after liver transplantation, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis activity in the early phase after transplantation was studied. Fluorometric study: Rat livers were preserved at 0°-4°C for 0-48 h in Euro-Collins solution and then reperfused for 15 min with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution at 4°C. The amplitude (R x A) between the oxidized and the reduced steady-state NADH fluorometric trace and the velocity (R x V) of the trace were determined to evaluate the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The R x A and R x V remained at levels higher than 90% of control after 6-h preservation, while the R x A of the 9-h preservation group and the R x V of the 12-h preservation group decreased significantly compared with those of the control and the 6-h preservation group. Survival study: a 100% survival rate after transplantation was achieved in the 6-h preservation group, whereas the rates were 18.8% and 0% in the 9-and 12-h preservation groups respectively. These survival rates correlated closely with the time-dependent decrease of the fluorometric parameters. Study of mitochondrial phosphorylative activity and energy charge 3 h after transplantation: With fresh grafts, the decrease in hepatic energy charge after transplantation was reduced to 0.79 from the control value of 0.86 by a 30% increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis ability. When the graft was preserved for 12 h, the energy charge dropped to 0.63 due to lack of the enhancement of ATP synthesis ability.

The samples were vacuum infiltrated with pure water or with a suitable buffer. The use of such methodology permitted an accurate determination of the energy storage parameter at low modulation frequencies, where in non-infiltrated leaves oxygen evolution dominates the photoacoustic signal and does not allow energy storage measurements. Differences between infiltration media were not essential, however the use of pure water as infiltration medium sometimes caused instability of the measured energy storage, particularly at longer experimental time. Values of energy storage in individual samples ranged mostly between 0.2 to 0.35. Measured as a function of the modulation frequency, energy storage was found to be constant from about 10 to 200 Hz for pea leaves. In sugar maple leaves, the energy storage slightly increased between 100 and 500 Hz. Obtaining an accurate value for energy storage also allowed an accurate estimation of the O2 evolution contribution to the photoacoustic signal of an unfiltrated leaf. In a maple leaf its frequency dependence showed only the effect of diffusion in the entire frequency range (10-500 Hz). Energy storage transients were observed after long periods (ca. 1/4-2 hrs) of dark adaptation upon the transition to light. In this case the initial energy storage was roughly about 1/2 that of the steady state value indicating strong PS I activity, while PS II was transiently incompetent. Energy-storage increased during illumination in a way to correspond to photosynthetic induction events as previously measured by fluorescence and O2 evolution. Transients in energy storage were also found following high light to low light transitions (i.e., switch off of the saturating background light), that paralleled similar transients in oxygen evolution, showing initial transient inactivation followed by progressive reactivation of PS II. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","energy storage; induction; photosynthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002173433

The hydriding behaviour of the new composite materials, Mg-ξwt.%FeTi(Mn) and La2Mg17-ξwt.%LaNi5, were studied for various values of ξ (ξ = 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50). The Mg-ξ-%FeTi(Mn) materials were activated under a hydrogen atmosphere (about 33 kgf cm-2) and an optimum storage capacity of about 3.5 wt.% corresponding to room temperature hydrogenation was established for ξ=40. This high storage capacity-almost double the storage capacity of the well-known FeTi(Mn)-has been observed under ambient conditions. The La2Mg17-ξ-%LaNi6 materials were activated at higher temperatures (about 360 °C) in a hydrogen atmosphere. An optimum storage capacity of 4 wt.% in terms of pressure and composition was observed for La2Mg17-20%LaNi5 at 350 °C. In comparison with the native ingredient La2Mg17, much faster (nearly three times) kinetics were found. In order to understand the hydrogenation behaviour and the high storage capacity, structural-microstructural and chemical analyses of these composite materials were carried out. From the structural investigations it has been found that all the synthesized materials are multiphase. The composite material Mg-FeTi(Mn) was found to contain FeTi1-ξ1 magnesium, titanium and Ti-Mg phases. The higher storage capacity (about 3.5 wt.%) in the case of Mg-40%FeTi(Mn) is probably due to FeTi-Mg complexes. The hydrogen molecule is split at the FeTi surface and diffuses into the magnesium matrix via FeTi. In the case of La2Mg17-ξ%LaNi5, the composite material consists of La2Mg17, MgNi2, nickel and LaNi3 phases. Because of the presence of nickel and nickel-containing phases (e.g. Mg-Ni), it is assumed that the dissociation of hydrogen is easier and hence the system La2Mg17-ξ%LaNi5 has better kinetics than its counterpart La2Mg17 alone. © 1992.",,"COMPOSITE MATERIALS; Energy Storage; Hydrogen - Storage; Lanthanum Magnesium Alloys - Characterization; Lanthanum Nickel Alloys - Hydrogenation; Magnesium Iron Titanium Alloys - Microstructure; Hydrogen Storage Materials; Storage Kinetics; Magnesium Iron Titanium Alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027112420

Native as well as ryanodine reacted vesicles display a complex time course of calcium uptake resulting in nearly complete exhaustion of medium calcium when ATP in combination with an ATP-regenerating system, in contrast to ATP alone, or dinitrophenyl phosphate, were used to support calcium uptake. Applying of dinitrophenyl phosphate as energy yielding substrate, not affecting channel activity, allowed to estimate the fraction of light vesicles devoided of calcium channels contaminating the heavy preparation as the fraction that stores calcium after the preparation has been treated with channel opening, low concentrations of ryanodine (1 μM). Calcium uptake by contaminant light vesicles (25%) cannot account for calcium storage, as well as, abolition of caffeine induced calcium release of ryanodine treated heavy vesicles. Calcium uptake of native and ryanodine treated vesicles is accompanied by the uptake of equivalent amounts of inorganic phosphate arising from ATP hydrolysis indicating that calcium is mainly stored as calcium phosphate. The momentary capability of the preparation to accumulate calcium was measured by activating calcium uptake during the calcium storage period with 0.2 mM 45CaCl2 and 4 mM phosphate at short time intervals. A significant increase of the momentary uptake activity with time was observed being more pronounced for ryanodine treated than for native vesicles indicating that under regenerating conditions, ATP can induce closing of the native and even more effectively of the ryanodine modified calcium release channels. © 1992, Walter de Gruyter.

This paper examines substrate supply pathways from storage sites to locomotory muscle mitochondria and discusses ecological implications of the limits for maximal flux through these pathways. The relative importance of the different oxidative fuels is shown to depend on aerobic capacity. Very aerobic, endurance-adapted animals such as long distance migrants favor the use of lipids and intramuscular fuels over carbohydrates and circulatory fuels. The hypothesis of functional co-adaptation between oxygen and metabolic fuel supply systems allows us to predict that the capacity of several biochemical processes should be scaled with maximal oxygen consumption. Key enzymes, transmembrane transporter proteins, glucose precursor supply and soluble fatty acid transport proteins must all be geared to support higher maximal glucose and fatty acid fluxes in aerobic than in sedentary species. © 1992 Birkhäuser Verlag.","aerobic capacity; fatty acid; glucose; lactate; Metabolic substrates; migration; regulation","lactic acid; aerobic metabolism; animal; ecology; fatty acid metabolism; glucose metabolism; metabolic regulation; muscle metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Aerobiosis; Animal; Ecology; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Human; Locomotion; Muscles; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026734821

This may necessitate increased fasting protein catabolism; however, the largest source of protein, flight muscle, must be maintained. This problem was examined in the horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), a 28-g passerine. Overnight fasting caused significant depletion of protein in flight muscle and liver, but not in other muscle groups. Proteolytic enzyme activity of the flight muscle doubled during fasting. Biochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed that protein was depleted disproportionately from the sarcoplasm of flight muscle cells. Fasting caused a reduction in the protein-specific glycolytic capacity of flight muscle tissue. Oxidative capacity of the flight muscle, as measured by both in vivo and in vitro assays, was not significantly affected. The disproportionate catabolism of flight muscle sarcoplasmic protein may be due to a greater susceptibility to proteolysis, and not necessarily because it represents a source of redundant storage protein. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Catabolism; Fasting; Muscle; Passerine birds, Eremophila alpestris; Protein","cathepsin D; muscle protein; animal; article; bird; diet restriction; electron microscopy; energy metabolism; flying; metabolism; muscle; physiology; ultrastructure; Animal; Birds; Cathepsin D; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Flight, Animal; Microscopy, Electron; Muscle Proteins; Muscles; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026466653

Additional desorption experiments were performed in an oven in N2 atmosphere. These samples were then investigated by spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy under atmospheric conditions.

AES investigations reveal in addition strong carbon contaminations.

Four parameters that affect the storage of ions are evaluated: the pressure of the buffer gas: the qz value which establishes the ion trapping environment; the cooling time during which ions may collapse to the center of the trap; and the supplementary a.c. voltage used to kinetically excite selected ions. The ion trap may be operated effectively at a low helium pressure (0.1 mTorr) if a sufficient delay period is added to allow the diffuse ion cloud to collapse to the center of the trap prior to detection. For a typical experiment, this modified operation at low pressures involves allowing the ions to undergo approximately 30-100 collisions (i.e. in a ≈30 ms interval at 0.1 mTorr). At low helium pressures (≈0.1 mTorr), more ions may be trapped at higher qz values. Collision-activated dissociation (CAD) at low helium pressures indicates that the average internal energy deposition is higher, and sensitivity is not lost, if a collisional cooling delay is added. This latter result potentially has great analytical relevance for CAD of biomolecules which require greater internal energy deposition to induce fragmentation. © 1992.","collision-activated dissociation; collisional cooling; ion detection.",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002560506

Observed gelation curves at constant temperatures were well approximated by first-order reaction kinetics. The saturated storage modulus depended mainly on the concentration of 11S protein. The saturated modulus was proportional to 3.4th power of 11S concentrations. The rate constant of the gelation increased with increasing gelling temperature and was mainly governed by the concentration of glucono-6-lactone. The activation energy of the gelation was calculated to be 1.5 × 101 kJ/mol from an Arrhenius plot of the rate constants. The latent time at which the shear modulus began to deviate from the baseline became shorter with increasing concentration of glucono-δ-lactone.

Its effect on energy metabolism, however, is not known. We studied the effect of ethanol on 24-hour substrate-oxidation rates in eight normal men during two 48-hour sessions in an idirect-calorimetry chamber. In each session, the first 24 hours served as the control period. On the second day of one session, an additional 25 percent of the total energy requirement was added as ethanol (mean [±SD], 96±4 g per day); during the other session, 25 percent of the total energy requirement was replaced by ethanol, which was isocalorically substituted for lipids and carbohydrates. Both the addition of ethanol and the isocaloric substitution of ethanol for other foods reduced 24-hour lipid oxidation. The respective mean (±SE) decreases were 49.4±6.7 and 44.1 ±9.3 g per day (i.e., reductions of 36±3 percent and 31 ±7 percent from the oxidation rate during the control day; P<0.001 and P<0.0025). This effect occurred only during the daytime period (8:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.), when ethanol was consumed and metabolized. Neither the addition of ethanol to the diet nor the isocaloric substitution of ethanol for other foods significantly altered the oxidation of carbohydrate or protein. Both regimens including ethanol produced an increase in 24-hour energy expenditure (7±1 percent with the addition of ethanol, P<0.001; 4±1 percent with the substitution of ethanol for other energy sources, P<0.025). Ethanol, either added to the diet or substituted for other foods, increases 24-hour energy expenditure and decreases lipid oxidation.

We are reporting the observation of an apparent concentration-driven transition in the cosine of the contact angles of liquids on mixed monolayers. It is suggested that this phenomenon is due to a possible (true or rounded) surface phase transition, resulting in the formation of a prewetting water layer. This formation is triggered by variations in the quenched distribution of random surface fields. The variation of the surface free-energy, both polar and dispersive parts, has been determined as a function of surface OH-concentration. The surface free-energy of the 100% OH surface is close to that found for water, as might be expected for a surface coated with several monolayers of water. Zisman plots obtained for several of the surfaces using polar and nonpolar liquids give γc values which follow the observed dispersive contribution to the total surface free energy, and thus do not present a good approximation to the surface free energy (i.e., γc &lt; γsv). Contact angle variation was studied on self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers containing mixtures of OH and CH3 groups at their air-monolayer interface. It was found that these high free energy organic surfaces yielded contact angles which were not stable over long periods of time. The extent of the variation was found to be related to the surface free energy (%OH). The effect of different storage environments and temperature on the changing contact angles are discussed. We propose that monolayer surfaces containing high concentrations of OH groups on mobile organic chains are not stable. Such monolayer surfaces may stabilize over time, depending on the chain length, by surface reorganization and the adsorption of contaminants. © 1992.",,"Alcohols - Adsorption; Gold and Alloys - Surfaces; Mathematical Statistics - Monte Carlo Methods; Solids - Surfaces; Energy Minimization; Monte Carlo Simulation; Surface Free Energy; Surface Potentials; Water Contact Angle; Surfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027113502

Southern Cape populations had relatively low reproductive rates, but levels of energy storage and survival rates were high. The reverse applied to eastern Cape populations. The diets of the two populations differed, with a higher ratio of available production nutrients (NPK) to maintenance nutrients (C) in the eastern Cape. A life history model is developed which accommodates these regional differences by linking nutritional characteristics of the diet with metabolic turnover rates. According to this model, the rate of reproductive investment (number of viable young per unit of time) relative to somatic investment (energy storage, survival) is determined by the rate at which production nutrients (NPK) are procurable. For herbivorous animals this depends on the rate at which the nutrients are available to their food plants, which in turn is linked to soil fertility and thus to the geological parent material. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Life history tactics; Metabolic turnover; Nutrient availability; Potamochoerus porcus","bushpig; life history; nutrient; South Africa, Cape Province; Potamochoerus porcus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027040974

We also measured the relative growth rate of the plants and the pigment content of leaves. The results indicated an ambivalent effect of acidity: there was a linear decline (r = 0.92) in the photosynthetic O2 evolution as the pH of the simulated rain was lowered from 5.6 to 3.0 and a jump when it reached 2.5, with a stimulation effect on the relative growth rate at lower pH levels. The photochemical energy storage and the relative growth rate increased from pH 5.6 to pH 4.04.5, then decreased at pH 3.0 and increased again at pH 2.5. The pattern of variation of the photochemical energy storage was fairly well correlated with the pigment content of the leaves (r = 0.83). It was concluded that acid rain preferentially affects photosystem II (FSII), inhibiting O2 evolution, and less PSI. The difference between O2 evolution and photochemical energy storage was explained in connection with cyclic electron transport around photosystem I (PSI). © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

More specifically, he discusses manipulators in which there are more controlled (joint space) degrees of freedom than task space degrees of freedom and in which at least one of these controlled joints is connected to an adjacent link through an elastic coupling. It is shown that there is a wide class of examples for which it is impossible to find joint space motions which track a given end effector trajectory and do not at the same time excite elastic dynamics. For this class geometries, the most one can in general hope to achieve no net storage of elastic energy in the joints. For certain congenial manipulator geometries, it is shown that under certain assumptions it is possible to plan motions which store no elastic energy. It is shown how trajectories interpolating prescribed endpoints in the work space may be planned using fifth-order splines.

Two protocols (n=12 in each) were used: subjects were either allowed to develop hypoaminoacidaemia or received a commercial solution of L-amino acids while maintaining near-basal plasma leucine levels. Insulin infusions resulted in 3-, 35- and 650-fold increases in plasma insulin levels in both protocols. The infusion of amino acids produced a rightward shift in the dose-response curve of insulin's effect on suppressing hepatic glucose production, indicating decreased sensitivity in addition to blunting of the maximal responsiveness. Total body glucose rate of disappearance was progressively increased with escalating insulin doses, but was 22% lower at the intermediate and highest insulin doses in the group that was infused with amino acids (3.44±0.53 vs 4.82±0.71 and 7.72±1.01 vs 10.36±1.08 mg·kg-1·min-1, respectively; p&lt;0.05). Forearm balance data confirmed the isotopic data, since amino acid infusions blunted the insulin-mediated increase in net forearm glucose utilization (by 50-83%). Furthermore, the infusion of amino acids resulted in marked reductions in the rate of carbohydrate oxidation and storage as assessed by indirect calorimetry.

The alloy MmNi3.5Co0.7Al0.8 showed a very long cycle life with reasonable discharge capacity (250 mA h g-1) and rate capability. An ingot with a very high endurance and low lattice strain was obtained under controlled conditions, including high rate cooling in the casting process for obtaining a columnar structure, no heat treatment and prevention of stoichiometric deviation. A columnar structure was formed so that the c-axis of the hexagonal structure was oriented parallel to the cooling plane. This alloy was significantly distinguished in crystal growth from a manganese-containing alloy (MmNl3.5Co0.5Al0.3Mn0.4) which had an equiaxial structure with considerable lattice strain, which needed conventional heat treatment. Deviation from stoichiometric composition to the nickel-rich side caused a significant decrease in capacity and cycle life owing to the precipitation of AlNi3 at grain boundaries. The decay in capacity of the MH electrode using MmNi3.6Co0.7Al0.8 was only 10% after 2000 cycles. The cylindrical sealed cell also showed a very long cycle life (a capacity decay of 6% after 2000 cycles). The high capacity sealed cell had a 1.5-2 times higher energy density (210 W h dm-3; 65 W h kg-1) with a longer cycle life and better rate capability than the high capacity Ni-Cd battery. © 1992.",,"Electric Batteries, Secondary - Service Life; Hydrogen; Nickel And Alloys; Rare Earth Compounds; High Capacity Sealed Cells; Hydrogen Batteries; Mischmetal; Rare Earth Based Hydrogen Storage Alloys; Electric Batteries, Secondary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026839820

Rhizome biomass, rhizome length per unit ground area, and specific weight (weight/ length ratio) of the rhizomes were monitored in one of the stands. Rhizome biomass decreased during spring, increased during summer and decreased during winter. However, changes in spring and summer were small (&lt; 500 g DW m-2) compared to the mean rhizome biomass (approximately 3000 g DW m-2). Winter losses were larger, approximately 1000 g DW m-2, and to a substantial extent involved structural biomass, indicating rhizome mortality. Seasonal changes in rhizome length per unit ground area revealed a rhizome mortality of about 30% during the winter period, and also indicated that an intensive period of formation of new rhizomes occurred in June. Rhizome concentrations of TNC and WSC decreased during the spring, when carbohydrates were translocated to support shoot growth. However, rhizome standing stock of TNC remained large (&gt; 1000 g m-2). Concentrations and standing stocks of mineral nutrients decreased during spring/ early summer and increased during summer/ fall. Only N, however, showed a pattern consistent with a spring depletion caused by translocation to shoots. This pattern indicates sufficient root uptake of P and K to support spring growth, and supports other evidence that N is generally the limiting mineral nutrient for Phragmites. The biomass data, as well as increased rhizome specific weight and TNC concentrations, clearly suggests that ""reloading"" of rhizomes with energy reserves starts in June, not towards the end of the growing season as has been suggested previously. This resource allocation strategy of Phragmites has consequences for vegetation management. Our data indicate that carbohydrate reserves are much larger than needed to support spring growth. We propose that large stores are needed to ensure establishment of spring shoots when deep water or stochastic environmental events, such as high rhizome mortality in winter or loss of spring shoots due to late season frost, increase the demand for reserves. © 1992 SPB Academic Publishing.","biomass; carbohydrates; nitrogen; phosphorus; Phragmites australis; potassium; reed; rhizome; translocation; wetland","carbohydrate; reed; rhizome; Sweden; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027041412

(MBI) in Whitby, Ont. had difficulty maintaining an acceptable viscosity in its starch mixing storage tanks, particularly over weekends when the five-day mill was not running. The standard measurement used for evaluating the starch mixture is viscosity. While water contamination or over-circulation can lead to starch viscosity breakdown, by far the most common cause is microbiological activity. In late 1988, the problem of viscosity breakdown in the starch mixture became serious enough to try something new. Enter the ion stick. This wand-like device is inserted in a water supply to prevent and remove hard water scale, and control and eliminate algae in recirculating water systems. MBI conducted an evaluation of the stick's performance in the double backer tank, between January and April, 1989, compared to the use of biocide in the single facer system. In January, the only problem occurred when the power supply was accidentally shut off over a weekend as part of an energy conservation program. A dedicated line solved that problem. In mid-March, the ion stick was shut down to observe the results. Viscosity remained stable until mid-April when it declined suddenly. The ion stick was reactivated and, within 48 hours, the viscosity level had stabilized again.",,"Bacteria--Control; Water Treatment, Industrial--Ionization; Hazard Free Biocide; Ion Stick; Starch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026838466

Chemical equilibria involving boric acid, borate ions, and borate ions associated with cis-diol sites on the polysaccharide chains determine the number of cross-links. These equilibria are functions of temperature and pH, and thus the rheology of the borate gels depends on temperature and pH. Measurements on 0.48 wt % polymer solutions were performed over the temperature range from 15 to 65 °C and the pH range from 6.35 to 9.5. The storage and loss moduli obey time–temperature superposition so that master curves can be constructed over 6 decades in frequency. The shift factors along the time axis follow a single-exponential Arrhenius form at pH values above 8 with activation energies that vary from 90 to 115 kJ/mol. The activation energies for guar and HPG are identical, which is consistent with the cis-diols on each polymer being the active site for cross-linking. Also, the data at different pH values can be superimposed by “time–pH” shifting to produce master curves from which the temperature and pH sensitivity of the gel rheology can be determined. Leibler et al. have recently proposed a theory for the rheology of associating polymer systems. Following this theory, we have subtracted the solution moduli from the gel moduli, and the resulting reduced moduli data follow a single time constant Maxwell model, where the time constant reflects the relaxation time ofborate/cis-diol interactions in the network. © 1992, American Chemical Society.

These materials can be considered to form a metabolically inert infrastructure which mainly serves three functions: (1) structural support to the organism, (2) storage of nutrients (building material and energy stores) and (3) transport and distribution of these materials. Considering the transport and support function of the metabolically inert structures and their interconnnections it is likely that the infrastructure will basically show some tree-like, branching building plan. In this paper a method is described to determine both the surface area (Abs) and the volume (Vbs) of simple (dichotomal) branching structures in relation to a few parameters (e.g. the radius and the length of a primary branch. Just as in the calculation of the surface area and volume of other geometrical objects the obtained values are determined by the definition of the branching system). Experimental data concerning basic metabolic rate (P) in relation to body weight (W) fit the equation W=k1P+k2P1·5 (k1 and k2 being constants), which can be derived by considering the body to comprise a metabolically active part combined with a metabolically inert infrastructure. With increasing size of an organism the volume of its metabolically inert infrastructure increases disproportionally. Just as with the ""power law"" for basic metabolic rate, the theoretical equation requires the assessments of two parameters. Reasonable estimates are given in this paper. © 1992 Academic Press Limited.",,"article; basal metabolic rate; body weight; mathematical model; oxygen consumption; priority journal; thermogenesis; transport kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026516226

Calcium has been assumed to play a key role in the catch mechanism because calcium concentration profoundly affects the mechanical properties. We have found a calcium-storage cell, the vacuole cell, in the dermis of the sea cucumber Stichopus chloronotus a wellstudied catch connective tissue. The processes of this cell are packed with vacuoles measuring 0.1-1.5 μm in diameter. The ultrastructure was compared in a relaxed state and in a catch (stiff) state induced by high-potassium artificial sea water. When fixed with pyroantimonate, the vacuoles contained precipitates in the relaxed state but not in the catch state. Analysis with an energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyzer suggested that the precipitate contains calcium.

With sugar maple leaf, we have observed a decline of the O2 signal in the course of time, once the leaf attained a steady-state photosynthesis. This decline of the O2 signal was not due to a decrease in photochemical activity as was evident by a stable fluorescence signal and constant energy storage. The rate and the extent of decline were larger at low modulation frequency and low modulated light intensity. The decline continued even in the presence of background far-red light (λ&gt;715 nm). The above observations lead us to conclude that the photoacoustic O2 signal from leaves is influenced by O2-consuming processes. Data are discussed in relation to a possible occurrence of an equilibrium between oxygen-evolving and oxygen-consuming processes to account for the O2 signal in the plant cell. Moreover, the oxygen-uptake component may have to be included in the vectorial model of photoacoustic signal generation in leaves. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Previously, the program has been used for the investigation of quadrupolar resonance excitation of ions with a static working point (or co-ordinates) in the stability diagram. The program has been modified to accommodate continuous d.c. and/or r.f. voltage ramps so as to permit calculation of ion trajectories while the working point is being changed. The modified program has been applied to the calculation of ion trajectories during ion isolation, or mass-selective storage, in the ion trap. The quadrupolar resonance excitation aspect of SPQR was not used in this study. Trajectories are displayed as temporal variations of ion kinetic energy, and axial and radial excursions from the centre of the ion trap. The working points of three ion species (m/z 144, 146 and 148), located initially on the qz, axis with qz ≈ 0.12, were moved to the vicinity of the upper apex by a combination of r.f. and d.c. voltages applied in succession. Stable trajectories were maintained only for the ion species of m/z 146 for which the working point lay within this apex; the other ion species were ejected either radially or axially. The d.c. voltage was then reduced to zero so as to restore the working point of the isolated ion species to the qz axis. The amplitude of the r.f voltage was reduced to its initial value so as to retrieve the initial working point for m/z 146. The process extended over a real time of 2.9 ms, and was collision-free. The trajectory of the isolated ion was stable during this process; the ion species with m/z value lower than that of the target ion, that is, m/z 144, was ejected axially at the βz = 1 boundary, while that with higher m/z value, that is, m/z 148, was ejected radially at the βr = 0 boundary, as expected. The moderating effects of buffer gas were not taken into consideration and ion kinetic energies during the sorting period were found to be sufficiently great that dissociative losses may be appreciable in a collisional system. A possible strategy for reducing kinetic energy during this process has been proposed. © 1992.","ion isolation; mass spectrometry; Quadrupole ion trap; tandem mass spectrometry.; trajectory simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001602482

All of the applied insecticides have been officially registered for agricultural purposes (which include forestry applications) in each State/Territory under the provisions of a specific Act of Parliament. Until July 1989, the registration of insecticides by State/Territory authorities was subject to stringent evaluation and clearance by the Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals, a central authority responsible to the Co-ordinating Committee on Agricultural Chemicals, and through it to the Australian Agricultural Council. Since then, evaluation and clearance for registration has been the function of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council with direct responsibility to the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This Council, established under the Commonwealth Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act (1988), aims to ensure uniformity of assessment and registration of insecticides throughout Australia. In each State, special permits may be issued to allow insecticides to be used for purposes not covered by the registered product label or unregistered insecticides to be used in research trials. Additional legislation in the form of Acts of State Parliament, and Associated Regulations, governs the distribution, application and safe handling of registered insecticides. Most forest authorities now record insecticide purchases and consumption, and all have issued detailed instructions to their staff on spray preparation, storage, disposal, safe transport, spillage, accidental poisoning, loss or theft. The most extensive use of insecticides has been against the indigenous Spur-legged Stick Insect, Didymuria violescens (Phasmatidae), in Victorian ash-type eucalypt forests by aerial spraying with malathion, and for eradication of the accidentally introduced West Indian Drywood Termite, Cryptotermes brevis (Kalotermitidae), in south-eastern Queensland and New South Wales, by fumigating entire buildings and furniture with methyl bromide. In Tasmania, extensive aerial applications of synthetic pyrethroids have been carried out by APPM Forest Products to safeguard young plantations of principally Eucalyptus nitens (Shining Gum) from defoliation by the Tasmanian Eucalyptus Leaf Beetle, Chrysophtharta bimaculata. Outbreaks of all these pests cause serious economic damage when left unchecked. A sustained media campaign critical of pesticide usage in Australia has induced a much greater public awareness of the likely health risks posed by insecticides. Forest services are now committed to limit the use of insecticides and to promote biological and silvicultural techniques as alternative controls. Using insect resistant genotypes in eucalypt plantation programs is also expected to relieve insect pest problems in the future. However, insecticide applications are likely to remain front-line options for eradicating exotic insect pests of high destructive potential and for controlling large outbreaks of indigenous pests in commercial eucalypt plantations or in forest nurseries. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043022382

The mechanical output of the muscle was determined from a user-specified neural drive according to the force-time, force-length, and force-velocity relations. The model allowed no storage of mechanical energy and no potentiation via the stretch reflex. The effects of different activation patterns as well as initial kinematic conditions on the maximum final velocity were examined. The results revealed a very nonlinear dependence of final velocity on both initial joint angle and angular velocity. Contrary to the principles of particle physics, it could be shown that an activation pattern that reached a maximum early in the movement achieved shorter movement times and, quite often, higher final velocities than an activation pattern that reached a maximum later in the movement. It was also found that by taking advantage of the nonlinear force-time, force-length and force-velocity relations, higher final velocities could be achieved if the muscle contracted from a previously stretch state with the absence of stored elastic energy. It was also found that with the same neural drive, the final velocities that could be achieved when the muscle was first required to absorb large amounts of energy in an eccentric contraction were similar to the final velocities that could be achieved when no negative work needed to be performed. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9844227247

Geochemical phenomena that cause problems in ATES systems include formation of scale in heat exchangers, clogging of wells, corrosion in piping and heat exchangers, and degradation of aquifer materials. Preventing such problems frequently requires employing water treatment systems. Individual water treatment methods vary in cost, effectiveness, environmental impact, corrosion potential, and acceptability to regulatory bodies. Evaluating these water treatment options is generally required to determine the feasibility of ATES systems. The H2OTREAT software was developed by Pacific Northwest Laboratory for use by engineers with limited or no experience in geochemistry. At the feasibility analysis and design stages, the software utilizes a recently revised geochemical model, MINTEQ, to calculate the saturation indices of selected carbonate, oxide, and hydroxide minerals based on water chemistry and temperature data provided by the user. The saturation index of a specific mineral defines whether that mineral is oversaturated, hence may precipitate at the specified temperature. The saturation indices of key calcium, iron, silica, and manganese carbonates, oxides, and hydroxides (calcite, rhodochrosite, siderite, Fe(OH)3[a], bimessite, chalcedony, and SiO2) are calculated. User input is separated into ""required"" and ""optional"" data (Table 1). Currently, H2OTREAT does not perform cost calculations; however, treatment capacity requirements are provided. Treatments considered include 1) Na and H ion exchangers and pellet reactors to avoid calcite precipitation, and 2) in situ nitrate addition and cascade precipitators to prevent Fe and Mn oxide precipitation. The H2OTREAT software also provides the user with guidance on other geochemical problems that must be considered, such as SiO2 precipitation, corrosion, and environmental considerations. The sodium adsorption ratio and sodium hazard are calculated to evaluate the likelihood of clay swelling and dispersion caused by high Na concentrations (e.g., as a result of Na ion exchange water treatment used to prevent calcite precipitation).

Objectives of LT3 were to demonstrate that high-temperature ATES could supply a real heating load and to simplify the water chemistry modeling. For LT3 the Field Test Facility (FTF) was connected to a nearby campus building to demonstrate the FTF's ability to meet a real heating load. For LT3 the wells were modified so that only the most permeable portions of the Ironton-Galesville aquifer were used to simplify water chemistry comparisons and modeling. The campus steam plant was the source for heat stored during LT3. A total volume of 63.2 x 103 m3 of water was injected at a rate of 54.95 m3/hr into the storage well at a mean temperature of 104.7°C from October through December 1989. Tie-in to the Animal Sciences Veterinary Medicine (ASVM) building was not completed until late December. A total volume of 66.0 x 103 m3 of water was recovered at a rate of 44.83 m3/hr from the storage well at a mean temperature of 76.5°C from January through March 1990. Highest and lowest temperatures of recovered water were 100.0 and 47.8°C, respectively. Approximately 66% of the energy added to the aquifer was recovered. The useful minimum temperature for recovered water was 49°C; approximately 50% of the energy added to the aquifer above 49°C (33% of the total energy stored) was delivered to the ASVM building. Approximately 15% of the usable (10% of the total) energy stored was actually used in the ASVM building. Operations during heat recovery with the ASVM building's reheat system were troublefree. Integration into more of the ASVM (or other) building's mechanical system would have resulted in significantly increasing the proportion of energy used during heat recovery. The cost to connect to other ASVM building systems for this experimental cycle was the main reason for not incorporating other building systems into the FTF.

This situation has lead to the involvement of a number of countries, especially those of the European Community, in heavily funded 'Wealth from the Oceans' projects. A significant element of the research being conducted under the auspices of these projects is concerned with the development of small unmanned and untethered autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To carry out their intended autonomous missions these vehicles will need reliable power systems which have high energy densities. However, although research into navigation, control and command systems has progressed considerably under this development effort, only limited headway has been made in the development of power systems which could be readily integrated into these vessels. Electrochemical power systems have been used in underwater applications for a number of years but those presently available cannot meet the rigorous specifications demanded by AUV missions. Consequently high performance fuel cells and advanced battery systems are being developed which should be generally available within the next ten years. Until then, power systems based on the utilisation of the more mature heat engine technologies appear to offer the possibility of a quicker solution to the energy density problem. Of the heat engine types available the Stirling Engine, already proven in larger submarines, shows considerable promise. One of the main reasons for the selection of the Stirling engine is it's ability to utilise any heat source, such as radioisotopes, thermal energy storage and metallic fuels. In this paper a project is described in which the design requirements for a Stirling engine driven AUV have been examined together with the identification of the most suitable primary energy source for a specific mission. As part of this project a user-friendly PC-based computer program has been developed which allows rapid assessments of the use of different energy sources with a double-acting Stirling for user defined missions. The structure and use of this code is discussed.",,"Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Heat storage; Stirling engines; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); Control-and-command systems; Different energy sources; Electrochemical power; High energy densities; High performance fuel cells; Primary energy source; Underwater application; Autonomous underwater vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072504989

In spite of these advantages these bearings have often proved difficult to design when installed in compliant structures due to the complex interaction of the structural resonances on the one hand and the static and dynamic constraints of the bearings actuators and their power amplifiers on the other. In this paper a mathematical model of the magnetic bearing rotor system for a flywheel energy storage system is developed, which takes these factors into account. Using this model it is shown by formulating an optimization problem that the vibrations due to rotor imbalance can be minimized by appropriate choices of the magnetic bearing stiffness and damping coefficients within the range allowed by the system constraints. It is shown that marked performance improvement over the case where the damping and stiffness are held fixed can be obtained by programming these coefficients as a function of speed.

Among these technologies are batteries, high efficiency induction motors, high frequency electric power distribution, dynamic energy storage, and Stirling cycle machines. While the emphasis of the PTD research is the application of these technologies to fulfill space power requirements, terrestrial applications may also exist. Future regulation of vehicular emission levels has prompted a recent increase in interest in electric and hybrid vehicles. Electric vehicles have been limited in range and performance by the storage capability of currently available batteries.

The designs are similar to previous receivers having an axial distribution of concentrated solar input flux, and an axial flow of the working fluid. The objective is to study the feasibility of single-phase designs which have comparable weight and thermal performance to existing two-phase designs. Linearized heat transfer equations are formulated for the storage of sensible heat in the receivers. The periodic input solar flux is represented as the sum of steady and oscillating distributions, which results in steady and oscillating components in the one-dimensional, time-dependent thermal model. The steady component is solved analytically to produce the desired receiver steady outlet gas temperature. For the oscillating components the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT) is applied, and the resulting one-dimensional equations solved analytically in the transform space. The complex transfer function of the receiver is obtained and evaluated as a filter for the input spectrum. Convolution of the source and the transfer function, and inverse transformation, results in the amplitudes and mode shapes of the oscillating solid and gas temperatures. By adjustment of design parameters, the amplitude of the oscillating component of the outlet gas temperature is limited to an acceptable magnitude. The overall result of the investigation is that sensible-heat receiver designs exist with comparable performance to present state-of-the-art two-phase receivers.

The investigation involves the creation of an elementary ATES model, and the development of the corresponding expressions for efficiencies and for the quantities of energy and exergy that are injected and recovered. It is demonstrated that ATES performance measures based on exergy often are more useful and meaningful than those based on energy. Exergy efficiencies account for the temperatures associated with energy transfers to and from an ATES, as well as the quantities of energy transferred, and consequently provide a measure of how nearly ATES systems approach ideal thermodynamic performance. Energy efficiencies only account for energy transfer quantities, and thus do not provide a measure of approach to ideal performance. In fact, energy efficiencies are often misleadingly high because some of the energy recovered can be at too low a temperature to be available for a useful purpose.

Due to the very high transportation cost associated with the lunar and Mars missions, the mass of these power systems will be a critical factor. Power systems currently being considered for these applications include both nonnuclear and nuclear systems. For lunar applications, the 354-hour-long nighttime presents a formidable challenge to energy storage technology for nonnuclear power systems. Because of their low energy densities, energy storage systems can be prohibitively massive at higher power levels. Consequently, the nonnuclear power systems may be limited to low-power mission applications on the surface of the Moon. Eliminating or greatly reducing the need for energy storage makes these systems competitive with nuclear power systems. A Free Electron Laser (FEL) power system based in lunar orbit was examined for providing power by beaming energy to the lunar surface. The FEL power system was compared with surface-based nuclear and nonnuclear power systems over a range of user power requirements. Preliminary results show the laser power beaming system to be increasingly competitive on a mass basis with the nonnuclear power at power levels above 50 kWe. However, compared with a surface-based nuclear power plant, the laser beaming power system is an unattractive option unless, for some reason, a nuclear plant cannot be situated on the lunar surface.",,"Electrons; Energy storage; Lunar missions; Martian surface analysis; Mass transportation; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Orbits; Space research; Energy storage systems; Energy storage technologies; Innovative approaches; Laser power beaming; Lunar applications; Power requirement; Space exploration mission; Transportation cost; Free electron lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072488522

One of the main problems witnessed by engineers has been that of the relatively low operating range provided by the storage batteries available on the market today, and so, recovering the energy that is inevitably lost during braking is of primary importance. The concept of regenerative braking is fairly simple as it consists in making the electric motors function as generators. In many of today's applications we find two indipendent controls for the operation of the hydraulic brake and for the activation of regenerative braking. The choice on which braking mode to use, or in which sequence the two modes are to be used is left to the driver who, at the onset of braking, is forced to make mental considerations in order to activate the two braking modes in the right sequence. Furthermore, the driver must not forget to disable the regenerative function at the end of each stop. BREMBO has designed a braking system in which a single control, that is, the brake pedal, activates and disables in the right sequence the two different braking modes, thus allowing: to maximize energy recovery by the electric motors each time the driver steps on the brake pedal; the hydraulic brake to be used in addition to regenerative braking when the latter is not enough to produce the required deceleration. The proposed braking system is lightweight and versatile. It can be adapted to the different powertrain configurations seen on various electric vehicles. © Copyright 1992 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Electric machine control; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Hydraulic brakes; Internal combustion engines; Traction motors; Braking modes; Braking system; Energy recovery; Operating ranges; Pollution problems; Powertrain configuration; Regenerative functions; Storage battery; Regenerative braking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072457512

In the zero gravity environment of an orbiting spacecraft, the behavior of a liquid/gas interface is dominated by forces not usually observed in one ""G"" due to the overwhelming effects of gravity. The normal perceptions no longer apply. Water does not run down hill and bubbles do not rise to the surface. Surface energy, capillary forces, wetting characteristics and momentum effects predominate. Techniques and equipment have been developed to separate the liquid/gas mixture into its constituent parts with various levels of efficiency and power consumption. The solution to the classic zero gravity problem of removing condensate from a temperature and humidity control heat exchanger is followed through its evolution from the elbow and wick separator used on the Biosatellite program, through the air turbine driven rotary pitot tube separator used on the Apollo program's Lunar Module, to the motor driven rotary pitot tube separator and heat exchanger ""slurper"" configuration used on the Shuttle Orbiter. An elbow separator uses the momentum of the liquid droplets to force the water to the outside wall of an elbow in an air duct downstream of a condensing heat exchanger. A wick is used to trap the water by capillary force and move it to the surface of a high bubble point membrane where the water passes cut of the duct to a low pressure sump. The simplicity of no moving parts is attractive, but carryover of droplets in the air stream, and the need for a low pressure sump are often not acceptable. Separator development continued with the evolution of the air turbine and motor driven rotary separators. In these separators the momentum of liquid droplets in a centrifugal force field produced in a spinning drum is used to move water to the outer wall for collection in a spinning trough attached to the drum. A pitot tube removes the water using recovered energy from the spinning motion. The increase in pressure is used to deliver water through a check valve to a storage tank at a pressure above the ambient cabin pressure. The simplicity (one moving part) and automatic control (it stops pumping as the trough water level gets low) of the rotary pitot type separators have made them the separators of choice on all manned space flight life support systems to date. However, power consumption, carryover, and sensitivity to contamination may limit their use in future long duration space flight application such as Space Station Freedom.

A limitation in the use of inductive energy stores has been the availability of adequately rated opening switches. A self commutated solid state switch has been developed for use as an opening device for an inductive energy store. A single switch module is rated at 30 kA and 5000 V. The charging pulse lengths for the intended application vary from 0.1 to 5 seconds. Efficiency and volumetric power density were optimized. The switch topology is a two stage hybrid consisting of an SCR-FET / SCR-IGBT combination. The switch is designed to charge an inductive energy store and repetitively commutate the current to a railgun load. The first of ten switch modules for a 250 kA switch has been built and successfully tested on a battery test stand at General Atomics.

This paper describes a simple but reliable method to protect a high power TWT amplifier. This circuit has been fabricated, successfully tested and working reliably in Radar Systems. In ground based radar transmitter systems, a high voltage energy storage capacitor is provided to meet the peak pulse current requirements and to minimize the 'droop' on the EHT pulse generated by the system. Energy stored in the capacitor is much higher (order of 100 times) than the safe energy the tube can dissipate in the event of an internal electrical arc. It becomes essential to save the costly tube from damage from this uncontrolled discharge. To achieve this a triggered spark gap is fired whenever excess current is sensed in any of the TWT electrodes. Spark gap triggering circuit is designed in such a way that a burst of pulses is generated immediately on sensing excess current. A current boosting circuit increases the power level of these pulses which guarantees the firing of the trigged spark gap.This effectively acts as a crowbar to safely dissipate the stored energy through a path away from the tube. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Electric discharges; Microwave amplifiers; Radar; Superconducting materials; Tubes (components); Crowbar protection; Electrical arc; Energy storage capacitor; Excess current; Ground based radar; High-power TWT; Reliable methods; Triggering circuits; Traveling wave tubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068161295

A 2-mm thick semi-insulating GaAs bulk switch was switched at 250 V, 9 A/cm2 with less than 20 % dissipation and an opening time of 250 nsec. The switch was fabricated in a hermetically sealed vacuum package, incorporating an electron-beam driver and a bulk switch in a single modular unit. The switch uses a low voltage (&lt; 50 keV) electron beam incident on the surface of the semiconductor sample to generate photons through cathodoluminescence; the photons then ionize the bulk sample as in photoconductive switch. The device exhibited a switching threshold at an electron-beam energy of about 35 keV and a low dissipation switching at 45 keV. The electron-beam- controlled GaAs switch results in a much higher overall system efficiency and less complexity due to the elimination of the high power laser required by direct photoconductive switching. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of producing electron-beam controlled semiconductor switches for practical applications. This switch can have application in many pulsed power systems including ballistic missile defense radar systems, radio-frequency induction accelerators, and systems that require an opening switch for inductive energy storage or for pulse length modulation. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Ballistic missiles; Electric power systems; Electron beam lithography; Electron beams; Electrons; Gallium arsenide; High power lasers; III-V semiconductors; Photoconductivity; Photons; Semiconducting gallium; Semiconductor switches; Ballistic missile defense; Electron beam energy; Induction accelerators; Inductive energy storage; Low energy electron beams; Photoconductive switching; Pulsed power systems; Switching thresholds; Photoconductive switches",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068152564

The third phase of that commissioning was a beam extraction test. The Booster extraction fast kicker (F3) deflected a 1.2 Gev proton beam from the Booster circulating orbit into the extraction septum aperture, partially down the.extraction line to a temporary beam stop. Now, the Booster is committed to the AGS operations program for both heavy ion and proton beams. Thus, the Booster extraction and the corresponding AGS injection systems must operate routinely up to a pulse repetition frequency of 7.5 Hertz, and up to a beam energy of 1.5 Gev. The injection fast kicker is located in the A5 section of the AGS ring and is used to deflect the proton or heavy ion beam into its final AGS closed orbit. The Booster extraction and the AGS injection fast kickers are both multi-module systems. Also, they both serve the dual-function of deflecting the proton or heavy ion beams, which require a change in pulse rise time, amplitude, flat top duration, and the fall time. For each system, the multiple modules are arranged electrically in parallel. Each module drives one lumped inductance picture frame magnet section, and the magnets are arranged mechanically in series. The pulsed current delivered from the modulator creates a pulsed magnetic field in the magnet aperture which imparts an angular deflection to the passing particle beam from/into the machine orbit. A distinctive feature of the AGS injection fast kicker modulators is the tail-bitting function required for proton beam injection. This enables the system to produce a fast current fall time (<140 ns) to go along with the high current pulse amplitude 1100 Ampere/module) modulator consists of two thyratrons. The main PFN thyratrons switch on the current, and the tail bitting thyratrons are used to force the magnet current to decrease rapidly. Two digital pulse delay generators are used to align the main thyratrons and the tail bitting thyratrons respectively. The system has been tested and installed.

The system consists of a power supply section, with a 1 megawatt diesel generator, which is housed in a 40 foot semitrailer, and a series of pulser modules, each capable of 2 megajoule energy storage, which may be housed in a variety of transportable containers. Each pulser module is a five section C type pulse forming network, controlled by triggered spark gaps. The five sections may be fired in any desired sequence, thus yielding any desired pulse waveform.Each pulser module measures 2 meters high by 6 meters long and less than 1 meter deep. As such, two such units may be mounted in a standard 20 foot shipping container or trailer, for a 4 MJ subsystem, or four in a forty foot container or trailer for an 8 MJ subsystem. Several of these subsystems may be arrayed together to provide an even larger pulser, transportable in sections in such containers. With the addition of the power supply section, such a system may be operated in a field setting, totally independent of power lines, since the power supply section holds not only the main charging generator but also a smaller auxiliary diesel generator for auxiliary power. Prior to installing the module in the mobile van it was assembled in the laboratory and its operation was evaluated. Satisfactory operation at 2 megajoules was demonstrated.

The first aerospace CPV prototype, a 10 in diameter, 24 Ah, 26 cell battery, was fabricated in 1988. A second generation 5 in diameter aerospace CPV was then developed which incorporated a loose heat fin designed to overcome the manufacturing problems that caused the premature failure of the first prototype. In addition to the revised heat fin, the second generation battery incorporated several additional design improvements which enhanced the reliability and manufacturability of the CPV. Based on the early success of the loose fin design approach in the 5 in design, the same approach was adapted for use in the original 10 in version. Prototypes of this design have been produced in a 125 Ah GEO version as well as a high power prototype aircraft starting battery. The design for terrestrial applications is discussed. The testing of the three load profiles demonstrated the excellent performance and flexibility of the CPV Ni-H2 battery. Simple battery control schemes based on charge pressure and discharge voltage proved adequate. The ability of the battery to withstand catastrophic system failures and total discharge proved to be a valuable asset. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Aerospace applications; Aircraft; Fins (heat exchange); Hydrogen; Nickel compounds; Orbits; Pressure vessels; Systems engineering; Common pressure vessels; Design improvements; Discharge voltages; High power prototype; Low earth orbit(LEO); Nickel hydrogen batteries; Premature failures; Terrestrial application; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067465025

Reducing the ""hotel load"" contribution of the Side Looking Sonar System increases the endurance of the AUV. Technologies and designs that reduce the weight, volume, and power consumption of the transducers and electronics are explored and developed. Recent trends in the underwater search arena are moving systems away from towed vehicles toward tethered and ultimately to AUVs. In towed search vehicles, weight is required to counter the upward force of the tow cable; whereas, for free swimming AUVs, minimizing the vehicle weight is necessary to achieve neutral buoyancy. Furthermore, for towed vehicles, mission duration is not limited by search vehicle endurance; however, the weight, volume, and power consumption all contribute to the hotel load of the AUVs, thus reducing endurance. Reduced weight means less vehicle displacement or floatation is needed to achieve neutral buoyancy. Less displacement, or lower volume, can allow either lower drag area or greater volume for energy storage. Finally, reducing the power consumption allows the redirection of the finite energy available from hotel load to the propulsion system. A detailed analysis of a state-of-the-art SLS system is performed to obtain a baseline for the study. The relative contributions of transducer, electronics, and interconnections toward the weight, volume, and power consumption are determined. This provides valuable direction in selecting areas where improvements are most promising. Research and analysis is performed to determine and trade off technologies, materials, processes, and designs which produce the greatest improvements. Detail applications of these technologies are developed into design concepts. Finally, an improved SLS system design is formulated iv anticipation of fabricating a working prototype. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Autonomous vehicles; Buoyancy; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Hotels; Propulsion; Sonar; Transducers; Underwater acoustics; Of autonomous underwater vehicles; Power consumption reduction; Propulsion system; Relative contribution; Research and analysis; Search application; Side-looking sonars; Underwater searches; Autonomous underwater vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067412680

The knowledge of how the space charges form and are stored in the dielectrics thus becomes important. Various advanced methods, including thermal pulses, pressure wave propagation and electro-acoustic pulses, have been developed to study the space charge distribution in solid dielectrics W. However, the effect on space charge formation by fillers, which are often used with polymeric insulation, is not well understood and studied. It was found that the breakdown behavior of filled EPR item was very much dependent on the chemical structure of the fillers . To understand how the chemical structure of fillers affects space charge formation and storage in the filled polymeric insulation, we have investigated the carrier traps in LDPE films filled with different type of zeolites by the measurement of thermally stimulated current.

The IDT structure is divided into cells, each modelled by a sequence of mismatched transmission lines consisting of a metallized and unmetallized regions. The model includes: (1) the impedance difference between metallized and free regions, the reflection coefficient at the metallization upstep, the reflection coefficient in the reverse direction at the downstep, all deduced from the Datta-Hunsinger perturbation formula; (2) the velocity difference between the free and metallized regions obtained using our SAW propagation calculation software for arbitrarily orientated multilayers; and (3) the energy storage susceptance at each finger discontinuity. Since only ordinary network elements are combined in accordance with the IDT geometry, this model permits good physical insight into the structure's characteristics and allows simple procedures for finding high directivity (so-called NSPUDT) orientations. Additionally, this unit-cell-based arbitrarily oriented IDT model applies to any desired IDT geometry. For regular and split-finger transducer structures as well as for two-transducer structures along NSPUDT directions, performance predictions obtained with the network model are in excellent agreement with measured data found in the literature. As a complementary step, we have derived the coupling-of-modes (COM) parameters from our network model and have shown that the COM description is consistent with it.

A kind of laser induced hole filling (LIHF) is the principal facor for determining the achievable recording density. When the hole interval becomes narrow, the degree of LIHF becomes prominent. This type of LIHF is a quite new phenomenon. Owing to this phenomenon, multiplicity (or hole interval) and irradiation energy for a single hole can be optimized simultaneously to maximize the recording density. The recording material studied here is metal-free sodium tetraphenyl porphyrintetrasulfonate in poly(vinyl alcohol), which is considered to have the least observable LIHF. According to the experimental data reported here and our previously reported theory, the maximum recording density is turned out to be 1. 0 Gbit/cm2 at 20 K. In this case, optimized irradiation energy is 29 mJ/cm2/hole and multiplicity is 130. This multiplicity corresponds to hole interval of 0.21 nm, which is about 5 times larger than the initial hole width of this recording material. On the analogy of this case, the maximum achievable recording density of current PHB materials at 4. 2 K becomes a little bit less than 20 Gbit/cm2. The most important research target for PHB memory is to find out materials with less of this type of LIHF. © 1992, The Chemical Society of Japan.

The absorption spectra of chlorin e6 trimethyl ester (Che6TME) doped PMMA before and after hole-burning did not overlap. Since laser induced hole filling only occurs when the spectra overlap, it can be avoided by using Che6TME/PMMA. We found that the use of dye molecules without C2 axis perpendicular to molecular plane, such as Che6TME, can prevent laser induced hole filling which is enebitable in C2 symmetric H2 porphyrin derivatives. Also in the systems we used here, we found that the energy transfer between guest molecules is negligible only at concentrations of less than ~10~3 M.

Although model compounds (octane and cyclohexane) exhibited quite high reactivities on H-Ga-silicate, the naqhtha fractions showed negligible reactivities on the catalyst. By examining the model reaction in the presence of quinoline or cresol, the authors attributed the low reactivity of the coal liquid to the following three reasons: a) adsorption of the basic components on the acid sites of the catalyst, b) inhibitory effect phenols, c) rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to the deposition of coke precursors formed during storage of the coal liquid. Washing the naphtha fractions with 3%HCI and then 10%NaOH aqueous solutions to remove these inhibitors significantly increased the reactivities of these naphtha fractions, and the reactions of the washed naphtha fractions on H-Ga-silicate afforded BTX in ca. 50% yields. Inhibitory effect of phenols on the conversion of hydorcabons was unexpected because facile alkylations of phenols with methanol on microporous catalysts are well known; therefore the reaction of phenols on H-Ga-silicatewas examined. At low temperatures, phenol molecules were strongly adsorbed in the pores of the H-Ga-silicate and inhibited the conversion of the hydrocabons. At high temperatures, phenols were apparently deoxygenated on H-Ga-silicateyielding aromatic hydrocabons; however, the catalyst was rapidly deactivated. © 1992, The Japan Institute of Energy.

The experiment used freon-113 at near-saturation conditions, at a constant 84% fill level, to simulate the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of cryogenic fluids in space applications. The objectives of TPCE are to characterize the fluid dynamics of axial-jet-induced mixing in low gravity, to evaluate the validity of empirical mixing models, and to provide data for use in developing and validating computational fluid dynamic models of mixing processes. TPCE accomplished all of its objectives in flight on the Space Shuttle in August 1991. The flow patterns observed generally agreed with a prior correlation derived from drop tower tests. Several existing mixing correlations were found to provide reasonable performance predictions. Low-energy mixing jets - dissipating on the order of one percent of the kinetic energy of previous mixer designs - were found to be effective and reliable at reducing thermal non-uniformities, promoting heat and mass transfer between the phases, and reducing tank pressure.

These disadvantages include very low density, requiring large volume tankage and thus increased aircraft drag and reduced payload capacity, high fuel price, and 20 K cryogenic storage requirements, thus greatly complicating ground operations. Methane is a very cheap, clean burning fuel, with a density 7 times that of hydrogen and modest cryogenic (120 K) storage requirements. It would thus be highly advantageous if methane could be made to function as a fuel for the NASP. Such a possibility has been discounted in the past, however, because methane does not burn fast enough for efficient scramjet operation, and it possesses an inadequate thermal heat sink to effectively cool the drag heated surfaces of hypersonic NASP. In this paper a concept, termed the Methane-Acetylene Cycle Aerospace Plane (MACASP), will be proposed that has the potential of overcoming these difficulties. In the MACASP concept, methane fuel stored onboard the aircraft is run out within the wing leading edge in pipes which are allowed to rise in temperature to about 1400 K. in the presence of catalyst, the heat provided by wing drag is used to drive the highly endothermic chemical reaction; 2CH4 = 3H2 + C2H2. The products of this reaction, hydrogen and acetylene, are then fed into a combustion chamber and burned in air. As on the NASP, terminal acceleration to orbit beyond the critical Mach number of the scramjet can be enabled by rocket operation using a small on-board supply of LOx. The advantages of this concept are that the two highly energetic but difficult to store fuels (H2 and C2H2) can be used without on-board storage required. In effect, a portion of the large amount of energy being dissipated by the MACASP as aerodynamic drag is being recaptured and used to jack the methane up to an energy state where it has as high an energy content per unit mass and as rapid a combustion rate as hydrogen. The endothermic chemical reaction, which occurs on a millisecond time scale, actually endows the methane with a heat sink per unit mass almost as great as that possessed by liquid hydrogen. In this paper the thermodynamics of the MACASP concept is explored and theoretical feasibility is shown. Potential problems and areas of concern are identified. A conceptual point design for a MACASP vehicle is advanced and mission analysis performed comparing performance of the MACASP to both conventional hydrogen NASP and rocket driven expendable launch vehicles. It is shown that the MACASP concept offers significant promise for economical Earth to orbit transportation. © 1992 by Martin Marietta Corp.

A high energy propellant is developed by passing a low density gas, H2, (which gains heat from a phase change material, Si) through a concentric cylinder heat exchanger. The phase change material is healed over a period of time significantly longer than the firing time by a radioisotope, PoGd. It is shown that such an engine can most efficiently operate just above and just below a propellant flow regime defined by gradual flow transition in the beat exchanger. Two designs are developed to illustrate each distinct operating scenario. A 10 N engine utilizing laminar flow is shown to be an attractive alternative to chemical and electric systems for the maneuvering of a vehicle about a larger space structure. A 450 N engine utilizing primarily turbulent heat transfer is shown to be an alternative to other systems for orbit transfer. Entrance region cooling, which can be mitigated by varying the flow area or increasing the length of the engine, is the primary limitation on an engine utilizing thermal storage. © 1992 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

It consists of curved crystal diffractors. gas-flow proportional counters, gas storage and regulation, control and read-out electronics, and mechanisms for rotating and positioning the various elements as required for Rowland circle operation of the spectrometer. Technical developments underway for the BCS include, 1) ultra-low leak rate windows of 1 µm thickness that can withstand 1 atmosphere differential pressure; and 2) methods for bending and bonding thin diffractors with the required tolerance. The HETG consists of an array of ~500 grating facets, each ~2×2 cm in size, that can be inserted just behind the AXAF telescope to disperse the X-rays across an imaging detector at the focal plane. The facets are periodic structures of two types: medium energy gratings (0.6 µm period, 0.5 µm thick in silver and high energy gratings (0.2 µm period, 1.0 µm thick in gold); in both cases the periodic structures are supported by a 1.0 µm thick polyimide film.

It is intended to feed a liquid-air cartridge (discharge tube) that is being developed separately under NASA sponsorship. It is assumed that, when fully developed, the cartridge will require a fairly steady current (70 KA) and a fairly constant voltage (7 KV). For various reasons, competitive concepts (homopolar generators, campulsators, capacitor storage, MHD generators, etc.) all have drawbacks. The principle of the generator is the same as an earlier one, for an electric gun, which demands self-containment (very important) hut is generally far smaller in size and in output. The principle is that of a linear generator, a conductive piston propelled by gas pressure at about 120 meters/sec through a perpendicularly created electromagnetic field of 2 Tesla strength, thus creating the required Faraday voltage. The overall length of the system works out to he 60 meters. The generator is still in the design stage. u Special attention was given to: (1) the design of an electromagnet that can create a cross flux density of 2 Tesla and be 41 meters long; (2) brushes on the piston, contacting the long electrodes, that can self-adjust to make up for wear, corrosion, temperature changes, etc.; (3) a high-pressure gas source to drive the piston against the retarding Lorentz force; (4) a piston speed braking system; (5) a means to return the piston to the start position, and (6) a means to take care of the inevitable recoil.

In those converters, energy storage ability of the devices cannot be used effectively, especially when dc power ripple is required to be very small. To solve such a problem, this paper presents novel single‐phase ac/dc conversion circuits, in which energy storage devices are used at the ac rather than at the dc side. That is, after converting single‐phase ac into balanced (rectangular) two‐phase ac using variable reactance element, reconversion of it into dc is carried out.

This dormancy corresponds to the inability of seeds to germinate in the dark at temperatures above 15°C, but is practically not apparent at temperatures between 5 and 15°C. Continuous white light markedly inhibits germination of dormant seeds, even at low irradiances, and reinforces their sensitivity to oxygen deprivation. However, prolonged illumination with white light does not alter subsequent germination in the dark. Breaking of dormancy during dry storage at 20°C results in a widening of the temperature range within which a high rate of germination occurs, and in almost complete disappearance of sensitivity of seeds to light. The structures surrounding the embryo (glumellae, caryopsis envelopes and possibly endosperm) are mainly responsible for dormancy and photosensitivity of whole seeds, probably because they limit the oxygen supply to the embryo. However, the embryo itself appears to play a role in dormancy. The results obtained are discussed in relation to dormancy of cereal seeds, and in relation to field establishment of B. rubens as a weed. La dormance des semences de Bromus rubens L. en relation avec les effets de la température, de la lumière et de l'oxygène Les semences mûres de Bromus rubens L. fraîchement récoltées sont dormantes. Leur dormance correspond à une inaptitude à germer à l'obscuritéà des températures supérieures à 15°C, mais elle ne se manifeste pratiquement pas entre 5 et 15°C. La lumière blanche continue inhibe nettement la germination des semences dormantes, même à de faibles énergies, et renforce leur sensibilitéà la privation d'oxygène. Cependant, un éclairement prolongé n'a aucune conséquence sur la germination ultérieure à l'obscurité. L'élimination de la dormance pendant la conservation au sec, à 20°C, se traduit par un élargissement de la gamme thermique qui assure une bonne germination et par la disparition presque complète de la sensibilité des semences à la lumière. Les structures qui entourent l'embryon (glumelles, enveloppes du caryopse et peut‐être albumen) sont, en grande partie, responsables de la dormance et de la photosensibilité des semences entières, sans doute parce qu'elles limitent l'apport d'oxygène à l'embryon. Toutefois, l'embryon lui‐même semble participer à la dormance. Les résultats obtenus sont discutés par comparaison avec la dormance des semences des céréales et en relation avec l'implantation, dans les cultures, de B. rubens en tant que mauvaise herbe. Dormanz der Samen von Bromus rubens L. in Bezug auf Temperatur, Licht und Sauerstoffversorgung Frisch geerntete Samen von Bromus rubens L. sind im Dunkeln bei Temperaturen über 15°C dormant, während diese Dormanz bei Temperaturen zwischen 5 und 15°C praktisch nicht vorliegt. Ständiges weißes Licht hemmt die Keimung dormanter Samen deutlich, sogar bei niedriger Intensität, und verstärkt ihre Empfindlichkeit gegenüber Sauerstoffmangel. Ständige Beleuchtung mit weißem Licht verändert jedoch nicht die folgende Dunkelkeimung. Das Brechen der Dormanz während der trockenen Lagerung bei 20 °C führt zu einem vergrößerten Temperaturbereich, in dem die Samen gut keimen, und läßt ihre Lichtempfindlichkeit fast vollständig verschwinden. Die Strukturen um den Embryo (Spelzen, Schale der Caryopse und möglicherweise Endosperm) sind hauptsächlich für die Dormanz und die Lichtempfindlichkeit des ganzen Samens verantwortlich, vermutlich deshalb, weil sie die Sauerstoffversorgung des Embryos einschränken. Aber auch der Embryo selbst scheint bei der Dormanz eine Rolle zu spielen. Die Untersuchungsergebnisse werden im Vergleich zur Dormanz von Getreidesamen und hinsichtlich des Vorkommens von Bromus rubens als Unkraut diskutiert. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

The X‐ray diffraction patterns patterns indicate that the PSPI is amorphous in the solid state. The Tg was 378°C ∼ 410°C, depending upon the thermal history over the range of 350°C ∼ 400°C. At the glass transition region, the dynamic storage modulus E′ was very sensitive to both i‐line exposure energy and thermal history. However, the mechanical stress‐strain behavior at room temperature was primarily dependent on the thermal history. The mechanical properties were 2.6 GPa ∼ 2.9 GPa Young's modulus, 131 MPa ∼ 168 MPa tensile strength, 10% ∼ 12% yield strain, and 16% ∼ 74% elongation at break, depending upon the baking or annealing. These dynamic and static mechanical properties indicate that on the PSPI backbone, crosslinks are formed thermally as well as photochemically. The thermal crosslinks might be formed through thermal liberation of the labile alkyl groups of aromatic diamine moieties and subsequent coupling of the radicals. The thermal degradation was also evidenced in the mechanical properties degraded by baking above 375°C or annealing above 350°C. In addition, during baking and cooling, the residual stress was dynamically measured on Si wafers as a function of temperature. The stress at room temperature was 48 MPa ∼ 52 MPa for the PSPI films baked at 350°C or 400°C, regardless of i‐line exposure.

When a PAC fiber sample was immersed in a swelling agent, e.g., 80% aqueous dimethylformamide (DMF) and subjected to a programmed heating, the fiber swells, with the dissociable intermolecular couplings gradually broken until finally the fiber was completely dissolved. If this process was done in a DSC analyzer, a small endothermic peak appears on the latter part of the SDSC thermogram. This represents the disentanglement energy of the entangled bonds in the sample. If done in a thermomechanical analyzer, the SSS, SS, and TSM, measured just before incipient dissolution, i.e., the point that intermolecular couplings were broken and only the entangled loopings junctions were left, should reflect the number of the entanglement loops. Thus, the long argued problem whether an entanglement is topological, or due to loci of chain coupling, or is of dual nature may be experimentally elucidated.

A region was localized near the boundaries of the stability diagram in which the ions experience an increase in their kinetic energy. This is reflected in the occurrence both of fragmentation due to collisional activation and of a certain extent of ion loss due to unstable trajectories. The results of this excitation, referred to as ‘boundary effects,’ depend on the specific qzat which the ion storage is performed and on the buffer gas used, and point to a simpler means of obtaining tandem mass spectra with the ion trap without the need to apply resonant tickle voltages between the end ‐cap electrodes.

Electron microscopic observations revealed that the rubber particles are as finely dispersed as in ABS. Both the heat of fusion and the dynamic storage modulus of the blends were linear functions of the blend composition. The melting point of nylon crystallites and glass transition temperatures of poly(acrylonitrile‐co‐styrene) (AS) and the rubber phase in ABS and the amorphous phase in nylon were almost independent of the composition. Very high Izod impact strength was achieved over a broad compositional range. These facts suggest that the nylon and the modified ABS are not mixed on a molecular level although there must be sufficient interaction between them. The melt viscosities were increased with an increase in the ABS component. In the region of less than 65% ABS, the viscosities bend off to the zero‐shear viscosity at low shear rates. Above 65% ABS, the viscosity curves were expressed by a power law fluid. The power law index decreased with an increase in the ABS content.

Structure, primary production and energy flow were studied in ungrazed and grazed alpine meadows in the Garhwal Himalaya, India. In grazed grasslands, the cover of graminoids increased, the biomass of palatable species was reduced by about 50%, but the biomass of unpalatable species increased, due to reduced competition from the better‐foraged species. Generally, 32% of live shoot and root biomass was consumed during a growing season. Also, above‐ground plant productivity increased as a result of plant regrowth, while below‐ground productivity decreased. Flow and storage of energy in ungrazed and grazed alpine grasslands showed an accumulation of 10.1 and 8.5 kJ/yr with energy conversion efficiencies of 0.7 and 0.6% respectively. Ca. 46% of the net energy accumulated was consumed by herbivores on the grazed grassland. Only 26% of the net captured energy disappeared from the system in the growing season, mainly via root and litter decomposition. 1992 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science","Biomass; Energy conversion efficiency; Forb meadow; Grass meadow; Grazing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986792458

S. Kistler in 1931. Aerogels are produced by a sol–gel process followed by supercritical drying of the wet gel in an autoclave. Their porosity extends from about 1 to 100 nm, which is the reason why properly made aerogels are highly transparent. Aerogels have a spongelike, open‐pore structure with a large inner surface. Monolithic aerogels are used in Cerenkov detectors in high‐energy physics; several houses have been insulated with layers of translucent granular aerogels for the purpose of passive solar energy usage; opacified aerogel powders are being tested as substitutes for chlorofluoro‐carbon‐blown polyurethane foams and as thermal superinsulations in heat‐storage systems; experiments have been performed with aerogels as catalytic substrates, acoustic impedance matching layers, precursors for high‐quality glasses, containment for fusion fuels, and gas filters; and aerogels are used in radioluminescent light and energy sources. The attraction that these low‐density materials exert on physicists, chemists, and material scientists is recognized from the upsurge of publications on aerogels: about 200 papers are currently published per year.

One of the most widely used methods for on-line continuous non-destructive monitoring of moisture content is through the use of low-power microwave energy. Microwave aquametry is based on the relationship between the propagation of electromagnetic energy through a dielectric sample to its moisture content. Although these principles are widely applicable to a variety of food material, most of the research thus far has concentrated on characterizing the attenuation-moisture relationships of grain.

Although these parameters minimize effects of roughness and vegetation, the spatial application of space and airborne radar are limited to the near range of the swath. Aiming at the development of algorithms to broaden the range of useful data, an experiment was conducted with NASMJPL airborne radar polarimeter (P, L and C Bands) in September 1989 in an agricultural area near Fresno, California There were two flights six days apart; ground measurements of soil moisture and surface roughness were taken on both flight dates in eight different fields. Based on first order surface backscattering models, a physically based algorithm for retrieval of soil moisture and surface roughness has been developed. It has been shown that the co-polarization ratio is sensitive to soil moisture but not to soil roughness at high incidence angles (38 to 60 degrees). The derived soil moisture was used to drive a two-layer heat and energy flux model in order to estimate evaporation from bare soils. The estimated values of evaporation for a two-week period are realistic. As the model incorporates time variations in both soil moisture and surface temperature, it could be used in conjunction with values of those parameters periodically estimated using SAR and infrared imagery, providing estimates of bare soil evaporation. © IEEE 1992.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Digital storage; Evaporation; Geology; Moisture; Parameter estimation; Polarization; Radar; Radar imaging; Radar measurement; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soils; Space optics; Space-based radar; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural areas; Energy flux model; Ground measurements; Infrared imagery; Polarization ratios; Spatial applications; Surface backscattering; Surface temperatures; Soil surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964453039

The principal of operation is as follows: the negative sequence components of the load currents are measured in magnitude and in phase and the PWM-controlled Active Power Filter is controlled to inject currents opposite to these quantities, thereby achieving the balancing function. The operation of the proposed system along with the selection of the Active Power Filter components are discussed in detail.

Sugar Baby) was fully suppressed by intermittent far-red (FR) irradiation (1 min every 30 min). When the intervening dark period was increased, a linearly increasing final germination percentage was obtained. However, a 4-day intermittent FR treatment induced phyto-chrome-controlled dormancy and the longer the dark interval the deeper was the dormancy of the non-germinated seeds. When seeds were soaked in a fully inhibitory osmotic solution, no dormancy was imposed. However, a single FR pulse at the time of transfer induced partial, secondary dormancy; the kinetics of the imposition of dormancy followed a negative exponential curve (half-life 1.5 days; 3 days for the cultivar Crimson Sweet). Seeds osmotreated for 10 days in darkness and subsequently dehydrated (with and without a final FR pulse) acquired germination characteristics similar to those in light-requiring and dark-germinating achenes, respectively, of the lettuce cultivar Grand Rapids. In the light-requiring osmomani-pulated seed population, the induction of germination was brought about by the low-energy reaction of phytochrome, chilling, dry storage and decoating. The transformation through osmomanipulation of the dark-germinating watermelon seeds (the inhibition of which required prolonged exposure to light) to positively or negatively photosensitive seeds (that responded to brief light pulses), might be attributed to the slow relaxation of existing meta-Fa and meta-Rb phytochrome intermediates to Pfrupon hydration. © 1992, The Medieval Academy of America.

The 200 MeV compact ring at the National Synchrotron Light Source is an ideal tool to study PSD since its energy can be varied from 60 to 200 MeV and the photoelectrons produced by synchrotron radiation can be measured in clearing electrodes installed to collect trapped ions. Using these electrodes we show: [a] photoelectrons are produced only by photons having energy above 10 eV and [b] desorption is proportional to the number of photoelectrons. Using calibrated gauges we conclude that (a) time-integrated beam current of 10–20 A h is needed for initial vacuum chamber clean up, (b) venting the chamber to dry nitrogen has a negligible effect on subsequent desorption, and (c) venting to air requires about 10 A h of beam conditioning. © 1992, American Vacuum Society.

Using calcium chloride hexahydrate as the salt hydrate, a glass tube bundle packed with the salt was set in the collector. The air heater was exposed to radiant heating by infrared lamps. The heat trap and the storage characteristics of the air heater were examined by measuring the transient temperature distribution of salt and air in the collector. When the lamps were turned off after attainment of a steady-state heating condition, outlet air of stable temperature around at the melting point was obtained for a time longer than 5 hours, and a much greater effect of latent heat storage was observed in comparison with that of an air heater with glass tube bundle but without the salt. A suspension of fine graphite particles in the salt enhances the heat trap efficiency due to the change in its optical properties. The suspension not only increases the molten part of the salt close to the collector inlet but also improves the crystallization due to its function as a nucleus. The heat storage capacity increased as a result. Good performance of this type of solar air heater was also found in an outdoor experiment. © 1992, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

Fat and glycogen represent, together with proteins, the principal energy storage materials. During energy requirement, e.g. muscular exercise, glycogen as a local reserve, is used first to supply energy needs. Acetyl-carnitine, as an active molecular group, represents an intermediate substrate, usable directly in the working tissue. The present study investigates whether plasma acetyl-carnitine could be a useful biochemical measure for information on fuel exchange in the body, and whether it is a rapidly available energy source exchangeable among tissues with different metabolic functions, such as muscle and liver. The present study investigated control and hepatopathic subjects after maximal and submaximal muscular exercise. Hepatopathic patients may be a useful model, as liver carnitine metabolism is likely to be impaired. Plasma acetyl-carnitine before, during and after maximal exercise in hepatopathic subjects did not differ, while in normal subjects it increased. After submaximal exercise, acetyl-carnitine increased in patients, as well in controls. In the patients (n = 9) with liver metabolism disorders we observed that during maximal exercise plasma acetyl-carnitine varied from 3.26 ± 2.18 ?mol/l (time 0 min) to 4.30 ± 2.02 ?mol/l (time 20 min) and from 1.99 ± 1.36 ?mol/l to 4.83 ± 2.60 ?/l (p < 0.05) in the controls (n = 7).

The main problems of molten salt as a latent thermal storage material are its large volume change on phase change and its feasibility for use with structural materials. Using mild steel, two different U-tube storage units were built for testing heat transfer performance, structural feasibility and compatibility with the molten salt. From thorough and comprehensive material analyses after 1,000 melting-freezing (charge-discharge) cycle tests, it was concluded that the present storage unit structure (horizontal U-tube and multiple-path type) and material selection were fairly feasible for a latent thermal storage unit with this particular molten salt. © 1992, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

The advantages of sagittal energy storage shortly after heelstrike and release at push-off of the prior energy storing feet are integrated with a medio-lateral control and propulsion functions. This is achieved by a totally asymmetrical shaped keel having three main curvatures. The heel has a complex shape consisting of a composite curvature in the sagittal and frontal planes. The mid-portion of the keel is arched and acts as a leafspring. The last curvature is located at the forefoot where the toe-end is internally rotated. A geometric model of the keel was developed to insure that no shape interferences were occuring with a physical model of the entire foot. From the geometric model a finite element model was developed and validated. Preliminary results indicate that the heel deforms it-self medially by about 1 mm and the fore-foot raises when a load representing the heel-strike contact is applied. Maximum deflection occurs when the push-off load is applied. Maximum stresses are located at the curved toe-end rather than at the heel component or near the holes for fixing the keel to the artificial shank. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Biomedical engineering; Geometry; Complex shapes; Flexible foot; Frontal planes; Geometric modeling; Lateral control; Maximum deflection; Maximum stress; Physical model; Computer aided design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913165067

Laboratory batch as well as bench scale continuous tests indicate that when fracturing silica sand is substituted for steel media, then superior energy savings on the order of 50% and more can be realized. Moreover, this approach has been found to eliminate the disadvantages observed with grinding using steel media such as high replacement cost, contamination of coal through media wear, greater degree of coal oxidation due to higher slurry temperature and greater level of noise dissipation. Additionally, coal-sand attrition system reduces the manpower time because steel media after grinding needs precautionary measures to be taken such as thorough cleaning and their storage in inert atmosphere to avoid rust and corrosion problems. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Here it was attempted to incorporate β-alanine in the aluminium hydroxide matrix. A series of precipitates were prepared with the highest ratio of β-alanine/Al = 0.22 obtained at pH = 7. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed in addition to amorphous precipitates, microcrystalline samples of four different X-ray patterns in nine precipitates, indicating variations in the structure of aluminium hydroxide matrix with incorporated β-alanine. Selected samples were exposed to γ-irradiation at 77 K, and at room temperature (293 K) in the presence and in the absence of air. In all the samples of amorphous structure no stable paramagnetic centers were determined by ESR after γ-irradiation in air. In all samples of microcrystalline structure similar stable paramagnetic centers were determined by ESR after γ-irradiation in air and in the evacuated tubes. These paramagnetic centers that we were unable to identify due to the poor resolution of the lines in the ESR spectrum can be most probably ascribed to structural defects introduced into the aluminium hydroxide matrix by β-alanine. In all amorphous samples γ-irradiated in the absence of air, the radical C̊H2CH2COOH formed by abstraction of amino group from the β-alanine was determined by ESR. The radical was unstable in air. Thus in the absence of air β-alanine may be considered as a storage site for the γ-irradiation energy in the amorphous aluminium hydroxides. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50749134334

Using computer simulations and semi-empirical potential energy functions for Si and GaAs, both long-range field effects and cluster excess energy effects are demonstrated. Using a continuum approach with a ledge energy that depends on cluster radius, great differences relative to the classical nucleation picture are found. For vicinal surface orientations, an equation for film growth velocity is developed which incorporates gas phase transport, surface transport, ledge collection efficiency, ledge attachment kinetics and excess energy storage due to deposition stress and adsorbate trapping. The paper first treats the case of Si film formation from SiH4 in H2 with only SiH2 forming in the adlayer. It then extends the treatment to deal with other Si intermediates formed in the adlayer which then desorb into the gas phase. Finally, the treatment is extended to consider SiNx film formation from SiH4 + NH3 in H2. © 1992, Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved.

However, this model is not restricted to the case considered and may be used for a superconducting solenoid with an arbitrary amount of stored energy. While a minimum superconducting volume is economically desirable, too thin a winding leads to prohibitively high current densities. The current density is nearly independent of the ratio of solenoid length to diameter.

An office building currently under construction in Nicosia, Cyprus, has been used as an example in the feasibility study. The objective of the study is to compare the performance of the ice storage/cold air distribution system with conventional all air systems in terms of their capital and running costs using current Cyprus Electricity Authority supply regulations and tariff structures. The results show that the application of ice storage combined with cold air distribution will lead to slightly lower capital cost than the conventional system and would result in significant energy cost savings over the life cycle of the system. Changing current Electricity Authority regulations to allow the same equipment to be operated both on-peak and off-peak tariffs will increase further the first cost advantage of the ice storage/cold air distribution air conditioning system over the conventional system. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44049114208

For a relative-velocity distribution of the electron beam, characterized by the longitudinal kT and transverse kT electron-beam temperatures, we found also analytical forms for the polarization rates. For a flattened distribution (kTkT) the polarization rates for different (n,l) states peak at a direction, perpendicular to the ion-beam axis (in the moving frame), where the photons are completely linearly polarized for the s states.

Fertilizing the central gyres would require enormous amounts of N and P fertilizer. Addition of iron to the Southern Ocean has been rejected as inefficient. The deep sea disposal of 50-100% of fossil fuel CO2 would suppress the predicted transient peak of atmospheric CO2 but eventually the atmospheric CO2 level will be the same as without, unless rapid buffering by dissolution of calcite is significant. Ocean disposal applies only to point sources representing ∼30% of fossil fuel emissions; relocation of these plants to maritime regions may not be economical either. Also ocean disposal costs ∼30-45% of the energy produced. Current research is focusing on production and oceanic mixing behaviour of the effluent stream (this volume). In this paper the fate of the disposed CO2 is assessed. The various proposed forms appear chemically unstable relative to ambient seawater. However the higher CO2 contents of seawater might lead to part of the CO2 being buffered forever through enhanced dissolution of existing calcite deposits. The predicted impact depends on the selected rate constant of latter dissolution. Ocean dumping is a fallback option, in case the sensible options of energy conservation and shifting to other energy sources would not be implemented adequately. Latter options would require societal and economic adaptations but appear the most efficient, if not inevitable, policy for imminent reduction of CO2 emissions. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249011931

In a range-dependent ocean environment, scattering in all directions will occur, but in some ocean environments the all-direction scattering is weak and often can be ignored. For long-range propagation, keeping the cumulative weak scattering can be important. Numerical treatment of this type of scattering in a very long range presents two computational problems: (1) the required memory storage, and (2) the required computation time. In this paper, a marching technique is developed to handle the cumulative scattering, thus alleviating the memory storage problem, and an efficient numerical solution is introduced which reduces the computation time. When using a marching technique to solve this problem, one usually encounters the problem of well-posedness. In the context of the development of the numerical scheme, an approximation is made which suppresses the instability associated with the well-posedness question. Additionally, in the scheme, at large distances from the source a continuation process is employed (essentially a PE) to continue the solution, thereby modeling an actual physical environment without scattering. The theoretical formulation of a representative scattering equation and the development of the scheme for solving this equation will be discussed. Moreover, a realistic problem with weak scattering is presented to demonstrate the validity of this treatment. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249008334

For q &gt; 7, the usual statistical single-monomer evaporation is the only observable metastable fragmentation channel. Surprisingly, the (C4H 10)n C4 H7+ cluster ions were found to exhibit a more complex metastable decay pattern, involving not only the single-monomer evaporation, but also two additional fragmentation channels leading to evaporation of 2 to 4 and 4 to 7 (C4H 10) monomers, respectively.

J walking can greatly reduce systematic errors due to quasiergodicity, or the incomplete sampling of configuration space in Monte Carlo simulations. As in the classical case, quantum J walking uses a jumping scheme to overcome configurational barriers. It couples the usual Metropolis sampling to a distribution generated at a higher temperature where the sampling is sufficiently ergodic. The J-walker distributions used in quantum J walking can be either quantum or classical, with classical distributions having the advantage of lower storage requirements, but the disadvantage of being slightly more computationally intensive and having a more limited useful temperature range. The basic techniques are illustrated first on a simple one-dimensional double well potential based on a quartic polynomial. The suitability of J walking for typical multidimensional quantum Monte Carlo systems is then shown by applying the method to a multiparticle cluster system consisting of rare gas atoms bound by pairwise Lennard-Jones potentials. Different degrees of quantum behavior are considered by examining both argon and neon clusters. Remarkable improvements in the convergence rate for the cluster energy and heat capacity, analogous to those found in classical systems, are found for temperatures near the cluster transition regions. © 1992 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449008756

The theorem so obtained is somewhat general: The radiating particles need not be relativistic, and they need not form a beam, the emitted radiation may be arbitrary (not necessarily electromagnetic), provided only that the emission process is short enough and not too violent. The proof makes no reference to transfer matrices, nor to properties of the guiding forces (which need not be electromagnetic), except that they are derivable from a Hamiltonian. Then in general the sum of the instantaneous damping coefficients is =i=13ai=1/2i=13k ̄i/pi =1/2̄pk̄, where k is the time rate of momentum given up by a particle of momentum p̄ and i=1,2,3 denotes the three components. When k̄ is parallel to p̄, and k=tsumn=MNk(n), where k(n)∼pn, then =tsumn(2+n)k(n)/2p. If, further, the emitting and emitted particles are both ultrarelativistic, and the sum of powers reduces to a single second-order term (as during photon emission by ultrarelativistic electrons in storage rings), then =4/2E, where is the power radiated out by particles of energy E.

However, up to now one drawback of the pulsed high power microwave discharge was the lack of commercially available high power microwave tubes with pulsed output powers in the region of 100 MW to1 GW. There are two methods for achieving output powers comparable to relativistic sources. One way is the combining of several conventional tubes, which is rather complicated especially for magnetrons. The other method is the compression of the microwave pulse of a conventional tube by means of a microwave cavity or a network of delay lines and hybrids. This paper describes the application of microwave pulse compression using Q-switching for discharging the storage cavity. Under optimum conditions, up to 80 % of the microwave pulse energy can be stored in a cavity and delivered to a matched load via triggering a suited switching element. The design discussed in this paper uses the laser discharge as switch. The plasma tube is integrated in the storage cavity and the discharge is triggered when the electric field strength exceeds the holdoff field strength of the gas mixture. The microwave source was operated at power levels of 4.5 - 5 MW and at repetition rates of 10 - 20 Hz. With a stored energy of 1.4 J a XeCl laser featuring a pulse energy of 4 mJ and a pulse length of 16 ns could be realized without any preionization. The discharge structure was in no way optimized. Principal limitations in laser pulse energy and repetition frequency are arising from the fact that the discharge acts both as a switch and as laser amplifier. Considerable improvements in the performance of the complete system can be expected, if the cavity is discharged by an optimized switch while the laser discharge acts only as a load. Some theoretical aspects of the pulse compression circuit will be presented together with experimental results. The results show the potential of realizing microwave discharge pumped excimer lasers with output powers ranging from 10 to 100 d.A laser head powered by a S-band (3 GHz) magnetron would be rather compact, because it comprises only a storage cavity and a discharge structure without any high voltage component. The feeding could be done via a flexible waveguide. In this way using microwave pulse compression techniques, the microwave discharge is an interesting alternative to TEA-discharges. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Chlorine compounds; Excimer lasers; Gas lasers; Magnetrons; Microwave circuits; Microwaves; Pulsed lasers; Pumping (laser); Timing circuits; Discharge structures; Electric field strength; High power microwaves; High voltage components; High-power gas lasers; Microwave discharge; Microwave pulse compression; Repetition frequency; Electric discharges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20444403139

Quantifying this temperature dependence is very important for fundamental, as well as practical, reasons. The purpose of this paper is to present a unified framework for handling the temperature dependence of rheological data. We considered the case (by far the most common in polymer melts) where all relaxation times (in the context of linear viscoelasticity) have the same temperature dependence (characterized by a “horizontal shift activation energy”) and all relaxation moduli have the same temperature dependence (characterized by a “vertical shift activation energy”). The horizontal and vertical activation energies were extracted from loss tangent vs. frequency and loss tangent vs. complex modulus data, respectively. This is the recommended method of calculation, as it allows independent estimation of the two activation energies (statistically uncorrelated). It was shown theoretically, and demonstrated experimentally, that neglect of the vertical shift leads to a stress (or modulus) dependent activation energy and necessitates different activation energies for the superposition of loss and storage modulus data. The long standing problem of a stress‐dependent activation energy in long chain branched LDPE was identified as originating from the neglect of the vertical shift. The theory was applied successfully to many polyolefin melts, including HDPE, LLDPE, PP, EVOH, LDPE, and EVA. Linear polymers (HDPE, LLDPE, PP) and EVOH do not require a vertical shift, but long chain branched polymers do (LDPE, EVA). Steady‐shear viscosity data can be superimposed using activation energies extracted from dynamic data. Copyright © 1992 Society of Plastics Engineers",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11644259506

The seasonality may be extreme culminating in very synchronised mass spawning events. Hypotheses to explain strongly seasonal reproduction are appraised in relation to demographic theory of life history which supposes that a limited resource (e.g., energy) may be allocated to (a) maintenance and defense against the environment (respiration, excretion, ionic regulation, etc.); (b) growth; or (c) propagule production and present reproduction. Allocation to each contributes to fitness through demographic components that can be defined by the Euler-Lotka equation. Hypotheses to account for strongly seasonal reproduction must explain the mechanism that confers selective advantage to highly seasonal non-random deployment of limited resources to reproduction. The various hypotheses proposed can be classified as (I) non-functional and (II) functional. Functional hypotheses suppose that a selective advantage accrues as a consequence of energy storage prior to allocation to reproductive function. There are costs associated with this energy storage that must be compensated by the selective advantage accruing from delayed deployment of resources. A number of different functional hypotheses can be identified which may be allocated to two sets of related hypotheses: (A) Synchronisation maximises offspring survival — the optimum larval survival strategy; and (B) Synchronisation maximises fitness independently of offspring survival — the optimum fertilisation strategy. Several versions of each can be identified; their predictions are examined and discussed in relation to possible consequences of enhanced rates of environmental change (global warming). © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Life-history theory; Natural selection; Seasonal reproduction; Spawning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10144254597

In this study, 10 MWh superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems are analyzed with respect to the potential impact of advancing materials technology. Initial analyses focus on magnet design parameters and costs based upon presently available materials. To determine the impact of materials currently under development, magnet designs are then optimized using advanced materials for which commercial availability is anticipated in the near future. The affects of increased superconductor current density, magnet operating temperature and structural material strength are evaluated. Several options for superconducting materials are considered. For relatively low-field (&lt; 17 T) coils, NbTi and Nb3Sn are used. Both of these are commercially available and their properties are well understood. For higher magnet fields and operating temperatures, the ceramic oxide Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O is anticipated in the near term (within 5-10 years). Advanced structural materials are also considered. These include cryogenic steels, maraging steels, and titanium alloys. Of these, Incoloy 908 (a cryogenic steel) is found to be the most suitable material for a small SMES system. The impact of fiber-reinforced steel composites is also evaluated. It was found that each advance in materials technology will significantly impact the economics of 10 MWh SMES systems. If all advances become available (increased current density, operating temperature and allowed stress), the net conductor, structure and cryogenic cost may be reduced by over 45% relative to presently available technology. Further cost reductions result if novel approaches to magnet engineering are successful (e.g., force-reduced magnets). © 1992 IEEE",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347084858

Livers were harvested using an in situ perfusion technique, where organs were flushed with the solution being tested, stored on ice--cold storage (CS)--for 2 or 24 h and then transplanted. Parameters monitored were liver enzymes in serum, hepatic water content, high energy phosphates, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation time T2, light microscopy and bile production. CS for 24 h is an extreme in pig liver preservation and is not compatible with animal survival. Biopsies showed drastic morphological changes and grafts did not produce bile in either group.

They are being developed to improve the reproductive efficiency of males and to lower the cost of artificial insemination. The development of semen diluents began with the use of simple NaCl solutions. Now, more complex diluents containing different osmotic regulators, energy sources, buffers and chelating agents are on the market. The discovery of cryoprotectants, such as glycerol and dimethylsulphoxide, has facilitated the preservation of chicken semen indefinitely at —196°C. The diluents which have been developed for short-term storage of semen are currently being used commercially wherever the technique of artificial insemination is being used seriously, especially in the turkey industry. Even though diluents for long-term semen storage are now available, their commercial application is not yet feasible. This paper reviews the development of the various diluents which has resulted in the ability to preserve domestic fowl semen for short and long periods.

The astrophysical motivation is to understand the effects of radiation drag on the dynamics of a jet or wind passing through the intense radiation field of an accreting compact object. From a critical point analysis, we find that a slow magnetosonic point can appear in a dragged flow even in the absence of gravitational force, as a result of a balance between the drag force and the combination of thermal pressure and centrifugal forces. As in the undragged case, the Alfvén point does not impose any constraints on the flow. Although it is formally possible for a dragged flow to possess more than one fast magnetosonic point, we show that this is unlikely in practice. In the limit of a ""cold,"" centrifugally driven flow, we show that the fast magnetosonic point moves to infinite radius, just as in the drag-free case. For a given mass flux, the total energy output carried to infinity, and the final partition between the kinetic energy and the Poynting flux, are the same for the dragged and the drag-free flows. The main effects of radiation drag are to increase the amount of energy and angular momentum extracted from the source and to redistribute the regions where acceleration occurs in the flow. This is accomplished through the storage and release of magnetic energy, as a result of additional winding and compression of the field caused by the action of the drag. For a relativistic wind, the dissipated energy can exceed the final kinetic energy of the flow and may be comparable to the total flow energy (which is dominated by Poynting flux). The energy lost to radiation drag will appear as a Doppler-boosted beam of scattered radiation, which could dominate the background radiation if the flow is well-collimated.","Accretion, accretion disks; Galaxies: nuclei; MHD; Radiative transfer; Relativity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041950963

During frozen storage the resulting formaldehyde‐protein interactions induce deleterious effects on the functional properties of frozen fish minces. Knowledge of the structural and enzyme properties is incomplete at present and produces certain ambiguities. A new procedure for extracting TMAO‐ase from saithe kidney (Pollachius virens (L.)), using a non‐denaturing detergent, has been developed. Subsequent anion exchange chromatography separated three independent enzyme fractions, differing mainly in their isoelectric points (5.0, 4.5 and 4.1). The three fractions revealed identical pH optima for activity (pH = 5.10), affinity constants (12 mM) and activation energies (4 kcal mol−1). However, differences were observed concerning some of their physicochemical properties such as T1/2 denaturation and spectrophotometric characteristics (unusual absorption at λ = 258 nm, related to the presence of DNA fragments).

In the present work the acceleration of a quench was directly measured for a case when the last was stimulated by fast current rising. These experiments simulated the situation during a quench in AC cables with insulated strands. It was found that a quench velocity is dependent on a current rising rate. The dependence of the quench velocity on start current and external magnetic field was also studied. These results may be used for calculations of the fast quench in real devices. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039331166

The basic analytical model is developed in Part I. Part II includes the completion of the analytical model and the results of an optimization study performed with this model. The results show that: I) Significant performance gains, that is, reductions in the entropy generation number on the order of 10 percent, are possible by employing perfectly stratified thermal energy storage systems that are designed on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics. 2) These performance gains are mainly due to the complete elimination of the entropy generation due to heat transfer through finite temperature differences within the storage element. 3) In general, the optimum design of a perfectly stratified thermal energy storage system requires the use of a very large heat exchanger; however, it is possible to employ a much smaller than optimum heat exchanger without seriously degrading the superior performance of the system. 4) The operation of a stratified system is quite flexible because it has no optimum storage time. 5) The optimum values of the capacity rate ratios, (ϕR)opt and (ϕR)opt for a perfectly stratified thermal energy storage system are in general not equal to unity; however, this finding is shown to be in concert with Bejan’s theory of “remanent„ irreversibilities for a heat exchanger. © 1992 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037765346

Over this period there has been a marked increase in the fundamental understanding of the defect states in these sulphides through studies of electron spin resonance, thermally stimulated luminescence and fluorescence emission spectra at low and elevated temperatures. Advances have been made on the theoretical front in the estimation of defect energies in CaS, SrS and BaS that afford close agreement between calculated and observed cohesive energies assuming an ionic model with an ionicity of 0.9. Preparative methods for polycrystalline powders, thin film layers and single crystals have been developed significantly. Theuse of the sulphurisation flux technique has resulted in highly stable CaS powders, whilst electron beam evaporation, RF sputtering and atomic layer epitaxial methods have been employed to produce thin film multilayer structures. The xenon melt growth technique has been applied to the production of single crystal rods of CaS. There has been a recent focus on full colour ac electroluminescence using CaS and SrS doped with rare earth ions in mixed and multilayer structures for displays. BaS has been developed particularly as a thermoluminescent dosimeter material. Enhancements in fluorescent emission characteristics have been investigated in CaS mixtures with non-isostructural sulphides. The increased understanding gained of alkaline earth sulphides has advanced their development particularly in the understanding gained of alkaline earth sulphides has advanced their development particularly in the electroluminescence field. However, further work on the theoretical and preparative fronts is needed to achieve greater opportunities for commercial exploitation. © 1993.",,"Alkaline earth metal compounds; Band structure; Barium compounds; Calcium compounds; Defects; Electroluminescence; Energy storage; Luminescence; Phosphors; Powders; Strontium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Barium sulfide; Calcium sulfide; Energy storage materials; Strontium sulfide; Sulfurization; Crystal growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027146923

The photochemical valence isomerization of pendant norbornadiene (NBD) to the quadricyclane (QC) moiety proceeded smoothly in the film state or polymer solution upon irradiation by sunlight or high-pressure mercury lamp. The rate of isomerization was strongly affected by the substituent of [(p-substituted phenyl)carbamoyl]-2,5-norbornadiene-2-carboxylate moiety in the polymers. Especially, the polymer containing a pendant 3-[(p-acetylphenyl)carbamoyl]-2,5-norbornadiene-2-carboxylate moiety showed higher photochemical reactivity than the other NBD polymers. Furthermore, it was found that the rate of photochemical reaction in the polymer solution was much higher than that of the corresponding model compounds. On the other hand, the resulting QC groups in the polymer film scarcely reverted to the original NBD without any catalyst if it were kept in dark at room temperature for a long time and showed excellent storage stability. However, the reversion proceeded smoothly when (5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine)cobalt(II) (Co-TPP) was added to the polymer solution as a catalyst.

Thus, in the presence of the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU or in the dark, H2O2 production does not take place. In cells permeabilized with lysozyme, the addition of ionophores, which is expected to increase the electron flow, produces only a small increase to initial velocity of hydrogen peroxide production. On the other hand, in nonpermeabilized cells, the addition of superoxide dismutase increases the initial velocity of hydrogen peroxide production, but the net amount accumulated by the system is very low because of posterior decomposition. Preincubation of cells with azide, which inhibits the catalase, prevents the decomposition, thereby increasing drastically the amount of hydrogen peroxide accumulated by the system after a few hours. Hence, H2O2 production appears to be limited mainly because of decomposition by catalase activity rather than by the photosynthetic electron flow rate or the diffusion of products through the cell wall. The net production of hydrogen peroxide by the system was enhanced severalfold by treatment with azide. If one takes into account the use of hydrogen peroxide as fuel due to the large amount of energy released in its dismutation, the photosystem can be a useful tool in the storage of solar energy.

Insulin resistance manifested as impaired activation of glycogen synthase and thereby storage of glucose as glycogen in skeletal muscle is demonstrable early on in NIDDM relatives, suggesting that NIDDM could be an inherited muscle disease. On the other hand, insulin deficiency is almost unequivocally present before manifest diabetes develops. An Intensive search for candidate genes for NIDDM has been initiated; so far it has not been possible to ascribe NIDDM to any alterations in the human genome. Given the heterogenous nature of NIDDM, its age-dependent penetrance and strong influence of environmental factors, it may not be fruitful to use NIDDM as an end-point in genetic linkage or association studies. It is more likely that DNA defects result in either insulin resistance or insulin deficiency, which in turn, can both lead to NIDDM. In accordance with the thrifty gene hypothesis, the insulin resistance gene has protected individuals during long periods of starving by storing energy as fat rather than as glycogen in muscle. The abundance of food in Western society has made this once protective gene a deleterious one, suggesting that these individuals are not equipped with the metabolic machinery to handle overeating. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","Genes; Glycogen synthase; Insulin; Muscle; NIDDM","amylin; glucose; glycogen; glycogen synthase; insulin; age; environmental factor; gene; genetic linkage; genome; glucose metabolism; glycogen muscle level; heredity; insulin deficiency; insulin resistance; lipid storage; muscle disease; muscle metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathogenesis; priority journal; short survey; skeletal muscle; Amyloid; Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent; Female; Glucose; Human; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Muscles; Prognosis; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027096266

Foraging selectivity is influenced by proboscis length; because the proboscis of P. sennae is c 1 cm longer than that of A. vanillae, it is able to forage at long-corolla flowers (three Ipomoea spp.) inaccessible to A. vanillae. Relative to other nectar sources exploited by the two species, these Ipomoea species are highly rewarding energetically. Phoebis sennae increases its energy intake relative to A. vanillae by exercising greater discrimination between high- and low-reward nectar sources, avoiding several species with small nectar volumes that are avidly visited by A. vanillae. Consequently, the average foraging profit of P. sennae is nearly four times that of A. vanillae. These differences in foraging selectivity and energy intake are closely related to energy storage and depletion rates, measured as age-related changes in gross lipid contents of adult butterflies. Adult activities in the less selective species, A. vanillae, are fueled to a greater degree with lipid reserves set aside at metamorphosis; A. vanillae emerge from pupae with 13-16% of dry mass allocated to lipids, and these lipid stores decline at a variable rate throughout adult life. In P. sennae lipid accumulated from adult feeding provides the larges proportion of energy stores. P. sennae emerge from the pupa with only 6% of the dry mass allocated to lipids, and accumulate lipid stores to levels as high as 40% of dry mass through most of adult life, depleting these lipid reserves only in late adulthood. Further, A. vanillae show significant sexual dimorphism in lipid content throughout life, with females containing greater quantities; P. sennae show no such dimorphism. -from Author",,"butterfly; energetics; food selection; foraging; nectarivory; Agraulis vanillae; Agraulis vanillae; Corolla; Insecta; Ipomoea; Ipomoea; Nymphalidae; Nymphalidae; Papilionoidea; Phoebis sennae; Phoebis sennae; Pieridae; Pieridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027085114

The model assumes that an animal scattering food caches for later use behaves in a manner that maximizes the rate at which it stores recoverable (surviving) food in its habitat. It is shown theoretically that under some conditions it is better not to cache all available food but instead to move on in search of other food sources. This ‘source-departure decision’ for scatterhoarders is analogous to the patch-departure decision for animals that forage among food patches. It is shown that whether, and at what point, a ‘moving-on threshold’ is reached should depend on the size of the source, the strength of density-dependent cache theft, and the abundance of sources in the habitat. A field experiment was performed to test the qualitative prediction that gray jays, Perisoreus canadensis, should not persist as long in caching food when a day-long opportunity for caching is restricted to a single source (single-source treatment) as when such an opportunity is divided among a series of disjunct sources (multiple-source treatment). In the single-source treatment, jays tended to cache at lower overall rates, transport food items to more distant cache sites, and spend less time caching. These tendencies became more pronounced later in the day. However, although the rate of caching approached zero in the single-source treatment, the jays did not completely cease caching. This apparent violation of the model is attributed to the behaviour of recaching, a facet of gray jay scatterhoarding behaviour that was not built into the model. This retrieval and redistribution of previous caches resulted in the stabilization of the density of caches near the source. In addition, this switch from single- to multiple-load caching trips arguably would make it economical for gray jays to continue to make caching trips from a source beyond the source-departure point predicted by the model. Our theoretical and empirical results begin to show how scatterhoarders may behave in a manner that maximizes the long-term average rate of storage of recoverable food energy throughout their habitat. © 1992, Brill.

This paper reports the first extended set of winter‐spring‐time energy balance measurements for a city. The study was conducted in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, from January to June 1987. It included hourly measurements of net all‐wave radiation, sensible heat flux and the Bowen ratio. The anthropogenic and storage heat fluxes were modelled. A dynamic source area model was employed to ensure the modelled parameters were consistent spatially with the measured turbulent fluxes. The winter‐spring urban energy balances observed in this study are different to those reported for summertime conditions at the same site. The fluxes for the entire period are not symmetrical about solar noon. Hence earlier interpretations possibly should be modified. Apart from this feature the spring season balances are similar to those reported for the summertime in terms of relative importance of individual fluxes. The wintertime energy balance appears to be different to that of spring and summer. The most noticeable feature is the increased importance of the latent heat flux, which on average is the largest output flux in the balance. A secondary, more expected feature, is the increased importance of anthropogenic heat flux as an input in winter.

The criterion of acceptance was taken as the USA 3-A Standard, which limits the temperature rise to less than 1·67°C (3°F) over an 18-h storage period. An equation was developed to calculate the thermal energy input from sunlight into a silo, and the thermal energies at different times of the day and at different times of the year are presented. The solar heat input was combined with convective heat loads, assuming New Zealand summer ambient conditions. A greater than acceptable temperature rise occurred with a single skin silo. The insulated silo easily met the 3-A Standard, as did a silo with cladding but no insulation. In the light of this analysis, consideration should be given to installing silos with a double skin construction, i.e. cladding but no insulation, in New Zealand. © 1992.",,"Climatology; Dairy products; Heat transfer; Solar radiation; Standards; Thermal insulation; Acceptance criteria; Convective heat loads; Milk products; New Zealand; Sunlight; Thermal energy input; Silos (agricultural)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027083764

Forty-four young pigs were assigned at 12 kg live weight for 6 weeks either to an initial slaughter group (n 8) or to one of the nine feeding treatments (n 4); three allowances of a high-protein food with 355 g crude protein (nitrogen × 6 25; CP)/kg (P1, P2, P3) at three levels of feeding (L, M and H). Each feeding level was met by supplementing the allowance of feed P with the appropriate amount of starch and each treatment had two males and two females. The rate of protein deposition was not affected by feeding level at the two lowest allowances of basal feed P (P1 and P2), but it increased with increasing the feeding level for the pigs on treatment P3. Males deposited more protein than females, but this effect was more pronounced with treatment P3. The rate of lipid deposition increased with each increase in the level of feeding and decreased with increasing the allowance of feed P. The calculated efficiency of protein utilization (ep) was expressed as a function of the energy:protein ratio in the feed (MJ metabolizable energy/kg digestible CP). The best model to describe the relationship was a linear-plateau model, with the maximum value for epof 0.814 at 73 MJ/kg. This relationship provided the basis of a model that could predict the response of a growing pig to its diet as rates of protein and lipid retention. © 1992, The Nutrition Society.

In rat hearts as well as in human cardiac tissue, ischemia induces norepinephrine (NE) release, which results in micromolar catecholamine concentrations in the interstitial space of the ischemic myocardium. It has been found that local metabolic, rather than centrally evoked NE release, plays the crucial role in excess adrenergic activation of the ischemic myocardium. NE release in ischemia is nonexocytotic and has been characterized as a two-step process, (a) Induced by energy deficiency, NE escapes from its storage vesicles and accumulates in the axoplasm. (b) NE is transported across the plasma membrane into the extracellular space via the neuronal NE carrier (uptake1), which has reversed its normal transport direction because of increased intracellular sodium concentration. NE release induced by ischemia is independent of the presence of calcium in the extracellular space and is not altered by blockade of N-type (neuronal) calcium channels. Furthermore, modulation of protein kinase C does not interfere with NE liberation in the ischemic myocardium. This independence of extracellular calcium, calcium entry into the neuron, and protein kinase C activity is in contrast to the strong calcium dependence of exocytotic transmitter release, which is found under physiological conditions. On the basis of these findings, it was unexpected that calcium antagonists such as gallopamil, verapamil, diltiazem, felodipine, and nifedipine suppress ischemia-induced NE release. The most potent effect was found for gallopamil with a concentration of 50% inhibition (IC50) of 300 nmol/L. Suppression of NE release by these organic calcium antagonists was completely independent of extracellular calcium, revealing a drug action that is different from blockade of calcium channels. It has been demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of calcium antagonists on NE release are due to an interaction with transmembrane transport of NE. Suppression of NE release is a potential cause of the potent antifibrillatory action of calcium antagonists during experimental myocardial ischemia. It is concluded, that inhibition of local metabolic NE release may contribute to the protective actions of calcium antagonists in myocardial ischemia. © 1992 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.","Calcium antagonism; Exocytosis; Myocardial ischemia; Norepinephrine release","diltiazem; felodipine; gallopamil; nifedipine; protein kinase c; verapamil; adrenergic stimulation; animal tissue; calcium antagonism; calcium transport; cell membrane transport; conference paper; controlled study; drug mechanism; drug potency; electrocardiogram; enzyme activity; exocytosis; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; heart protection; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; human tissue; nonhuman; noradrenalin release; priority journal; Animal; Calcium Channel Blockers; Human; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Norepinephrine; Ventricular Fibrillation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027070372

Thus, body fat is not clearly related to nutritional condition in the field, except that starved animals have low fat reserves at death (<3% of wet body mass). High body fat in the laboratory can be accounted for by higher digestibility of energy in laboratory diets and lower levels of activity in cages. -from Authors",,"brown lemming; fat storage; lemming; nutrition; Lemmus sibiricus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027068881

Actinides resident in the fuel pins as a result of their use in reactor cores constitute a significant component of this hazard. Recently, the Department of Energy has initiated an Actinide Recycle Program to study the feasibility of using pyrochemical (molten salt) processes to recover actinides from the spent fuel assemblies of commercial reactors. This project concerns the application of robotics technology to the operation and maintenance functions of a plant whose objective is to recover actinides from spent fuel assemblies, and to dispose of the resulting hardware and chemical components from this process. Such a procedure involves a number of safety and human factors issues. The purpose of the project is to explore the use of robotics and artificial intelligence to facilitate accomplishment of the program goals while maintaining the safety of the humans doing the work and the integrity of the environment. This project will result in a graphic simulation on a Silicon Graphics workstation as a proof of principle demonstration of the feasibility of using robotics along with an intelligent operator interface.

Air can be stored in underground rock caverns, caverns in salt domes, or in aquifers. Victoria has no salt domes, but has aquifers onshore in the Gippsland Basin with geological dome structures of suitable depth, discovery pressure, porosity, permeability and caprock for CAES development. The most suitable aquifer is near Seaspray, where several dome structures exist. Computer simulation of injection and extraction of air from the aquifer indicated the largest aquifer structure had the capacity to sustain a 300MW station.

The model is constructed on the basis of a survey of the pertinent literature concerning the social behavior and ecology of ungulates. The use of the optimization model relies on the idea that natural selection shapes the policy of choice of herd sizes in the sense that the animals tend to maximize their individual ""fitness."" The model concerns animals that perform a daily selection of herd size during a period of N days, the Nth day corresponding to the beginning of the reproductive season. We assume that the herdmates share the food in the patch and that the per-individual mortality rate (due to predation) is a decreasing function of herd size. Further constraints are introduced for minimal and maximal levels of energy storage. We consider three different optimization strategies based on maximizing (i) the final energy level EN′ (ii) the final survival probability PN′ and (iii) their product ENPN. Strategy (iii) is the most relevant since it corresponds to maximizing the effective expected reproductive fitness (i.e., the expected number of offspring). We present explicit solutions for the three problems of optimization and we examine the optimal policies in relation to predation pressure and to food distribution patterns. Finally we present a comparison of our theoretical predictions with the biological evidence. There appears to be good qualitative agreement. © 1992.",,"fitness; herd size; natural selection; socioecology; ungulate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027060271

Direct measurements of net all-wave radiation and the turbulent sensible heat flux were conducted from a 28 m tower located about 4 km from the city centre. Heat storage in the urban fabric was parameterized and the turbulent latent heat flux was found by the residual in the energy balance equation. Most of the data were gathered in the dry season from February to the end of March 1985. The results from this tropical highland city resemble those from temperate cities in respect of the magnitude of the Bowen ratio and the diurnal trend in the amount of the net radiation partitioned into turbulent sensible heat. On the other hand, the role of heat storage is much larger than in the temperate case so that the partitioning of the sensible heat between turbulent and conductive transfer seems to be more nearly equal. Nevertheless evaporation appears to be an important term in both the surface water and energy balances. The nature of the energy balance may help explain some of the previously observed features of the heat island and humidity regimes of Mexico City. © 1992.","Mexico City; observations; Surface energy balance; urban climate","Atmospheric humidity; Heat conduction; Heat radiation; Heat storage; Interfacial energy; Mathematical models; Solar radiation; Temperature measurement; Tropics; Turbulent flow; Mexico City; Net all wave radiation; Surface energy balance observations; Turbulent sensible heat flux; Urban climate; Climatology; surface water; article; circadian rhythm; city; energy transfer; evaporation; heat exchange; mexico; radiation energy; season; tropic climate; energy balance; surface; urban climate; Mexico, Mexico City",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027060228

The present study examined the changes in nutrient composition taking place during yellowing of rice, and the effects of feeding rats and broiler chicks on a moderately yellow rice at 600 g/kg diet. Nitrogen content was found to be higher in rice grains that had become more yellow, only part of the increase being in non-protein-N; however, relative to crude protein (N x 6.25) the concentrations of lysine, methionine, cystine and arginine were lower. There were no significant differences between white and yellow rice in the food intake, weight gain and efficiency of food utilization (EFU) of rats and chicks when diets were formulated to contain similar nutrient concentrations, or the same basal ingredient composition. Diet pelleting increased food intake and weight gain in both animal species, but reduced dry matter and energy digestibility in rats; effects on nutrient retention in chicks were largely non-significant. Liver weights of rats and chicks and pancreas weights of chicks were unaffected by yellow rice; however, chicks fed on mash had a larger pancreas on average than those fed on pellets. Thus, whilst the nutrient composition of rice is altered during yellowing, a moderately yellow rice is unlikely to produce major adverse effects when fed to rats and broiler chicks. © 1992, The Nutrition Society.

The use of a symmetric conjugate gradient solver for both the flow and transport matrices results in a high degree of computational efficiency. Three‐dimensional deformable block elements are used to allow the model to conform to domains with irregular geometry. The thermal transport model is validated against the results of the Borden thermal injection field experiment presented in the companion paper. The model simulations provide an excellent match with the observed temperature distribution over time, with the effects of thermal buoyancy and losses across the ground surface accurately reproduced by the model.

These techniques allowed direct observations of structure and bonding environments at the calcite surface. The results indicate that the main processes involved in cadmium uptake by calcite are adsorption and solid-state diffusion into the crystal, which leads eventually to the formation of solid-solution. Pure calcite crystals were cleaved from precleaned Iceland spar and were briefly exposed to aqueous solutions containing various concentrations of Cd2+, CO32-, ClO4-, and/or Cl-. Some Cd2+ was radiolabelled. LEED results demonstrate that the calcite surface is atomically ordered, even after hydration and cadmium uptake. γ-scintillation data from crystals exposed briefly to solutions of 109Cd2+ indicate that surface uptake ranged from the equivalent of about 1 to 4 monolayers. XPS analyses in the first 2 hours after exposure detected Cd within the top 30 Å, but crystals stored in air or in ultra-high vacuum showed a decrease in Cd surface concentration with time such that after two days, Cd was barely detectable in the near-surface region. In other experiments, LEED verified the crystallinity of otavite (CdCO3) grown epitaxially over the {101} cleavage faces of calcite, and XPS showed almost no Ca in the near-surface on scans taken immediately after precipitation; but after storage for a month in ultrahigh vacuum, binding energy shifts and the presence of a Ca peak strongly suggested the development of solid-solution by diffusion through the solid. No Cd enrichment was observed at sites of surface defects using AES, indicating that solid-state diffusion into the mineral surface was not accomplished simply by migration along microfractures alone. This work suggests that solid-state diffusion may play a role in the rate and extent of uptake of certain trace metals from solution and probably leads to the formation of solid-solution in calcite and other carbonate minerals. It also suggests that the process of diffusion into the solid mineral host should be considered in hydrogeochemical models that intend to simulate and predict trace-metal mobility in carbonate terrains. © 1992.",,"cadmium; calcite; carbonate; diffusion; Iceland spar; trace metal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027047467

Some 98 taxa were found, with the nine most abundant species comprising >80% of total macrofauna. A two-factor principal component model, which explained 65.7% of the total variation within the data set, revealed a strong interaction among plant biomass vlaues, faunal parameters and time of year, as well as an inverse relationship between aerial and below-ground plant components, reflecting storage and growth events. Variation in total numbers of species and densities of the epifaunal Parhyalella whelpleyi(Amphipoda) and Bittium varium (Gastropoda), and the infaunal Lucina pectinata (Bivalvia) was not significantly related to the various plant biomass measures, suggesting that other processes may be involved in the regulation of local species richness. Total infaunal numbers, and densities of the infaunal dominants, Isolda pulchella and Nereis oligohalina (Polychaeta), were significantly predicted by live below-ground biomass expressed as dry weight, but not as ash-free dry weight. This indicates that plant material is primarily used as a refuge or physical support to tubes, rather than as a food source. Total epifaunal and Littorina flava (Gastropoda) numbers were negatively correlated to live above-ground plant biomass. Infaunal abundance is apparently strongly affected by below ground Spartina biomass. Unexpectedly, higher aerial plant biomass did not bear higher epifaunal or infaunal numbers; such relationships would be better expressed by negative linear interactions or nonlinear models.

Instead, validation is interpreted here as a series of activities, including both theoretical and experimental tests, designed to enhance our confidence in the capability of a proposed model to describe some aspect of reality. We examine the validation process applied to a project concerned with heat and fluid transport in porous media, in which mathematical modeling, simulation, and results of field experiments are evaluated in order to determine the feasibility of a system for seasonal thermal energy storage in shallow unsaturated soils. Technical details of the field experiments are not included, but appear in previous publications. Validation activities are divided into three stages. The first stage, carried out prior to the field experiments, is concerned with modeling the relevant physical processes, optimization of the heat-exchanger configuration and the shape of the storage volume, and multi-year simulation. Subjects requiring further theoretical and experimental study are identified at this stage. The second stage encompasses the planning and evaluation of the initial field experiment. Simulations are made to determine the experimental time scale and optimal sensor locations. Soil thermal parameters and temperature boundary conditions are estimated using an inverse method. Then results of the experiment are compared with model predictions using different parameter values and modeling approximations. In the third stage, results of an experiment performed under different boundary conditions are compared to predictions made by the models developed in the second stage. Various aspects of this theoretical and experimental field study are described as examples of the verification and validation procedure. There is no attempt to validate a specific model, but several models of increasing complexity are compared with experimental results. The outcome is interpreted as a demonstration of the paradigm proposed by van der Heijde,26 that different constituencies have different objectives for the validation process and therefore their acceptance criteria differ also. © 1992.","environment; seasonal heat storage; unsaturated zone; validation","Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Porous materials; Design procedures; Field experiments; Performance modeling; Unsaturated zone; Validation methods; Groundwater flow; groundwater flow; heat storage; heat transport; model validation; unsaturated zone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027042990

The model assumes that such an animal behaves in a manner that maximizes the rate at which recoverable (surviving) food energy is stored. One application of this model concerns how a scatterhoarder should respond when it encounters a food source in the same location as a previously exploited one. Such spatial overlap of food sources through time may be a common occurrence for animals such as Perisoreus canadensis which store thousands of food items throughout their territory during the summer months for use during winter. The model predicts that gray jays should space their caches more widely during subsequent encounters with a source at a given location. Consequently, they should take longer to cache a given number of food items and, because fewer of these caches will survive, the number of recoverable caches made per unit of time spent caching should be reduced. As predicted, jays in the field compensated for the local density of extant caches by transporting food items further from the source during second encounters with a source in a given location. Jays, at least for the conditions of this experiment, are not forced by a memory constraint to behave in some standard fashion when they encounter a point food source. Scatterhoarders, by flexibly adjusting their behaviour in response to previously made caches, may approach the maximal rate of storage of recoverable food throughout their territory over the long term. -from Authors",,"cache; grey jay; jay; scatter hoarding; Perisoreus canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027037592

The Index of Biotic Integrity demonstrated that species richness and composition were much lower in the contaminated river with an obvious imbalance in the trophic structure of the fish community. Biomolecular and biochemical responses such as DNA damage and elevated activity of detoxification enzymes indicated that fish in the contaminated river had been exposed to toxicants. The status of various condition indices such as the liver and visceral somatic indices suggested metabolic and nutritional imbalances in sunfish as a result of exposure to pulp mill effluents. Fish populations in the contaminated river also demonstrated an abnormal size distribution and age structure. Female redbreast sunfish from the BKME-impacted river contained a large number of atretic oocytes and had lower serum levels of estradiol than fish from the reference site. These observations plus data from previous developmental toxicity studies suggest that the primary mechanism by which BKME may affect fish populations in this river is through reproductive dysfunction and recruitment failure. Decreased recruitment may have caused a reduction in population size and resulted in decreased competition and increased resource availability. With increased food and habitat availability, more energy may have been available for growth and lipid storage of survivors in the contaminated river. © 1992.",,"estradiol; industrial effluent; age; animal tissue; article; body size; comparative study; controlled study; dna damage; ecology; effluent; estradiol blood level; female; fish; health; liver; male; metabolic balance; nonhuman; nutritional health; oocyte; population dynamics; population exposure; pulp mill; reproductive toxicity; viscera; water contamination; Animal; Comparative Study; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; DNA; DNA Damage; Female; Fishes; Fresh Water; Industrial Waste; Liver; Male; Oxidoreductases; Paper; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Animalia; Lepomis auritus; bleached kraft mill effluent; fish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027037539

During active upwelling, zooplankton biomass increased significantly, the maximum over the shelf being constituted almost entirely of developmental stages of herbivorous copepods.

Occasionally a change of routine may cause the hot product to be packed before it has cooled to an appreciable extent. The risk is that spontaneous ignition may then take place in the packaged material. We analyse this type of problem numerically, with particular regard to the critical stacking temperature, Ti,c, of cubes of material. We investigate its dependence both on the external ambient temperature and on the size of the packaging. The numerical calculations to solve the spatial and time dependent energy conservation equation with conductive heat transport using the finite difference method required a three dimensional grid, set up as 203 mesh points. The numerical tests were performed using parameters relevant to the exothermic reaction in cellulosic material. The initial condition was posed as a spatially-uniform, excess temperature within each packing case. This contribution differs from previous studies since, commonly, the analytical methods used refer to the critical, initial temperature excess, δTi,c, within the reactant in dimensionless terms (through the Frank-Kamenetskii parameters ψ and σ) in only one-dimensional geometries.

As a result of a growing tourist industry, the need for desalination capacity is steadily growing. However, the cost of seawater desalination is high. Optimizing and planning of seawater desalination capacity can reduce total costs for drinking water. Studies have been conducted for Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. Co-generation systems for the combined production of electricity and water are in use on these islands. It is shown that the optimum size of evaporation (MSF, MED or VC) desalination units can be calculated in relation to the maximum required production capacity and storage capacity. Once the optimum combination of unit size and storage capacity is known, planning of extensions in production capacity can be calculated based on the forecast of water demand, available storage capacity and maintenance or breakdown periods. There is no optimum unit size for reverse osmosis (RO), the alternative desalination process. Because of its modular concept, extension with RO can be planned in any desired capacity. RO is shown to be a more economical system compared to evaporation desalination. Future extensions by RO therefore will further reduce costs for seawater desalination. The low-temperature MED process is shown to be economic in comparison with both MSF and RO in case of high energy costs and/or long expected lifetimes and a low rate of interest. © 1992.","Aruba; Bonaire; cost; Curaçao; MED; MSF; planning; RO; storage.; unit size","Cogeneration plants; Costs; Optimization; Regional planning; Reverse osmosis; Seawater; Water supply; Water treatment plants; Aruba; Bonaire; Curacao; Drinking water; Unit size; Desalination; Desalination; Optimization; Sea Water; Water Supply; desalination; evaporation; optimizing; planning; reverse osmosis; Caribbean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027009169

From the viewpoint of conversion, in the active geothermal field which can be used as a case study, the S-to-I conversion occurs in different ranges of present day temperature from drill hole to drill hole, which is related to the thermal history of the field up to two or three discrete illite/smectite (I/S) phases having different percents of illite layers (%I) coexist metastably at intermediate stages of the conversion. This is particularly visible in drill holes where the conversion occurs at high temperatures. The S-to-I conversion from a fossil geothermal field suggests that the greater the thermal gradient, the more the smectite illitization is facilitated. By having the average rate of entire S-to-I conversion, which was calculated from the data of K-Ar and % I in I/S, the activation energy required to complete the S-to-I conversion was estimated to be approximately 30 ± 5 kcal/mol in natural hydrothermal systems, where the S-to-I conversion was assumed as a first order reaction and the pre-exponential factor is the same as Eberl and Hower (1976). The estimated value is close to those deduced previously from laboratory experiments. This suggests that the experiments made by using specific geologic materials and conditions may be applicable to evaluate the kinetics of S-to-I conversion in hydrothermal systems from the viewpoint of an empirical equation. Nevertheless, since the S-to-I conversion in natural hydrothermal systems is in fact controlled by mechanisms of smectite dissolution and recrystallization of illite, it will be necessary in the future to construct the real reaction kinetics based on a proven mechanism. © 1992.",,"hydrothermal system; radioactive waste storage; reaction mechanism; reaction rate; smectite/illite conversion; Chemical Reactions - Reaction Kinetics; Clay Minerals - Crystallization; Clay Minerals - Dissolution; Hydrothermal Systems; Smectite to Illite Conversion; Clay Minerals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027007846

Part of the work has involved characterising microbial populations and their influence on the various processes being studied. Core material and groundwaters have been sampled for microbiological content at various depths from boreholes at the Osamu Utsumi open pit uranium mine and Morro do Ferro Th/REE ore body. Microbes were found in all samples, but numbers do not appear to show any clear trend as a function of depth. Analyses of groundwaters gave higher numbers than with solid material, probably because of sampling methods, and demonstrated the presence of sulphur cycle bacteria. These observations have been compared with predictions of a model used in performance assessment to calculate the maximum biomass/microbial activity based on constraints set by available nutrients and energy. The main conclusions of this analysis are: 1. (i) Low microbial activities can be supported by the energy and nutrients supplied by rock alteration processes (weathering) at or around the redox front. The maximum annual production of 0.01-0.1 g biomass (dry)/m2 of redox front is in reasonable agreement with observed standing populations. 2. (ii) The presence of high concentrations of sulphate reducing bacteria around the redox front is compatible with other evidence for a complex sulphur geochemistry which may be predominantly microbially catalysed and could explain the nodular form of pitchblende concretions and the presence of secondary pyrite. 3. (iii) There is little evidence of trace element mobilisation by organic byproducts and the main role of microbes in this system seems to be catalysis of specific redox reactions. © 1992.",,"microbial activity; natural analogue; radioactive waste storage; Brazil, Minas Gerais, Pocos de Caldas; Catalysis; Groundwater; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Radioactive elements; Redox reactions; Reduction; Sulfur compounds; Thorium deposits; Uranium mines; Water bacteriology; Chemolithotrophic organisms; Groundwater microbiology; Microbial populations; Microbially catalyzed redox reactions; Pitchblende nodules; Radioactive ore bodies; Solid material microbiology; Sulfate-reducing bacteria; Geochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027007416

Chemical and isotopic alteration models were combined with finite difference models of the convective cooling of caldera intrusives. The modeling indicates that the intense chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical alteration of the Osamu Utsumi breccia pipe requires the circulation of &gt; 105 kg/cm2 of boiling hydrothermal fluid &gt; 200°C through each square centimeter cross-section of the pipe. This circulation could be driven by heat from a 6 km diameter intrusive extending to 10 km depth. Even with this large amount of circulation concentrated in the permeable breccia pipe, uranium solubilities must be 2 1 2 orders of magnitude greater than indicated in the most recent experiments (and more in line with previous estimates) to produce the primary uranium mineralization at the Osamu Utsumi mine. The same models applied to a hypothetical high temperature waste repository show that heat from radioactive decay will produce a hydrothermal circulation system remarkably similar to that studied at the natural analogue site at Poços de Caldas. The depth of fluid convection induced by the hypothetical repository would be 5 to 10 km, the maximum temperature would be ∼ 300°C, the lifetime of the high temperature phase would be a few thousand years, and boiling would occur and cause most of the alteration within the hypothetical waste repository. This physical analysis emphasizes the importance of permeability on a 10 × 10 × 10 km scale in controlling the potential amount of circulation through the hypothetical repository. Application of the chemical models successfully used to interpret mineralization and alteration at the Poços de Caldas Osamu Utsumi mine to the hypothetical waste repository shows that even in a worst case scenario (waste implaced in a permeable host rock with no measures taken to inhibit flow though the repository) the amount of hydrothermal alteration in the hypothetical repository will be ∼ 0.1% of that in the breccia pipe at Osamu Utsumi. Assuming no barriers to uranium mobility, uranium precipitation above the hypothetical repository would be 0.04 ppm (rather than 40 ppm), hydrothermal alteration 0.03 wt% (rather than 30 wt%), etc. Our analysis indicates that modeled mineralogical alteration is sensitive to the thermodynamic data base used. Prediction of mineralogical alteration (which may be necessary to predict the migration of radionuclides other than uranium, for example) probably cannot be based directly on even very carefully collected laboratory thermodynamic data. Mineralogical complexities of the system, as well as data base uncertainties will require calibration of the thermodynamic framework against mineralogical alteration observed in the laboratory or field. © 1992.",,"Boiling liquids; Finite difference method; Geochemistry; Geological repositories; Geothermal energy; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Radioactive elements; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioisotopes; Volcanic rocks; Alkaline volcanic rocks; Boiling hydrothermal fluids; Chemical alteration models; Isotopic alteration models; Natural radioactive sites; Near-field radionuclide migration; Permeable breccia pipes; Radioactive ore bodies; Radioactive waste repository analogs; Uranium ore deposition; Uranium mines; goechemical model; hydrothermal alteration; mineralization; radioactive waste storage; uranium; Brazil, Minas Gerais, Pocos de Caldas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027007411

The exercise consisted of treadmill running at 30 m · min-1, on a 10° incline, for 60 min, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks prior to pregnancy, which continued until day 19 of gestation. In mature animals, chronic exercise increased (p &lt; 0.05) liver glycogen concentration in both pregnant and nonpregnant rats. In pregnant exercised animals, the glycogen concentration of the maternal liver increased almost twofold (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the sedentary pregnant group. There was no difference in the amount of glycogen stored in the gastrocnemius or soleus muscles in response to training, pregnancy, or chronic maternal exercise in the mature rat. In the pregnant groups, there were fewer (p &lt; 0.05) viable fetuses and more (p &lt; 0.05) resorption sites than in young rats. In addition, exercise during pregnancy in the mature animal decreased (p &lt; 0.05) fetal body weight.

This conflict seems to favour the maternal system, as evidenced by the enhanced maternal liver glycogen storage and the negative effect on fetal growth.","age; exercise; glycogen storage patterns; pregnancy","glycogen; adolescent; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; exercise; female; fetus; fetus development; metabolism; newborn; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026985755

In order to enable reversible chemical reaction, a measurement apparatus and method have been developed in this study. The apparatus consists of a reaction chamber and a steam chest. Measurands which become the target of the measurement are confined to temperature, vacuum pressure and mass. All measurands can be detected electrically by using a thermocouple, a differential pressure gage and a strain meter, and the automatic measurement by using a microcomputer is possible at real time. The pressure gage is independent of humidity in a measuring atmosphere. Furthermore, in mass measurement under vacuum conditions, the effect of fluctuations in temperature or pressure is removed by using the principle of parallel springs. Consequently, the measurement system is confirmed to be useful for measuring fundamental characteristics of chemical heat storage using CaCl2. © 1992, The Japan Society for Precision Engineering.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients with McArdle's disease and five patients with mitochondrial myopathies performed the same incremental maximal exercise test. Their respiratory gas exchanges and the variation of the venous blood metabolites--lactate (LACT), pyruvate (PYR), alanine (ALA), ammonia (NH3)--were studied in comparison with the results of fourteen control subjects who performed the same test. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the two groups of patients displayed a similar significant decrease of their maximal VO2. In McArdle's patients the limitation of the maximal oxygen consumption was associated with a low respiratory exchange ratio (RER), a high VE/VO2, and characteristic metabolic data: no rise of LACT and PYR, a decrease of ALA and an important rise of NH3. In mitochondrial myopathies low VO2 max were due to a leftwards shift, i.e. towards low powers of exercise, of LACT, PYR, NH3 and ALA values. However the pattern of increase of LACT, PYR and NH3, exponential, and of ALA, linear, as well as respiratory exchange ratios were similar to control values. In this case, the limitation of oxygen consumption was due to a lack of the usual substrate, pyruvate. Low respiratory exchange ratio demonstrated that the muscle metabolism had a tendency to shift to lipid oxidation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that patients with McArdle's disease may improve their muscle energy production by endurance training which enhances lipid metabolism, whereas in mitochondrial myopathies, the energy production by oxidation of pyruvate or lipids may be improved only by enzymatic substitution.",,"alanine; ammonia; lactic acid; lactic acid derivative; pyruvic acid; pyruvic acid derivative; adult; article; blood; comparative study; energy metabolism; exercise test; exercise tolerance; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; lung gas exchange; male; metabolism; mitochondrial myopathy; muscle; muscle contraction; oxygen consumption; pathophysiology; physiology; Adult; Alanine; Ammonia; Energy Metabolism; Exercise Test; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease Type V; Humans; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Male; Mitochondrial Myopathies; Muscle Contraction; Muscles; Oxygen Consumption; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Pyruvates; Pyruvic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026957474

The magnitude of the stabilization value, relative to the overall value of energy storage, is evaluated in terms of a simple model that accounts for the relevant characteristics of the electric power utility's production mix.

The absorption of solar radiation by the transparent insulation is taken into account by considering the wavelength dependent extinction coefficients for five wavelength regions of the solar spectrum.

First, on the basis of a separation between the rigid displacement and the deformation, the relevant kinematic relationships are derived. A standard assumed‐mode approach is used to describe the deformation displacement field by a linear combination of known functions. Then, the computation of the kinetic energy leads to the definition of a set of tensors, which are configuration‐independent (like the mass matrix in a linear setting) and fully characterize the body non‐linear dynamic behaviour introduced by large rotation. A computer code has been developed, in order to extend an existing FE package, for the computation of these tensors. Details of the technique, including storage requirements and suggestions for model reduction, are given. Finally, two examples are presented: (i) the result of the computation of one of the introduced tensors; (ii) the development of the non‐linear model of a rotating beam.

The corresponding problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program where the prices of energy and spinning capacity are assumed known and where two kinds of constraints are considered: dynamic plant constraints, concerning the operation of several units and including startup costs and minimum up time requirements, and also dynamic reservoir constraints, concerning the operation of the upper and lower reservoirs within specified levels. The consideration of dynamic plant constraints together with dynamic reservoir constraints has never been attempted before. It is an extended problem and its solution is difficult to approach. Approaches based on dynamic programming, Lagrangian duality and network flow programming are analysed in view of the extended problem and their advantages and disadvantages are indicated. To bridge the gap between the application range of the programming techniques to this problem of pumped storage scheduling, approximative assumptions and a new approach are proposed. This approach handles the plant constraints by means of dynamic programming, extracts of water values corresponding to the reservoir constraints from the dual solution of a network flow program, and adjusts the water values based on Lagrangian duality.

It was found that factors such as convection, vibration and non-contacting shock have no effect on the freezing of supercooled water. They seem to be just adding some positive energy to water. On the other hand, collision or rubbing between solids or between a solid and a liquid surface in supercooled water helps the water to freeze.

Almost all the proposed management strategies involve the final disposal of highly concentrated brines evolved from this water. Salt-gradient solar ponds, for thermal and electrical power production, are proposed to accomplish this until a permanent salt-sink is designated. Numerous research papers and reports, based on field testing, have been published. The California Department of Water Resources operated a 0.5-acre solar pond from 1985 to 1989 at its Los Banos Demonstration Desalting Facility. Salt-gradient solar ponds consist, in part, of agricultural drainage water, initially with a salinity of 10,000 milligrams per liter (mg/L), concentrated 30-fold to a concentration of 300,000 mg/L or higher. Many well-established techniques are available to achieve this concentration. Approximately 100 million gallons of drainage water per acre of solar pond are needed. The energy stored in a salt-gradient solar pond can be used to provide the elevated temperatures for the biological selenium removal systems being developed, for the driving force in distillation systems used for pond maintenance, or for electrical power. © 1992.",,"Agricultural runoff; Biological water treatment; Distillation; Drainage; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Groundwater; Biological selenium removal system; Concentrated subsurface agricultural drainage waters; Salt gradient solar ponds; San Joaquin Valley, California; Solar ponds; California, USA; Drainage; Effluent Treatment; Irrigation; Salinity; Solar Ponds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026933753

It is a process in which sulphuric acid is decomposed to a gaseous mixture consisting of water, sulphur dioxide and oxygen, using high temperature thermal energy, oxygen as a vector and mostly adiabatic equipment. Parts of the basic process with excessive exergy losses have been identified and a modified flow sheet has been developed and analyzed from thermodynamic and engineering points of view. Thermodynamic analysis of the modified flow sheet indicates that the overall exergetic efficiency of the decomposition process is 79.86%, which represents an improvement of 14.17% over the basic process. Engineering analysis of a plant producing 106 mol of SO2 per hour shows that the typical levelized cost of chemical exergy production was $ 2.25/GJ exergy from the basic process and $ 1.79/GJ exergy from the modified process.

Many of these studies have recognized that radial heat transfers, induced by equipment operation, can significantly distort temperature levels recorded inside the sand pack. The fact that the design and operation of combustion tubes have not been standardized, indicates the difficulty of physically eliminating this heat transfer problem. If thermal reservoir simulators are to be reliably calibrated using data from such experiments, these heat transfers must be understood and accounted for in the history matching. A general-purpose numerical model for simulating laboratory combustion experiments is presented that rigorously accounts for the on-off operation of the adiabatic heaters as well as external thermal-energy storage and convective circulations-a deconvolution of the laboratory phenomena. Included in the paper are applications of the model which show that combustion tubes of different diameters, being subjected to the same operating conditions (air injection flux, heater operating strategy, saturations, etc.) can produce significantly different results. Smaller tubes will tend to produce lower combustion front velocities and peak temperatures, and higher fuel loads. These results demonstrate why caution is required when translating laboratory data to field project design. This paper offers considerable insights into the role of heat losses in the combustion process.

The coil is being used as part of an experimental superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) device for power system applications. Special requirements are placed on the detection and protection system of such a coil as rapid energy exchanges are frequent. The detection signal is derived from a combination of the main coil voltage and a search coil voltage. The protection method is by way of an external parallel resistor. The problem of opening a circuit breaker in series with the coil is analyzed. Actual quench recordings are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.

These classifiers are also shown to share similarities with networks of localized receptive fields and with psychological models of concept formation. Next, the performance of some RCE classifiers is examined. The ability of a trained RCE classifier to generalize to new instances is compared with that of several well-known classifiers. Then, four previously unexamined aspects of RCE classifiers are investigated empirically: (1) the influence of potential wells on training rate, (2) the influence of potential wells on storage requirement, (3) the influence of potential wells on generalization to new instances, and (4) rejection of an instance from an unknown class. Modifications of a traditional RCE classifier improve average correct classification at generalization from 83.2 to 90.7% without significant change in computational cost. By comparison, a nearest-neighbor performs at 93% and a feedforward multilayer neural network at 88.4% on the same data. Surprisingly, when the improved RCE network is compared with its underlying adaptive nearest-neighbor component, one finds that the incorporation of potential wells into the RCE classifier does not reduce training time or instance storage requirement, nor does it improve generalization to new instances. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Computability and Decidability; Formal Logic; Neural Networks; Pattern Recognition; Performance; System Theory; Hyperspherical Classifiers; Potential Wells; Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) Classifiers; Equivalence Classes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026924052

Horseshoe Drive, Naples, FL 33942, United States","Extreme seasonal water use variation necessitates the design and construction of some membrane water treatment plants to meet the full peak demand. The full treatment plant capacity is only utilized during a relatively small portion of the year, which is an inefficient way to utilize a membrane treatment facility containing permeators that require replacement in a set number of years regardless of the use rate. If the peak demand occurs only during a few days in a given year, then the demand can be met by increasing storage within the distribution system. However, when the peak demand is based on population variations over a period of several months in a year, such as in South Florida, the system storage cannot provide the necessary volume of water to meet seasonal demand. A cost-effective alternative to a larger membrane treatment plant capacity is aquifer storage and recovery of treated water. The concept of aquifer storage and recovery is quite simply the use of an aquifer as a giant subsurface storage tank. In Collier County, Florida, the population nearly triples during the tourist season occurring between December and April . This seasonal population increase also corresponds to the dry season, when only a small percentage of annual rainfall occurs. During the wet season, June to October, the excess plant capacity will be used to produce treated water that will be injected into a brackish water aquifer lying between 450 and 550 feet below land surface. The injected, treated freshwater displaces the brackish native water occurring in the aquifer. When the full treatment plant capacity is required, injection is discontinued. As demand increases above plant treatment capacity, fresh water is recovered from the aquifer, disinfected and blended with the newly treated water. Aquifer storage and recovery can be a viable method of increasing water treatment efficiency and promoting energy conservation. © 1992.",,"Aquifers; Costs; Efficiency; Membranes; Storage (materials); Wastewater reclamation; Water distribution systems; Water supply; Aquifer storage; Florida; Peak demand; Population variation; Seasonal demand; Treated water recovery; Water treatment plants; Aquifers-Coastal; Membrane Technology; Water Treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026918413

These applications include electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), electrically-heated catalysts (EHCs) for automobiles, utility-power peak-shaving, and others. The advantages of the SBLA over other types of batteries will by significantly higher power density, together with good energy density, high cycle life, high voltage density, low production cost and zero maintenance. In addition, the lead/acid battery represents a technology which is familiar and accepted by Society, is recyclable within the existing infrastructure, and does not raise the safety concerns of many other new batteries (e.g., fire, explosion and toxic gases). This paper briefly reviews the basic design concepts and issues of the SBLA battery technology, various quasi-bipolar approaches and the results of ARA's development work during the past four years. Performance data are given based on both in-house and independent testing of ARA laboratory test batteries. In addition, performance projections and other characteristics are given for three ARA SBLA battery designs, which are compared with other batteries in three example applications: UPS, EHCs, and EVs. The most notable advantages of the SBLA battery are substantial reductions in product size and weight for the UPS, smaller packaging and longer life for the EHC, and higher vehicle performance and lower cost for the EV, compared to both existing and advanced EV batteries. © 1992.",,"Electric vehicles; Emergency lighting; Standby power service; Storage battery vehicles; Bipolar lead/acid batteries; Cycle life; Peak shaving; Power density; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026914948

The Booster Ring magnet power supply system based on resonant circuits, coupled with distributed energy make-up networks, is a complex system, sensitive to many system parameters. When multiple resonant cells, each with its own energy make-up network, are connected in a ring, it is very difficult to derive closed-form solutions to determine the operating conditions of the power supply system. A meaningful way to understand and analyze such a complex system is to use a simulation tool.

These devices utilize solar energy to provide high temperature process heat for e.g. thermochemical energy storage. The ideal conversion efficiency results as a compromise between maximum Carnot efficiency or maximum operating temperature and maximum absorption efficiency or minimum radiation losses. In optically accurate imaging solar concentrator systems such as e.g. parabolic dishes, the flux distribution in the focal plane is basically an image of the sunshape. Therefore, sunshape affects the absorption efficiency of any solar converter operated in such a concentrator. In this paper we investigate this influence for a solar cavity receiver. We show that there is a well defined optimum operating temperature and an optimum receiver aperture radius for which the energy conversion efficiency approaches a maximum value. With increasing circumsolar ratio the optimum temperature decreases and the optimum aperture radius increases. However, the maximum overall energy conversion efficiency only modestly depends the three parameters considered (i.e. the circumsolar ratio, the operating temperature and the receiver aperture). © 1992.",,"Resonators, Cavity - Efficiency; Resonators, Cavity - Radiation Effects; Solar Radiation - Absorption; Circumsolar Radiation; Solar Cavity Receiver; Sunshape; Solar Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026902059

Thousands of PV systems are being installed annually in the United States and abroad with typical applications including lighting, telecommunications, and other battery charging requirements. In general, a standalone PV system consists of a PV array, which converts sunlight to direct-current electricity, energy storage in the form of secondary batteries, loads or appliances, and a control system, which regulates battery charging and operation of the load. While PV module development over the past decade has resulted in a highly reliable product, the performance of battery and charge controller sub-systems have indicated a need for improvement. These deficient areas include proper specification of charging requirements and control set points for the battery type and environment. A better understanding of how batteries (less than 220 Ah) operate in PV systems is essential for the success of this market. Specifications applicable to the low charge/discharge rates typical in PV systems need to be published in the battery technical literature.This paper presents typical strategies for battery charge regulation and load control used in stand alone PV systems. Several charge algorithms (methods of controlling current to the battery) are presented, along with terminology used by the PV industry for battery charge controllers. Information gained from an extensive evaluation of commercially available charge controllers is discussed along with data collected from tests on PV systems in the field. Finally, an overview of battery performance characteristics needed for the successful design and long-term operation of PV systems is presented with the. © 1992 IEEE",,"Electric Batteries, Secondary - Charging; Pulse Width Modulation; Signal Processing - Digital Techniques; Solar Cells; Voltage Regulators; Battery Charge Controller; Series Controller; Shunt Controller; Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems; Solar Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026901313

The effect of the high temperature was evaluated by comparing these data with those of similar chicks raised at a normal temperature (20 to 33 C) up to 6 wk of age. The reductions in body weight, protein gain, and feed and protein efficiency due to the high temperature increased with age and were much larger in males than in females.

Such storage has potential in heating and cooling buildings, waste heat recovery, off-peak power utilization, heat pump systems, and many other applications. Among the PCMs that have proven useful in heat storage applications are calcium chloride hexahydrate, CaCl2·6H2O, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, MgCl2·6H2O, and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O. Many salt hydrate PCMs, including those listed above, have the disadvantage that during extraction of stored heat the material supercools before freezing. This reduces the utility of the material, and if too severe can completely prevent heat recovery. Many factors determine whether a particular additive will promote nucleation, for example, crystal structure, solubility, and hydrate stability. Candidate isomorphous and isotypic nucleating additives, with crystal structures that fit well with the PCM structure, were selected from tables of crystallographic data. Èpitaxial nucleators, with less obvious lattice structure features that promote nucleation, were selected mostly by intuition. Effective nucleators were discovered by both methods. Based on laboratory test results, promising materials were developed into formalations based on CaCl2·6H2O, MgCl2·6H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2OMgCl2·6H2O eutectic, and Mg(NO3)2·6H2ONH4NO3 eutectic salt hydrate PCMs. Subsequently, attempts were made to correlate crystal structure and hydrate stability with nucleating efficacy, and to speculate about active nucleating structures. © 1992.",,"Crystallization; Crystallography; Salts--Hydration; Salts--Phase Transitions; Calcium Chloride Hexahydrate; Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate; Magnesium Nitrate Hexahydrate; Nucleating Additives; Phase Change Materials; Supercooling; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026899190

A DRAM was used to develop the test technique because bit-mapping capability and previous heavy-ion upset data were available. Other investigators have used Nd:Yag lasers to correlate laser and heavy-ion data for devices characterized by prompt charge collection, which is controlled by charge carrier density in the immediate vicinity of a depletion region. However, the present analysis is the first to establish such a correlation for devices, such as the NMOS DRAM, where charge collection is dominated by long-range diffusion, which is controlled by carrier density at remote distances from a depletion region. In the latter case, penetration depth is an important parameter and is included in the present analysis. A single-pulse picosecond dye laser beam (1.5 μm dia.) focused onto a single cell component can upset a single memory cell. In addition, clusters of memory cell upsets (multiple errors) were observed when the laser energy was increased above the threshold energy. The multiple errors were analyzed as a function of the bias voltage and total energy of a single pulse. A diffusion model to distinguish the multiple upsets from the laser-induced charge agreed well with previously reported heavy ion data. This correlation is one more step toward the goal of using a picosecond dye laser for SEE investigations. © 1992.",,"Charge carriers; Lasers; Mathematical models; MOS devices; Bias voltage; Carrier density; Diffusion model; Effective laser energy transfer (ELET); Heavy ion single-effect events; Long-range diffussion; NMOS DRAM functional parameters; Picosecond dye laser; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026897218

The algebraic framework presented includes a flexible integration of the friction loss term that reduces to previous linear approximations as special cases. In addition, an explicit algorithm is derived for a general hydraulic element called an external energy dissipator. This boundary condition conveniently represents surge tanks, relief valves, storage reservoirs, valves discharging to the atmosphere, and many other common devices. Significantly, the solution remains explicit even if friction losses and inertia effects are present in both the storage element and a connecting pipe.

Savings in utility operations from improved system efficiency, increased reliability, and reduced maintenance requirements contribute to the economic justification of SMES. Beyond these benefits, there are additional benefits which in the long run may significantly outweigh the electrical operational benefits. These benefits are the energy conservation and environmental benefits. Since SMES can uncouple generation from load, it can shift generation around, thereby changing the operational characteristics of the system. The technology has the capability of reducing fuel consumption which can in turn reduce emissions. In a regional setting it can potentially shift emissions both in volumes and in physical areas to avoid problem situations.

Most of the experimental data on semiconductors and semiconductor devices has been taken using high energy neutrons. Recent research has shown that this data can be extrapolated to other high energy radiation such as protons, electrons, alpha particles, and gamma rays by normalizing to the energy going into atomic processes. Minority carrier lifetime is the most sensitive electronic property of silicon in the neutron environment. The degradation of minority carrier lifetime results in changes in semiconductor device properties such as current gain, storage time, saturation voltage and sink current. Carrier removal is the next most important characteristic of displacement damage and it causes a decrease in carrier mobility and an increase in resistivity. The dependence of these basic semiconductor properties on neutron fluence is introduced into device models such as SPICE and the resulting radiation inclusive model permits quantitative determination of device parameters as a function of neutron fluence.

The model predicts the temperatures, the mass flow rates and the states of the liquid dripping and the vapour rising from each of the plates. The quantitative effect of varying different parameters on the column performance is presented. The simulation model can eventually be used to optimize the rectification column.

Proteolytic activity was studied in platelet concentrates (PC) stored in plasma at 22°C. In experiment 1, two PC with a higher (A) and a lower (B) white cell concentration were prepared from each of nine donors by centrifugation. Aliquots of the cell‐free plasma, PPP, were stored as a control. Samples for the assay of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), elastase, spontaneous proteolytic activity (SPA), kallikrein‐inhibiting activity, thrombin‐antithrombin complexes (TAT) and D‐dimers were collected initially and on days 1,3,5 and 7 of storage. Consumption of glucose, pH and concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ATP were determined to investigate the metabolic status of the PC. The decrease in pH correlated to the leucocyte count, r= ‐0.74, P<0.001 and to the increase in LDH, r= ‐0.74, P<0.01. The levels of elastase and the SPA were consistently low in the PPP bags. In the PC elastase had increased by day 5 and the SPA by day 3; the levels in PC A were significantly higher than in PC B, P<0.01. The leucocyte count correlated with the elastase activity, r= 0.71, P<0.01, and with the SPA, r= 0.65, P<0.01. A minor increase in FPA was demonstrated while no TAT and D‐dimers could be detected. The cause of the formation of FPA was studied in experiment 2; three bags of PC and four of PPP were prepared from each of 16 donors. To the PC and three of the PPP bags either hirudin, aprotinin or no enzyme inhibitor (control) was added. To the fourth PPP bag extra CPD was added to evaluate the effect of pH. Hirudin decreased the formation of FPA (P<0.001) while aprotinin had no inhibitory effect; thus the formation was due in part, to thrombin activation. The levels of FPA were higher in the PPP controls, correlating with an increase in the pH. We conclude that there is an activation of proteolytic enzymes in plasma during storage. The duration of storage, stability of pH and the concentration of white cells are important factors. The data give evidence for the benefit of a removal of leucocytes already in the preparation procedure. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

On the other hand, the grid difficulty in accepting intermittent PV power, when this latter exceeds 10-20% of the network active power capacity, introduces an upper limit for penetration of PV systems in the bulk market of central power stations. Accounting for different capacity factors between PV and conventional power (typically 20% of PV against 55% of conventional power plants), this limit corresponds, in terms of PV annual electric energy production, to a contribution of about 3.5-7%. Since the electric energy contribution to the global energy balance in industrialized countries corresponds to about 30% of the total, the PV energy contribution will be as a maximum in the order of 1-2%. What would make the photovoltaics role marginal with reference to its contribution in satisfying the would energy demand and negligible with regard to induced environmental benefits. In order to overcome this barrier it is necessary to review PV strategy, assuming as a reference for energy competitiveness a new commercial product, made of an integrated system, PV array plus H2 seasonal storage subsystem, and related back up generator, able to assure the load supply with continuity. The recurrent oil crises, the new environmental boundary conditions for energy production and use, and the present state and perspectives of PV and H2 technologies lead us to conclude that the PV-H2 system development can be a very promising strategic solution, which realizes together with the PV energy cost effectiveness goal an actual, clean, renewable, and alternative energy option. © 1992.",,"Electric Power Generation - Costs; Energy Resources - Renewable; Environmental Protection; Solar Cells - Arrays; Solar Energy - Marketing; Hydrogen Seasonal Storage Subsystem; Photovoltaic Array; Photovoltaic Integrated Systems; Photovoltaic Cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026881052

The plastic work done on the propellant prior to initiation can be measured by equating it to the loss in drop weight kinetic energy, provided energy storage in the machine is negligible. Three HTPB/AP propellants were studied with an instrumented impact machine. Data are given for impact velocities ranging from 5.54 m/s, at which no sample was consumed, to 16.14 m/s, at which nearly all of the sample was consumed. These data are interpreted in terms of a proposed mechanism based on other impact tests. On bare steel tools ignition, as opposed to hot spot formation, is assumed to occur at impact velocities greater than 10.3 m/s, when more than 90% of the sample is consumed during the test. At higher impact velocities, for the present data, times to reaction are short and the change in impactor kinetic energy during the initiation delay is defined as the critical initiation energy.

This short duration stage (< 1 μs) has been divided into two phases. In the first, the electrical energy is introduced in a constant volume process. In the second, a sudden expansion occurs which is associated with the generation of a shock wave. The thermodynamic properties of the plasma were calculated by using concepts of statistical thermodynamics, in which molecular dissociation, ionization (up to the 3rd ionization) and the various modes of energy storage in a molecule were considered. The transport coefficients (thermal and electrical conductivities) were evaluated from molecular theory, as modified for partially ionized gas. The plasma conditions at the end of the second phase are expressed in terms of the breakdown energy and the maximum temperature of the plasma. The initial conditions for the arc stage have therefore been established. It is shown that owing to the drastic changes in the gas composition at high temperatures, the relationship between the input energy and the plasma temperature and its dimensions is quite complicated. The total thermal energy of the kernel at the end of the breakdown stage, as predicted by a simple model, was found to be four times higher than predicted by the present rigorous model. © 1992.",,"Dissociation; Mathematical models; Plasmas; Thermodynamic properties; Transport properties; Breakdown stage; Molecular dissociation; Partially ionized gas; Spark channels; Transport coefficients; Electric discharges; article; dissociation; electric conductivity; electricity; ionization; shock wave; temperature; thermal conductivity; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026869603

If we could control the revolution of the turbine in proportion to wind velocity, we could obtain the optimal system. However, the battery load suppresses increased revolution because the voltage is fixed. Therefore, we must compromise with an optimal fixed revolution. The present paper proposes a method to determine the voltage and the capacity of the battery based on computer simulation. We have applied it to our Darrieus-Savonius wind turbine (1 kW) and have confirmed its validity with a 4-month field test.",,"Computers--Applications; Electric batteries; Fluid mechanics; Mathematical models; Wind effects; Fluid Machinery; Natural Energy; Storage Battery; Wind Energy; Wind Turbine Generator; Windmill; Wind turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026868309

The heat transfer for conduction-dominated melting is analyzed, taking into account the two-dimensional effects. The storage process irreversibilities associated with both the gas flow and the heat transfer (including entropy generation in the melted layer) are considered. The number of entropy generation units, which is a measure of the thermodynamic imperfection of the energy storage process, is expressed as a function of the main design parameters of the system. Analytic bounds and simplified asymptotic expressions for this quantity are derived.

Consequently bulk power system are now more vulnerable to severe system disturbances and these, more frequently, have caused collapses. The main cost of these incidents to the community has been the extensive loss of supply to large urban centres. With the retirement of power stations within or near these urban centres, not only are these localities more vulnerable but if a blackout does occur, it takes longer to restore supplies. As a long term strategy, the installation of numbers of Battery Storage Plant (BSP) in urban centres would significantly raise power system levels of reliability and security. There are three important advantages of BSP: (i) no environmental difficulties to placing them within urban areas, (ii) there is an instantly accessible output of MW and MVAr, (iii) commercial consumers requiring a higher reliability will meet much of the capital cost Utilities would need to offer tariff incentives to gain an operational control of the BSP. The ability for extremely fast output changes of MW and MVAr outputs, coupled with their energy storage, would make BSP useful for normal and emergency operation as well as speeding up system restoration. Their potential economic and operational advantages point to an increasing utilisation of BSP by electric utilities in the future development of power systems. © 1992 IEEE","Battery Storage Plant; Consumer Reliability; Emergency Operation; Frequency Control; Restoration; Security; System; Tariffs; Voltage Control","Electric Power Plants; Electric Power Systems; Power Plants--Energy Storage; Battery Storage Plants; Urban Centers; Electric Batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026866022

Both prostheses led to similar osteophyte formation and synovitis after a 3-month implantation period. Ingrowth to the periphery of the prostheses was found in all cases. Knees with prostheses, no matter what size, had a higher compression compliance than sham-operated knees, but energy storage was similar to normal.

Spontaneous ignition took place in the packaged material some hours later. Considerable damage to buildings and other losses were incurred. The ambient temperature within the store was not sufficiently high to cause thermal ignition. The problem proved to be a special but not necessarily unusual case in which the onset of ignition was governed by the initial temperature of assembly of the packaged material. These circumstances have been recognized in the fibreboard manufacturing industry for example, such that US legislation requires the cooling of newly manufactured boards below a specified temperature before stacking takes place. We discuss the theoretical background to this type of problem, based on an adaptation of thermal ignition theory with conductive heat transport (Frank-Kamenetskii conditions). We obtained the appropriate kinetic and thermochemical parameters for exothermic reaction in a cellulosic material in order to apply the theory. We were then able to calculate a maximum packing temperature to expedite safe but efficient storage or transport. The numerical calculations to solve the spatial and time dependent energy conservation equations by use of the finite difference method required a three dimensional grid, set up as 203 mesh points, equivalent to cube-shaped, packaged material in the practical application.

Towards our application, this results in system optimization of two major design aspects: (1) The optimization of pond-water depth to achieve the target equilibrium temperature; and (2) the optimization of cool-room dimensions for best cost/performance of the required volume of interior storage space.

One approach applies to the storage of liquid hydrogen with continuous liquid hydrogen addition, while the other applies to storage of a certain amount of liquid hydrogen without any addition. For the first case, the optimization is conducted by evaluating the desirable storage times for different initial ortho concentrations relative to pure liquid para-hydrogen. For the second case the energy cost incurred during boil-off is compared with the extra liquefaction work for conversion. For both cases a curve, representing the optimum liquefaction ortho concentration for the different storage times is obtained.

This paper reviews the effects of exercise and diet on energy expenditure and, ultimately, energy balance. Overnutrition increases RMR and TEF while undernutrition decreases them. Carbohydrate and protein oxidation is closely tied to intake whereas fat oxidation does not closely parallel fat intake. Thus excess fat intake is likely to lead to fat storage. Acute endurance exercise at > 70% VO2max increases postexercise RMR and TEF. Chronic exercise training may increase RMR while also increasing TEF.

An understanding of the mechanisms of such particle-associated phenomena is being augmented by particle analysis technology. In this context, microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, devised for problem solving, are being applied to frequently encountered sub-micrometre particulates which are 'unstable' with respect to methods of sample preparation and storage used routinely for particulates prior to analysis. These unstable aquatic particulates include 'species' sensitive to dehydration and to artificial aggregation induced by surfaces within a fractionation apparatus. These species, as defined broadly, include polysaccharide gels, hydrated humic substances, iron oxyhydroxides, viruses, the smallest micro-organisms and decomposing parts of cells. To develop predictive models of their roles as dispersing agents for contaminants, and to speciate such associations, it is necessary to characterize them in a state as close to the natural as possible. This critical review presents the state-of-the-art in the realistic characterization of hydrated sub-micrometre particulates by correlative electron microscopy (EM) used in conjunction with spectroscopy and minimally perturbing preparatory techniques. Correlative EM is a strategy for using several different kinds of microscopes and accessory techniques in a multi-method context to analyse a given specimen for different kinds of information, including relationships in three dimensions within colloid systems. Sizing, morphology and gross composition are determined on a 'per particle' basis by transmission EM used in conjunction with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, electron diffraction and molecule-specific stains. Heterogeneity measures and positional information are refined and quantified by correlating observations from transmission and scanning EM with those from optical microscopy. In a systematic manner, artifacts of perturbation can be readily detected, assessed and minimized. Artifacts of shrinkage, swelling and redistribution of materials can be measured against a vitrified standard.","Correlative electron microscopy; Particle analysis; Speciation problems; Sub-micrometre particulates; Unstable aquatic particulates","water; animal; colloid; ecology; electron microscopy; methodology; plankton; review; Animal; Colloids; Ecology; Microscopy, Electron; Plankton; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026831082

In the case of two phase-change systems in series, which are melted by the same stream of hot fluid, there exists an optimal melting point for each of the two materials. The first (upstream) system has the higher of the two melting points. The second part of the paper addresses the theoretical limit in which the melting point can vary continuously along the source stream, i.e., when an infinite number of different (and small) phase-change systems are being heated in series. It is shown that the performance of this scheme is equivalent to that which uses an optimum single phase-change material, in which the hot stream remains unmixed during the melting process. The time dependence, finite thickness and longitudinal variation of the melt layer caused by an unmixed stream are considered in the third part of the paper. It is shown that these features have a negligible effect on the optimal melting temperature, which is slightly higher than (T∞, Te)1/2. © 1992 by ASME.",,"Optimization; Thermodynamics; Least Irreversibility Optimal Melting Point; Materials Thermodynamic Optimization; Melting Temporal Effects; Optimal Melting Temperature; Phase-Change Energy Storage; Single Phase-Change Element; Materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026829521

At low field strengths the conductivity is ohmic and at higher field strengths (up to 30 MV/m), ionic conduction is a possible mechanism. The activation energy of low field conduction is determined and at high electric fields the hopping distance for ions is in the range of 4.4 to 8.0 nm. No dependence of the activation energy or the hopping distance between traps on the thickness is observed. TSD currents are also measured at various poling fields, formation and storage times, and rates of heating. The TSD current shows a peak at 135°C for a rate of heating of 1 K/min and shifts to a higher value when the rate of heating is increased. The peak current and the charge released to the external circuit is proportional to the poling field. The observed peak is attributed to the depolarization of permanent dipoles with room temperature relaxation time 5.3×l05 s. The relaxation time is also calculated from the remaining polarization within the material by a new experimental procedure. The results obtained agree with that obtained using the Debye theory if we accept a lower value of the characteristic relaxation time, suggesting additional mechanisms of polarization at higher temperatures. © 1992 IEEE",,"Electric Discharges; Electric Field Effects; Electric Insulating Materials - Ionic Conduction; Relaxation Processes; Aramid Paper; Aromatic Polyamides; Poole-Frenkel Effect; Relaxation Time; Schottky Effect; Thermally Stimulated Discharge Currents; Electric Insulating Materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026821839

Although the reaction order, apparent rate constant, apparent activation energy and rate-controlling steps change with phase regions, they are kept constant within a given phase region. The apparent activation energy of the dehydriding reaction is always larger than that of the hydriding reaction. © 1992.",,"Chemical Reactions - Reaction Kinetics; Hydrides - Phase Equilibria; Hydrogen Fuels - Storage; Thermodynamics - Calculations; Gas Solid Reactions; Hydriding Dehydriding Reactions; Hydrogen Metal Hydride Systems; Reversible Reactions; Intermetallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026819905

We discuss the mirror penetration depth from the standpoints of reflection delay and energy storage in the quarterwave mirrors and derive exact analytic expressions for the penetration depth at the mirror center frequency based on both definitions. We show that, in general, the two models yield different expressions for the penetration depth, but for certain practical cases the difference is negligible.

Subsequent curing of these fabrics under selected mild conditions produced fabrics containing bound and crosslinked polyols with several improved functional properties (thermal storage and release, flex and flat abrasion resistance, soil release and hydrophilicity). These functional property improvements are due to structural aspects of the crosslinked polyol. These structural aspects are high latent heat due to energy required to break intra‐ and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the elastomeric and hydrophilic nature of the polymer in the fiber matrix.

Spent polypropylene liquid filters held for plutonium recovery, known as “residue,” or as transuranic mixed waste contribute to storage capacity problems and create radiation safety and health considerations. An in-line process-liquid filter made of Kevlar polymer fiber has been evaluated for its potential to: (1) minimize filter residue, (2) recover economically viable quantities of plutonium, (3) minimize liquid storage tank and process-stream radioactivity, and (4) reduce potential personnel radiation exposure associated with these sources. Kevlar filters were rated to <1 μ nominal filtration and are capable of reducing undissolved plutonium particles to more than 10 times below the economic discard limit, however produced high back-pressures and are not yet acid resistant. Kevlar filters performed independent of loaded particles serving as a sieve. Polypropylene filters removed molybdenum particles at efficiencies equal to Kevlar filters only after loading molybdenum during recirculation events. Kevlars’ high-efficiency microfiltration of process-liquid streams for the removal of actinides has the potential to reduce personnel radiation exposure by a factor of 6 or greater, while simultaneously achieving a reduction in the generation of filter residue and waste by a factor of 7.

Their high energy content, about 37 kJ/g, compared with 17 kJ/g for protein and 16 kJ/g for carbohydrate, makes them specially suitable for this function. Since TG are insoluble in the aqueous environment of the cells and of the blood and lymph, they must be carried in association with other lipids and proteins. Such aggregates are known as lipoproteins. There are two major classes of TG-rich lipoproteins, namely, chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Several early studies suggested a positive correlation between elevated plasma TG levels and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. However, the interest of most researchers was diverted in the late seventies and early eighties toward the study of cholesterol and its distribution among different lipoprotein fractions. The evidence relating elevated TG to CHD is not as strong as for low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In some studies, when multivariate analysis was used, the positive association between TG and CHD risk disappeared when controlling statistically for TC and HDL cholesterol. This suggested that the atherogenic risk resulting from the accumulation of triglyceride-rich particles could be due to the association with other risk factors rather than being atherogenic by themselves. It is well accepted that an intimate relationship exists between TG metabolism and high density lipoproteins (HDL). This lipoprotein class is synthesized by the liver and intestine and acquires surface material from TG-rich lipoproteins during their catabolism by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Patients with low HDL often show an exaggerated postprandial lipemia, and it has been suggested that in this situation, there could be an increased uptake of triglyceride-rich remnants by the arterial wall. This will result in an intracellular accumulation of cholesteryl ester and in the subsequent development of atherogenic foam cells. An additional problem in the analysis and interpretation of previous studies, arises from the remarkable fluctuations of TG levels. Unlike total cholesterol levels, which are rather stable and actually not very influenced by environmental factors, plasma TG levels are subject to dramatic changes, specially during the postprandial state, the most common in many humans. This section will review the current knowledge on the physiology and pathophysiology of the triglyceride transport, with special emphasis on the genetic disorders associated with high TG levels.",,"high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; gene function; genetic disorder; human; hyperlipidemia; lipid metabolism; lipid transport; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026793181

Passive inflation also increases Vti. The purpose of the present study was to measure the changes in Vti during positive end-expiratory pressure- (PEEP) induced changes in lung volume and with a concentration-response curve to methacholine (MCh) in rabbits and to compare the effects of induced constriction vs. passive lung inflation on tissue mechanics. Measurements were made in 10 anesthetized open-chest mechanically ventilated New Zealand male rabbits exposed first to increasing levels of PEEP (3-12 cmH2O) and then to increasing concentrations of MCh aerosol (0.5-128 mg/ml). Lung elastance (EL), lung resistance (RL), and Vti were determined by adjusting the equation of motion to tracheal and alveolar pressures during tidal ventilation. Our results show that under baseline conditions, Vti accounted for a major proportion of RL; during both passive lung inflation and MCh challenge this proportion increased progressively. For the same level of change in EL, however, the increase in Vti was larger during MCh challenge than during passive inflation; i.e., the relationship between energy storage and energy dissipation or hysteresivity was dramatically altered. These results are consistent with a MCh-induced change in the intrinsic rheological properties of lung tissues unrelated to lung volume change per se. Lung tissue constriction is one possible explanation.","alveolar pressure; hysteresivity; lung tissue mechanics","methacholine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; artificial ventilation; bronchospasm; concentration response; controlled study; lung compliance; lung inflation; lung mechanics; lung resistance; male; nonhuman; positive end expiratory pressure; pressure gradient; priority journal; rabbit",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026780437

For the next 30 to 40 years, however, interest in CHO ingestion during exercise waned. Indeed, it was not until the reintroduction of the muscle biopsy technique into exercise physiology in the 1960s that a series of studies on CHO utilisation during exercise appeared. Investigations by Scandinavian physiologists showed that muscle glycogen depletion during prolonged exercise coincided with the development of fatigue. Despite this finding, attempts to delay fatigue during prolonged exercise focused principally on techniques that would increase muscle glycogen storage before exercise. The possibility that CHO ingestion during exercise might also delay the development of muscle glycogen depletion and hence, at least potentially, fatigue, was not extensively investigated. This, in part, can be explained by the popular belief that water replacement to prevent dehydration and hyperthermia was of greater importance than CHO replacement during prolonged exercise. This position was strengthened by studies in the early 1970s which showed that the ingestion of CHO solutions delayed gastric emptying compared with water, and might therefore exacerbate dehydration. As a result, athletes were actively discouraged from ingesting even mildly concentrated (&gt;5 g/100ml) CHO solutions during exercise. Only in the early 1980s, when commercial interest in the sale of CHO products to athletes was aroused, did exercise physiologists again begin to study the effects of CHO ingestion during exercise. These studies soon established that CHO ingestion during prolonged exercise could delay fatigue; this finding added urgency to the search for the optimum CHO type for ingestion during exercise. Whereas in the earlier studies, estimates of CHO oxidation were made using respiratory gas exchange measurements, investigations since the early 1970s have employed stable 13C and radioactive 14C isotope techniques to determine the amount of ingested CHO that is oxidised during exercise. Most of the early interest was in glucose ingestion during exercise. These studies showed that significant quantities of ingested glucose can be oxidised during exercise. Peak rates of glucose oxidation occur ≈75 to 90 minutes after ingestion and are unaffected by the time of glucose ingestion during exercise. Rates of oxidation also appear not to be influenced to a major extent by the use of different feeding schedules. Irrespective of whether subjects ingest glucose as single or multiple feedings, around 20g of glucose is oxidised in the first hour of exercise. Since repetitive feedings would be expected to accelerate the rate of delivery of glucose from the stomach to the duodenum, the similar rates of ingested glucose oxidation after single and multiple feedings suggest that exogenous CHO oxidation may not be limited by the rate of gastric emptying. Instead, studies in which rates of both gastric emptying and of ingested CHO oxidation were measured have shown that ingested glucose oxidation in the first 60 to 90 minutes of exercise must be limited by factors distal to the stomach; that is, either by the rate of glucose absorption into the bloodstream, or by the rate of exogenous glucose oxidation by the active muscles. Other data, however, indicate that it is the rate of absorption of glucose into the bloodstream, rather than its oxidation by muscle, which limits the rate of exogenous CHO oxidation. Thus, in glycogen-depleted or fasted subjects exogenous CHO oxidation is not increased. Further, the rate of exogenous CHO oxidation plateaus when the exercise intensity increases above 50% of maximal oxygen consumption V̇2max, suggesting that glucose delivery to the blood may be limiting. Comparisons between glucose and fructose ingested by fed subjects during exercise show that the rate of oxidation of fructose is less than that of glucose. Oxidation rates of ingested maltose, sucrose and glucose polymer solutions are very similar to those reported for glucose provided the CHO is ingested in sufficiently large volumes. The practical implications of these findings for optimal performance in endurance events are that athletes should be encouraged to maximise CHO delivery to the working muscles. This is best achieved by ingesting a pre-exercise bolus feeding (200 to 400ml) of a mildly concentrated (5 to 7 g/100ml) long-chain glucose polymer solution, followed by repetitive, multiple feedings (100 to 150ml) of the same solution every 10 to 15 minutes for the first 2 hours of prolonged exercise. Thereafter, athletes should ingest a single (200 to 300ml) bolus of a more concentrated (15 to 20 g/100ml) long-chain glucose polymer solution followed by 100 to 150ml of the same drink every 10 to 15 minutes until the completion of exercise. This drinking pattern will ensure that both fluid and CHO delivery are maintained at rates necessary to sustain performance during the later stages of prolonged, exhaustive exercise. © 1992, Adis International Limited.

Although these systems have performed to expectations there are a number of operational problems which still need to be overcome.

A model of a lithium hydride phase change energy storage system was used to estimate reasonable physical dimensions for this application, which included the use of a liquid metal heat transfer fluid. A finite difference computer code was developed and used to evaluate three methods of enhancing heat transfer in the phase change material energy storage system. None of the following methods, inserting thin fins, reticulated nickel, or liquid lithium, significantly improved the system performance. The use of a 95% void fraction reticulated nickel insert was found to increase the storage capacity (total energy stored) of the system slightly with only a small decrease in the system energy density (energy storage/system mass).

In the present studies we used the heterotopically transplanted rat heart and the isolated working rat heart to assess whether adenosine, given during reperfusion, could improve either the rate or the extent of postischemic recovery. Hearts were arrested (2 minutes at 4° C) with the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution and stored by immersion in the same solution for 8 hours at 4° C. Hearts were then transplanted into the abdomen of homozygous recipients. Immediately before reperfusion, adenosine (0.5 ml of a 1 μmol/L solution, equivalent to 0.13 μg) was injected into the left ventricle (control rats received an equivalent amount of saline). Hearts were reperfused in vivo for 30 minutes or 24 hours, after which they were excised and perfused (Langendorff) for 20 minutes for the assessment of function. They were then freeze clamped and taken for metabolic analysis. After 50 minutes of reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure was 75 ± 5 mm Hg (4 mm Hg end-diastolic pressure) in the adenosine group versus 61 ± 4 mm Hg in the control group (p < 0.05); however, after 24 hours function was identical in the two groups (52 ± 4 versus 52 ± 3 mm Hg). After 50 minutes of reperfusion coronary flow was greater in the adenosine group (11.0 ± 0.4 versus 9.7 ± 0.4 ml/min in control rats; p < 0.05), a difference that was sustained for 24 hours (12.8 ± 0.3 versus 11.4 ± 0.4 ml/min in control rats; p < 0.05). Adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate contents recovered to similar extents in control and adenosine groups after both 50 minutes and 24 hours of reperfusion. In further studies with an identical storage protocol (8 hours at 4° C), hearts were not transplanted but were reperfused with crystalloid medium in the Langendorff mode for 15 minutes (creatine kinase leakage measured) and in the working mode for 180 minutes. In an attempt to mimic the heterotopic transplant protocol, adenosine (1 μmol/L) was included in the perfusion fluid for the first 2 minutes of reperfusion. Similar results to those of the transplant studies were obtained, with coronary flow being consistently improved in the adenosine group; however, this benefit was lost after only 2 hours of reperfusion. In conclusion, a bolus of adenosine during reperfusion of transplanted hearts affords a sustained (up to 24-hour) improvement in the postischemic recovery of coronary flow and accelerates the rate of early contractile recovery; final contractile recovery, however, is not improved.",,"adenosine; adenosine triphosphate; cardioplegic agent; creatine phosphate; animal tissue; article; coronary artery blood flow; cryopreservation; energy metabolism; heart function; heart graft; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle pressure; heart muscle reperfusion; heart transplantation; heart ventricle enddiastolic pressure; isolated heart; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; xenotransplantation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026771203

The following results were obtained: 1) addition of nucleoside transport inhibition prevented high-energy phosphate depletion during cold storage: after 24 h, adenosine triphosphate content in group I was 9.4 ± 3.1 μmol/g versus 17.7 ± 3.6 μmol/g dry weight in group II (P < 0.05); 2) addition of nucleoside transport inhibition to cardioplegia and during reperfusion resulted in greater high-energy phosphate content (adenosine triphosphate in group III was 7.9 ± 3.5 μmol/g vs. 17.8 ± 2.8 μmol/g in group VI [P < 0.05]) and improved hemodynamics upon reperfusion (hearts in group III did not recover, maximum isometric left ventricular pressure development was 1,635 ± 577 mmHg/sec in group IV, 1,915 ± 423 mmHg/sec in group V, and 2,437 ± 201 mmHg/sec in group VI [P < 0.05, group VI vs. groups IV and V]); and 3) hearts treated with nucleoside transport inhibition in cardioplegia and during reperfusion (group VIII) could be transplanted successfully in contrast to group VII hearts.

Depot fat samples from thirteen individual mid-Pacific turtles Chelonia mydas were examined for overall fatty acid composition. 2. 2. It can be concluded from analysis of fatty acids that the mid-Pacific green turtles generally synthesize their triglyceride depot fats with at least one, but not more than two, positions occupied by 12:0 and 14:0, possibly with 16:0 and 16:1 as well. 3. 3. These two fatty acids are probably utilized as temporary energy storage and are synthesized from acetate originating in the gut from dietary carbohydrates. 4. 4.

The general formulation of bidirectional associative memories presents certain difficulties when the associations of pairs of patterns do not suppose a local energy minimum. To avoid these problems, the authors describe an adaptive scheme which allows the correlation matrix to be modified so as to reach the energy minimum while at the same time identifying the input patterns. The strategy used allows the adaptation of the matrix to be performed for each external input, so that it can henceforth be described as a supervised type of training scheme. A consequence is its synthesis by means of neural networks with both the BAM and the adaptive mechanism itself integrated in distinct layers, allowing either of them to be changed without altering the others. The proposed scheme is an extension of the well-known neural synthesis for associative memories through easy rules for building it.",,"Control Systems, Adaptive; Data Storage, Digital--Associative; Learning Systems; Mathematical Techniques--Matrix Algebra; Bidirectional Associative Memories; Summary Only; Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026765049

Two x-ray phosphors with different K edges, designed to emit light of different wavelengths, were bound together in a single screen. Two CCD cameras, each sensitive to the respective wavelengths emitted by each phosphor, are proposed to be coupled to the binary screen.

The intense synchrotron radiation emitted by the electron and positron beams produces strong outgassing from the vacuum chamber walls during operation. This gas load exceeds by many orders of magnitude the static pressure and must be absorbed by a large, distributed pumping system around the whole machine circumference.

The theory of neural networks was extended to include discrete neurons called quantrons (Q'trons, a shorthand for quantum neurons). Q'trons are featured in their multiple output levels whose number is usually greater than two. The dynamics of the Q'tron neural network (NN) were studied and the property of the embedded system energy, referred to as Liapunov energy, was derived. If a problem can be reformulated as one which minimizes the Liapunov energy, then it can be solved by a suitably constructed Q'tron NN. Two typical examples, an A/D (analog-to-digital) converter and an associative adder, are realized by using such Q'tron NNs. In order to make this NN approach complete, i.e., so that it will never provide false solutions, a mechanism which prevents the NN from being stuck at some local minima of the Liapunov energy is incorporated into each Q'tron.

Considerably more of this mannan-like carbohydrate is present in cells from 3-day stationary phase than from late log phase cultures, consistent with the ability of 3-day stationary phase cells to survive in non-nutrient buffer and maintain oxygen consumption for longer than log phase cells. The amount of this mannan-like compound decreased by over 50% during a 3-h incubation in buffer of cells from 3-day stationary phase cultures. The presence of glucose during the incubation prevented the utilization of this carbohydrate, consistent with the possibility that it serves as an energy reserve. © 1992.","Carbohydrate reserve; Leishmania donovani; Mannose; Polysaccharide","carbohydrate; mannose; article; leishmania donovani; metabolism; nonhuman; parasite cultivation; priority journal; promastigote; Animal; Carbohydrates; Glucose; Leishmania donovani; Mannans; Mannose; Oxygen Consumption; Polysaccharides; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Leishmania donovani",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026749721

The following two major groups (I and II) and five subgroups (-a to -e) in each group were prepared. In group I (reversed group); the hearts were initially stored in Collins' solution but were reversed by a 1-minute flush with cardioplegic solution followed by storage in cardioplegic solution for the last 1 to 180 minutes of the total 3-hour storage, that is, groups I-a (reversed for 1 minute), I-b (10 minutes), I-c (30 minutes), I-d (90 minutes), and I-e (180 minutes). In group II (nonreversed control group); the hearts were stored in Collins' solution throughout 3 hours and were also divided into five subgroups of groups II-a, II-b, II-c, II-d, and II-e in which only a 1-minute flush with Collins' solution was performed at the point corresponding to group I. The coronary flow in any of group II showed a marked decrease during the early reperfusion period. In group I, however, the coronary flow increased significantly in proportion to the duration of the reversing phase. The recovery of the aortic flow and the cardiac output in group I showed a bell-shaped pattern in relation to the duration of the reversing phase, reaching their peak values when reversed for 30 minutes (group I-c). The prolonged reverse (180 minutes) resulted in a deterioration of functional recovery associated with a poorer preservation of high-energy phosphates and a larger enzyme leakage. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of intracellular-type Collins' solution for cold storage of the heart were further improved by reversing Collins' solution with the extracellular-type cardioplegic solution for the last 30 minutes of the 3- hour cold storage because the disadvantageous vasoconstriction due to Collins' solution during reperfusion was successfully prevented by the replacement of intravascular and extravascular Collins' solution with cardioplegic solution before the reperfusion.",,"cardioplegic agent; Collins solution; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aorta flow; article; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; cryopreservation; heart output; heart transplantation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; reperfusion; vasoconstriction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026746758

In those converters, energy storage ability of the devices cannot be used effectively, especially when dc power ripple is required to be very small. To solve such a problem, this paper presents novel single-phase ac/dc conversion circuits, in which energy storage devices are used at the ac rather than at the dc side. That is, after converting single-phase ac into balanced (rectangular) two-phase ac using variable reactance element, reconversion of it into dc is carried out.

This low initial cost system has no moving parts, so there are not likely to be excessive maintenance costs. The paper describes a prototype charcoal or biomass-stove thermal refrigerator in which the absorption cycle and thermo-syphonic cycle of a heating liquid has been coupled in a novel and straight forward approach. The system consisted of a heat-exchanger, in the form of a jacket surrounding the generator tube of a water-ammonia absorption cycle refrigerator, and was connected in a close-pipe work loop to a heat exchanger placed in a charcoal-stove. A heat-transfer oil flowed due to thermo-syphonic forces between the heat exchanger and the jacket. The commercially manufactured (but modified) refrigerator required a heat input of 200W and had an evaporator capacity of 22W in the freezer cabinet at a generator temperature of 200°C. The working pressure of the aqua-ammonia system was reduced from 2.6MPa to 1.75 MPa so that the evaporator could operate at a lower generator temperature of between 170°-180°C. According to initial tests it took 4 hours for the system to warm up, and took another 7 hours for water in the freezer cabinet to approach 0°C from an initial 25°C. The cooling capacity of the evaporator was roughly 70% of the cooling capacity of the original system with electric heating. For a twelve hour test the stove consumed 2.5kg of charcoal with an air port opening between 3 to 5 millimeters. Initial results show that fluctuations in the heating oil temperatures did not have a corresponding effect on the evaporator temperature due to the thermal inertia. This cycle of operation is being extended at present to allow larger heat flux through the jacket. However, food below +5°C could be maintained over a 24 hour cycle, using coconut husks and other biomass material commonly available in the island communities. The need for the systems to be developed in this project will be greatest in coastal fishing villages and island communities around Papua New Guinea, where large amounts of fish and marine produce are lost or their value depreciated by spoilage. Preliminary estimates indicate that the described prototype absorption unit stimulated by the wood/coconut husk stove (rather than electricitylkerosene), when manufactured commercially will cost less than US$1500 at 1991 prices. © Ambient Press Limited 1992.",,"Biomass--Energy Utilization; Heat Exchangers--Heat Transfer; Solar Radiation--Collectors; Charcoal Stove; New Guinea; Refrigerating Machinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026735332

An insertion mutation introduced into the iron Superoxide dismutase locus (designated sodB) of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 created a mutant strain devoid of detectable iron superoxide dismutase activity. Both wild-type and mutant strains exhibited similar photosynthetic activity and viability when grown with 17 μmol·m-2 illumination in liquid culture supplemented with 3% carbon dioxide. In contrast, the sodB mutant exhibited significantly greater damage to its photosynthetic system than the wild-type strain when grown under increased oxygen tension or with methyl viologen. Although damage occurs at both photosystems I and II, it is primarily localized at photo-system I in the sodB mutant. Growth in 100% molecular oxygen for 24 hr decreased photoacoustically measured energy storage in 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and abolished the fluorescence state 2 to state 1 transition in the sodB mutant, indicating interruption of cyclic electron flow around photosystem I.

The high energetic efficiency and energy partitioning toward fat accretion characteristic of this refeeding period were unaltered by (1) dietary fat levels varying between 6% and 30% of energy intake; (2) protein levels between 15% and 40%; (3) carbohydrate types (glucose v fructose v sucrose v starch v unrefined carbohydrate); and (4) diets containing 30% fat but differing in fatty acid composition (long-chain triglycerides [LCT] v medium-chain triglycerides [MCT] v oleic v linoleic v α-linolenic metabolites eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] ω-3 fatty acids). Changes were only observed for extreme diets, ie, those deficient in protein or very high in fat. Low-protein diet was the only condition in which the high metabolic efficiency characteristic of the refeeding period was partially suppressed, and this occurred despite a lack of concomitant reduction in body fat deposition. On the contrary, with high-fat diets (>30% of dietary energy consumption) the elevated efficiency was further increased, an effect that was only partially accounted for by the lower energy cost of body fat gain from high-fat diets. These studies indicate that during body weight recovery, the mechanisms underlying the adaptive increase in metabolic efficiency favoring the replenishment of body fat stores override any effect of food type on thermogenesis, and suggest some convergence in the controlling neural pathway. The implications of these findings vis-a-vis nutritional rehabilitation (catch-up growth) and obesity relapse are discussed. © 1992.",,"carbohydrate; docosahexaenoic acid; fat; icosapentaenoic acid; linoleic acid; long chain triacylglycerol; medium chain triacylglycerol; oleic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; protein; adolescent; animal model; article; body fat; body weight; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; energy expenditure; energy transfer; food composition; growth; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; priority journal; protein restriction; rat; refeeding; relapse; Animal; Body Composition; Body Weight; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Growth; Lipids; Male; Obesity; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026727154

A reproductive attempt at a time when calories are not sufficiently available can result in a reduced return on the maternal energetic investment or even in the death of the mother and her offspring. Numerous physiological and behavioral mechanisms link reproduction and energy metabolism. Reproductive attempts may be interrupted or deferred when food is scarce or when other physiological processes, such as thermoregulation or fattening, make extraordinary energetic demands. Food deprivation suppresses both ovulation and estrous behavior. The neural mechanisms controlling pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and, consequently, luteinizing hormone secretion and ovarian function appear to respond to minute-to-minute changes in the availability of metabolic fuels. It is not clear whether GnRH-secreting neurons are able to detect the availability of metabolic fuels directly or whether this information is relayed from detectors elsewhere in the brain. Although pregnancy is less affected by fuel availability, both lactational performance and maternal behaviors are highly responsive to the energy supply. When a reproductive attempt is made, changes in hormone secretion have dramatic effects on the partitioning and utilization of metabolic fuels. During ovulatory cycles and pregnancy, the ovarian steroids, estradiol and progesterone, induce coordinated changes in the procurement, ingestion, metabolism, storage, and expenditure of metabolic fuels. Estradiol can act in the brain to alter regulatory behaviors, such as food intake and voluntary exercise, as well as adenohypophyseal and autonomic outputs. At the same time, ovarian hormones act on peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, and liver to influence the metabolism, partitioning and storage of metabolic fuels. During lactation, the peptide hormones, prolactin and growth hormone, rather than estradiol and progesterone, are the principal hormones controlling partitioning and utilization of metabolic fuels. The interactions between metabolic fuels and reproduction are reciprocal, redundant, and ubiquitous; both behaviors and physiological processes play vital roles. Although there are species differences in the particular physiological and behavioral mechanisms mediating nutrition-reproduction interactions, two findings are consistent across species: 1) Reproductive physiology and behaviors are sensitive to the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels. 2) When reproductive attempts are made, ovarian hormones play a major role in the changes in ingestion, partitioning, and utilization of metabolic fuels. © 1992 Pergamon Press Ltd.","Adipose tissue; Energy balance; Estradiol; Estrous behavior; Estrous cycles; Exercise; Food intake; Gonadotropin-releasing hormone; Lactation; Luteinizing hormone; Maternal behavior; Menstrual cycles; Metabolic fuels; Ovulation; Progesterone; Thermoregulation","estradiol; gonadorelin; luteinizing hormone; progesterone; adipose tissue; energy balance; energy metabolism; estrus cycle; exercise; female; food intake; lactation; mammal; maternal behavior; menstrual cycle; neurotransmission; nonhuman; ovulation; priority journal; reproduction; review; sexual behavior; thermoregulation; Animal; Female; Human; Mammals; Metabolism; Reproduction; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026721095

Although the thermogenic response to food was not significantly lower in patients than in controls ( 51.6 ± 13.5 v 72.2 ± 8.8 kcal 6 h), patients exhibited a delayed and blunted increment of energy expenditure after the meal intake (P &lt; .025). The greater part of the glucose load was oxidized in patients (70.2 ± 3.9% v 50.4 ± 3.9% in controls; P &lt; .01), suggesting a defective glucose storage as glycogen. This result could be related to insulin resistance, which was evidenced by a large increase in glucose and insulin levels after the meal intake in patients (P ± .001). Conversely, lipid oxidation was sharply reduced and de novo lipogenesis occurred in patients, so that the rate of lipid storage was increased. The profiles of circulating levels of catecholamines, thyroid hormones (free thyroxine [FT4] and triiodothyronine [T3]), and glucagon were assayed during the test. Norepinephrine and glucagon levels remained higher in patients throughout the test (P &lt; .001), whereas thyroid hormones stayed in the same range in the two groups. After an initial increase, glucose levels decreased sharply, inducing an activation of counterregulatory hormones, glucagon, and notably, epinephrine, for which the increment was correlated with the decrease of glucose (r = -.917; P &lt; .001).

This has been driven not only by the ever present need to remain competitive and to perform more demanding tasks, but also by the realization that AUV technology has matured sufficiently to make a positive contribution to specific classes of marine work tasks. Many of these fall under the general category of survey operations. For these applications, the survey class AUV has subsystems which are common to all users.

The hearts were excised either after cold hyperkalemic cardioplegic arrest or after simple hypothermic arrest (25° C). In human myocardium, hypothermia alone preserved the adenosine triphosphate pool markedly. Even after 24 hours of cold storage adenosine triphosphate was still 9.5 ± 2.5 μmol/gm dry weight (58% of the preischemic value). The major fraction of catabolites remained nucleotides: adenosine triphosphate plus adenosine diphosphate plus adenosine monophosphate decreased only from 99% ± 1% (preischemic value) to 80% ± 13% of the total purine content. The remaining catabolites were mainly nucleosides (adenosine 0.2% ± 0.1% and inosine 19% ± 13% of the total purine content). Cardioplegic arrest before cold storage did not change the pattern of purine nucleotide catabolism in any respect (p > 0.05). In baboon myocardium, hypothermia alone preserved the adenosine triphosphate content somewhat less than in human myocardium. Adenosine triphosphate content after 24 hours was 5.2 ± 1.6 μmol/gm dry weight (40% of the preischemic value). The catabolism of adenosine triphosphate, however, did not proceed far beyond the level of adenosine monophosphate, so that the sum of nucleotides remained the same as in human hearts. Adenosine was 0.2% ± 0.3% and inosine 17% ± 4% of the total sum of purines. Also in the baboon heart, cardioplegia did not influence the pattern of catabolism significantly (p > 0.05). In the dog myocardium, hypothermia alone did not protect against severe catabolism of adenosine triphosphate. The adenosine triphosphate content at 24 hours of storage was 3.5 ± 2.5 μmol/gm dry weight (25% of the preischemic value). Catabolism of adenosine triphosphate proceeded far beyond the level of the nucleotides (63% ± 17% of the total sum of purines), resulting in an accumulation of adenosine and inosine (5% ± 4% and 30% ± 13% of the total sum of purines) and even of hypoxanthine (1% ± 1% of the total sum of purines). In the dog heart cardioplegic arrest inhibited adenosine triphosphate catabolism considerably. Adenosine triphosphate content at 24 hours was 8.1 ± 1.8 μmol/gm dry weight (56% of the preischemic value); 83% ± 5% of the total purine content remained present as nucleotides, and the nucleoside content was reduced to 2% ± 3% for adenosine and 11% ± 6% for inosine. Hypoxanthine was barely detectable. In conclusion, these data suggest that there is little effect of cardioplegic arrest on the catabolism of high-energy phosphates when human and baboon hearts are stored cold for 24 hours.",,"adenosine; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; cardioplegic agent; hypoxanthine; inosine; nucleoside; purine nucleotide; animal model; animal tissue; article; baboon; cardioplegia; catabolism; clinical article; controlled study; cryopreservation; dog; energy consumption; heart preservation; heart transplantation; high energy phosphate; human; human tissue; nonhuman; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026708114

Glycerol showed a comparable effect on Tm of trypsin. This effect on Tm of thrombin was not seen in the presence of excess sodium chloride (1·2 m) in aqueous buffer solution. The stabilizing effect of glycerol may be due to increased energy demand to unfold the protein molecule, as reflected by an increase in Tm. This stabilizing effect, as measured by Tm, was seen for other polyols, including sucrose, and was also dependent on the concentration of the stabilizing agent.

The presence of these piles may have an adverse effect on the quality of the air around them because of microorganisms surviving or growing on the wood. Depending on the type of wood used and the harvesting, handling and storage conditions, fuel wood chips have been found to support growth of a wide range of microorganisms, particularly fungi. In indoor storage areas of wood chips, spores, cells and cell particles can become airborne and be inhaled by persons working in these areas. A number of methods exist to sample and monitor airborne microbial particles. These methods, particularly if two or more are combined, are suitable to detect and quantify viable and non-viable airborne microbial particles, to determine particle sizes and, in most cases, to identify to the species level the microorganisms collected. Many of the fungi, actinomycetes and other bacteria which have been reported to occur on wood chips are potentially pathogenic or toxigenic. Inhalation of microbial spores, cells or fragments, especially at high concentrations and small particle sizes, can lead to serious allergic reactions or pulmonary diseases. There is evidence that even low concentrations of microbial aerosals may have sub-acute long-term health effects. Some microorganisms appear to produce toxins in sufficient concentration that toxicoses can be caused by them via the inhalation route. Microbially produced volatiles have also been suspected to cause adverse health effects. © 1992.",,"Aerosols--Concentration; Air Pollution--Indoor; Wood--Fuels; Fuel Wood Chips; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026685550

As ultrasonic wave propagates through a material, it creates mechanical vibration of material particles. Detailed development of the experimental technique, analysis of data, and results are described and illustrated in this paper. Some key experiments were carried out using a transmission method to obtain time-domain spectra. The time-domain responses were digitized; frequency spectra were obtained by Fourier transformation. Food materials studied included cheese and dough of various moisture contents. Good qualitative agreement was found between the ultrasonic technique and traditional rheometry.

A power factor equal to one would lead to optimal operation. However, the zero crossing of the AC source voltage introduces the need to store energy. Bulky low-frequency storage elements increase the specific volume and weight of the converter, while the exchange of energy with storage elements decreases the overall efficiency. The energy stored in the resonant circuit is fundamentally too low to solve this problem. The stored energy in the output capacitor necessary to decrease the high-frequency ripple voltage is available for these purposes.

We then demonstrate that, at these speeds, the non-propulsion energy requirements severely limit the ultimate range. We next discuss strategies for implementing navigation and control systems at power levels of 0.1 to 1 Watt. We present systems which are based on existing technologies in use in various areas of oceanographic research but not generally utilized in the AUV community.

To test this hypothesis in man, we measured insulin sensitivity (by euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of tritiated glucose) before and after short-term administration of a nicotinic-acid derivative (Acipimox) in 10 steroid-treated, kidney transplant patients with insulin resistance. Thirty-five healthy subjects served as controls. Six of them reveived Acipimox. Total body glucose metabolism was reduced in steroid-treated patients compared with control subjects (41.7 ± 3.3 v 50.0 ± 2.2 μmol/kg lean body mass [LBM] · min, P < .05). The reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was mainly due to an impairment in nonoxidative glucose metabolism (primarily glucose storage as glycogen) (18.3 ± 2.8 v 27.2 ± 2.2 μmol/kg LBM · min, P < .01). Acipimox lowered basal FFA concentrations (from 672 ± 63 to 114 ± 11 μmol/L, P < .05) and the rate of lipid oxidation measured in the basal state (1.5 ± 0.2 to 0.6 ± 0.1 μmol/kg LBM · min, P < .01) and during the clamp (0.7 ± 0.2 to 0.03 ± 0.2 μmol/kg LBM · min, P < .05). In addition, Acipimox administration normalized total glucose disposal (to 54.4 ± 4.4 μmol/kg LBM · min), mainly due to enhanced nonoxidative glucose metabolism (to 28.9 ± 3.9 μmol/kg LBM · min) in steroid-treated patients (both P < .05 v before Acipimox). In keeping with these findings, Acipimox also enhanced nonoxidative glucose metabolism by 28% in six control subjects (P < .05). Therefore, the improvement in nonoxidative glucose metabolism after Acipimox was unrelated to the degree of insulin resistance. We conclude that corticosteroids cause insulin resistance primarily by affecting glucose storage. Although there is no evidence that an operative glucose-FFA cycle would contribute to this defect, short-term lowering of FFAs by a nicotinic-acid derivative, Acipimox, restored glucose storage to normal. This effect may be unrelated to the FFA-lowering effect of the drug. © 1992.",,"acipimox; corticosteroid; nicotinic acid derivative; adult; article; calorimetry; clinical article; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; creatinine blood level; energy metabolism; fatty acid blood level; glucose blood level; glucose clamp technique; glucose infusion; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; glucose tolerance; glucose transport; human; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; kidney transplantation; lipid oxidation; oral glucose tolerance test; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; thermogenesis; triacylglycerol blood level; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Antilipemic Agents; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glucose; Human; Insulin Resistance; Middle Age; Pyrazines; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026665934

We therefore examined the effect of dietary fatty acid composition on serum Lp[a] levels in three strictly controlled experiments with healthy normocholesterolemic men and women. In Expt. I, 58 subjects consumed a control diet high in saturated fatty acids for 17 days. For the next 36 days, 6.5% of total energy intake from saturated fatty acids was replaced by monounsaturates plus polyunsaturates (monounsaturated fatty acid diet; n = 29) or by polyunsaturates alone (polyunsaturated fatty acid diet; n = 29). Both diets caused a slight, nonsignificant, increase in median Lp[a] levels, with no difference between diets. In Expt. II, 10% of energy from the cholesterol-raising saturated fatty acids (lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid) was replaced by oleic acid or by transmonounsaturated fatty acids. Each of the 59 participants received each diet for 3 weeks in random order. The median level of Lp[a] was 26 mg/l on the saturated fatty acid diet; it increased to 32 mg/l (P < 0.020) on the oleic acid diet and to 45 mg/l (P < 0.001) on the trans-fatty acid diet. The difference in Lp[a] between the trans-fatty acid and the oleic acid diets was also highly significant (P < 0.001). Expt. III involved 56 subjects; all received 8% of energy from stearic acid, from linoleic acid, or from trans-monounsaturates, for 3 weeks each. All other nutrients were equal. Median Lp[a] levels were 69 mg/l on both the stearate diet and linoleate diet, and rose to 85 mg/l (P < 0.01) on the trans diet. Changes in Lp[a] were positively related to initial levels. Samples from Expt. I had been stored for 43 months, those from Expt. II for 31 months, and samples from Expt. III for 14 months at -40°C or lower.

Diabetes was induced by intravenous streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Trained diabetic rats were run on a treadmill for 60 min, 27 m/min, 10% grade, 6 days/wk for 10 wk. Training of diabetic rats had no effect on glycemic control but decreased plasma lipids. In vivo myocardial long-chain acylcarnitine, acyl-CoA, and high-energy phosphate levels were similar in sedentary control, sedentary diabetic, and trained diabetic groups. The levels of myocardial triacylglycerol were similar in sedentary control and diabetic rats but decreased in trained diabetic rats. Hearts were perfused with buffer containing diabetic concentrations of glucose (22 mM) and palmitate (1.2 mM). D-[U-14C] glucose oxidation rates (14CO2 production) were depressed in hearts from sedentary diabetic rats relative to sedentary control rats. Hearts from trained diabetic rats exhibited increased glucose oxidation relative to those of sedentary diabetic rats, but this improvement was below that of the sedentary control rats. [9,10-3H]palmitate oxidation rates (3H2O production) were identical in all three groups. These findings suggest that exercise training resulted in a partial normalization of myocardial glucose utilization in diabetic rats.","diabetic cardiomyopathy; glucose and fatty acid oxidation; hyperlipidemia","acylcarnitine; long chain fatty acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; fatty acid oxidation; glucose blood level; glucose oxidation; glucose utilization; heart muscle metabolism; heart performance; high energy phosphate; hyperlipidemia; isolated heart; lipid blood level; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; treadmill exercise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026651874

Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) depletion and intracellular pH were studied within an 18-h-storage phase, by using the following preservation media: Eurocollins (EC), UW Lactobionate (UW) and Bretschneider's solution (HTK). Values obtained after 8-h ischemia were chosen to estimate the performance of the various media: NTP levels were 37 ± 7%, 10 ± 5% and 0% of control levels, respectively, in livers stored in UW, HTK and EC solutions. pHin reached values of 7.15 ± 0.10 in UW and HTK, and 6.96 ± 0.10 in EC-stored livers. Ischemic damage was assessed by reperfusing the stored organ with Krebs medium: NTP recovery was around 70 ± 20% for the three solutions used. Recovery of pHin was near the control value (7.23 ± 0.08), except for EC solution (7.05 ± 0.20). The main results are that (i) the rates of NTP and pHin decrease are strongly dependent on the nature of the preservation solution, whereas (ii) NTP recovery is not significantly different during post-ischemic reperfusion. With regard to animal survival, UW solution is at present considered largely superior to EC medium for liver preservation. Thus, our data suggest that the rates of NTP depletion and pHin fall during cold preservation could be both considered as better indicators assessing liver injury than the post-ischemic NTP recovery. © 1992.",,"euro collins solution; htk solution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; induced hypothermia; liver preservation; liver transplantation; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; rat; reperfusion; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Energy Metabolism; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypothermia; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Phosphorus; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Reperfusion Injury; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026650279

It is then mixed and burned with a small amount of gas in a combustor in order to heat the air.

Because the heating and air conditioning (HAC) systems are electrically powered, vehicle range is reduced when the HAC system is operating. While air conditioning power and energy demands in the contemporary gasoline powered vehicle are comparable in magnitude to the power and energy levels needed to propel the vehicle at level road load cruising conditions, HAC energy demand levels of this magnitude are not acceptable for battery electric vehicles. Consequently, it is necessary to devise new approaches which significantly reduce the HAC energy requirements. Specifically, the summertime interior heat load must be reduced by limiting infrared (IR) energy transmission into the passenger compartment. Furthermore, heat pump efficiency needs improvement.

A significant finding is that long established models of material damage have survived the test of time very well. A new design regime referred to as Very High Temperature Design (VHTD) is identified. The characteristics of this regime are changing material properties which require some changes in philosophy in drafting of future codes, particularly in regard to definitions of yield strengths and other design allowables. Finally, there is some discussion of the more general use of the stress/strain plane, e.g. isochronous curves, for representation of very complex material constitutive behavior.

But many male mammals, including rhesus macaques (Macaco mulatta), undergo circannual weight changes concurrent with mating season activity. Four adult male rhesus macaques living in a heterosexual social group in an outdoor enclosure were studied over a 2-year period in order to ascertain potential mechanisms underlying seasonal weight changes. Alterations in weight were significantly correlated with changes in abdominal fat levels and in body mass index. Neither testosterone nor estradiol fluctuations were correlated with weight changes, but estradiol levels were significantly correlated with body mass index. The annual profile of changes in abdominal fat level reflected the annual profile of variation in circulating estradiol levels. The fatted male phenomenon appears to characterize circannual weight fluctuations in rhesus macaques. Seasonal weight changes resulting from fat deposition are suggested to provide a substrate for adipose tissue aromatization that yields elevated estradiol levels and enables males to forego feeding and concentrate their energy budgets on activities directly related to mate acquisition and retention. © 1992.",,"estradiol; testosterone; abdomen; animal experiment; animal tissue; aromatization; article; body mass; body weight; estradiol blood level; lipid storage; male; mating; nonhuman; priority journal; rhesus monkey; seasonal variation; skinfold thickness; testosterone blood level; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Body Composition; Body Weight; Energy Metabolism; Estradiol; Macaca mulatta; Male; Seasons; Sex Behavior, Animal; Skinfold Thickness; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Testosterone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026623029

However, in order to increase the value of wind energy to utilities, it is necessary to provide firm capacity during peak load periods. This paper investigates the technical and economic merits of several wind hybrid system configurations to meet this goal. A systems simulation model has been developed specifically for this study. The model includes hybrid configurations, using wind and Photovoltaics (PV) as the primary renewable energy sources combined with a natural-gas-fired combustion turbine (CT) and storage such as pumped hydro or batteries. A simple spread-sheet cost model is used to perform cost-of-energy (COE) analyses from the perspective of an independent power producer, who may be bidding on firm capacity. The model uses typical California seasonal and diurnal wind speed, and solar insolation distributions with corresponding utility load curves to estimate the COE for varying proportions of wind/PV capacity, the backup CT, and the storage system. A wind system without storage or CT backup is first analyzed as the baseline configuration. Results from a parametric study of a hybrid wind/CT generating station provide the COE estimates for stations with 0% to 100% CT backup for a range of fuel prices. In addition, pumped hydro and battery storage elements are modeled to determine their potential, improve profitability, and provide firm capacity. The intent is to identify practical hybrid configurations with the potential to profitably shift the intermittently generated energy to peak load periods in order to provide firm capacity. Results from a tradeoff study of the storage capacity provide a hybrid configuration with the best potential for profitability.",,"Electric Power Generation - Costs; Electric Utilities; Cost-of-Energy (COE) Analysis; Hybrid Wind Energy Systems; Systems Simulation Model; Wind Power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026622751

Approximately 60,000km of water networks have to be rehabilitated or replaced. Some 3 or 4 million water meters must be installed and the installations in buildings erected after 1960 replaced. Because of water shortage or inadequate water quality the long distance and district water systems have to be extended. Other important problems facing water supply in the eastern part of Germany are: Increasing the water storage capacity; improving the technical equipment for water storage; introducing process control in water supply systems (long distance and towns). These measures should result in: Decreasing water losses; reducing the specific water consumption; diminishing the rate of damage; improving the economic efficiency of water supply management; reducing energy consumption; improving the safety of water supply systems.Water supply and sewage treatment in the eastern part of Germany has until recently included 15 enterprises which correspond to the structure of 15 districts.

Free-convective buoyancy movements of the water around the outside of this coiled pipe (which was totally immersed in the store) occurred as a result of mains supply cold water (at 20°C) being forced internally through the pipe. The axis of the heat-exchanger's coil is oriented horizontally, and the heat-exchanger's inlet is arranged to be at its lowest level. The effect of insulating short lengths of the heat-exchanger's pipe upon the rate of heat recovery was investigated. The purpose of this 'insulation' strategy for the heat exchanger was to prevent some of the heat gained by the water as it passes through the heat-exchanger's pipe being unintentionally returned to the store. Judicious positioning of the insulation has the effect of increasing the heat transfer rate along the exposed lengths of pipe, thereby enhancing the heat-exchanger's effectiveness. Irrespective of the flow rate of water forced through the heat-exchanger's pipe, the best performance of the heat exchanger was achieved when using a 150-mm length of rubber-foam pipe insulation (of 40 mm o.d. including the heat-exchanger's external diameter) at the lowest level of the heat exchanger and near the vertical centre-line of the tank, i.e. in the path of the descending cooled stream of water in the store.

The basic methods of heating and cooling of buildings are solar radiation, outgoing longwave radiation, water evaporation, and nocturnal radiation cooling. A Trombe‐Michel wall consists of a large concrete mass, exposed to sunlight through large, south‐facing windows; it is used for heating buildings. Solar absorption cooling and solar dehumidification and evaporative cooling are two approaches that utilize solar energy for the generation of the working fluid and the cooling of dwellings. Outgoing longwave radiation is the most practical way of cooling buildings in desert climates and is effective on roof surfaces, emitting the radiations from the surface of earth to the atmosphere and to outer space. Water evaporation in desert coolers is the usual method of cooling in arid regions. Nocturnal radiation both heats in winter and cools in summer, in suitable climates, and does so with no nonrenewable energy other than a negligible amount required to move the insulation twice a day. The study of 24 different locations in Libya divides the country into regions with distinct passive strategies. The northern region and the Mediterranean coast need passive heating. The buildings in this region should restrict conductive heat flow, prevent infiltration and promote solar heat gains. The southern region, a part of the Sahara desert, needs passive cooling. The buildings in this region need high thermal mass and should promote natural ventilation, restrict solar heat gains and encourage evaporative and radiant cooling. The difficulties encountered in passive solar design are the large exposed area required with suitable orientation for the collection of energy and the large space requirement for the storage of thermal energy. This paper reviews these passive systems and discusses suitable strategies to be adopted for Libya.

Don stand, thinned to 450 trees ha-1 and pruned to heights up to 5 m. Tree leaf and slash surface area indices, on a one-sided area basis, were 1.7 and 3.5, respectively. Slash surface area was principally (about 90%) comprised of leaves. A total of 1154 mm of rain was recorded on 163 days during 336 events. Median event size and rainfall intensity were 0.8 mm and 0.4 mm h-1, respectively. The measured fraction of rainfall intercepted by the tree canopy was 0.19. Stemflow was linearly related to rainfall, with maximum values (for rainfall of 91.4 mm) of 6.3 and 7.6 mm for trees that had been pruned to heights of 2-3 m and 3-5 m, respectively. Slash covered 60% of the ground, with interception being 11% of rainfall on a stand basis. Wetness sensors, located within the base of the tree canopy, were wet for 26% of the time. The fraction of wetness duration during darkness nearly coincided with the time fraction of dark hours. This result and the equal probability of rainfall throughout the day showed the importance of night-time interception and evaporation. Estimates of stand aerodynamic conductance for water vapour transfer, derived from six night-time canopy drying events, were proportional to wind speed and varied from 0.05 to 0.33 m s-1 (corresponding wind speeds were 1.2 ms-1 and 6.0 ms-1, respectively). During these events, there was no radiative energy so that evaporation was driven by convective energy, with vapour pressure deficit being typically 0.1 kPa. The effect of rainfall interception on the forest water balance was examined using a biophysical water balance model with parameters derived from the stand measurements. Although there was generally satisfactory agreement between modelled and independently measured two-weekly soil water storage over the year, annual evaporation of rainfall intercepted by the tree canopy modelled with the Penman equation was only 9% of rainfall (100 mm). This is attributed largely to an underestimation of wet tree canopy evaporation -during 15 days of higher-intensity rain when daily falls exceeded 20 mm. For the remaining 148 rain days, modelled wet tree canopy evaporation was generally close to the measured 19% of rainfall. Modelled annual wet canopy evaporation emanating from the slash was 116 mm (10% of rainfall). Modelled annual tree transpiration and understorey evaporation during fine periods were 367 and 328 mm. respectively. Annual soil drainage/water yield was 270 mm. Implications for the management of water yield from forested catchments are discussed. © 1992.",,"canopy evaporation; pine forest; rain interception; stem flow; water balance; Forestry; Runoff; Soils--Moisture; Trees; Water Resources--Evapotranspiration; Wind Effects; Rainfall Interception; Slash; Soil Drainage; Wet Tree Canopy; Rain and Rainfall",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026614498

This provides a unique market opportunity for developers of electric vehicles but substantial improvements in the technology are probably required if it is to be successfully exploited. There are around a dozen types of battery that are potentially relevant to road vehicles but, at the present, lead/acid and sodium-sulphur come closest to combining acceptable performance, life and cost. To develop an efficient, lightweight electric motor system requires up-to-date techniques of magnetics design, and the latest power-electronic and microprocessor control methods. Brushless machines, coupled with solid-state inverters, offer the most economical solution for mass production, even though their development costs are higher than for direct-current commutator machines. Fitted to a small car, even the highest energy-density batteries will only provide around 200 km average range before recharging. Therefore, some form of supplementary on-board power generation will probably be needed to secure widespread acceptance by the driving public. Engine-driven generators of quite low power can achieve useful increases in urban range but will fail to qualify as 'zero-emitting'. On the other hand, if the same function could be economically performed by a small fuel-cell using hydrogen derived from a methanol reformer, then most of the flexibility provided by conventional vehicles would be retained. The market prospects for electric cars would then be greatly enhanced and their dependence on very advanced battery technology would be reduced. © 1992.",,"Electric Batteries, Secondary--Performance; Fuel Cells--Applications; Air Pollution - Legislation; Air Pollution - Particulate Emissions; Electric Motors - Efficiency; Fuel Cells - Industrial Applications; Storage Battery Vehicles; Electric Cars; Sodium-sulfur Cells; Traction Cells; Electric Vehicle Drive System; Zero Emitting Vehicles; Storage Battery Vehicles; Automobiles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026610101

Renewable shares of 13% (2005), 36% (2025) and 69% (2050) on the total energy demand will lead to hydrogen shares of 11% in 2025 and 34% in 2050. An essential part of such a strategy is the very efficient conversion of hydrogen into useful energies like electricity and heat mainly by fuel cells in the co-generation mode. Fuel cells offer considerably higher conversion efficiencies with respect to electricity and also allow the use of waste heat at different temperature levels. Whereas low- and medium-temperature fuel cells will have advantages if pure hydrogen is used, high-temperature fuel cells offer the possibility to perform a mixed biogas-hydrogen conversion with a high energy yield.

Alcohol interferes in various ways with the complex system of nutritional immunomodulation. Alcohol acts directly on mechanical barriers in the gastrointestinal tract and increases permeability of intestinal walls, which results in a reduced exclusion of immunogenic material in the intestine. Alcohol further affects granulocytopoiesis and suppresses various immune functions. Indirect effects on the immune response are caused by alcohol-induced malnutrition. Heavy alcohol abuse is associated with a high energy intake derived by alcohol and an inadequate intake of protein, vitamins and minerals. In addition, alcohol abuse impairs absorption, utilization, storage and excretion of nutrients, which together with inadequate nutrient intakes results in nutritional immunosuppression. The high incidence of infections in alcoholics could be one consequence of the alcohol-induced immunosuppression.","alcohol abuse; host defense; immunocompetence; immunotoxic effects; nutritional status","alcohol; alcohol abuse; conference paper; human; immunocompetence; nutrition; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026604297

The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 3-week swimming training programme would increase muscle glycogen stores in rats fed a high-fat (FAT) diet in resting conditions. Rats were fed either the FAT or CHO diet for 7 days ad libitum, and then were fed regularly twice a day (between 0800 and 0830 hours and 1800 and 1830 hours) for 32 days. During this period of regular feeding, half of the rats in both dietary groups had swimming training for 3 weeks and the other half were sedentary. The rats were not exercised for 48 h before sacrifice. All rats were killed 2 h after their final meal (2030 hours). The glycogen contents in red gastrocnemius muscle, heart and liver were significantly higher in sedentary rats fed the CHO diet than in those fed the FAT diet. Exercise training clearly increased glycogen content in soleus, red gastrocnemius and heart muscle in rats fed the CHO diet. In rats fed the FAT diet, however, training did not increase glycogen content in these muscles or the heart. Exercise training resulted in an 87% increase of total glycogen synthase activity in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats fed the CHO diet. However, this was not observed in rats fed the FAT diet. The total glycogen phosphorylase activity in the gastrocnemius muscle of the rats of both dietary groups was increased approximately twofold by training. These results suggested that muscle glycogen was enhanced in rats fed the CHO diet and that the glycogen content of the muscle of rats fed the FAT diet was not increased by exercise training. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Fat diet; Muscle glycogen; Training","3 hydroxybutyric acid; fatty acid; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; glycogen synthase; immunoreactive insulin; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; blood analysis; body mass; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; fatty acid blood level; female; gastrocnemius muscle; glucose blood level; glycogen analysis; heart; heart muscle; lipid diet; liver; male; muscle; muscle exercise; muscle mass; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; soleus muscle; swimming; training; Animal; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glycogen; Glycogen Synthase; Hydroxybutyrates; Insulin; Liver; Male; Muscles; Phosphorylases; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Rest; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026601985

Paired in vivo studies on platelets labeled with indium 111 after 14-day storage demonstrated higher recoveries (mean ± SD) of 23% ± 9% and longer survivals of 109 ± 59 hours for the test group versus 8% ± 10% and 19 ± 22 hours, respectively (p &lt; 0.01), for the control group (synthetic medium with no inhibitors and use of standard containers). The improved viability was associated with a significantly lower glycolytic rate; better maintenance of other in vitro parameters including respiratory activity, adenosine triphosphate levels, hypotonic shock response, surface glycoprotein lb (by flow cytometry); and improved preservation of morphologic integrity (p &lt; 0.05). In particular, a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.91) was observed between in vivo recoveries and the fraction of platelets negative for glycoprotein lb.

The diets were given continuously for 18 hours in a randomized cross-over study on 2 consecutive days. Energy supply (kcal/d) was adjusted individually to meet the energy expenditure measured on the preceding day after an overnight fast and was 1,647 ± 129 (SEM) for the carbohydrate-based diet and 1,655 ± 131 for the fat-based diet. Oxidation rates (kcal/d) for carbohydrate (carbohydrate-based diet, 525 ± 70; fat-based diet, 363 ± 84) were different between the diets (P < .05), whereas no difference could be found for fat (carbohydrate-based diet, 820 ± 117; fat-based diet, 968 ± 136) and protein (carbohydrate-based diet, 252 ± 29; fat-based diet, 236 ± 23). However, during carbohydrate-based feeding, carbohydrate balance (288 ± 93 kcal/d) and fat balance (-327 ± 107 kcal/d) were significantly different from zero (P < .05), indicating continuous oxidation of endogenous fat and storage of administered glucose. During the fat-based diet, carbohydrate and fat balances were not different from zero. A correlation between energy and substrate balances was not seen during either diet. From these findings, it is concluded that (1) in patients with infections, up to 55% of energy intake can be given as fat; and (2) during feeding with the carbohydrate-based diet, a substantial part of the delivered glucose is stored as glycogen and endogenous fat is used for energy production. © 1992.",,"carbohydrate; lipid; adolescent; adult; aged; article; calorimetry; clinical article; controlled study; diet; energy metabolism; female; human; infection; injury; male; priority journal; Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Comparative Study; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Enteral Nutrition; Female; Human; Lactates; Male; Middle Age; Respiration; Septicemia; Wounds and Injuries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026592582

We have extended these findings to in vivo systems. We show that increased growth and accumulation of DNA fragments occur in most organs of ad libitum-fed animals obtained from three mouse models of degenerative diseases in adult animals: glomerulonephritis in NZB/NZW F1 and MRL/n strains, the induction of lymphadenopathy by retrovirus LP-BM5 in C57BL/6J mice and induction of obesity in C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet. With the virus, changes are most marked in lymphoid organs in the C57BL/6J strain. With the obesity model, essentially all organs, including aorta, are affected, both in the C57BL/6J strain and also in the glomerulonephritic NZB/NZW F1 and MRL/n strains. In addition, we showed that these lesions, as well as the DNA fragmentation, can be reversed in 2 to 4 weeks by restricting energy intake to 65% of ad libitum feeding or by exercise sufficient to remove storage fat. These observations suggest that excessive organ growth in mature animals, as activated by either excessive energy input or by retrovirus, leads eventually to excessive nucleosome endonuclease activity with resultant cell death.",,"animal experiment; apoptosis; article; caloric intake; controlled study; degenerative disease; growth; male; mouse; nonhuman; overnutrition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026590144

Left ventricular function was assessed at 37° C with a crystalloid perfusate, before cardioplegic arrest and after 20 hours of low- flow perfusion (1.5 ml/min) with continuing arrest at 4° C, and after this period, again at 37° C with a crystalloid perfusate. Four groups (n = 8/group) of hearts were studied with four cardioplegic solutions: St. Thomas' Hospital solution alone, St. Thomas' Hospital solution with aspartate 20 mmol/L, St. Thomas' Hospital solution with glucose 20 mmol/L, and St. Thomas' Hospital solution plus both aspartate and glucose (20 mmol/L each). The addition of glucose to St. Thomas' Hospital solution made no significant difference in the recovery of aortic flow rates (17.7% ± 8.6% and 21.6% ± 7.8% of prearrest values), but when aspartate or aspartate and glucose were present, hearts showed significant improvements (89.8% ± 5.2% and 85.0% ± 6.2%, respectively). These improvements were associated with a reduction in the decline of myocardial high-energy phosphates during reperfusion, a reduction in cellular uptake of Na+ and Ca++, and a reduction in ultrastructural damage.

Livers were stored up to 48 hr and reperfused after a period of hypothermic storage of 1, 7, 14, or 21 hr. In a parallel series of experiments, with livers stored under identical conditions, repeated proton relaxometry measurements (0, 1, 7, 14, 24, 32, 48 hr) were undertaken; and ATP, ADP, AMP (Atkinson's energy charge), and water content of livers, as well as pH of storage solution, were estimated. Based on a strong correlation between proton spin-spin relaxation time T2 and tissue water content (edema), this new method may be useful to estimate the amount of cell swelling during hypothermic storage from a surgical biopsy of about 200 mg within a few minutes. There was, however, no significant correlation found between energy charge and/or pH and water content, T2, or bile flow.

Anaerobic capacity has a relatively less important role, but may be of greater importance today with the faster race velocities resulting from the new skiing techniques of ski skating. Although use of the ski skating techniques results in faster race velocities than the classical techniques, it has been found that under some conditions the double-pole technique is more economical than other skiing techniques. It is suggested that this results from a more effective storage and recovery of elastic energy, a greater proportion of the forces being directed along the line of travel, and a lower air resistance due to greater trunk and hip flexion with the double-pole technique. The greater economy of the double-pole technique suggests that this may be advantageous in certain race conditions if the upper body is adequately prepared. The greater propulsive forces generated with the upper body with ski skating also suggest that training of the upper body should receive more emphasis. The potential cardiovascular adaptations from cross-country ski training appear to be similar for the classical and skating techniques, yet training specificity is important for optimal performance. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cross-country skiing; Economy; Lactate; Oxygen uptake; Roller skiing; Skiing techniques","age; anaerobic capacity; anthropometry; biomechanics; cardiovascular system; competition; energy resource; hip; human; joint function; muscle strength; normal human; oxygen consumption; performance; physiology; race; review; skiing; sport injury; technique; training; trunk; velocity; Biomechanics; Exercise; Heart Rate; Human; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Endurance; Skiing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026570980

To address this question, we measured insulin sensitivity (euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of tritiated glucose) and insulin secretion (hyperglycemic clamp) in three groups of subjects: (1) 10 kidney transplant patients with normal oral glucose tolerance, (2) 14 patients who developed diabetes after kidney transplantation, and (3) 10 healthy controls. Glucose utilization, primarily storage of glucose as glycogen, was reduced by 34% in kidney transplant patients with normal glucose tolerance when compared with healthy control subjects (18.2±2.9 vs. 27.5±2.7 µM/L; P<0.05). Insulin secretion was normal in relation to the degree of insulin resistance in transplanted non-diabetic patients, thus maintaining a normal oral glucose tolerance. Development of transplantation diabetes was associated with only minor further deterioration of glucose storage (14.7±2.7 μmM/L; P<0.001 vs. control subjects), whereas first-phase, second-phase, and glucagon-stimulated insulin secretion measured during hyperglycemic clamping (incremental area under the insulin curve 287±120,1275±419, and 3515±922 pM) became impaired as compared with nondiabetic kidney transplant patients (769±216, 3084±545, and 6293±533 pM; P<0.05).

Most studies show that energy expenditure of nongrowing LBW infants is 45 to 55 kcal/kg/day. Hence, for energy equilibrium, energy intake minus energy losses (i.e., metabolizable energy intake) must be at least 50 kcal/kg/day. Intakes above this amount result in energy storage or positive energy balance, whereas lesser intakes necessitate mobilization of endogenous energy stores (negative energy balance). Some of the problems of achieving positive energy balance in LBW infants (e.g., feeding intolerance and fear of necrotizing enterocolitis) can be circumvented by use of parenterally delivered nutrients. On balance, virtually all LBW infants will tolerate parenteral amino acid, glucose, and lipid intakes, respectively, of 2,5, and 1 gm/kg/day or an energy intake of about 40 kcal/kg/day. It usually is possible to increase energy intake of most infants by an additional 10 kcal/kg/day. Whether this is achieved with enterally delivered nutrients or additional parenteral glucose or lipid intake, including the necessary modifications to enhance tolerance (e.g., insulin, 20% vs 10% lipid emulsions, and lipid emulsions containing medium-chain fatty acids), must be decided for each infant based on his or her underlying condition, likelihood of tolerating either substrate, and the impact of intolerance on the underlying condition. The consequences of not providing an essential nutrient during the immediate postnatal period also must be considered. The fact that essential fatty acid deficiency develops more rapidly in infants receiving isocaloric (60 kcal/kg/day) parenteral intakes with versus without amino acids, the likelihood that brain growth continues despite negative energy balance, and the possibility that LBW infants may not be able to desaturate/elongate linoleic and linolenic acids to the more unsaturated, longer-chain fatty acids that are deposited in the developing brain suggest that these infants may require exogenous intakes of specific fatty acids. © 1992 Mosby-Year Book, Inc.",,"amino acid; essential fatty acid; glucose; polyunsaturated fatty acid; brain development; conference paper; energy balance; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy expenditure; food composition; growth; head circumference; human; infant; low birth weight; newborn; parenteral nutrition; priority journal; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Enteral Nutrition; Fatty Acids; Human; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Parenteral Nutrition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026568450

Zinc deficiency also causes abnormal fetal growth. Moreover, alcohol has been shown in some rodent studies to impair placental transport of zinc. The purpose of this investigation was to define better normal human placental zinc transport and the effects of alcohol on this process. To do this we employed the isolated perfused single cotyledon human term placental model, as well as the cultured human cytotrophoblast. In the perfused placental studies, it was shown that zinc is transferred by the placenta very slowly, about 6% of the rate of transport of antipyrine, a freely diffusible marker. The transfer is comparable in both directions, maternal to fetal and the reverse. Zinc does not cross the placenta against a zinc concentration gradient, in either direction. Rather there is good evidence of significant uptake (storage) of the zinc by the placenta on the recirculating compartment side of gradient studies. Moreover, when the perfusion fluid was low (0.2 g/100 ml) in albumin, about twice as much zinc accumulated in the perfused cotyledon and there was less zinc in the maternal compartment, as compared to perfusion with ten‐fold higher (2.0 g/100 ml) albumin concentrations. Thus, ligand binding in the perfusate importantly influences placental zinc uptake. Interestingly, however, the increased placental binding of zinc did not translate into greater transfer of zinc to the fetal compartment. Thus, normal zinc transfer is slow, equal bidirectionally, and dependent on ligand binding in perfusate and placenta. Equal transport in both directions and absence of accumulation of zinc against a concentration gradient at “physiologic” zinc concentrations are not consistent with active (energy dependent) transfer. Alcohol (400 mg/100 ml) added to the perfusate did not impair placental zinc transfer from the maternal to fetal circuits over 4 h. Also, net uptake of zinc by human placental trophoblast exposed to 200 mg/100 ml alcohol concentration for 48 h was comparable to control values. Thus, alcohol exposure over this time in both experimental systems did not impair zinc transport by the term human placenta. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

Laboratories of Physiology, Universities of St Etienne and Lyon, France and Departments of Biology and Physical Activity, University of Jyväskylä, Finland. Six subjects performed a first series of vertical plantar flexions and a second series of vertical rebounds, both involving muscle triceps surae exclusively. Vertical displacements, vertical forces and ankle angles were recorded during the entire work period of 60 seconds per series. In addition, expired gases were collected during the test and recovery for determination of the energy expenditure. Triceps surae was mechanically modelled with a contractile component and with an elastic component. Mechanical behaviour and work of the different muscle components were determined in both series. The net muscular efficiency calculated from the work performed by the centre of gravity was 17.5±3.0% (mean ± SD) in plantar flexions and 29.9 ± 4.8% in vertical rebounds. The net muscle efficiency calculated from the work performed by the contractile component was 17.4 %% 2.9% in plantar flexions and 16.1 ± 1.47; in vertical rebounds. These results suggest that the muscular efficiency differences do not reflect muscle contractile component efficiency but essentially the storage and recoil of elastic energy. This is supported by the relationship (P < 0.01) found in vertical rebounds between the extra work and the elastic component work. A detailed observation of the mechanical behaviour of muscle mechanical components showed that the strategy to maximize the elastic work depends also on the force‐velocity characteristics of the movement and that the eccentric‐concentric work of the contractile component does not always correspond respectively to the ankle extension‐flexion. © 1992 Scandinavian Physiological Society","elastic energy; muscle efficiency; stretch shortening cycle; triceps surae","adult; article; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; human; human experiment; male; muscle stretching; normal human; priority journal; skeletal muscle; Adult; Ankle Joint; Biomechanics; Elasticity; Exercise; Human; Locomotion; Male; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026561692

The potential risks have been expressed as 'risk potentials' or 'person equivalents'. These are purely theoretical units and represent only an attempt to quantify the potential impact of different sources and substances on human health. Existing concentration limits for effects on human health are used. The philosophy behind establishing limits for several carcinogenic chemicals is based on a linear dose-effect curve. That is, no lower concentration of no effect exists and one has to accept a certain small risk by accepting the concentration limit. This is in line with the establishment of limits for radiation. Waste products from coal combustion have the highest potential risk among the fossil fuel alternatives. The highest risk is caused by metals, and the fly ash represents the effluent stream giving the largest contribution to the potential risk. The waste from nuclear power production has a lower potential risk than coal if today's limit values are used. If one adjusts the limits for radiation dose and the concentration limit values so that a similar risk is accepted by the limits, nuclear waste seems to have a much higher potential risk than waste from fossil fuel. The possibility that such risk estimates may be used as arguments for safe storage of the different types of waste is discussed. In order to obtain the actual risk from the potential risk, the dispersion of the waste in the environment and its uptake and effects in man have to be taken into account. © 1992.","carcinogenicity; fossil fuel; nuclear waste; risk analysis; toxicity; waste management","fossil fuel; article; carcinogenicity; energy resource; environmental health; nuclear industry; nuclear power plant; radioactive waste; risk factor; toxicity; Environmental Pollution; Fossil Fuels; Humans; Industrial Waste; Infant, Newborn; Nuclear Reactors; Power Plants; Radioactive Waste; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026560111

Drexel Ave, Chicago, IL 60637, United States","Previous studies of total sleep deprivation (TSD) and paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) in the rat by the disk-over-water method have indicated that both produce changes in thermoregulation. In both kinds of deprivation, there was a progressive, large increase in heat production as indicated by measures of energy expenditure (EE). In TSD there was an initial increase in waking body temperature (T(b)) followed by a later decrease; in PSD there was only a progressive decrease. The increases in heat production far in excess of heat storage indicated increased heat loss in both groups. Because the increase in T(b) in TSD rats was supported by ambient temperature choices (T(ch)) in a thermal gradient that became progressively higher during deprivation, an increase in waking temperature setpoint (T(SET)) was indicated. Because the rats resorted to behavioral warming in spite of greatly increased thermogenesis, they must have had some failure to retain body heat. Prior to the present study, changes in T(SET), had not been evaluated in PSD rats. Because they had not shown increases in T(b), PSD rats might not have an elevated T(SET), which would indicate a functional difference between PS and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Also, an evaluation of behavioral thermoregulation in PSD rats would clarify whether their T(b) decline resulted from excessive heat loss or from a lowered T(SET). To evaluate changes in heat flow and T(SET), EE, T(b) and T(ch) were measured in five PSD rats and their yoked control (PSC) rats. PSD rats showed progressive increases in EE and decreases in T(b) as in the earlier PSD study; T(ch) rose progressively. PSC rats showed minimal changes in all three parameters. Because PSD rats showed increased EE and T(ch), which oppose T(b) decline, their decline in T(b) must be ascribed to excessive heat loss rather than to decreased thermogenesis or a lowered T(SET). Heat loss deficits and T(SET) change in PSD rats were compared to those of previously studied TSD rats. A positive correlation between EE and T(ch) in both groups was consistent with an elevation of thermogenesis and behavioral warming in response to a heat retention deficit. At T(ch) near baseline, where T(b) was assumed to be near T(SET), T(b) was increased in TSD rats but not in PSD rats, indicating that T(SET) was increased by TSD and not by PSD. Therefore, in TSD rats the increased T(ch) and EE may be viewed as attempts to reach an elevated T(SET) in the face of excessive heat loss. In PSD rats, elevated T(ch) and EE are also responses to excessive heat loss, but the apparent target is to maintain baseline T(b) rather than an elevated T(SET). Because both TSD and PSD rats lost PS, but NREM sleep was well preserved in PSD, the elevation of T(SET) in TSD rats was more closely associated with the loss of NREM sleep, whereas the difficulty in retaining body heat can be ascribed to the loss of PS.","Energy consumption; Heat loss; Paradoxical sleep deprivation; Sleep deprivation; Temperature regulation; Temperature setpoint; Thermal preference","animal experiment; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; REM sleep; sleep deprivation; thermoregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026559795

Lp values were measured at four temperatures for each oocyte between 37°C and 10°C, and the temperature‐related Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) calculated. It was apparent that individual oocytes exhibited a wide range of Lp values; at 37°C Lp values ranged between 0.33 and 1.80 μm/atm/min.

Because of the known effects of long-term storage on metabolic activities, we studied the effects of our lyophilization process on RBC metabolism. Of all the metabolic enzymes studied, only triosephosphate isomerase (D-glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1), enolase (2-phospho-D- glyceratehydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.11), and pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate O2- phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) were decreased when compared with fresh control nonlyophilized RBC. The activities of these enzymes did not differ significantly from those of blood bank RBC. Concentrations of high-energy intermediates, ATP, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, along with lactate and ATP production were decreased in lyophilized RBC. No enzymes of the pentose phosphate shunt were altered during lyophilization. In addition, our data show that lyophilized RBC possess an intact capacity to (i) synthesize adenine nucleotides and (ii) reduce MetHb to Hb and, thus, maintain the Hb in a functional physiologic state similar to fresh nonlyophilized RBC. The present study demonstrates the possibility of lyophilizing RBC in a manner that maintains normal metabolic and enzymatic function upon rehydration.","glycolytic enzymes; lyophilization; methemoglobin; pentose phosphate shunt","2,3 diphosphoglyceric acid; adenine nucleotide; adenosine triphosphate; enolase; glycolytic enzyme; hemoglobin; methemoglobin; pyruvate kinase; triosephosphate isomerase; adult; article; blood bank; controlled study; enzyme activity; erythrocyte metabolism; erythrocyte preservation; freeze drying; glucose metabolism; human; human cell; normal human; nucleotide metabolism; pentose phosphate cycle; priority journal; reduction; regression analysis; rehydration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026537669

The new platelet‐additive solution (termed Seto solution) contained 90 mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 3mM MgCl2, 17 mM tri‐sodium citrate, 4.9 mM NaH2PO4, 20.1 mM Na2HPO4, 23 mM sodium acetate, 28.8 mM maltose, and 23.5 mM glucose with a pH of 7.4. The solution was sterilized by autoclaving in plastic bags in nitrogen to prevent glucose caramelization at high pH. Plasma‐poor platelet concentrates prepared by adding Seto solution to the pelleted platelet buttons were stored in a LE‐2 polyolefin bag at 22 °C with constant agitation for 5 days. The platelets suspended in Seto solution maintained oxygen consumption at a rate of 1.1 nmol/min/109 platelets after 5‐day storage, with glucose consumption and lactate production rates of 0.5 ± 0.2 and 1.2 ± 0.2 nmol/min/109 platelets, respectively. This resulted in a final mean pH of 7.0. Those suspended in AR solution ceased glycolysis within 3 days because residual plasma glucose had been consumed. This was associated with decreases in percent hypotonic shock response and aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and collagen. Lactate dehydrogenase discharge in AR solution was 5 and 8 times higher at day 3 and day 5, respectively, than that of Seto solution. Morphologically, there were no ballooned platelets after storage in Seto solution. Platelets stored in Seto solution were nearly equal to those stored in plasma. Conclusions: Steam‐sterilized Seto‐additive solution caused better storage of platelets for 5 days than AR solution, suggesting that glucose is important for optimal storage. Phosphate acts as an effective buffer and maltose stabilizes platelet volumes. © 1992 Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,"acetic acid; citrate trisodium; disodium hydrogen phosphate; gluconate sodium; glucose; lactate dehydrogenase; magnesium chloride; maltose; potassium chloride; sodium chloride; sodium dihydrogen phosphate; thrombocyte concentrate; article; autoclave; cytolysis; enzyme release; glycolysis; human; human cell; oxygen consumption; ph; priority journal; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte preservation; thrombocyte structure; thrombocyte volume; Blood Platelets; Blood Preservation; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glucose Solution, Hypertonic; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Isotonic Solutions; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Oxygen Consumption; Platelet Count; Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins; Sterilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026536474

In UP, baseline metabolic rate (MR) was 4.1 ± 0.2 kJ/min and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) 0.97 ± 0.02. During the final 30 minutes of hyperinsulinemia MR rose by 0.32 ± 0.07 kJ/min (p < .01) and RER rose to 1.09 ± 0.03 (p < .01). GD was 61 ± 3 μmol/kg per minute, GO 35 ± 1 μmol/kg per minute, and GS 26 ± 4 μmol/kg per minute. The energy cost of glucose storage as glycogen was 0.15 kJ/min, and as lipid was 0.2 kJ/min. In WGP baseline MR was 4.5 ± 0.4 kJ/min and RER was 0.91 ± 0.03. During hyperinsulinemia MR rose by 0.63 ± 0.2 kJ/min, RER rose to 0.93 ± 0.02, GD was 53 ± 4 μmol/kg per minute, GO was 30 ± 3 μmol/kg per minute, and GS was 23 ± 1 μmol/kg per minute. The energy cost for this glucose storage was 0.22 kJ/min. Therefore, during hyperinsulinemia in UP, GD, and TR are similar, but GO is greater and GS is less than previously reported in healthy subjects. However, this TR is entirely accounted for by the energy cost of glucose storage with no evidence of facultative thermogenesis. In WGP, all responses were similar to those in healthy subjects, and the TR was in excess of that required of the energy cost of glucose storage.",,"glucose; insulin; adult; aged; article; body weight; clinical article; female; glucose metabolism; human; hyperinsulinemia; male; priority journal; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026531633

Rat hearts (n = 8 per group) were excised and subjected to immediate arrest with St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution (2 minutes at 4° C) with or without addition of monosodium aspartate (20 mmol/L). The hearts were then immersed in the same solution for 8 hours (4° C) before heterotopic transplantation into the abdomen of homozygous rats and reperfusion in vivo for 24 hours. The hearts were then excised and perfused in the Langendorff mode (20 minutes). Addition of aspartate to St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution gave a small but significant improvement in left ventricular developed pressure, which recovered to 82 ± 3 mm Hg compared with 70 ± 2 mm Hg in control hearts (p < 0.05). However, coronary flow and high-energy phosphate content were similar in both groups. In subsequent experiments hearts (n = 8 per group) were excised, arrested (2 minutes at 4° C) with St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution containing a 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mmol/L concentration of aspartate, stored for 8 hours at 4° C, and then reperfused for 35 minutes. A bell-shaped dose-response curve was obtained, with maximum recovery in the 20 mmol/L aspartate group (cardiac output, 48 ± 5 ml/min versus 32 ± 5 ml/min in the aspartate-free control group; p < 0.05). However, additional experiments showed that a comparable improvement could be achieved simply by increasing the sodium concentration of St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution by 20 mmol/L. Similarly, if sodium aspartate (20 mmol/L) was added and the sodium content of the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution reduced by 20 mmol/L, no significant protection was observed when recovery was compared with that of unmodified St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution alone. In still further studies, hearts (n = 8 per group) were perfused in the working mode at either high (>80 ml/min) or low (<50 ml/min) left atrial filling rates. Under these conditions, if functional recovery was expressed as a percentage of preischemic function, artifactually high recoveries could be obtained in the low-filling-rate group. In conclusion, assessment of the protective properties of organic additives to cardioplegic solutions requires careful consideration of (1) the consequences of coincident changes in ionic composition and (2) the characteristics of the model used for assessment.",,"aspartate sodium; cardioplegic agent; animal tissue; article; coronary artery blood flow; cryopreservation; dose response; heart function; heart output; heart preservation; heart protection; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026528560

The second, a prospective study, validated this estimate and quantifies the long-term adaptations in fat oxidation resulting from body fat loss. Twentyfour moderately obese women were studied under controlled dietary conditions at stable weight before and after mean weight and fat losses of 12.7 and 9.8 kg, respectively.

Two glucose clamp protocols together with continuous indirect calorimetry were performed to examine whether reduced rates of glucose oxidation and/or nonoxidative glucose metabolism explain insulin resistance in liver cirrhosis. Using a 4-hour, two-step protocol (0-2 hours, plasma glucose 5.2 mmol/L, plasma insulin 92 mU/L to test the half-maximum response; 2-4 hours, hyperglycemia 10.0 mmol/L, plasma insulin 442 mU/L to test the maximum cellular glucose disposal) liver cirrhosis reduced glucose disposal to 45% and 60% of control values, respectively. Simultaneously, insulin-induced increases in glucose oxidation, plasma lactate levels, and lipogenesis were normal, whereas nonoxidative glucose metabolism was reduced (-82% and -47% of controls, respectively). To determine whether reduced nonoxidative glucose metabolism was caused by reduced glucose disposal, glucose disposal was ""matched"" to normal values in a subgroup of cirrhotic patients. Nonoxidative glucose metabolism values were normal, but plasma lactate concentrations disproportionally increased (+96%) after ""matching"" glucose disposal. Insulin resistance was independent of the etiology of the cirrhosis, the biochemical parameters of parenchymal cell damage and liver function, and the clinical and nutritional state of the patients. It is concluded that liver cirrhosis impairs insulin sensitivity and maximum cellular glucose disposal. Reduced glucose disposal is caused by defective glucose storage. Insulin resistance is independent of the etiology of liver cirrhosis and of the clinical and nutritional state of the patient. © 1992.",,"c peptide; glucose; human insulin; lactic acid; article; basal metabolic rate; body composition; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; female; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; human; hyperinsulinemia; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; liver cirrhosis; liver function; male; nutritional status; priority journal; Adult; C-Peptide; Energy Metabolism; Female; Glucose; Human; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Age; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026518655

They were stored either in the Leibovitz medium, a cell culture medium with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG), a compound known to suppress ischemia‐induced cell swelling, or in the University of Wisconsin solution, the most effective solution for cold organ preservation. After 24 or 48 hr of storage at 4.5° C in Leibovitz medium, cell viability and adherence efficiency to plastic dish, were only slightly reduced, whereas University of Wisconsin hepatocytes had a decreased viability and (especially after 48‐hr storage) lost their adhesion ability; they did not survive in vitro. The metabolic competence of hepatocytes maintained in Leibovitz medium was retained over the 3 days of culture, as shown by low extracellular levels of the membrane‐bound and cytosolic hepatic enzymes, as well as by intracellular glutathione content, albumin secretion rate and several phase I and phase II drug metabolic reactions very close to those found with fresh hepatocytes maintained under similar culture conditions. Addition of polyethylene glycol to the Leibovitz medium resulted in slightly higher viability and function of hepatocytes after cold storage. These results clearly demonstrate that viability of a transplanted liver does not correlate with long‐term in vitro viability of isolated hepatocytes after hypothermic preservation in University of Wisconsin solution. They also suggest that nutritional and energy substrates as found in the Leibovitz medium are probably required to define a suitable solution for cold preservation of isolated parenchymal cells. The findings with Leibovitz medium favor the conclusion that hypothermically preserved hepatocytes could be used for various metabolic studies and for the treatment of liver insufficiency.

Cell cultures were incubated in normal medium containing fetal bovine serum, phosphate free medium or similar medium supplemented with inorganic phosphate or thiophosphate. In contrast to the other media, cells cultured with thiophosphate medium for 3-4 days showed seriously compromised structure and functions. The cells lost 75% of their catecholamine content and their ability to secrete remaining catecholamines in response to nicotine stimulation. Radio-labelled thiophosphate was rapidly taken up by the cells and, in long-term experiments, was incorporated largely into a 97-121 kDa protein band on SDS-PAGE. Additional minor bands were found to a lesser, variable extent. Transmission electron micrographs of cells treated with thiophosphate showed extensive depletion of chromaffin vesicles and disruption of mitochondria, suggesting that the functional damage noted with these cells could be associated with damage to mitochondria. Analysis of general cell metabolic activity by conversion of the dye (3-[3,4-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-3,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to its formazan derivative indicated increased metabolic activity at early stages of exposure to thiophosphate followed by a decline with continued exposure, supporting the argument for an overall depression of cell metabolism.

A fundamental difference between these organs is that the heart is contractile, containing large quantities of actin and myosin, and is susceptible to contracture-induced injury caused by energy deprivation. We have quantified and correlated the onset of contracture with levels of ATP and glycogen during cold storage in rabbit hearts flushed with UW solution, with and without 1 mM calcium (Ca), or 3 mM iodoacetate (IAA). A fluid-filled left ventricular balloon was used to generate pressure-volume curves (compliance) at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hr of cold storage. Onset of contracture occurred in U W stored hearts at 18 hr, contracture in hearts exposed to Ca occurred between 6 and 12 hr. Compliance was significantly less in hearts exposed to Ca at 12, 18, and 24 hr (P<.01) than in hearts without Ca. ATP levels were well maintained for up to 18 hr in the hearts preserved in UW solution (78%), but fell more rapidly in the presence of Ca at 12 hr (i><.005), 18 hr (P<.005), and 24 hr (P<.05). In comparison, the ATP supply of the liver and kidney was exhausted by only 4 hr of cold storage. Onset of myocardial contracture correlated with a decrease in ATP to less than 80% of control, and contracture accelerated ATP decline 3—6-fold. IAA caused nearly complete myocardial contracture and ATP depletion within 2 hr. Isolated heart function was 77% and 73% at 6 and 12 hr of storage, but fell to 54% and 42% at 18 and 24 hr, respectively, coinciding with development of contracture. We conclude that ischemic contracture in this model is a major cause of myocardial damage during cold storage, and is accelerated by the presence of Ca. Other organs can be successfully stored despite exhaustion of ATP reserves. Thus successful cold-storage of the heart is highly ATP-dependent. Since cold storage inevitably leads to ATP depletion, extension of myocardial ischemic tolerance will depend on either reversible inhibition of ATP hydrolysis during storage, reversible uncoupling of contracture development from ATP depletion, or maintaining ATP production by continuous hypothermic perfusion. © 1992 by Williams and Wilkins.",,"adenosine triphosphate; calcium; glycogen; animal experiment; animal tissue; comparative study; conference paper; controlled study; cryopreservation; heart muscle compliance; heart muscle ischemia; heart preservation; kidney preservation; liver preservation; nonhuman; pressure volume curve; priority journal; rabbit; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Cold; Compliance; Heart; Heart Ventricle; Organ Preservation; Rabbits; Solutions; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026508594

The purpose of this report is to describe our initial experience with a tiered-therapy, variable detection criteria, multiprogrammable antiarrhythmia device capable of antitachycardia pacing, cardioversion, and defibrillation in 50 cardiac arrest survivors. Methods and Results. An epicardial lead system was used in 35 patients. A transvenous lead system was used in 15 patients. The index arrhythmia leading to device implantation was ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 23 patients, ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 21 patients, and both VT and VF in six patients. Postoperatively, all 50 patients benefited from the additional functions available in the new device compared with a device capable only of high-energy termination of arrhythmias using a simple rate detection algorithm. Total patient survival over a mean follow-up period of 15±5 months was 96%, with no patient succumbing to sudden arrhythmic death, cardiac death, or surgical death. Nine patients (18%) avoided the need for a bradycardia pacemaker because of the device's backup bradycardia pacing function. A programmable tachycardia cycle length stability algorithm prevented inappropriate device intervention into atrial fibrillation in 11 patients (22%). Detection schema flexibility, antitachycardia pacing capabilities, and low-energy cardioversion options allowed the elimination or avoidance of antiarrhythmic drugs in 41 patients (82%). Device data storage facilitated troubleshooting and reprogramming of detection algorithms and therapeutic schema in all 50 patients. Finally, the ability to perform noninvasive programmed electrical stimulation obviated the need for invasive cardiac catheterization in 35 of 35 patients who required electrophysiological testing after device implantation. Conclusions. These findings indicate that a multiprogrammable antiarrhythmia device can provide a substantial advance in the treatment of patients with disabling or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias by minimizing the use of painful shocks, reducing the need for antiarrhythmic drugs, lowering the incidence of inappropriate shocks, facilitating electrophysiological evaluation, and obviating the need for dual-device therapy.","Automatic implantable defibrillator; Sudden death; Ventricular fibrillation; Ventricular tachycardia","adolescent; adult; aged; article; artificial heart pacemaker; cardioversion; clinical article; defibrillator; electrophysiology; electrostimulation; female; heart atrium fibrillation; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart pacing; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; male; priority journal; survival; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Electric Countershock; Evaluation Studies; Female; Human; Male; Middle Age; Pacemaker, Artificial; Radiography, Thoracic; Software; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Survival Analysis; Tachycardia; Ventricular Fibrillation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026504952

Recent advances in energetics methodology are considerable, making measurements more practicable and accurate. They include the following: the development of less invasive methods for the measurement of energy expenditure in the field; improvements in, and reevaluation of, older techniques for energy expenditure measurement; and an improved understanding of the physiological basis of adaptation to high and low energy intakes. This article describes and evaluates field methods currently available for estimating energy intake, expenditure, and storage. All three types of method can be used to examine energy balance over periods of more than a month, and energy nutritional stress in individuals and communities. Energy intake measures are the least accurate and most time‐consuming, while anthropometric body composition methods are the most robust in a wide variety of field conditions.

A water heater used in this manner is typically called an off-peak water heater because resistive heating is unrestricted during utility off-peak periods. During on-peak periods, by comparison, the utility seeks to limit and delay resistive water heating. Laboratory tests, where the off-peak period and hot water draw schedule were varied, were conducted on two residential storage water heaters. A computer model of an electric water heater was developed and validated. The laboratory tests and the model were used to quantify the effect that various off-peak and hot water draw schedules have on water heater thermal efficiency. Thermal efficiency was found to vary up to 7% for water heaters which meet the 1991 minimum efficiency standards as specified within the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. The energy factor, as measured using the Department of Energy Test Procedure for Water Heaters, was found to be independent of the off-peak schedule because of a 'normalizing' that occurs as part of the calculation procedure.",,"Computer Aided Analysis; Electric Coils; Electric Power Systems--Load Management; Electric Water Heaters; Off-Peak Schedules; Water Heaters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026491675

The impacts of the pump efficiency, the electrical efficiency of the driving system, solar intensity, ambient air temperature, minimum and maximum water storage, and load variation on the PV generator size were studied. The study used a computer program based on the optimal sizing method investigated by the author. The system under consideration is intended to be used initially at Giza, Egypt (30 deg. longitude, 30 deg. latitude). The results showed that changing the pump efficiency from 20 % to 35 % will reduce the generator size from 15 to 8.6 kW peak, while changing the electrical efficiency of the pump drive system from 55 % to 90 % will change the generator peak power from 15.5 to 10 kW. Changing the minimum storage capacity from 250 m3 to 2,500 m3 will reduce the generator size from 10.84 to 10 kW, while changing the maximum storage capacity from 250 to 2,500 m3 will increase the generator size from 10 to 10.84 kW peak. Changing the location from north Egypt to south will lead to generator size deviation of about 23 % due to change in ambient air temperature and solar intensity.

The applied kilovoltage for molybdenum and tungsten target x-ray sources with various spectral filters and average breast composition (50% adipose, 50% fibroglandular) has been optimized with respect to signal-to-noise ratio and absorbed dose and was found to vary between 19 and 29 kVp as breast thickness increased from 4 to 8 cm.

Peterson analyzed the combined effects of heat, humidity and workload using the Texas Model of Thermoregulation and suggested that environmental heat load imposed on a person wearing heavy, semipermeable clothing could be predicted using the Heat-Humidity Index (HHI = 0.5 Tdb + 0.5 Twb), where Tdb = dry bulb temperature and Twb = wet bulb temperature. Our study was designed to: 1) test the validity of this computer model; and 2) evaluate the applicability of the HHI to heavily clothed subjects working in a variety of thermal environments. Nine men wearing chemical defense clothing were each studied under eight conditions over the range Tdb = 20 - 40°C, Tbg = Tdb + 5°C, relative humidity = 9 - 75%, and oxygen uptake = 14- 27 ml · kg-1 · min-1. Variables analyzed included tolerance time (TT), rectal temperature (Tre), skin temperature, heart rate (HR), weight loss, sweat rate, evaporation rate, and evaporative efficiency.

Comparison of hot-dry and warm-humid HHI subsets (20 and 30°C) showed no significant differences in TT, HR and weight loss, validating the 50:50 weighting of Tdb and Twb under these conditions.

In the UWS preserved hearts, recovery of aortic flow was greater when the simple storage technique was employed compared to intermittent or continuous coronary perfusion (groups 5 and 6). In the STS preserved hearts, aortic flow recovery was superior when the intermittent perfusion technique was applied. The same pattern was observed with regard to recovery of left ventricular pressure. Lactate dehydrogenase release during reperfusion was significantly less pronounced in group 4 (UWS, single flush, simple storage) as compared to group 1 (STS, single flush and simple storage), whereas best preservation of myocardial high energy phosphates was observed when hearts were preserved with multiple dose cardioplegia using STS. Simple hypothermic storage with UWS affords the best functional recovery after prolonged myocardial ischemia in all groups. Repetitive or continuous application of this solution is detrimental, possibly due to potassium overloading. In STS treated groups, multiple dose application of oxygenated STS enhances functional and metabolic recovery compared to its single dose application. Thus, single dose applicationof UWS might be more effective in prolonged myocardial protection for clinical heart transplantation.

The concept was examined by mathematically modeling the absorption and transfer of heat by the lunar regolith. Regolith thermal and physical properties were established through various sources as functions of temperature. Two cases were considered: a semi-infinite, constant temperature, cylindrical heat source embedded in a continuum of lunar regolith and a spherically shaped molten zone of lunar regolith set with an initial temperature profile. The cylindrical analysis was performed in order to examine the amount of energy which can be stored in the regolith throughout a number of lunar day/night cycles. A constant temperature cylinder was used to heat the regolith during the day. At night the cylinder acted as a perfect insulator. This cycling was performed until a 'steady state' situation was reached in the surrounding regolith. It was determined that a cycling 'steady state' occurs after approximately 15 day/night cycles. Results were obtained for cylinders of various diameters. The spherical molten zone analysis was performed to establish the amount of thermal energy, within the regolith, necessary to maintain some molten material throughout a nighttime period. This was done by setting the initial conditions within the regolith to model a molten zone with a surrounding temperature profile and allowing this to cool for one nighttime period. The surrounding temperature profile was modeled after the cycling 'steady state' temperature profile established by the cylindrical analysis. It was determined that a molten sphere diameter of 4.76 m is needed to maintain a core temperature near the low end of the melting temperature range throughout one nighttime period.",,"Cylinders--Thermal Effects; Lunar Regolith; Thermal Energy; Solar Energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026473276

Many maintain that this is a gross overestimate, but it cannot be denied that the sudden onset and rapid deterioration known to occur in some metabolic disorders during the first year of life can mimic SIDS. This may remain undetected unless postmortem material is examined in specialist centres with individual metabolic disorders in mind. Defects in energy metabolism and the maintenance of glucose homeostasis frequently show this pattern of presentation precipitated by minor clinical infection. These disorders include the glycogen storage disorders, gluconeogenic enzyme defects, and the defects of fatty acid oxidation. Several reports have appeared since 1984 linking fatty acid oxidation defects with SIDS. Estimates of their prevalence vary, due partly to methodological heterogeneity and partly to the limited size of individual studies which have not permitted adequate statistical analysis. Nevertheless, the lack of adequate information has not precluded a great deal of debate. Over the past seven years a group in Sheffield has studied the occurrence of these defects in SIDS using three distinct approaches: - retrospective analysis of SIDS cases; - prospective analysis of SIDS cases; - prospective analysis of urine obtained from siblings of SIDS cases during the first week of life. The result of these studies would suggest that the contribution to SIDS made by medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may be in the region of 1%. Additional related metabolic disorders may account for a further as yet undefined small percentage. The eventual resolution of some of these uncertainties may be provided by harmonising the results of existing studies and by DNA analysis of materials obtained at necropsy in SIDS cases.",,"medium chain acyl coenzyme a dehydrogenase; conference paper; human; infant; metabolic disorder; priority journal; sudden infant death syndrome; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Homeostasis; Human; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Oxidation-Reduction; Sudden Infant Death; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026469226

In contrast, the hearts of heart and lung donors were preserved by core cooling using cardiopulmonary bypass and infusion of cold blood cardioplegia containing 26 mM potassium. The heart-lung block was transported in cold donor blood. Nucleotides and their catabolite concentrations were measured in donor tissue specimens taken before organ collection, before commencement of implantation and 30 min after aortic clamp removal. During reperfusion, samples of coronary sinus and arterial blood were collected and analysed for nucleotide catabolite concentration. Myocardial ATP and total nucleotide pool remained almost unchanged during the ischemic transport of the donor organs with only very small increases in myocardial inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations. However, a significant decrease of total adenine nucleotide pool by 10%-20% was demonstrated between the start of implantation and 30 min post-reperfusion. A release of inosine + hypoxanthine was greatest in the 1st minute (15-25 µM), but was still substantial after 10 min of reperfusion (5-15 µM).

In practise, the inherently quiet Stirling engine has already proved itself as an Air-Independent Powerplant (AIP) in manned submarines of between 500 and 1200 tonnes displacement. However, in these applications the packaging constraints are not as severe as those encountered in small unmanned autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In the larger underwater vessels the energy source used by the Stirling is a pressurised fuel/oxygen combustor. The main problem with such systems is the space need of the oxygen storage units - usually cryogenically controlled liquid oxygen (LOX) tanks. This particular requirement is easier to satisfy in larger submarines because the ratio of LOX storage to tank volume increases with tank size. However, the Stirling is a closed cycle prime mover and can use a number of different energy sources. Two of the more attractive being high temperature thermal energy storage and liquid metal combustion systems. It has also been shown that a Stirling system could be used as a bottoming cycle for a high temperature fuel cell. Thus, the Stirling appears to offer the AUV powerplant designer a number of attractive alternatives. In this paper these alternatives are explored and the advantages and disadvantages of the use of Stirling systems in AIP applications is discussed.",,"Ocean Engineering; Submersibles; Thermodynamics - Stirling Cycle; Air Independent Powerplant; Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; Liquid Oxygen; Heat Engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026464174

It is, of course, well known that the human amnion differs very little from that of other recent members of the phylum, although during evolution the development of the placenta has brought about extensive changes in the chorion. Much of the structure and many of the functions of both the amnion and chorion laeve can be interpreted from a comparative point of view (e.g., production of lipids). The next section deals with the ontogeny of the human amniotic sac, and the histogenesis and functional structure of the fetal membranes. It concludes with a structural analysis of the single layers of the fetal membranes at the end of pregnancy. Light and electron microscopy and histochemical examination are combined with experimental investigations; the striking differences and departure from any possible ""norm"", however, made the interpretation of morphological findings particularly difficult. Explanations for these differences are put forward: the texture of the connective tissue elements is only approximately determined and therefore gives rise to many irregularities; differences in the structure of cells depend upon their functional state; and the cells exist in groups which reciprocally exchange functional activity with each other. It is emphasized that the amniotic epithelium produces lipids which then appear in the same composition in the amniotic fluid. The fibroblasts in the amniotic connective tissue may, when necessary, be transformed into phagocytes (the so-called Hofbauer cells). Within the fetal membranes one can also observe glucose metabolism which, apart from the supply of local energy and the storage of glycogen, is concerned with production of phospholipids, triglycerides, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and collagen (types I, III, and IV). A similar process of glucose metabolism is found in the trophoblast, especially the building-up of an extracellular matrix (the so-called fibrinoid), which seems to play a part in the formation of an immune barrier. An attempt is made to correlate the various differentiated cells of the trophoblast with particular functions. The vacuolated cells obviously store glucose. Others, as lectin-binding investigations have shown, are concerned with production of the extracellular matrix. They produce a three-dimensional latticework between the cells, and reach out as far as the borders of the chorionic connective tissue. In this regard, the microtexture of the amniotic and chorionic connective tissue provides a basis for a more precise understanding of their mechanical stability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"amnion fluid; cytology; embryo membrane; fetus; human; permeability; physiology; prenatal development; review; Amniotic Fluid; Embryonic and Fetal Development; Extraembryonic Membranes; Fetus; Humans; Permeability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026462410

Such correction requires an accurate estimation of the scatter distribution in the image field. In this paper, a novel method, referred to as the primary-modulation-demodulation (PMD) method, is introduced. With the PMD method, the primary X-ray distribution is modulated and demodulated with two filters placed on the tube and detector sides of the patient. The modulation-demodulation process, while leaving the overall primary signal distribution unchanged, results in a reduction of scatter signals in selected regions in the image. This signal drop can be measured and used to estimate and construct the scatter distribution for use in image correction. Because the PMD method allows both primary and scatter signals to be acquired simultaneously, it is ideal for use in non-scanning DSA or digital storage phosphor imaging for dual-energy subtraction imaging and/or quantitative contrast measurement. In this paper, the principle and implementation of the PMD method is described.

The hearts were stored either in our own cardioplegic solution (group 1) or in Collins' solution (group 2) for 3 hours at 4° C and were then reperfused. The electromechanical activity in group 1 was elevated, as indicated by a higher incidence of ventricular fibrillation at 5 minutes of reperfusion (group 1: 5/6; group 2: 0/5; p < 0.05). The coronary flow rate in group 2 was significantly lower, at least for the first 15 minutes after reperfusion, than that of group 1, suggesting the possible existence of vasoconstriction in group 2. Although myocardial oxygen uptake during this period was smaller in group 2, the recovery of myocardial high-energy phosphate levels was better and creatine kinase leakage was less in group 2. The recovery of aortic flow after 30 minutes of reperfusion was significantly better in group 2 (group 1, 59.1 ± 5.8%; group 2, 71.7 ± 6.0%; p < 0.01), although the early recovery was somewhat worse in group 2. These data suggest that the heart stored in an intracellular-type solution, compared with one stored in an extracellular-type solution, recovers in an electromechanically suppressed fashion during the early reperfusion phase, associated with a better metabolic recovery and a slower but larger functional recovery. The disadvantage of the intracellular-type solution, however, may be its effect on the increase of coronary vascular resistance during the early reperfusion period.",,"cardioplegic agent; Collins solution; animal tissue; aorta flow; article; blood flow velocity; coronary artery blood flow; cryopreservation; functional assessment; heart function; heart muscle metabolism; heart muscle oxygen consumption; heart muscle reperfusion; heart preservation; heart transplantation; heart ventricle fibrillation; high energy phosphate; isolated heart; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; vasoconstriction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026461023

Factors such as percentage of body fat, uppervs. lower-body obesity, family history, past dieting history, and underlying medical conditions should be assessed on an individual basis and applied in the development of successful weight-reducing strategies. The recommended approach to nonpharmacologic intervention for weight loss is to first educate individuals about fat storage and energy balance and then focus on the development of positive behavioral skills such as wise food selections, favorable eating patterns, and regular physical activity. Although preventive measures such as positive eating patterns and exercise habits are ideally acquired in childhood and adolescence, successful weight management can still be achieved in adulthood.

Patients must learn to make food selections that have a high nutrient:energy ratio. Considerable research indicates that the dietary fat level, independent of total caloric intake, is a predictor of fat storage. A contributing factor is the difference in metabolic efficiency of converting dietary fats to body fat compared to the relative inefficiency of converting carbohydrates to body fat. The recommendation that no more than 25% of daily caloric intake come from fat is in keeping with good nutritional practices and may also lower the risk of heart disease and cancer. Patients should have nutrition counseling supplemented with written materials on label reading and recognizing high fat foods, types of fat and cholesterol, serving sizes, meal planning, low fat cooking and dining out. Choosing foods with a high nutrient:energy ratio allows the patient to eat an increased volume and thus a wider variety of foods to meet their nutrient and energy requirements. © 1992, Springer.

Signal and signal-to-noise ratios were measured as a function of time, erasure power/time, or number of pre-scans to study these problems. The latent image signals were found to decay very rapidly during the first several minutes and stabilize after several hours. The fading effect results in a variable signal gain (signal per unit exposure), which may affect the system calibration and quantitative use of the image data. Complete erasure of the latent image signals is necessary to ensure that no residual image signals are present when the plate is exposed again. It was found that plates used in high exposure applications (GI, therapeutic imaging) may require an excessively long erasure time to prepare them for use in low exposure applications (chest imaging). Although the latent image is partially erased during the readout process, it may sometimes become necessary to re-scan the plate for a second or third readout. It was found that because a large number of energy traps are generated for each X-ray photon, a significant portion of the X-ray information remains intact for reuse after the first or second scans.

An environmental neutron detector, which responds satisfactorily to these requirements, was developed at LNF (Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Roma, Italy), for neutron monitoring in the area of the storage ring ADONE. It consists of a cylindrical moderator (height 15 cm, diameter 15 cm) of polyethylene with five TLD-600, sensitive to n+γ radiation and five TLD-700, sensitive to γ radiation, placed in the centre. A simulation of the instrument was performed using the 3-D Monte Carlo computer code MCNP (Monte Carlo Neutron and Photon transport), in order to obtain the theoretical fluence and dose equivalent response as a function of neutron energy. An accurate calibration of the instrument was carried out at the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig, FRG) exposing it to monoenergetic neutron beams (with energies of 14.2, 5, 0.57, 0.144 MeV and thermal neutrons). A further calibration has been carried out at the CRE ENEA (Frascati, Roma, Italy), with a continuous spectrum from a 252Cf fission neutron source (E = 2.3 MeV). From the results of the calibration, an average instrument response of 1.3-1.5 nC.mSv-1 seems to represent a sufficiently conservative choice in the evaluation of dose equivalent for high energy neutrons (over 5 MeV); however, for neutrons highly degraded in energy, such a factor could give an overestimation of the dose equivalent of more than a factor two.",,"calibration; computer simulation; conference paper; dose response; fission neutron; neutron dosimetry; neutron radiation; radiation dose; radiation monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026454805

The enclosure is cylindrical and well insulated. Initially the interior fluid is isothermal and quiescent. At time zero, a step change in the source temperature begins to influence the flow. The final condition is a quiescent isothermal fluid field at the source temperature.

Such indirect dryers have the potential to significantly reduce the losses that can occur during sun-drying. It has often been suggested that such indirect dryers should incorporate some form of energy storage system that would allow energy to be stored prior to the crop being placed in the dryer thus increasing the drying rate. Little success has, however, been achieved with such energy storage due to the fact that the storage beds used have either increased the pressure loss in the dryer by an excessive amount or that the rate at which heat could be removed from the bed was too low to significantly effect the drying rate. The present study is concerned with an evaluation of an energy storage system placed around the chimney of a passive dryer. Because such a system does not impose any significant extra pressure losses on the dryer and yet is placed at a position where the air velocity is reasonably high, it may overcome some of the problems that limit the usefulness of existing energy storage systems. The storage could be either in the form of a water jacket around the chimney or in the form of a high conductivity granular material placed around the chimney. This arrangement has been numerically evaluated here. It has been assumed that the energy storage material is charged for an extended period of time before drying begins and so reaches an equilibrium temperature. The drying of the crop has then been studied using a simple numerical model for the dryer. The results of the study indicate that a storage bed surrounding the chimney does have the potential to improve the drying performance of an indirect passive solar dryer but that the extent of the improvement is limited by the low heat transfer rate to the air passing through the chimney. Ways of overcoming this deficiency are discussed.",,"Chimneys - Thermal Conductivity; Dryers - Mathematical Models; Dryers - Solar; Energy Storage - Efficiency; Energy Storage Systems; Indirect Solar Crop Dryer; Dryers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026441820

The energy ratio λ ≡ W/Ws (expended to stored energy) which is considered as a measure for the distance from thermodynamic equilibrium appears as the characteristic quantity of the model. According to the latter instability of the deformation structure (structural instability) which gives rise to a macroscopic flow instability, does occur at a critical model value λm*. This depends on stress and structural parameters and is in the range from 20 to 100. In particular, λm* should be independent of the loading procedure. From the view of the model, instability is the consequence of the exhaustion of energy storage capability. Structural instability appears to be a critical phenomenon initiated by the growth of (critical) fluctuations in size ds of the deformation substructure. In accordance with model expectations the observed critical λ* values for different materials are within the margins of λm*, and, in accordance with the model, they are proportional to a critical stress σ*. Moreover, the λ* values are dependent on temperature and independent of loading procedure and loading path. Hence λ* reveals properties of a quantity of state. In situ examinations conducted on Cu at homologous temperatures Th &gt; 0.4 have shown that the strain distribution during flow instability is macroscopically uniform. This indicates a high growth rate of critical structural instabilities at higher temperatures. It depends on the growth rate of critical ds fluctuations, whether strain distribution remains uniform or will become localized (shape instability).",,"Copper and Alloys - High Temperature Properties; Crystals - Dislocations; Mathematical Models; Critical Model Value; Dislocation Population Model; Energy Ratio; Flow Instability; Strain Distribution; Structural Instability; Metals and Alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026441641

An important factor in reducing the first cost of these systems is to identify new ground installation procedures and plastic pipe ground heat exchanger configurations. A family of low cost heat exchangers has been developed, and initial data on their performance is available. These heat exchangers are constructed from coiled plastic pipe rolls of 152.4 meter (500 feet) of pipe and are tied in a circular pattern so that they can be placed in narrow 0.15 meter (six inch) wide trenches in trench lengths varying from 12.2 to 38.1 meters (40 to 125 feet). These same coils when placed in multiple passes have the potential to be used for cool, warm and hot storage systems that would be placed below grade. Performance data of these various types of coils will be presented and will compare these coils to conventional ground heat exchangers. The coils tested include: 1. two and 4 pipe heat exchangers installed in open trenches 2. loop type systems installed in closed trench horizontally bored holes at various depths 3. circular type heat exchangers of 152.4 meters (500 feet) of pipe buried in narrow 0.15 meters (six inch) wide open trenches of 12.2 to 38.1 meters (40 to 125 feet) in length.

Due to their favorable magneto-optic wavelength dependence and enhanced corrosion resistance, these materials show promise as future data storage media. However, partially due to the large variety of thin-film deposition methods and growth conditions, it has been difficult to obtain a clear understanding of the mechanisms of magnetic anisotropy in these systems. In order to create controlled and well characterized model systems, we have grown a series of epitaxial Co/Pd superlattices oriented along the three high-symmetry crystal directions [001], [110], and [111] on single-crystal GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy [MBE]. Simultaneously, we have deposited polycrystalline Co/Pd multilayers on Si substrates mounted alongside the GaAs for direct comparisons of epitaxial and non-epitaxial films produced under identical conditions. The structural properties of these multilayers were determined by low-and reflection high-energy electron diffraction (LEED and RHEED), low- and high-angle X-ray diffraction, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The dependence of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy on the Co thickness in these superlattices showed significant systematic differences for each of the three crystal orientations.

It is commonly used in system simulations since detailed temperature data in the storage medium are not known (or even considered). However, it is rarely used in the evaluation of operating systems because of the difficulty in determining it, especially in potentially multidimensional storage configurations, like a horizontal tank. This paper examines the issue of the evaluation of the average storage temperature, specifically from the point of view of reproducibility and how much data is required for a confident calculation. Unfortunately, this issue was not completely resolved and was shown to be strongly dependent on the locations of the measurements. Two examples are presented that demonstrate the usefulness of knowing the average storage temperature. The examples also give a quantitative demonstration of the effect of withdrawal flow rate on the amount of thermal energy that can be withdrawn from a given system.

A cell resistance of 2.50 Ω cm2 and energy efficiency of 91% were obtained in the vanadium cell, after the graphite felt electrode material was treated with boiling concentrated sulphuric acid for 5h. The electrochemical activity of the graphite felt was found to increase with increasing sulphuric acid concentration. Treatment of graphite felt with nitric acid and mixtures of sulphuric and nitric acids, however, led to higher cell resistance values compared with the sulphuric acid treatment. Surface analysis of treated and untreated felts using the XPS method has shown that the functional groups CO and CO increased dramatically compared with untreated samples. A sequence reaction mechanism was proposed for the VO2+ ⇌ VO+2 and V2+ ⇌ V3+ charge-discharge reactions occurring in the positive and negative 1 2-cells, respectively of the vanadium redox battery. © 1992.","batteries; energy storage; surface activation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006185749

MMO activity could be maintained in whole cells by storage in unagitated vessels for several days. However if these cells were agitated and aerated in the absence of a carbon and energy source then 80% of the propylene-oxidizing activity Was lost within 24 h. It was shown that this loss of activity was due to the inability of the cells to provide energy to drive the oxidation process rather than the loss of MMO activity per se. If propylene oxide was added to these aerated cells then the rate of inactivation was increased and 50% of the activity was lost over a 10 min period. The addition of an exogenous energy source caused a doubling in the rate of inactivation. These marked increases in the rates of inactivation in the presence of propylene oxide were found to be caused by the loss of the methane monooxygenase activity per se rather than a further loss of the energy-producing systems. Cells actively producing propylene oxide from propylene, using methanol as an energy source, also lost their propylene oxide-producing capacity rapidly due to loss of the methane monooxygenase activity. The rate of inactivation under these circumstances was related to the rate of propylene oxide production from propylene rather than the level of this product in the culture supernatant. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath); Product toxicity; Propylene oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005560215

A source and sink method is presented in which a sink front is used to characterize a melt front while a source front is used to characterize a freeze front. An integrodifferential equation is then derived for the interface position which is linearized locally for numerical solution. This position is, in turn, used as input for the determination of the temperature distribution and energy storage and release in different phases of the medium. The numerical solution presented in this paper has shown to be unique, convergent, stable, and accurate. The analysis has been applied to the study of phase change in a subcooled paraffin wax imposed with a cyclic temperature condition. Test results yield some interesting phenomena related to the merging of phase-change fronts and hysteresis of energy storage and release, among others, which have not previously been reported in the literature.

Experimental ratings are determined in accordance with the Solar Rating and Certification Corporation guidelines. Storage tank design is varied by using a stratification manifold in place of the standard drop tube. Variations in other component sizes and operating factors are based on current industry standards. Statistical analyses indicate that a change in collector area accounts for nearly 90 percent of the variation in heat output. Doubling collector area from 2.78 m2 to 5.56 m2 increases delivered solar energy by 31 percent. Use of a stratification manifold increases the delivery of solar energy by six percent. Doubling collector flow rate from 0.057 to 0.114 1/s increases solar output by approximately three percent; however, the increase in pumping energy outweighs the benefits of increasing collector flow rate.

The effect of the enzyme system was further investigated for meat products in order to elucidate the coupling between redox processes of meat pigments and lipids during freezer storage of minced beef. The rate of enzymatic reduction of metmyoglobin to myoglobin was strongly dependent on pH, ionic strength and temperature. For excess of NADH, the energy of activation was pH-dependent and approximated 60 kJ-mol-1, and was assigned to the electron transfer between reduced cytochrome b5 and metmyoglobin. The pH-dependence indicated parallel reactions of two protein forms in acid/base equilibrium with each other; a p Ka=6.0 suggests the involvement of an imidazol moiety, for which the protonization facilitates the electron transfer. The reaction centres of the proteins are oppositely charged, as concluded from a decrease in rate with increasing, ionic strength. For conditions of high enzyme activity, metmyoglobin was reduced to myoglobin but not further oxygenated to oxymyoglobin, indicating oxygen consumption as the result of a direct reduction of O2 by cytochrome b5. For intermediate enzyme activity (25° C, pH 6.3 and 5.8), the liver extract and NADH were capable of decreasing the metmyoglobin-induced oxygen consumption rate of linoleic acid emulsions by a factor of 10, showing that the iron(III) form of myoglobin is the active oxidation catalyst. However, for meat products, addition of the liver extract and NADH did not improve the colour stability as monitored by tristimulus colorimetric measurements but significantly increased lipid oxidation, as indicated by an increase in thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002335227

The model simulates dynamic recrystallization by adding recrystallization nuclei and stored energy continuously with time. The simulations reproduce many of the essential features of dynamic recrystallization. The stored energy of the system, which may be interpreted as a measure of the flow stress, goes through a maximum and then decays, monotonically under some conditions and in an oscillatory manner under others. The principle parameters that were studied were the rate of adding stored energy, ΔH, and the rate of adding nuclei, ΔN. As ΔH increases, for fixed ΔN, the oscillations decay more rapidly and the asymptotic energy rises. As ΔN increases again the oscillations decay more rapidly but the asymptotic stored energy decreases. The mean grain size of' the system also oscillates in a similar manner to the stored energy but out of phase by 90°. The flow stress oscillations occurred for conditions which lead to both coarsening and refinement of the initial grain size. Necklacing of the prior grain structure by new grains were observed for low ΔH and high ΔN; it is, however, not an invariable feature of grain refinement. The initial grain size has a profound influence on the microstructure that evolves during the first cycle of recrystallization but at long times, a mean grain size is established which depends on the values of ΔH and ΔN alone. Comparison of the relationships between the energy storage rate, maximum and asymptotic stored energy and the grain size suggest that in physical systems the energy storage rate and the nucleation rate are coupled. Comparison of the simulation results with experimental trends suggests that the dependence of nucleation rate on storage should be positive but weak. All of these results were obtained without the addition of special parameters to the model. © 1992.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002021940

Under the influence of the mutual Coulomb repulsion, intrabeam scattering leads to a flow of energy from the transverse to the longitudinal direction. Depending on the density and the initial transverse temperature T0, three regimes can be distinguished: a fast transient increase of the longitudinal temperature T0 in a fraction of a betatron period, a slow linear increase in some ten betatron periods, and a fast exponential increase followed by complete thermal equilibration. If T0 is large, linear order is lost and thermal equilibrium is postponed to large times. Fourier analyses show that the energy flows into the long-wavelength modes of the collective string excitations. A comparison of calculated heating rates with achievable cooling rates reveals that maintaining linear order in a storage ring is marginal. © 1992 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001764215

Most ascomycetous and basidomycetous fungi synthesize hydroxamate-type siderophores containing N5-hydroxy-N5-acyl-l-ornithine residues which constitute the iron binding ligands. After complexing of ferric ions, octahedral complexes are formed. Uptake of iron via siderophores involves the recognition of siderophores by the cognate transport systems which is dependent on the configuration of the metal centre (Λ/Δ) and its surrounding functionalities. Transport across the membrane requires metabolic energy and can be inhibited by respiratory poisons, uncouplers, low temperatures, anaerobiosis and is functioning in a pH range of pH 2–7. Four classes of hydroxamate siderophores have so far been isolated: ferrichromes, fusarinines, coprogens and rhodotorulic acid. Besides their function in solubilizing and transport of iron, hydroxamate siderophores are also involved in iron storage. Recently, a novel complexone type siderophore (rhizoferrin) has been discovered which seem to be widespread in the Mucorales. Interestingly the Mucorales are the only fungal group where ferritin has been detected so far, suggesting that the substitution of hydroxamate siderophores by complexone siderophores has led to the formation of ferritins as the eucaryotic iron storage proteins. © 1992, British Mycological Society.

At cryogenic temperatures each supermolecule sits in one of the different minima. Supermolecules might show different physical properties, specifically a spread in their absorption frequencies. This property forms the basis for spectral hole-burning, a special type of photochemistry. Spectral hole-burning not only allows high resolution spectroscopy of matrix isolated organic molecules, it also opens a wide field of technical applications, especially with respect to frequency selective information storage. Recently more than 2000 images were stored in a single polymer film at different frequencies of the visible spectrum. More general this type of wavelength-selective photochemistry allows the storage of all the properties associated with an optical wave field, such as frequency, polarization, direction of propagation, intensity, and, in conjunction with holographic methods, also the phase. One might say that supermolecular photochemistry freezes in all the properties of light. It is often claimed that the top end of the current generation of electronic computers will be replaced by optical computers having fast parallel computing capacities. A further development might be a molecular computer. The properties of light are transferred to photochemical changes in the material and the stored patterns can then be operated on by logical operations at will. The interaction of the molecular energy levels with an external electric field provides dynamical responses. A functional model of a molecular processor which is based on spectral hole-burning and on the spectroscopic properties of a dye doped polymer film is described here. Hole-burning materials can be used for image recording as well as for parallel processing of stored information. © 1992, IUPAC",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001151185

In particular, this paper reexamines a fundamental level of theory which was employed several years ago for the interpretation of the electronic spectra of simple organic molecules: configuration interaction (CI) among all singly substituted determinants using a Hartree-Fock reference state. This investigation presents several new enhancements to this general theory. First, it is shown how the ""CI-singles"" wave function can be used to compute efficiently the analytic first derivative of the energy in order to obtain accurate properties and optimized geometries for a wide range of molecules in their excited states. Second, a computer program is described which allows these computations to be done in a ""direct"" fashion, with no disk storage required for the two-electron repulsion integrals. This allows investigations of systems with large numbers of atoms (or large numbers of basis functions). Third, it is shown how the CI-singles approximation can be corrected via second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory to produce a level of theory for excited states which further includes some effects of electronic correlation.

The solution is restricted to include s waves only. Spline approximation and orthogonal collocation reduce the Yakubovsky equations to a matrix equation which is solved using the Lanczos algorithm. Storage requirements are reduced by more than three orders of a magnitude by exploiting the tensor structure present in the equation. Some of the results obtained with these methods are presented. All calculations are done on a workstation. The calculated binding energies have more than five significant digits, and it is therefore expected that the exploitation of the tensor structure makes it possible to use the Yakubovsky differential equations for realistic ground-state energy calculations with a higher accuracy than is possible with other methods. © 1992 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000615664

The energy storage of the linear electron transfer process in photosynthesis, of cyclic photosystem (PS) I, and possibly of PSII was determined by selection of excitation wavelength and of flash interval. At 695 nm excitation, a rather large cyclic PSI energy storage of 0.68 ± 0.04 eV/quantum of energy at 8 ms after a 1-μs flash was obtained. This energy remained the same at flash intervals of 0.35 to 60 s and was independent of the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. We tentatively assign this energy to the ferredoxin-NADP-reductase-ferredoxin and oxidized cytochrome b6/f complexes. An efficient distribution of energy between cyclic and linear systems is obtained with the simple assumption that the turnover time of the cyclic system is slower than that of the linear system. The energy storage of linear electron flow was determined by 655 nm excitation of Chlorella with a short flash interval of 0.35 s per flash. It was calculated to be 0.50 ± 0.03 eV/hv, close to that expected for oxygen and NADPH formation. The energy storage of PSII is determined by excitation of Chlorella at 655 nm with a long flash interval of 60 s per flash. It was calculated to be 1.07 ± 0.05 eV/hv, consistent with the energy storage being in S-states and the secondary electron acceptor of PSII with a calculated redox energy of 1.03 eV/hv. In the presence of 1 μM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, the calculated energy storage in PSII is still significant, 0.53 ± 0.04 eV/hv. This probably indicates a significant cyclic electron flow around PSII. These cyclic flows may contribute considerably to energy storage in photosynthesis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000560593

This paper deals with the energetics of soliton disappearance and is of interest for polaron theory as well. A semiclassical Davydov model is used, for which exact wave functions can be determined. The results in a special case equal those obtained with the full quantum-mechanical model. Monte Carlo simulations show that thermal destabilization is not associated with transitions to exciton states, as is usually assumed in the literature, and that it involves instead disordered states with energies intermediate between those of the minimum energy soliton state and those of the exciton states.

When the outer layers of six wheat grists with different wholemeal baking qualities were removed by pearling, only three of the grists produced loaves with significantly higher volumes than the corresponding controls. For the three grists giving an improvement in breadmaking quality, the average increase in volume was about 7·4%. The variation in the response to pearling may depend on the cultivars present, but not necessarily on the original breadmaking quality of the individual wheat grists. Bran materials collected from a sequential pearling process affected baking performance detrimentally when added to a wholemeal control of an unpearled grist and to a composite flour (i.e. a white flour plus 12·5% bran and offal). The most marked depression in loaf volume was observed when the outermost bran fraction (about 1·1 % of the grain weight), containing the highest concentration of epicarp hairs, was incorporated into the breadmaking recipe. Heat treatment (autoclaving) of this fraction did not diminish its adverse effect on loaf volume, suggesting that heatsensitive components (e.g. enzymes) are not implicated. Also, the differences in original unesterified free fatty acid levels between the white flour, the wholemeal and the flour from pearled grain were found to be small, and are unlikely to account for the observed differences in baking performance. Dry abrasion or pearling of the wheat grists is unlikely to improve the storage stability of the resulting flours, since the lipase activities of the wholemeal and the flour from pearled wheat were not significantly different. Microscopical examination of the wholemeal dough suggests that non-endosperm components induce serious structural distortion of gas cells and may contribute to the resultant crumb morphology, which is an important element of crumb texture. © 1992, Academic Press Limited.

This finding affects not only previously published conclusions on analyzed plasma-electron temperatures using these existing SSB theories, but also the resultant discussions on plasma behavior reported from various plasma devices. Also, this information is of importance for ongoing and future analyses of SSB data so as to avoid making further misinterpretations from the analyzed results. A possible physical interpretation for these unexpected SSB response data is discussed using thermal charge-diffusion effects in the SSB substrate.
