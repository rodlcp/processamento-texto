This setup has been studied for fast energy release in flares, but has not been studied before in the context of the magnetic energy buildup that precedes the flare. Our analytical results are new because they include gas pressure and provide explicit formulae for the expressions of all quantities (and especially the electric current) and energy storage as functions of the values of boundary conditions. A general solution is shown as a combination of eigenfunctions, with coefficients resulting from the boundary conditions. These boundary conditions are given in terms of any arbitrary plasma acceleration at a boundary enclosing the domain we study. The approach used here studies the MHD evolution of the electric current and plasma density variations driven by external forces. We find that both pressure and Lorentz forces are important, and that their boundary values select between a wide range of solutions, many of which have been found previously in numerical simulations. Most of the modes we find display strong current sheets, velocities, and pressure variations at the separatrices. Also we find that Joule and other dissipative terms are not important for typical cases, except at an extremely narrow inner core, and near the separatrices. We discuss our results and their relationship to numerical MHD simulations.","MHD; Sun: magnetic fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044250921

We report on the results of studies aimed at lowering the alloy costs by partial substitutions of A and B elements respectively.

The alloy Lm0.5Mm0.5Ni4.2Mn0.2Al0.3Si0.3 (Mm, rare earth mischmetal; Lm, lanthanum-rich mischmetal) showed a maximum capacity of 270 mA h g-1 and good cycling stability, i.e. the optimum in price/performance ratio. Substitution of larger amounts of nickel with copper could further lower the price of such alloys; however, these copper-containing alloys showed low kinetics and a slow activation. Electrochemical measurements were carried out on ten different single-phase AB5 alloys and on a two-phase AB5.36-type alloy. Up to 500 charge-discharge cycles were performed.

Schafer Associates, Inc., 303 Lindbergh Avenue, Livermore, 94550, CA, United States; Waganer, L.M., McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, St. Louis, P.O. Box 516, MO, United States","The United States Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored two studies of inertial fusion energy (IFE) electric power plants, one led by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (MDA) and the other led by W. J. Schafer Associates (WJSA). These studies, which were completed in March of 1992, included the conceptual design and analysis of two KrF-laser and two heavy-ion-driven power plants. The reactor and driver designs for the heavy-ion power plants are described in this paper. The MDA team design, Prometheus-H, features a wetted-wall chamber, a compact induction linac driver, and channel propagation for beam delivery. The single-beam driver uses storage rings to accumulate a series of pulses before delivery to the target. The use of storage rings and a folded linear section results in a compact footprint and significant cost savings compared to a straight multiple-beam linac. Fourteen beams of doubly-charged, 4 GeV Pb ions are used to deliver 7 MJ on the target at a pulse repetition rate of 3.5 Hz with an overall driver efficiency of 21%. The channel propagation mode requires only two small, diametrically opposed holes through the blanket and first wall; this approach maximizes the wall coverage and minimizes radiation leakage and contamination of the beamlines. Th resulting target gain is 103 for a yield of 719 MJ per pulse. The Prometheus chamber has a Pb-cooled, porous SiC first wall and a He-cooled Li2O breeding blanket. The blanket structural material is low-activation SiC. The thermal conversion efficiency is 43%, and the net electric power is 1000 MWe. The WJSA team design, Osiris, uses a wetted-wall chamber, a multiple-beam induction linac driver, and ballistic focus with auto-neutralization. The driver design is conservative in that it uses singly charged ions and does not use beam combination or splitting. Twelve beams are close-packed in order to use common cores and focusing magnets. The accelerator costs were reduced by operating at spacecharge-limited current density and standardizing the quadrupole and inductor designs. In this case, twelve beams of 3.8 GeV Xe ions provide a total of 5 MJ at a pulse repetition rate of 4.6 Hz. The overall driver efficiency is 28%, the target gain is 87, and the yield is 432 MJ per pulse. The Osiris chamber uses a flexible, porous carbon/carbon fabric to contain the flow of the molten salt Flibe, which serves as the primary coolant and breeding material.

The stage inductors are 40 μH and the peak current exceeds 200 kA, with a pulse length of approximately 500 μs when the stages are triggered simultaneously. When triggered in sequence the peak current is typically 70 kA for a pulse duration of 2 ms. `D' size ignitrons are used as stage switches and also as crowbars to limit voltage reversal on the capacitors. Care was taken to reduce problems of electrical interference by elimination of ground loops. Current waveforms are predicted for simultaneous and sequenced trigger timing with a dummy load, and agree well with measured waveforms.

Adequate equipment for rapid dumping of the counter-rotating beam bunches at the end of the storage period or in an emergency situation is therefore required. A fast kicker magnet system has been built for this purpose. The magnet is energized by the discharge of a storage capacitor, located close to the magnet in the LEP tunnel. The charging voltage of the capacitor is proportional to the beam momentum which is 20 GeV/c at injection and will be 100 GeV/c at top energy. The current pulse has a maximum amplitude of 9.5 kA with a rise time of 9.2 μs and a fall time constant of 285 μs. The generator consists of a pulse capacitor discharged by a gas switch in series with a stack of blocking diodes, specially selected for very low reverse recovery energy. A free-wheel diode stack, in series with a small series resistor for slope control, bypasses the generator output. These free-wheel diodes have a very low dynamic forward resistance. After a short presentation of the layout of the dumping system and its kicker magnet this paper discusses in more detail the pulse generator with emphasis on the performances of the fast diode stacks.

Tissue adenine nucleotide and purine catabolite concentration in oxygen group was almost identical to the control at the end of hypothermic preservation, while ATP and energy charge in nitrogen and simple cold storage groups were significantly low. Conjugated dienes before and after reperfusion showed no difference in any groups, indicating no involvement of free radical injury on reperfusion in this asanguineous perfusion model. These results suggest that continuous supply of oxygen is necessary for liver preservation even though the temperature is lowered to inhibit cellular metabolism.","free radical; liver; oxygen; perfusion; preservation","adenine; adenosine triphosphate; nitrogen; ouabain; oxygen; purine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; induced hypothermia; liver perfusion; liver transplantation; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; oxygenation; rat; Animal; Hypothermia, Induced; In Vitro; Liver; Male; Organ Preservation; Oxygen; Perfusion; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027894293

The program objectives were: (1) to define a cost-effective, environmentally safe, solid-to-liquid, phase change material (PCM) that would melt and freeze sharply and concurrently at about 25°C, and have a heat of fusion +30 cal/g and (2) develop methods by which the PCM could be incorporated into building materials (specifically plasterboard) to accomplish energy conservation and electric peak-load shifting in residential and commercial buildings. These DOE PCM-plasterboard research goals have been achieved. A suitable low-cost linear alkyl hydrocarbon PCM from petroleum refining has been defined, and methods of containing the PCM to eliminate leakage and problems of expansion in melting and freezing have been developed. Processes whereby this PCM could be incorporated into plasterboard either by post-manufacturing imbibing of liquid PCM into the pore space of the plasterboard or by an additive that could be incorporated into the wet stage of plasterboard manufacture have been developed and tested in detail. Both of these processes have been successfully demonstrated in the laboratories of the University of Dayton Research Institute, National Gypsum Company (NGC) and United States Gypsum Company (USG).

Most important, it was determined that small-scale differential scanning calorimetry can adequately predict (within 9%) the performance of PCM wallboard when installed in full-scale applications. Initial PCM wallboard developmental tests were conducted on a small scale using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The DSC measured the melting point and latent heat of selected phase-change materials and some prototype PCM wallboard. Based on these initial DSC tests, coconut fatty acid was selected for the room-scale PCM wallboard tests due to its favorable melting and freezing temperature range. At a loading of 25% by weight, the DSC measured an average latent heat of 9.57 Btu/lb (22.26 J/g) for the PCM wallboard. The average melting point was 76.8 °F (24.9 °C). Additional tests were conducted to ascertain DSC measurement reproducibility, spatial uniformity of PCM loading, and PCM high-temperature stability. Room-scale tests showed that the PCM wallboard had an average thermal storage capacity of 10.4 Btu/lb (24.2 J/g). This varied by only 8.7% compared to the latent heat recorded by the DSC. Thus expensive, large-scale testing may not be required until a PCM wallboard product is well along in development. Thus far, the PCM wallboard development work has experimentally shown that the concept is workable on a large scale and that phase-change material can be successfully integrated and distributed within a building with a significant thermal storage effect. However, to obtain the magnitude of storage required, more work is needed to identify or develop new materials with greater latent heat capacity while keeping the melting/freezing range between 72 °F (22.2 °C) and 79 °F (26.1 °C).",,"Building materials; Calorimetry; Fatty acids; Materials testing; Thermal effects; Walls (structural partitions); Coconut fatty acid; Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Melting point; Phase change material (PCM) wallboard; Thermal energy storage capacity; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027885793

Specific models are discussed, such as dipolar and charge carrier polarisations in solids, and it is shown that the exponent n is related to the density of the polarising species and also to the dipole 'length' which in the case of hopping charge carriers means the hopping distance.

We describe a plausible mechanism, involving field stripping of excited hydrogen atoms, for these losses. Protons are injected into the PSR by transporting a neutral hydrogen beam through a hole in the yoke of one ring bender and then through a carbon foil on the ring axis. The foil strips roughly 93% of the beam atoms to protons. Although the original PSR design assumed that all unstripped atoms would pass through a hole in the yoke of the next downstream bender and on to a beam stop, recent calculations indicate that about 6% of these unstripped atoms will emerge from the foil in an excited state with principle quantum number n≥3. These calculations also indicate that atoms in excited states with n≥3 will be stripped quickly to protons in the 1.2-Tesla field of the downstream bender. The trajectories of these protons will be outside the phase-space acceptance of the ring and will be quickly lost by collision with the beam pipe, thereby giving rise to first-turn losses. The estimated numbers of protons that would be lost by this mechanism are consistent with the observed first-turn loss rates. This mechanism has important consequences for the design of future storage rings that use neutral atom or negative ion stripping for injection.",,"Colliding beam accelerators; Electron energy levels; Particle beam injection; Phase space methods; Protons; Storage rings; Beam loss measurements; First turn losses; Proton storage ring (PSR); Particle beam dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027883594

When decreasing the beta functions at the insertion point (IP), this technique becomes fairly ineffective, since it fails to properly correct the higher order chromatic aberrations. Here we consider the approach where the chromatic effects of the quadrupole lenses generating low beta functions at the IP are corrected locally with two families of sextupoles, one family for each plane. Each family has two pairs of sextupoles which are located symmetrically on both sides of the IP. The sextupole-like aberrations of individual sextupoles are eliminated by utilizing optics forming a -I transformation between sextupoles in the pair. The optics also includes bending magnets which preserve equal dispersion functions at the two sextupoles in each pair. At sextupoles in one family, the vertical beta function is made large and the horizontal is made small. The situation is reversed in the sextupoles of the other family. The betatron phase advances from the IP to the sextupoles are chosen to eliminate a second order chromatic aberration. The application of the localized chromatic correction is demonstrated using as an example the lattice design for the Low Energy Ring of the SLAC/LBL/LLNL PEP-II B Factory.",,"Aberrations; Accelerator magnets; Betatrons; Error compensation; Error correction; Function evaluation; Lenses; Particle beam dynamics; Particle optics; Localized chromaticity correction; Low beta insertions; Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027882356

Elektra Birseck has developed the following concept in order to optimize the use of fossil energy while minimizing the emission of pollutants: The co-generation power plant is equipped with a heat buffer. During the daily electrical load peak it is electrically, else thermally controlled. Thus, energy storage and transport are performed in the physically most adequate form, viz. in the heat buffer and in the electrical power system respectively. The power system transports the energy to two types of consumers whose peak loads appear at different times of the day: First to thermal consumers with electrical heat pumps equipped with short term buffer which make use of the environmental heat. Second to electrical consumers for whom it acts as peak power plant. The stability criterion for connecting a plant to the power system is derived. The results of the operation of 25 plants during several years are presented. The costs exceed the average electrical acquisition costs by appr. 0.02 US $/KWh.

Time resolved nuclear resonance scattering experiments, for example, need pulses of x-rays spaced at the order of 100 nsec apart and a very low noise floor (10-6) between pulses. Perhaps even more important than the level of the background is that it be reproducible and homogeneous in time.

In particular, to keep a constant stability margin along the linac, the scaling retained was such that β2/γ was constant. Recent developments suggest that the lattice scaling along the linac should be modulated differently in order to better balance the effects of the wake fields with respect to the chromatic dispersion. This may help to reduce the emittance dilution as would also a reasonable increase of the injection energy compatible with a bunch compressor. In the case of 250-GeV CLIC linacs, it was found that independent scaling of the cell length and focusing strength, and scaling laws different from the one mentioned above allow a better control of the growth of the small emittances foreseen, especially in the vertical plane. This approach combined with a simultaneous adjustment of the injection energy and an improvement of the trajectory mastering, has made it possible to relax the alignment tolerances on the quadrupoles and the cavities while keeping the final emittances at their required level.",,"Alignment; Betatrons; Cavity resonators; Colliding beam accelerators; Fits and tolerances; Focusing; Mathematical models; Particle beam injection; Stability; Storage rings; Bunch compressors; Cell length; Emittance control; Emittance dilution; Focusing strength; Injection energy; Lattice scaling; Wake fields; Linear accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027853432

The mathematical model of charge carriers transport in an amorphous nitride thin films in MONOS structures at the high electric fields has been developed. The essential peculiarity of this model is that the injected carriers from the contact are captured by a quasi-continuous spectrum of states that there are traps, having an exponential distribution of density in the nitride band gap and by the monoenergetic positively charged deep centers. The positive traps are made by the negative correlation energy defects.

In this paper we argue that such a policy is ill-founded because the supposition on which it rests is based on an incomplete consideration of the comparative pollution characteristics of the two fuels. The consideration is incomplete in two senses: (i) authors focus on emissions of carbon dioxide to the virtual exclusion of the secondary greenhouse gases, (ii) attention is paid only to those emissions which result from fuel combustion, rather than to emissions from the entire fuel cycle (including extraction, distribution and storage). In this paper we adopt a simple, empirical 'emission-accounting' framework [28]. Using a range of plausible parameter values it is demonstrated that the 'greenhouse friendliness' ranking of natural gas and oil is highly ambiguous. We cite very recent engineering estimates of methane leakage associated with commercial natural gas distribution and go on to demonstrate that natural gas usage may result in the emission of more greenhouse gases than oil usage. The ambiguity in the ranking is driven by two major uncertainties, one technological and one political. The most significant implication is that the resolution of the technical uncertainty surrounding the greenhouse effect and man's impact upon global climate will not be sufficient to determine what constitutes an effective policy response. The determination of policy will be an essentially political problem.

At high dispersion η the beam will be spread out corresponding to its initial (and/or correlated) energy spread ΔEo (or ΔErf) and is therefore very sensitive to energy changes.

The analytical and practical approaches taken to minimize the effects of these transients are described. Injector breakdowns were simulated using an air spark gap and measurements made using standard EMC test techniques. The power circuit was modeled using an electrical simulation code; good agreement was reached between the model and measured results.",,"Capacitor storage; Circuit theory; Computer simulation; Electric breakdown; Electric current measurement; Electric power systems; Electric spark gaps; Electromagnetic compatibility; Energy management; Equipment testing; Ion beams; Transients; Air spark gap; Continuous wave deuterium demonstrator; Electrical simulation code; EMC test techniques; High current transients; Injector breakdown; Magnetic snubber; Radio frequency quadrupole; Stray capacitance; Particle injectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027842007

At pressures commonly encountered in a hydraulic accumulator (up to 41.48 MPa, absolute (6000 psig)), thermodynamic properties of nitrogen depart significantly from ideal gas behavior. To determine the best equation of state for accumulator calculations, predictions of the ideal gas law, the Beattie-Bridgeman equation, the Benedict-Webb-Rubin (BWR) equation, and Sandri's equation of state were compared with nitrogen data published by the National Bureau of Standards. The BWR equation of state is shown superior to other proposed equations and is, consequently, selected for accumulator analysis. A hydraulic accumulator operating at a constant temperature will have the maximum possible energy storage capacity. A conventional accumulator can be 'isothermalized' by the insertion of an appropriate elastomeric foam into the gas enclosure. This will minimize entropy generation in the accumulator and virtually eliminate the thermal losses. At 300 K (80°F), the upper-bound volumetric energy density for commercially available accumulators rated at 20.79 MPa, absolute (3000 psig), is 7.27 MJ/m3-gas (276.0 hp-s/ft3). The corresponding value for 41.48 MPa, absolute (6000 psig), is 13.19 MJ/m3-gas (500.8 hp-s/ft3). These are theoretical limits and can only be approached by the insertion of an appropriate foam with an 'optimum' mass and construction. By comparing experimental data taken with an 8.185-liter (2.162-gallon), piston-type accumulator with analytical results, it is shown that foam optimization can increase the energy storage capacity of this accumulator by about 10%. The results of this study are applied to a 1361-kg 3000-lb) hybrid passenger car and minimum accumulator volume requirement, and its associated total mass are determined.",,"Automobiles; Energy storage; Entropy; Equations of state; Foams; Nitrogen; Optimization; Thermodynamic properties; Beattie-Bridgeman equation; Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation; Elastomeric foam; Energy storage capacity; Gas charged hydraulic accumulator; Hydraulic hybrid passenger car; Hydraulic hybrid vehicle; Ideal gas law; Sandri's equation; Hydraulic accumulators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027841915

The aim of the work has been to investigate theoretical and practical approaches to the design of heat-exchanger networks, including heat storage, for waste-heat recovery in batch processes. The study is limited to the incorporation of energy-storage systems based on fixed-temperature variable-mass stores. The background for preferring this to the alternatives (variable-temperature fixed-mass and constant-mass constant-temperature (latent-heat) stores) is given. It is shown that the maximum energy-saving targets as calculated by the Pinch-Point Method (Time Average Model, TAM) can be achieved by locating energy stores at either end of each process stream. This theoretically large number of heat-storage tanks (twice the number of process streams) can be reduced to just a few tanks. A simple procedure for determining a number of heat-storage tanks sufficient to achieve the maximum energy-saving targets as calculated by the Pinch-Point Method is described. This procedure relies on combinatorial considerations and could therefore be labelled the `Combinatorial Method' for incorporation of heat storage in heat-exchanger networks. Qualitative arguments justifying the procedure are presented. For simple systems, waste-heat recovery systems with only three heat-storage temperatures (a hot storage, a cold storage and a heat store at the Pinch Temperature) often can achieve the maximum energy-saving targets. Through case studies, six of which are presented, it is found that a theoretically large number of heat-storage tanks (twice the number of process streams) can be reduced to just a few tanks. The description of these six cases is intended to be sufficiently detailed to serve as bench-mark cases for development of alternative methods.",,"Chemical operations; Energy conservation; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Process control; Systems analysis; Tanks (containers); Batch processes; Fixed temperature variable mass storage; Pinch point method; Time average model (TAM); Waste heat utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027841280

In this paper, mass changes due to evaporation/condensation are neglected but heat exchange is retained in the energy equation. By doing this, a simple easily solvable set of equations can be set up to represent the thermal behaviour of the slab. No account is taken of possible wet exothermic reactions in this paper. The aim is simply to understand the effects of evaporation/condensation on the overall thermal history. Using a simple model which treats the mass changes within the material as negligible, the competitive effects of condensation and evaporation are shown to produce a two-time situation which depends crucially on the surface mass transfer/heat transfer ratio hm. Either self-heating occurs at a lower rate than that due to dry oxidation, or else a maximum temperature is reached before a lower equilibrium steady-state temperature is achieved. Thus, compared to the dry case, in general terms, evaporation certainly encourages stability. However, the final strictly subcritical steady state will not always be achieved due to the competitive process between recondensation and evaporation loss at the surface at medium timescales. A set of quasi-steady states is identified which yield plots of a more restrictive critical value of temperature against the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter (proportional to the thickness of the slab and its reactivity). If the value of hm is such that the maximum temperature reaches this critical value, then thermal runaway can still take place even though the starting value of temperature was strictly below the true (damp) final steady-state critical value. © 1993 Oxford Univerity Press.",,"Condensation; Evaporation; Heat transfer; Heating; Mass transfer; Materials handling; Mathematical models; Storage (materials); Thermal effects; Thermodynamic stability; Transport properties; Damp combustible materials; Reactive materials; Self heating; Semenov approach; Thermal runways; Flammable materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027841152

The restraining equipment used must be strong enough to prevent the flowline from exhibiting uncontrolled motion. Therefore, reaction forces must be computed before a service job to ensure that proper restraint systems are used. In practice, most damage occurs within the first few seconds after the equipment ruptures. Therefore, steady-state mathematical models are insufficient and transient models are essential to simulate such ruptures. Moreover, fracturing jobs often use foams, and these foams are often mixed with proppants (such as sand). Transient solutions must allow for the use of these fluids. This paper discusses the development of transient solutions for predicting reaction forces of exploding gases, foams, and propped foams. The solution employs numerical methods using quasisteady-state analysis techniques. It also outlines the effects of energy storage during rupture, allowing for the design of effective restraining equipment for the job.

Under typical operation, dump loads or battery charging maintain minimum diesel loads to insure long term diesel operation until, with adequate wind power and energy storage level, the diesels are turned off. Such operation results in high average fuel consumption and significant diesel wear from frequent stops and starts. An initial investigation of the subject suggests that variable speed operation of the diesel/generator set with an inverter to convert variable frequency power to 60 Hz power would result in lower acceptable diesel loads, increased fuel efficiency, and decreased start/stop engine wear.

Fuel consumption, generator and inverter efficiency, and lubrication system performance were used as indicators of system performance. As summarized in the paper, the results show a significant decrease in brake specific fuel consumption at low engine speed. Changes in performance indicators with speed and load indicate that low speed operation increases the acceptable load range of the diesel and that system fuel consumption is improved over typical synchronous speed operation.",,"Electric inverters; Electric loads; Fuel consumption; Lubrication; Synchronous generators; Systems analysis; Variable speed drives; Variable speed diesel generators; Wind/diesel systems; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027832091

The continuing economic problems and their effects on health increase the urgency of the need for assistance from the international community. Diverging trends in life expectancy became evident in the mid-1970s, and the gap continued to widen in the 1980s for all major causes of death, particularly cardiovascular diseases. The situation is worse in the NIS than in the CCEE, and worst in the central Asian countries. In 1990, the worst infant mortality rate in these countries was eight times the best rate elsewhere in the Region. Non-mortality data, while patchy, confirm the indications given by mortality data. There is no single reason for the health gap, but contributory factors include the increasing prevalence of major risk factors in lifestyles and the environment, and the low efficiency and effectiveness of health care systems. The current situation and short-term prospects are mixed, but the negative trends in mortality and morbidity patterns are likely to continue for some time. While the worst health problems of the transition period in the CCEE/NIS could largely have been avoided, there is no doubt that economizing on health today will exact large costs tomorrow.The socioeconomic conditions in eastern European countries are declining. Deterioration began during the mid-1960s. The mortality gap has continued to widen during the 1980s. The Central Asian Republics show mortality patterns similar to ones in developing countries; infant mortality is about 8 times higher than in western Europe. Infant mortality rates in eastern and central Europe are 2-3 times higher than in western Europe. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death. Another increasing mortality group is lung cancer, and the gap is widening in the West. The NIS (formerly republics of the Soviet Union) have high rates of communicable diseases preventable through immunization. The logistics of vaccine distribution and storage are inadequate. Abortion is the primary means of family planning. 70% of the population of the Russian Federation reported their health as less than good, and only 20% of Russian military personnel are fit based on international standards. Tobacco consumption and high alcohol consumption are the primary health risks. Poor nutrition, stress, and drug abuse add to the risks. The health gap is wide also due to poor housing conditions and environmental pollution. Health care systems, unhealthy lifestyles, and unhealthy environments all contribute to the widening gap in health. The rigid administrative health structures are not conducive to change. The quality of care is low. Decentralization and private sector involvement may produce needed changes in the quality of health services. CCEE countries spend 4.5-7.1% of gross national product on health, compared to 7.3% in the West. In the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia, health expenditures per person are 3-4 times less than in OECD countries. Prices are very high for drugs, food, and energy. Although the medical staff-patient ratio is high, there are shortages in particular specialties. Nurses are poorly trained and in low supply. Hospital equipment is very old and poorly maintained. There is overuse of secondary and tertiary hospitals and underuse of general hospitals.",,"eastern europe; europe; health status; human; life expectancy; politics; risk factor; short survey; social status; world health organization; Asia; Biology; Critique; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Europe; Health; Health Status Indexes; International Agencies; Obstacles; Organizations; Risk Factors; Un; Western Asia; Who; Europe; Europe, Eastern; Female; Health Status; Human; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Mortality; Primary Health Care; Quality of Health Care; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Women's Health; World Health Organization",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027820061

Due to the length of travel time to Mars the visit time will be on the order of days or months. A duration length that is not conductive to power systems such as primary fuel cells or batteries. Power systems for Mars will have to have an element of power generation. The candidate systems are photovoltaic with regenerative fuel cells (PV/RFC) and nuclear. This paper evaluates candidate PV array designs in conjunction with a candidate RFC storage system. The analysis is done in two steps. First several array designs (flat, tent, single axis tracked and two axis tracked) are analyzed to predict their performance on the Martian surface. Next these designs are coupled with RFC storage for a system model. The PV/RFC system designs are then optimized for minimum mass by trading off energy generation, PV, for energy storage, RFC. The optimization technique is based on methods used for optimizing terrestrial systems. This paper ties together several studies to provide a more detailed analysis of Mars PV system performance and Mars PV/RFC system mass. From the results of this analysis the performance benefit of several different array designs have been quantified and an optimum design approach identified. The next logical step would be to quantify the other characteristics (cost, operation, installation, maintenance) of array designs so that a Life Cycle Cost evaluation and selection can be made.",,"Fuel cells; Nuclear energy; Performance; Spacecraft; Mars surface; Regenerative fuel cells; Photovoltaic cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027816780

Clean burning methanol is produced from coal-derived synthesis gas off-peak, and withdrawn from storage and fired on-peak. This paper will describe the application of LPMEOH technology to convert a 500 MW GCC baseload reference plant into a flexible, load-following unit with a peak/valley capacity ratio of 3:1.

This type of system usually uses only about 85 percent of the evaporator capacity for cooling; the other 15 percent is used to superheat the refrigerant to protect the compressor from liquid slugging. This practice results in excessive evaporator volume. Full use of the evaporator is important in mobile air conditioning systems where the space available for the evaporator is very limited. In addition, full use of the evaporator provides higher cooling capacity and better dehumidification in residential applications. Current designs do not reflect those advantages. This study reports on a recuperative cycle (RC) air conditioning system that can use 100 percent of the evaporator effectively. At the same time, the design increases the compressor volumetric efficiency, resulting in an increase in refrigerant mass flow rate and a reduction in compressor power consumption. The test results indicated an improvement in system coefficient of performance (COP) of more than 20 percent over the entire compressor test range. The RC concept can also be used on heat pumps to improve system performance. conditioning system using Eutectic Salt was discussed and analyzed in this paper.

The analysis includes all the details of the melting process that takes place during the charging of the cell. While it is recognized that an overall latent heat storage system (LHSS) analysis is necessary to fully evaluate the effect of melting heat transfer on performance, it is considered that a single cell analysis can be used to give a qualitative indication of how the overall LHSS charging process takes place. The paper presents heat transfer and exergy analysis results for the cell charge process. Heat transfer results include interface positions and energy stored as a function of time. Heat transfer results are also compared with those obtained for melting with a constant wall temperature, to evaluate the effect of the interaction between the charge fluid and the cell. The results of the comparison indicate that this interaction has a great effect on heat transfer, resulting in asymmetric interface profiles and slower charge processes.

Whole-building energy simulations were made to compare the energy performance of a prototypical office building in three California climates using conventional and cold air distribution, with and without ice storage, to show the impacts of load shifting, energy use, and utility costs for three typical utility rate structures. The merits of economizers and fan-powered mixing boxes were also studied when used in conjunction with cold air delivery. A survey was conducted to assess the perceived strengths and limitations of this technology, perceived barriers to its widespread use, and user experience. The survey was based on interviews with consulting engineers, equipment manufacturers, researchers, utility representatives, and other users of cold air distribution technology. Selected findings from the industry survey are also discussed. Cold air distribution (CoAD) is found to always reduce fan energy use in comparison to conventional 55 °F (13 °C) air distribution systems when conditioned air is delivered directly to the space (no fan-powered mixing boxes). Total building energy use for ice storage/CoAD systems was always higher than a well-designed conventional system but significantly lower than a commonly installed packaged system. When a favorable utility rate structure was applied, the load-shifting benefits of ice storage/CoAD systems produced the lowest annual operating costs of all system-plant configurations studied.",,"Buildings; Cost accounting; Electric rates; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Surveys; Technology; Cold air distribution (CoAD); Fan energy use; Ice storage; Thermal energy storage (TES); Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027810350

A high repetition rate modulator and cell is presently being developed for use on a proposed heavy-ion recirculator. The goal is to develop an array of field-effect transistors to switch 5 kV, 1 μs pulses onto a Metglas induction core at pulse rates exceeding 100 kHz. Each transistor in the array is driven by a fiber-optic isolated gate signal that is powered by a dc/dc converter. The circuit architecture provides for core reset between pulses and produces bursts of pulses that are variable in pulse width and prf.

For adequate beam-residual gas lifetimes in these machines the pressure should typically be in the 10-10 Torr range. However the synchrotron radiation impinging on the walls of the vacuum chamber desorbs gas and may result in large pressure increases detrimental to the operation of the collider. To achieve the required strong bending in these machines it is necessary, in the case of the LHC, to employ dipole fields up to 9.0 T which need superconducting magnets operating at 1.9 K. The vacuum chamber is therefore at cryogenic temperature and functions as a cryopump.

The effects of internal radiation on the solidification/melting of an absorbing, emitting, and isotropically scattering, finite, and semi-transparent gray phase change medium bounded between two concentric cylinders was studied. In this two-dimensional transient system, heat at the inner surface was extracted/added at a constant rate and also by a secondary fluid passing through the inner tube. In developing the describing equations a method that uses enthalpy along with temperature as dependent variables was employed. In this approach the energy equation is applied once over the complete domain covering both phases. The location of the solid/liquid interface is eliminated from the formulation and is obtained as one of the results of the solution after the temperature distribution is found. Applying the law of conservation of energy to a control volume, the net rate of energy increase of a control volume was equated to the net rate of heat conducted and radiated into the control volume through its surfaces. The radiative heat flux term in the energy equation was obtained from the differential form of the equation of transfer. The pn differential approximation to the equation of radiative transfer was utilized to derive the necessary moment equations. Marshak type boundary conditions were used to solve the differential equation describing the radiative transfer. The moment equations were then conveniently coupled with the other terms in the energy equation. The resulting describing equations which include the radiative flux, along with the appropriate boundary and semi-transparent moving interfacial conditions were written in finite difference form. The Gauss-Seidel iterative method with successive over-relaxation was used to solve the non-linear simultaneous equations. The transient temperature distribution, solid/liquid interface location, radiative heat flux and energy storage capacity of the semi-transparent phase change medium were then determined using the numerical scheme. Using the transient multi-dimensional model, the effects of parameters such as optical and thermophysical properties of the medium, conduction-radiation interaction parameter on the rate of solidification/melting and energy storage capacity were studied. The results show that radiative heat transfer significantly affects the dynamics of solidification/melting as conduction-radiation interaction parameter decreases. The results of this study will lead to a better design and optimization of phase change thermal energy storage systems particularly for space applications.",,"Approximation theory; Describing functions; Differential equations; Finite difference method; Heat radiation; Iterative methods; Melting; Nonlinear equations; Phase interfaces; Solidification; Temperature distribution; Thermodynamics; Enthalpy; Gauss Seidel iterative method; Internal radiation; Marshak type boundary conditions; Phase change thermal energy storage (TES) systems; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027807602

Processing of polymer-based composites into complex shapes is well established and relatively easy when compared with traditional ceramic processing unit operations. In addition, incorporating a ceramic superconductor into a polymer matrix can improve mechanical performance as compared with a monolithic ceramic. Finally, because ceramic superconductors are susceptible to attack by moisture, a polymer-based composite structure can also provide protection from deleterious environmental effects. This paper focuses on the processing and subsequent characterization of ceramic superconductor/polymer composites designed primarily for electromagnetic shielding and diamagnetic applications. YBa2Cu3O7-x[YBCO] ceramic superconductor is combined with poly(methyl methacrylate) [PMMA] to form novel composite structures. Composite structures have been molded with both a discontinuous superconducting phase (i.e., ceramic particulate reinforced polymers) and with a continuous superconducting phase (i.e., polymer infiltrated porous ceramics). Characterization of these composite structures includes the determination of diamagnetic strength, electromagnetic shielding effectiveness, mechanical performance, and environmental resistance. The goal of this program is to produce a composite structure with increased mechanical integrity and environmental resistance at liquid nitrogen temperatures without compromising the electromagnetic shielding and diamagnetic properties of the superconducting phase. Composites structures of this type are potentially useful in numerous magnetic applications including electromagnetic shielding, magnetic sensors, energy storage, magnetic levitation, and motor windings.",,"Ceramic materials; Characterization; Composite structures; Copper oxides; Electromagnetic shielding; High temperature superconductors; Mechanical properties; Phase transitions; Polymers; Polymethyl methacrylates; Processing; Structure (composition); Yttrium compounds; Ceramic superconductor/polymer composites; Nonmetallic matrix composites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027802108

Not included are rock-mechanical effects. The model is based on a mass and energy balance for the gas filled cavern and on the Bernoulli equation and energy balance for flow in the wellbore. The cavern equations are solved iteratively at successive time steps. The wellbore equations are solved within an iteration cycle of the cavern equations. Gas properties are calculated internally using generally accepted correlations and basic thermodynamic relations.

There are fifteen such switches in the TFTR power conversion TF and PF coil system. These switches are metal enclosed DC equipment, rated at 15 kV (2500 amperes continuous). They contain gapless zinc oxide arrestors, a stored-energy-operated, double-pole, single-throw grounding switch (capable of closing in on an 80 kA load current), a double-pole, single-throw disconnect switch (to isolate the load from the power supplies), and polarity reversal bus links. In addition to circuit protection the switches provide a level of electrical isolation when it is necessary to access the DC side of the machinery. The operation of the stored energy grounding switches are the subject of this paper. The ground switch is opened by a pneumatic cylinder and is closed with the energy stored, in two heavy springs, during the opening stroke. Whenever the ground switch closes in the normal mode, it does so with a very high level of mechanical acceleration and, consequently, with a relatively high incidence of breakdown. Off line operating modes (i.e., access to Tokamak, hipot testing of the coils, power supply reconfiguration, maintenance and testing) generate a significant number of ground switch operations for non emergency purposes. To minimize downtime resulting from the mechanical trauma of frequent operation, a soft close operating mode was designed into the existing electrical and pneumatic system since there is no need for rapid switch closure during these conditions. Implementation of the soft close enhancement is accomplished pneumatically. Whenever the ground switch control logic detects that its associated interleaf power supplies are disarmed, air pressure from an accumulator tank (an integral component of each switch) is introduced into the backside of the piston of the main pneumatic cylinder. The energy stored in the closing springs is released upon receipt of a 'Close' command. This backfill pressure is vented to atmosphere through a small orifice. The ground switch will now close slowly due to the action of the large closing springs working against a pneumatic impedance. The design of the soft close system and its operational logic will be described in this paper.",,"DC machinery; Design; Electric equipment protection; Electric grounding; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Pistons; Pneumatic control equipment; Security systems; Switches; Accumulator tank; Hipot testing; Poloidal field coil; Soft close system; Tokamak fusion test reactor; Toroidal field coil; Tokamak devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027756412

On the other hand, DCS and DCRS store only enough primary coolant at the exit temperature to supply the BOP during the downtime. In DCRS, large pumping power is avoided by making the storage chambers into large cylinders and charging and discharging them with the primary coolant reversibly against nearly equal back pressures of steam bled from the steam turbines.

The experiment requires flexibility in the control of magnet currents to achieve simultaneous shaping, ohmic drive, and position control with a small set of uncompensated PF magnets. The relatively modest budget and limited manpower make issues of maintenance and reliability extremely important to the eventual success of the experiment. These requirements resulted in a power system design with many unique features. A total of 11 conversion systems power the 14 magnets of the tokamak to provide nearly complete flexibility in plasma shaping and control. Five thyristor circuit breakers are used to initiate the plasma. Four of the PF converters utilize circulating current configurations to maintain plasma position control as the magnet currents pass through zero. The TF converter incorporates transformer tap-changing circuitry to reduce alternator loads during peak demand periods. Many converters have solid-state fuse loss and conduction monitor circuits that allow continued operation when only 1 device in a parallel bank fails. The same circuits detect commutation failures and protect the converters from these potentially destructive faults. Unique design features can sometimes lead to new and unforeseen problems in operation or maintenance. This report will discuss the initial operating experience of the Alcator C-MOD power system from preliminary acceptance testing through plasma operations. The performance of the thyristor circuit breakers, commutation and conduction monitor circuits, circulating current power supplies, and tap-changing TF supply will be presented and compared with expectations.

In the literature perturbation approximations, finite element methods and various phenomenological parameter-fitting using experimental data are among the techniques which have been exploited. In this paper, a non-perturbation approximation method, which attempts to parallel some well-established techniques used in solving electromagnetic waveguide-discontinuity problems, is developed as an alternate numerical procedure for calculating SAW reflections. Implementing such method requires that the full solution to SAW propagation in the free and in the layered regions be obtained. Thus, for a free-to-metallized discontinuity, the two SAW phase velocities, the total SAW power flow in the free region and in the layered region, and the electroacoustic fields, must be calculated. In this paper the reflection problem is formulated as an optimization problem subject to the necessary scattering parameter constraints.

Symmetrically illuminated, direct drive targets were chosen for the KrF laser driver for better gain at a lower cost. The 4 MJ pulse energy to the target is provided by 960 medium-sized (6 kJ) electric discharge lasers. This provides redundancy, system reliability, and stringent illumination requirements. Innovative non-linear optics (NLO) design for beam combination and pulse compression converts the beams into temporally-shaped, high quality beams. The 60 beamlines are shielded to minimize the radiation to the reactor and driver buildings. Long-lived, aluminum-coated, grazing incidence metal mirrors (GIMM), supported by SiC structure, are located within 20 meters of the center of the reactor cavity. These GIMMs and the final focusing mirrors are high-speed, adaptable structures that help steer the beams to the position of the tracked target. The second reactor design uses an innovative, lower-cost, pulsed, single beamline LINAC to deliver heavy ion beams into 14 storage rings. Tailoring of the beam storage, compression, and extraction from the storage rings provides the required temporal and energy shaping. The sets of beams are divided to illuminate the indirectly-driven target from two sides with 7 MJ of energy. The beams are focused to a point on the backside of the blanket where the beams are stripped to a high charge state. This enables formation of a small diameter transport channel through the blanket and across the cavity to the target. The first wall system for both designs uses a SiC structure cooled internally and on the surface with liquid lead. The lead is evaporated and recondensed on the surface to protect and cool the first wall from the 3 to 5 Hz target explosions. The blanket is a Li2O solid breeder, cooled with low pressure helium. The two Prometheus IFE reactor designs show that IFE has the potential to be economically competitive with very attractive safety and environmental features while maintaining a high degree of technical credibility.",,"Codes (symbols); Computer simulation; Excimer lasers; Ion beams; Laser beams; Lighting; Linear accelerators; Mirrors; Nonlinear optics; Plant layout; Radiation shielding; Silicon carbide; Balance of plant; Direct drive target; First wall system; Grazing incidence metal mirrors; Heavy ion beam driver; Inertial fusion energy reactor; Fusion reactors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027744536

The supercooling of the liquid can be reduced by adding some activation factors, such as shock, flow, impurities, and so on, but the mechanisms of freezing of supercooled liquid under the activation conditions have not been made clear. In this study, therefore, effects of agitation due to alternating electric fields on the freezing of supercooled liquid droplet were experimentally investigated.

The QLS and SLS experiments show a pronounced water-induced micellar growth from small and almost spherical reverse micelles at ω-0$/ = 2.0 to giant polymer-like reverse micelles at ω-0$/ ≥ 8.0 for lecithin/cyclohexane w/o-microemulsions. An excellent agreement between polymer theory for dilute and semidilute solutions and the light scattering results was found. At volume fractions φ ≪ φ*, where φ* is the overlap threshold, the scattering data is in good agreement with the work-like chain model. At φ &gt; φ* a viscoelastic network is formed, and properties such as the static (ζs) and hydrodynamic (ζh) correlation length or the osmotic compressibility exhibit universal behavior which is in agreement with scaling theory and experimental results from polymer literature. While the dependence of the zero shear viscosity ηs on φ can be explained by the `living polymer' model, the frequency-dependent measurements of storage and loss moduli G' and G″ are in clear disagreement with the single exponential stress relaxation predicted by this model. The frequency-dependent measurements could indicate the formation of crosslinks between the entangled micelles, a hypotheses further supported by the very large values for the `scission energy' found in a preliminary study of the temperature dependence of the micellar size distribution at low values of φ.",,"Colloid chemistry; Light scattering; Mathematical models; Physical chemistry; Polymers; Rheology; Correlation strength; Equilibrium polymers; Lecithin reverse micelles; Micellar size distribution; Osmotic compressibility; Scission energy; Sphere to coil transition; Micelles",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027726707

After 25 years of utility service and 8 years of pulsed operation the alternator is still in good condition.

This means the alternator must be interlocked with the power supplies (7 in all) so that it can protect itself from excessive armature current should any one fail. It also necessitates monitoring many of the critical temperatures, pressures and safety backup systems so that either operator intervention or an orderly shut-down can prevent serious problems.

The response of the TSM sensor arises from the perturbation of the electrified interface, including the acoustoelectric coupling of the surface potential with ionic species and the formation of the electrical double layer. In dilute solutions, dissipation of acoustic energy resulting from acoustoelectric coupling dominates the complete energy-transfer process, which leads to a rapid decrease of the series resonant frequency and an increase in the motional resistance. In concentrated solutions, energy transfer from the quartz dielectric to the interface becomes more important due to increasing energy storage of the double layer, as shown by the continuing increase of the static capacitance and steady decrease of the parallel resonant frequency. In addition, the overall energetics of the dissipation and transfer processes at the interface are reflected in the measurement of the quality factor. © 1993, American Chemical Society.

At present, circularly polarized x-rays are obtained from storage ring bending magnets by accepting radiation from above and below the axis, but insertion device sources are desired for greater intensity. Planar helical undulators are magnetic insertion devices that generate helical magnetic fields. The charged particle beam executes a helical trajectory in the device, and produces elliptically polarized x-rays. The special case of circularly polarized x-rays is most in demand. We present here the design description of a new type of planar helical undulator, which we are constructing for the SPEAR storage ring at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL). It comprises four rows of pure permanent magnet blocks, one row in each quadrant about the axis defined by the electron beam. Rows may be translated longitudinally with respect to each other to change the helicity of the magnetic field they create at the position of the beam. They may also be translated longitudinally to vary the energy of the x-rays emitted, unlike designs where this function is performed by varying the gap between the rows.

Activation free energies are linearly related to the inverse of the oligomer length n (the dimerization rate decreases as n is increased). Thin films of methyl end-capped thiophene oligomers (n = 4, 6, 8 and 10) display reversible oxidations from a single one-electron step (tetramer) to a single two-electron step (octamer and decamer) through two separate one-electron steps (hexamer). ESR indicates strong magnetic dimerization for the one-electron-oxidized hexamer. The close resemblance of the electrochemical and ESR behaviour of the hexamer with that of polythiophene suggests that oxidation of the latter occurs via hexameric spin-dimerized polarons. The conductive and capacitive properties of the end-capped oligomers (n = 6, 8 and 10) were investigated by in situ conductivity and chronopotentiometry. While conductivity of octamer and decamer is displayed at the two-electron (bipolaron) state, the hexamer, insulating at this state, is conducting at the mixed-valence polaron-bipolaron state; capacitive responses are evidenced at the bipolaron state for the octamer and decamer only. The difference of conductive and capacitive behaviour between the hexamer and the higher oligomers is explained by charge localization in hexameric segments. © 1993.",,"Aromatic compounds; Capacitance; Chemical activation; Electric conductivity; Electrochemistry; Microwave spectroscopy; Oligomers; Oxidation; Polymerization; Reaction kinetics; Sulfur compounds; Thin films; Electron spin resonance (ESR); End capped oligothienyls; Thiophene oligomers; Conductive materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027699254

The desire to remediate the thousands of sites has become an increasing concern. In many cases, a lack of knowledge regarding the exact location and depth of these objects can greatly escalate the time requirements and costs of a cleanup. Currently, the estimated cost for cleanup is approximately $100 billion with site characterization costs in the range of $25-30 billion. The United States Department of Energy's Special Technologies Laboratory (STL) staff has been involved with subsurface technologies and imaging since 1968. STL has developed a stepped FM-CW Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) that operates from 196 MHz to 708 MHz. Included is a brief technical description on this fully self-contained unit. Several sample data sets also are described for familiarization with the unique data format of this GPR. Field tests were conducted at old toxic waste disposal sites at Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. Soil composition was mainly clay at the INEL location and a rocky limestone/sand mixture at the LANL location. The primary targets of interest were 55 gallon barrels (metallic), but larger concrete storage containers also were examined. Field tests for buried ordnance were conducted at Twenty Nine Palms Magnetic Test Range in California and at Fort Polk in Louisiana. The soil was mainly sand at the Twenty Nine Palms location and a loam composition at the Fort Polk location. The primary targets of interest varied from 60 mm projectiles to 500 pound bombs. Test surveys were conducted to determine the feasibility of GPR under these specific conditions. Detection of both known and unknown targets were made to varying degrees. Estimations of lateral location and depth of these targets were accomplished. This paper describes how ground penetrating radar can be applied to site characterization, its limitations and some case study results. © 1993 SPIE.

Cooling by radiation from the disk is included. In the absence of a mass transferring stream, with shocks excited by the tidal force only, the disk quickly settles into a quasi-stationary shock pattern. The presence of a stream impacting on the disk has a profound effect by keeping the flow very nonsteady. From simulations covering several hundred binary orbits, we find the following sequence of events. After an initial transient (which lasts on the order of 20 orbits) most of the mass transferred accumulates in a ring while a lower level accretion takes place from the ring onto the central object. For disk temperatures of a few percent of the local virial temperature, the effective α-viscosity, as measured by the accretion rate, during this phase is of the order 10-3. The size of the disk and the shape of the brightness distribution across it agree well with observations of quiescent CV disks. The rotation profile in the ring approaches a constant angular momentum distribution and then becomes violently unstable by a process observed earlier by Blaes and Hawley. During the instability, the accretion rate onto the central object is enhanced. Storage of mass in a ring alternating with accreting phases due to instability of the torus is expected to take place in general at low disk viscosity, whatever the process responsible for the viscosity. This provides a new mechanism for soft X-ray transients and the superoutburst cycle in cataclysmic variables.","Accretion, accretion disks; Binaries: close; Methods: numerical; Shock waves; Videotapes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044250699

Also the properties of the amplifier play a role; the Robinson criterion is an example. Longitudinal mismatch can be excited as well by cavity as by amplifier properties. The mechanism can be very easily demonstrated and understood in case of a storage ring with a one-gap RF cavity. In case of a linac of finite length, the effect is evaluated statistically.

Among organic Ca2+-channel modulators, the diphenylalkylamines tested consistently inhibited TY binding: the order of potency was prenylamine&gt;lidoflazine&gt;flunarizine&gt;cinnarizine, with Ki values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.2 μM, respectively. Low (up to 100 nM) concentrations of prenylamine did competitively inhibit TY binding, and higher concentrations provoked a mixed-type inhibition. Furthermore, LIGAND-analysis of competition curves revealed a high- and a low-affinity binding site for prenylamine and flunarizine. The TY binding process was also sensitive to selected K+- and Na+-channel modulators. Since several Ca2+-antagonists are known to affect H+-ATPase and the bioenergetics of catecholamine storage vesicles in chromaffin granules, thus affecting monoamine storage, the energy requirements for the formation of the TY/carrier complex were here assessed, assuming similarity between chromaffin granules and synaptic vesicles. TY binding, though not reflecting endovesicle-sequestered TY, was indeed strongly sensitive (with Ki coefficients in the fM or low nM range) to the dissipation of the vesicular transmembrane proton concentration (Δ pH), electrical (Δ Ψ), and proton electrochemical (Δ μH+) gradients, provoked by a number of specifically targeted agents. It is concluded that Ca2+-channel agents of the diphenylalkylamine group may directly affect striatal TY binding due to an extrachannel-regulated competition with TY for the vesicular carrier of DA, as well indirectly, by disruption of the transmembrane energization of the reserpine-sensitive carrier. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","[3H]Tyramine binding; Ca2+-channel modulators; dopamine carrier; K+-channel antagonists; Na+-channel agents; vesicle membrane energetics; vesicular markers","binding protein; calcium channel; catecholamine; cinnarizine; flunarizine; lidoflazine; potassium channel; prenylamine; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; sodium channel; animal cell; animal tissue; article; binding site; bioenergy; dopaminergic transmission; male; membrane vesicle; nonhuman; priority journal; proton motive force; rat; synapse vesicle; Animal; Binding, Competitive; Calcium Channel Blockers; Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; Cations; Cell Membrane; Comparative Study; Corpus Striatum; Electrochemistry; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Oligomycins; Potassium Channels; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium Channels; Tritium; Tyramine; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027490246

The emulsion under investigation was stabilized by fractionated egg phospholipids and the majority of particles had diameters in the nanometer size range. Systems with a comparable chemical composition and size distribution are used in the pharmaceutical field for intravenous administration. The influence of the high energy input during production on the structure of such phospholipid-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions is of special interest since toxic side-efrects have been described which seem to be related to an excess of phospholipids and structural parameters. During production and storage (for more than 1 year) lysophospholipids and free fatty acids were formed by the degradation of the fractionated egg phospholipids and thereby influenced the actual composition of the emulsifier. Although about 12 mol.% of the phospholipids were lysophospholipids and at least comparable amounts of partly ionized free fatty acids existed in the emulsion, micellar or mixed micellar structures were not detected. Nuclear magnetic resonance data as well as zeta potential measurements indicated that the majority of lysophospholipids and ionized fatty acids were incorporated in the emulsifier layers and influenced the actual surface charge density of the emulsion droplets. In contrast to earlier findings on cruder o/w emulsions, the predominant particle structure of the emulsion droplets was an oil core covered by a phospholipid monolayer. The excess of emulsifier did not form predominantly liquid crystalline lamellar structures at the oil-water interface as described for cruder systems but small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). Large numbers of SUVs coexisted in the system with real emulsion droplets. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were not found, probably owing to the high energy input during homogenization. Additionally, few double-emulsion particles and large multiple vesicles could be detected. The results indicate that the submicron-sized o/w emulsion under investigation is a complex system containing various types of particle. It seems that in submicron-sized o/w emulsions the excess of phospholipids does not preferably form liquid crystalline lamellar structures at the oil-water interfaces but SUVs, owing to the high energy input during their production.

The detectors are calibrated using short (20 ps) and long (500 ps) pulse X-ray irradiation and 3-60 ps, deep UV (202 and 213 nm), spatially-smoothed laser irradiation. Two-dimensional unsaturated gain profiles show &lt; 5 % percent long-range transverse variations but up to 3 dB/cm drop in gain parallel to the pulse propagation direction. Up to 50 % gain enhancements due to voltage reflection from the bends of a meander stripline geometry3 and from the ends of conventional straight striplines4 are also observed. Reproducible gate profiles are obtained with either picosecond X-ray or UV bursts and FWHM extracted with 3 picosecond accuracy. A novel single-shot method for measuring local gate propagation speeds using a tilted MCP is also demonstrated. Detailed output versus input studies indicate a linear dynamic range of 300. At higher irradiances, the gradual transition from linear behavior to hard saturation is gathered over a range of 105 in irradiation and fitted using a discrete dynode model5,6. Finally, a pump-probe experiment quantifying for the first time long-suspected gain depletion by strong localized irradiation was performed. Gain depletion is defined here as a drop in the pulsed voltage amplitude beyond that due to normal resistive losses1 as it propagates along the MCP microstrip. The mechanism for the extra voltage and hence gain degradation is shown to be associated with intense MCP irradiation in the presence of the voltage pulse, at a fluence at least an order of magnitude above that necessary for saturation. Results obtained for both constant pump area and constant pump fluence are presented. The data is well modelled by calculating the instantaneous electrical energy loss due to the intense charge extraction at the pump site and then recalculating the gain downstream at the probe site given the pump-dependent degradation in voltage amplitude. © 1993 SPIE.

Resonators were fabricated with different degrees of random surface roughness by polishing AT-cut quartz crystals with various abrasive particle sizes and then depositing conformal Cr/Au electrodes. The electrical response of liquid-contacted resonators was measured over a range of frequencies near resonance and fit to an equivalent-circuit model. A method is described for determining the complex shear mechanical impedance (the ratio of shear stress to particle velocity at the solid/liquid interface) from the equivalent-circuit elements. This impedance is sensitive to the influence of surface microstructure on the solid/liquid interaction. The surface mechanical impedance was measured while surface roughness, contacting liquid properties, device operating frequency, and liquid contact angle were varied. Results show that, for roughness features much less than the liquid decay length, the surface may be considered hydrodynamically smooth and the responses depend only on the density-viscosity product. As features become comparable to or larger than the decay length, new mechanisms, including liquid trapping and compressional wave generation, arise for energy storage and power dissipation. Surface treatments that vary the liquid contact angle show no significant effect for liquid coupling by a smooth surface; however, the extent of liquid trapping by a rough surface appears to diminish with increasing liquid contact angle, explaining results previously attributed to the occurrence of slip at the solid/liquid interface. © 1993, American Chemical Society.

The site has an annual precipitation of 1100 mm and a deposition of about 20 kg N and 25 kg S per ha-1 yr-1. The soil type is a poorly developed podzol. Treatment include irrigation; artificial drought; ammonium sulphate addition; nitrogen-free-fertilization and irrigation with liquid fertilizers including a complete set of nutrients. The experiment has a randomized block design with four replicates per treatment. A comprehensive investigation of the above ground C storage on an areal basis was made at the start of the experiment and after 3 yr of treatment. After 3 yr of treatment with simulated N-S deposition using ammonium sulphate (100 kg N, 114 kg S ha-1 yr-1), C accumulation rates in the above ground compartments had increased by 37%. Similarly, irrigation caused increased C accumulation rates by 25%, whereas simulated drought during the vegetation period during 2 yr followed by 1 yr of recovery caused a 15% reduction of the C accumulation rates. Irrigation combined with liquid fertilization (100 kg N ha-1 yr-1), including all important nutrient elements, led to 65% increase in C accumulation rates compared to the control. The C sequestration of the latter treatment gradually increased and, during yr 5 of treatment, 8.6 Mg C ha-1 accumulated in stems and branches, compared to 3.6 Mg ha-1 for the control. It is concluded that there is a strong interaction between N-deposition and C accumulation rates in Norway spruce in south Sweden. The C accumulation rates are also sensitive to water availability.

The most commonly occurring precipitant of acute asphyxia has always been the transfer between air and water environments. Over the last one hundred years studies on a wide range of living organisms, from single cells to complex multicellular organisms like mammals, have demonstrated the presence of well-defined metabolic and cardiovascular-respiratory mechanisms for protecting living things against acute asphyxia. Single-celled animals depend upon anaerobiosis and secondarily hypometabolism. In addition to these processes, animals with gills or lungs utilize ""passive"" protection such as increased oxygen storage and the ""dynamic"" cardiovascular adjustments of bradycardia and selective ischemia. These latter changes decrease overall oxygen consumption and hence utilize the oxygen stores in the most economical way to protect the cardiac and cerebral tissue, which are most sensitive to hypoxia and vital to continued survival of the organism. In this article an attempt is made to place these processes into an evolutionary context. As through a glass darkly we glimpse asphyxial defense running like a paleophysiological thread through hundreds of millions of years, being accentuated here and muted there, depending upon the particular needs of individual species. © 1993 Springer.",,"animal; asphyxia; evolution; human; pathophysiology; review; Animal; Asphyxia; Evolution; Human",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027672389

The dispersions prepared by photoreduction in the presence of micelle are mainly composed of the mixtures of monometallic gold and platinum clusters, which cannot work as more active catalysts than monometallic platinum clusters. In contrast, the dispersions prepared by alcohol-reduction in the presence of polymer are composed of Au/Pt bimetallic clusters with a ""Pt-surrounded Au-core"" structure, which are more active catalysts than the monometallic Pt clusters as catalysts for the hydrogen production. © 1993 Indian Academy of Sciences.","Bimetallic cluster; catalysts; electron transfer; hydrogen production; platinum; solar energy storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008089024

The latex contained grafted poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and three different particle diameters (D = 147, 435, and 915 nm) were used. Results were obtained as a function of HEC volume fraction, φp, and particle volume fraction, φs. A scaling law was used to describe the dependence of the extrapolated yield value, τβ, with φs above the critical flocculation polymer volume fraction, φ+p. The exponent in φs was constant and of the order of 2.8, which is close to that for a diffusion controlled aggregation process. τβ was used to calculate the energy of separation between the particles in a flocculated structure. The free energy of attraction due to depletion, Gdep was calculated using three theories. The storage modulus, G′, was measured as a function of φp, φs, particle size (D), and molecular weight of HEC. The results showed an increase in G′ with increase in φp as expected. However, G′ increased with increase in D which is opposite to the effect found previously using PEO. In addition, the molecular weight of HEC did not significantly affect the dependence of G′ on φs. These results were unexpected; tentative explanations for them are given. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001598081

Experimental results show that multilayer interconnect consisting of AlCu on Ti/TiN barrier layer has superior electromigration resistance as compared to that deposited on single TiN film. The application of an advanced wafer-level reliability test enables us to investigate grain boundary diffusion controlled electromigration phenomenon. The microstructural properties of the metallizations are also characterized by X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscope. The stress migration resistance is also studied using high temperature storage at 175 °C and thermal cycle treatment at 450 °C. The study shows that the increase in (111) preferred orientation of AlCu film and grain size with less random distribution do improve the electromigration lifetime. The effects of various metal geometries such as interconnect width and thickness on reliability are also investigated in this paper. Data shows the electromigration lifetime is not monotonically proportional to the increase in metal thickness. Due to the bamboo structure effect, the narrower interconnect shows the longer lifetime. An activation energy (Ea) of 0.94 eV is found for the multilayer metallization, Ti/TiN/AlCu/TiN. The resistance change measured after the stress migration experiment shows that the multilayer interconnect with the intermediate thickness of AlCu has comparable stress migration resistance to those of thicker films. The effect of other parameters like the thickness of TiN anti-reflective coating (ARC) on reliability is also investigated. © 1993 SPIE.

This dynamics consists in the mutual redefinition of the characteristic function and of its domain depending on the matching with the input.

The aim of this study was to quantify the seasonal and diurnal variation of energy budget components of a 2.6 ha short-rotation stand. Measurements were made using a thermometer interchange system for gradient and Bowen ratio estimations. Energy storage in soil, air and biomass was determined from temperature and humidity measurements. The partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes changed drastically at the beginning of the season. From the first half of May until the second half of June the maximum (noon) latent heat flux increased by a factor of 3, the total storage decreased by a factor of 2 and the sensible heat flux decreased by a factor of 4.5, while net radiation was unchanged. The vapour pressure deficit was similar during these periods but the leaf area index increased from about zero to three. On a mean monthly basis, the sensible heat flux was negative (directed towards the surface) from June to October, i.e., during most of the season. Heat was supplied to the atmosphere only at the beginning of the season for this type of short-rotation stand. Heat storage in air and biomass was significant on an hourly basis, especially in mornings and evenings when it could be of the same order as the net radiation. It was concluded that the development stage of the short-rotation stand had a large influence on how the energy was distributed between the convective fluxes. It was also concluded that storage in air and biomass had to be accounted for if precise estimates of energy balance on a shorter (hourly) time scale were required. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",,"energy budget; latent heat flux; sensible heat flux; short-rotation stand; willow forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027880957

The rats were meal-fed regularly twice a day (0800-0900 hours and 1800-1900 hours) on either a high carbohydrate (CHO) (carbohydrate/fat/protein = 70/5/25, % of energy) or high fat (FAT) (35/40/25) diet for 12 days. On the final day of the experiment, all of the rats in each dietary group were fed an evening meal containing equal amounts of energy (420 kJ · kg-1 body mass). After the meal, they were divided into three subgroups: pre-exercise control (PC), exercise (EX), and resting control (RC). The PC-CHO and PC-FAT groups were sacrificed at 2030 hours. The EX-CHO and EX-FAT groups were given a period of 3-h swimming, and then sacrificed at 2330 hours. The RC-CHO and RC-FAT groups rested after the meal and were sacrificed at 2330 hours. Total energy expenditure during the period 1.5 h from the commencement of exercise was higher in EX-CHO than in EX-FAT. The respiratory exchange ratio was also higher in EX-CHO than in EX-FAT, suggesting enhanced carbohydrate oxidation in the former. Compared with both PC-FAT and RC-FAT, the liver glycogen content of EX-FAT rats was significantly decreased by exercise. On the other hand, the liver glycogen content of both EX-CHO and RC-CHO was higher than that of PC-CHO rats. The glycogen content of soleus muscle of EX-FAT was slightly decreased during exercise, however, that of EX-CHO increased significantly. Thus postprandial energy expenditure during exercise was higher in the rats fed the CHO diet than in those fed the FAT diet, which could have been related to the increase of both liver and muscle glycogen storage during exercise in the former. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Glycogen; High-carbohydrate diet; Liver; Muscle; Oxygen consumption; Prolonged exercise; Rat","glycogen; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; energy expenditure; exercise; glycogen liver level; glycogen muscle level; lipid diet; lung gas exchange; male; nonhuman; postprandial state; priority journal; rat; soleus muscle; Animal; Body Weight; Comparative Study; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Epinephrine; Exertion; Glycogen; Liver Glycogen; Male; Muscles; Norepinephrine; Organ Weight; Oxygen Consumption; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027168864

Among the recent results are the following: The measured spectra can be fitted to N(p2) = N0 exp (—p2/Po)> where p is the momentum of the ejectiles and p0 » 360 MeV/c for all ejected particles from protons to alpha particles and for all 16 targets except 6Li. The proton spectra show an additional low-momentum component attributed to evaporation. The measured residual nucleus distribution from stopped p annihilation in Cu, when compared with INC calculations and with residual mass distributions from energetic n+, n˜ and proton interactions with Cu, indicate that the energy set free in the annihilation process is used only in part as excitation energy. The residual nucleus distribution from a 238U target shows that both symmetric and asymmetric fission take place. Detection and analysis of coincident fission products from 209Bi, 232Th and 238U enabled us to determine the individual and total mass and energy distributions of the fragments, their opening angle, the average excitation energy and momentum of the nucleus at scission, and the number of nucleons emitted before and after scission. We also found that the process is asymmetric for low excitation energies and symmetric for higher ones.

Box 101251, Bayreuth, D-95440, Germany","Canopy-scale evaporation rate (E) and derived surface and aerodynamic conductances for the transfer of water vapour (gs and ga, respectively) are reviewed for coniferous forests and grasslands. Despite the extremes of canopy structure, the two vegetation types have similar maximum hourly evaporation rates (Emax) and maximum surface conductances (gsmax) (medians = 0.46 mm h-1 and 22 mm s-1). However, on a daily basis, median Emax of coniferous forest (4.0 mm d-1) is significantly lower than that of grassland (4.6 mm d-1). Additionally, a representative value of ga for coniferous forest (200 mm s-1) is an order of magnitude more than the corresponding value for grassland (25 mm s-1). The proportional sensitivity of E, calculated by the Penman-Monteith equation, to changes in gs is &gt;0.7 for coniferous forest, but as low as 0.3 for grassland. The proportional sensitivity of E to changes in ga is generally ±0.15 or less. Boundary-line relationships between gs and light and air saturation deficit (D) vary considerably. Attainment of gsmax occurs at a much lower irradiance for coniferous forest than for grassland (15 versus about 45% of full sunlight). Relationships between gs and D measured above the canopy appear to be fairly uniform for coniferous forest, but are variable for grassland. More uniform relationships may be found for surfaces with relatively small ga, like grassland, by using D at the evaporating surface (D0) as the independent variable rather than D at a reference point above the surface. An analytical expression is given for determining D0 from measurable quantities. Evaporation rate also depends on the availability of water in the root zone. Below a critical value of soil water storage, the ratio of evaporation rate to the available energy tends to decrease sharply and linearly with decreasing soil water content. At the lowest value of soil water content, this ratio declines by up to a factor of 4 from the non-soil-water-limiting plateau. Knowledge about functional rooting depth of different plant species remains rather limited. Ignorance of this important variable makes it generally difficult to obtain accurate estimates of seasonal evaporation from terrestrial ecosystems. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Aerodynamic conductance; Canopy conductance; Evaporation; Humidity response; Soil water","aerodynamic conductance; canopy conductance; coniferous forest; evaporation; grassland; soil water content",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027794128

The shape of an object is described by a combination of object primitives: ellipsoids, elliptical cylinders, tapered elliptical cylinders, rectangular solids, and their halves, quarters, and eighths, based on set union, intersection, and difference. The primitives are then assigned density and energy-dependent photoelectric and Compton cross sections. This approach is validated in two steps. Firstly, only non-uniform attenuation is included. The transaxial images of a simulated thorax phantom are reconstructed using a modified Chang's technique for nonuniform attenuation. Secondly, detected Compton scattering is added to the model. Scatter fraction of a point source in a water cylinder is used to validate our scatter model for uniform scattering media. The difference between simulated and experimental results is on the order of 10%. For the model of nonuniform attenuation and detected Compton scattering, a thorax phantom is used for validation. Normalized profiles across the center of the sphere projections for simulation and experiment are observed to have insignificant difference.

Livers from male Wistar rats were first flushed with Ringer's and Euro-Collins solutions. After ischemic storage in Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37°C for 60 min and in Euro-Collins solution at 4°C for another 60 min, they were then persufflated with either gaseous O2 or N2 for 30 min at 37°C, and rinsed again with Ringer's solution. Enzyme concentrations and calcium ion activities were measured in the effluent rinsing solution after passage through the liver. Treatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD) or allopurinol resulted in a significant reduction of tissue injury, determined by the enzyme loss, calcium uptake, and lipid peroxidation upon persufflation with O2. Allopurinol also improved the tissue levels of ATP and the sum of adenine nucleotides after aerobic persufflation, whereas SOD did not. Notwithstanding, neither treatment had any effect on anoxic persufflation with N2. Thus, we conclude that the postischemic liver is susceptible to oxygen-induced free radical injury and that allopurinol and SOD promote specific antioxidative protection of the liver, with the exclusion of side effects related to substrates or perfusion modalities. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","allopurinol; free radicals; ischemia; oxygen; SOD","allopurinol; superoxide dismutase; animal tissue; article; energy metabolism; intravenous drug administration; ischemia; lipid peroxidation; liver; male; nonhuman; rat; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Triphosphate; Alanine Transaminase; Allopurinol; Animal; Calcium; Energy Metabolism; Free Radicals; Glutamate Dehydrogenase; In Vitro; Ischemia; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Superoxide Dismutase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027244070

The cooling process was initiated 30 min after incubation of freshly isolated hepatocytes at 37° in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 15 mM glucose to allow for metabolic equilibration. At the end of this period, hepatocyte suspensions were supplemented with 1.7% albumin, 13.3% dimethyl sulfoxide, and the synthetic buffers, 3-[-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) and N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N′-[2-ethanesulfon acid] (HEPES). Hepatocytes were cooled in a step-wise manner to -196° by holding the cells for 1 hr at -20° and then for 1 hr at -70° before transfer into liquid nitrogen. After thawing and removal of damaged cells by centrifugation in Percoll, the total recovery of viable hepatocytes subjected to freezing was about 42%. The contents of ATP, ADP, and AMP were not altered significantly in cells stored in liquid nitrogen. The metabolic competence of cryopreserved hepatocytes was further confirmed by their ability to synthesize urea from NH4Cl and ornithine at the same high rate that was observed in freshly isolated cells (693 ± 68 and 740 ± 68 nmol · mg dry wt-1·hr-1, respectively). Similarly, cryopreservation did not affect drug-metabolizing systems as indicated by the metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene and 7-ethoxycoumarin, two model substrates. In both freshly isolated and cryopreserved hepatocytes, 7-ethoxycoumarin was O-deethylated to 7-hydroxycoumarin at essentially the same rates (8.66 ± 0.75 and 8.25 ± 0.53 nmol · mg dry wt-1·hr-1, respectively) and 7-hydroxycoumarin accumulated in hepatocyte suspensions almost exclusively in the conjugated form. The storage of hepatocytes in liquid nitrogen also did not affect the complex metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene to total oxygenated metabolites and, more importantly, to metabolites conjugated with glutathione, glucuronic acid, and sulfuric acid. Thus, cryopreserved hepatocytes represent a valid and convenient model to study drug biotransformation in intact cells. © 1993.",,"7 ethoxycoumarin deethylase; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; benzo[a]pyrene; buffer; dimethyl sulfoxide; liquid nitrogen; radioisotope; urea; animal cell; article; cell viability; controlled study; cryopreservation; liver cell; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; thawing; xenobiotic metabolism; Adenine Nucleotides; Animal; Benzo(a)pyrene; Biotransformation; Buffers; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Coumarins; Cryopreservation; Energy Metabolism; Liver; Male; Nitrogen; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Xenobiotics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027227758

Lange and U. Brandt (1993) FEBS Lett. 320, 183-188], we showed that the bulk of the ATP-dependent IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store of the hamster insulinoma cell line, HIT-T15, resides in cell surface-derived vesicles most likely of microvillar origin. The origin and orientation of these vesicles suggested that Ca2+ storage is not due to a membrane-located Ca2+ pumping ATPase but rather to ATP-dependent Ca2+-binding within the vesicles. In this case, Ca2+, ATP and IP3 should have free access to the vesicle lumen. This hypothesis was tested. ATP-independent Ca2+ uptake occurred with biphasic kinetics. An initial rapid uptake, which was complete within 30 s, was followed by a slow linear uptake lasting about 10 min. The rapid component was shown by efflux experiments to have an equilibration half-time of about 4 s. This rapid Ca2+ efflux pathway was inhibited by externally applied La3+ (0.1 mM). A similar rapidly equilibrating La3+-sensitive Ca2+ pool was also present in vesicles which had been actively loaded with Ca2+ in the presence of ATP. The intravesicular distribution space of this labile Ca2+ pool was identical with that of the non-metabolizable hexose analogue 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, demonstrating that rapid Ca2+ uptake occurs into a true vesicular water space and is not due to binding. ATP and IP3 were also shown to enter the vesicles by an energy-independent pathway which is inhibited by the anion channel inhibitor, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS; 0.5 mM). Both ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and IP3-induced Ca2+ release from preloaded vesicles were inhibited by DIDS. These findings clearly demonstrate that (1) the vesicle membrane is permeable to ATP and IP3 via anion channels, and (2) Ca2+ uptake into as well as IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the vesicles occur by passive diffusion through a cation channel which is not regulated by IP3. Consequently, the mechanisms for Ca2+ storage and IP3-induced Ca2+ release must be located in the vesicle lumen. Moreover, the microvillar diffusion-barrier concept, originally proposed for the regulation of hexose transport may also be valid for the receptor-operated regulation of cation and anion influx pathways. Functional coupling of the microvillar Ca2+ stores with the associated cation influx pathway is also strongly supported by the previously demonstrated microvillar shape changes accompanying depletion of the Ca2+ stores by bombesin or thapsigargin in HIT cells [K. Lange and U. Brandt (1992) FEBS Lett. 320, 183-188]. © 1993.","Anion channel; ATP; Calcium ion store (HIT cells); Cation channel; Inositol trisphosphate; Microvilli","adenosine triphosphate; anion channel; cation channel; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; animal cell; article; calcium transport; cell culture; hamster; membrane vesicle; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Anions; Calcium; Cell Membrane; Hamsters; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Ion Channels; Kinetics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Animalia; Cricetinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027157768

The hydration reaction is incomplete, and tetracalcium phosphate is the only crystalline solid detected by X-ray diffraction analysis. The apparent activation energy of tetracalcium phosphate hydration is 36 kJ/mol. An activation energy of this magnitude is indicative of an interfacially controlled reaction. As with many hydration reactions, which are initially interfacially controlled, a layer of hydration product accumulates on the hydrating surfaces, and subsequent hydration becomes diffusionally controlled. Consistent with such a mechanistic path, seeding with calcium hydroxide reduces both the maximum rate of heat evolution and the total heat of reaction, while seeding with hydroxyapatite increases the total heat evolved. Complete hydration may be achieved when a tetracalcium phosphate slurry is continuously agitated for an extended period. After storage for one year large Ca(OH)2 crystals have precipitated and an equilibrium involving hydroxyapatite and Ca(OH)2 has been achieved. Carbonate readily enters the hydroxyapatite lattice and carbonated hydroxyapatite is formed in a CO2 atmosphere. Although its composition is uncertain, the carbonated hydroxyapatite formed has a Ca/PO4 ratio of 2, and it is the only phase observed at the complete reaction of tetracalcium phosphate under CO2. © 1993, Thomas Telford Ltd.

By observing the beam parameters, such as energy spread and transverse beam sizes systematically, it was proved that the Landau cavity is effective to improve the beam quality at a beam current less than ∼7 mA/bunch.

Although cleanup of defense-related waste at Hanford holds many positive benefits, negative features include high costs to the US taxpayer, numerous uncertainties concerning the technologies to be employed and the risks involved, and the high probability that special interest groups and activists at large will never be completely satisfied. Issues concerning future use of the site, whether to protect and preserve its natural features or open it to public exploitation, remain to be resolved. © 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Cleanup; Environmental monitoring; Nuclear waste; Restoration","environmental protection; environmental radioactivity; history; law; nuclear waste; radioactive waste disposal; review; risk assessment; united states; waste management; cleanup project; environmental planning; future prospect; nuclear site; waste disposal; USA, Washington State, Hanford",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027330550

The photosynthetic response of plants to low temperature is dependent upon time of exposure and the developmental history of the leaves. Exposure of fully expanded leaves of winter cereals to short-term, low temperature shifts inhibits whereas low temperature growth stimulates electron transport capacity and carbon assimilation. However, the photosynthetic response to low temperature is clearly species and cultivar dependent. Winter annuals and algae which actively grow and develop at low temperature and moderate irradiance acquire a resistance to irradiance 5- to 6-fold higher than their growth irradiance. Resistance to short-term photoinhibition (hours) in winter cereals is a reflection of the increased capacity to keep QA oxidized under high light conditions and low temperature. This is due to an increased capacity for photosynthesis. These characteristics reflect photosynthetic acclimation to low growth temperature and can be used to predict the freezing tolerance of cereals. It is proposed that the enhanced photosynthetic capacity reflects an increased flux of fixed carbon through to sucrose in source tissue as a consequence of the combined effects of increased storage of carbohydrate as fructans in the vacuole of leaf mesophyll cells and an enhanced export to the crown due to its increased sink activity. Long-term exposure (months) of cereals to low temperature photoinhibition indicates that this reduction of photochemical efficiency of PS II represents a stable, long-term down regulation of PS II to match the energy requirements for CO2 fixation. Thus, photoinhibition in vivo should be viewed as the capacity of plants to adjust photosynthetically to the prevailing environmental conditions rather than a process which necessarily results in damage or injury to plants. Not all cold tolerant, herbaceous annuals use the same mechanism to acquire resistance to photoinhibition. In contrast to annuals and algae, overwintering evergreens become dormant during the cold hardening period and generally remain susceptible to photoinhibition. It is concluded that the photosynthetic response to low temperatures and susceptibility to photoinhibition are consequences of the overwintering strategy of the plant species. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","annuals; evergreens; growth and development; photoinhibition; photosynthetic adjustment; regulation; resistance; temperature shifts",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001825301

A broad range of beam energy Tb, target atomic number Zt and thickness xt was employed. The loss (removal) cross sectionσL per target atom, extracted from the lifetime measurement, exhibits a minimum for small xt which is found to scale with ( Zt Tb)2. This behavior is expected because forward Coulomb scattering from target nuclei should be the dominant loss mechanism under the conditions of measurement. A marked increase in σL for larger xt is attributed to emittance growth arising from multiple scattering in competition with the transverse cooling rate. Lattice dispersion at the target increases the contribution to beam heating by electrons in the target atoms and introduces an additional loss mechanism. From the measured σL and beam lifetime, a time cycle may be selected which gives the optimum time-averaged luminosity for a given experiment. Scaling of σL allows prediction of the optimum luminosity over the full operating regime of the cooling ring. © 1993.",,"Cooling; Crystal lattices; Dispersion (waves); Electron beams; Energy dissipation; Gases; Mathematical models; Measurements; Optical properties; Scattering; Targets; Beam loss rates; Electron cooled storage ring; Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF); Internal gas target; Luminosity optimization; Proton beams; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027608602

Standard second-order central differences are used to approximate the Reynolds and energy equations to reduce the error in the mass flow/continuity. The new approach is in very good agreement with exact solutions and predicts closer values than Cheng's to the traction measurement. Results show that the maximum mean temperature rise, the minimum film thickness, the coefficient of friction, and the pressure spike are significantly influenced by the slide/roll ratio.

The model relies on breaking up the semiconductor drift space into small cells, each of which contains a transmission line element so as to allow an electromagnetic wave to propagate away from the generated plasma. The transmission line element also serves as the energy storage element. A time varying resistor controls the conductivity, induced by either a light signal or an avalanche. As expected, the model points out the importance of triggering an avalanche/displacement current wave in regions where the static field is high. Under certain conditions the model predicts a growing electromagnetic wave with sufficient amplitude to sustain avalanching.

We discuss recent progress in work with both materials. Recent work in GaAs has revealed that a non-""lock on"" state of sustained conductivity could be produced in GaAs photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSS's). The sustained conductivity is produced when a PCSS is switched into a high impedance (500 Ω) load by a high intensity (90 mJ-12 ns) laser pulse. Furthermore, we have shown that the conductivity of the GaAs switch could be quenched at a time determined by circuit parameters. Thus, the switch could be used as an opening switch in an inductive energy storage pulsed power system without the need for pulse shaping or a different wavelength laser to open the switch. We have demonstrated such an inductive energy storage system with a power gain of 4.2 and a switch opening time of <10 ns. We have also undertaken experiments with polycrystalline ZnSe which indicate that it may operated well as a closing switch material. The ZnSe switches were found to exhibit a nonlinear effect at high applied electric fields. In this paper we report on our investigations of ZnSe opening switch using a simple lumped inductive circuit. At high fields and short wavelength, we observed in ZnSe a behavior similar to ""lock-on"" as observed in GaAs. No such behavior was observed for longer wavelengths even at higher bias fields. This suggests the strong local field caused by the nonlinear effect observed in previous experiments is responsible for the onset of the observed ""lock-on"" behavior. © 1993 SPIE.

Despite inclusion of a generalized stability factor, the aerodynamic method underestimated the daytime (sunrise-sunset) sensible and latent heat fluxes by approximately 30% in comparison with the BREB method. The sum of the aerodynamic estimates of sensible and latent heat seldom balanced the energy avaiable from net radiation and change in storage. Wind speed was low during the experiment (averaging 1.6 m s-1), and so a second analysis was run for data from daytime, non-rainy, turbulent conditions (wind &gt; 1.5 m s-1). This showed that sensible and latent heat were still underestimated by approximately 30% in comparison with the BREB approach. This suggests that underestimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes by the aerodynamic method was not related to the wind speed conditions during the experiment. These results show that the stability-corrected aerodynamic model did not agree with the Bowen ratio method in this experiment. It appears unlikely that the discrepancies resulted from measurement errors. Perhaps the theoretical foundation of the similarity parameters (stability functions) in the aerodynamic model are not sufficiently generalized. The discrepancies found here confirm the necessity of calibration checks on the validity of aerodynamic estimates of the turbulent fluxes. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",,"aerodynamic method; Bowen ratio; energy balance; evapotranspiration; heat flux; wind speed; USA, Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027706838

This experience also indicates that much of the regulatory debate is focused on safety margins, that is, the smaller the safety margins the bigger the regulatory debate and the greater the amount of proof required to satisfy the regulator. Such experience suggests that caution and prudence guide the development of a regulatory regime for fusion reactors. Fusion has intrinsic safety and environmental advantages over fission, which should alleviate significantly, or even eliminate, the regulatory problems associated with fission. The absence of a criticality concern and the absence of fission products preclude a Chernobyl type accident from occurring in a fusion reactor. Although in a fusion reactor there are large inventories of radioactive products that can be mobilized, the total quantity is orders of magnitude smaller than in fission power reactors. The bulk of the radioactivity in a fusion reactor is either activation products in steel structures, or tritium fuel supplies safely stored in the form of a metal tritide in storage beds. The quantity of tritium that can be mobilized under accident conditions is much less than ten million curies. This compares very favorably with a fission product inventory greater than ten billion curies in a fission power reactor. Furthermore, in a fission reactor, all of the reactivity is contained in a steel vessel that is pressurized to about 150 atmospheres, whereas in a fusion reactor, the inventory of radioactive material is dispersed in different areas of the plant, such that it is improbable that a single event could give rise to the release of the entire inventory to the environment. These intrinsic features give fusion a significant safety and environmental advantage over fission. With such significant intrinsic safety advantages there is no a priori need to make fusion requirements/regulations more demanding and more stringent than fission. To do so could have the effect of making the licensing process more difficult, more costly, and less certain. The result could be a delay in the advent of a safer and more environmentally benign energy system. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","fusion safety; licensing; regulations; safety and environment","Accident prevention; Environmental impact; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Tritium; Fusion power; Licensing; Regulatory aspects; Fusion reactors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027615571

CRtBP are expressed in both fully differentiated and developing tissues in a manner that supports a relationship to the action of retinoic acid in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. The FABP are, by contrast, expressed only in fully differentiated tissues in a manner compatible with a major function in the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) for energy production or storage. The precise function(s) of FABP and CRtBP remain imperfectly understood, while subspecialization of function(s) within the two groups is suggested by the complex diversity in both of structurally distinct members that display striking tissue and temporal specificity of expression in addition to ligand specificity. Notwithstanding this considerable apparent functional diversity among the FABP and CRtBP, available evidence supports a dual set of generic functions for both protein groups in a) promoting cellular flux of poorly water-soluble ligands and their subsequent metabolic utilization or transformation, and b) sequestration of ligands in a manner that limits their association with alternative binding sites within the cell, of which members of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily (HNR) are a potentially important category. Theoretical as well as experimental models probing diffusional fluxes of LCFA in vitro and in living cells have provided support for a function for FABP in intracellular LCFA transport. Protein-bound ligand also appears to provide the substrate for metabolic transformation of retinoids bound to CRtBP, but convincing evidence is lacking for an analogous mechanism in the direct facilitation of fatty acid utilization by FABP. An emerging relationship between FABP and CRtBP function centers on their binding of, and induction by, ligands which activate or transform specific HNR-the retinoic acid receptors and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the case of CRtBP and FABP, respectively. Evidence consistent with both a 'promotive' role (provision of ligands for HNR) and a 'protective' role (limiting availability of free ligand for HNR association) has been advanced for CRtBP. Available data supports a 'protective' function for cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABP) and liver FABP (L-FABP) and points to the existence of ligand-defined, lipid-binding-protein-HNR relationships in which CRABP serve to attenuate the induction of gene expression by retinoic acid, and in which L-FABP may modulate a cellular adaptive multigene response to increased LCFA flux or compromised LCFA utilization. Furthermore, the emerging role of LCFA in the regulation of gene expression combined with the complex interplay between heterologous HNR-ligand associations and gene cross-regulation implies an important potential interaction between FABP, CRtBP, and their respective ligands in gene regulation. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","binding proteins; fatty acid; nuclear receptors; retinoic acid; retinoid; retinol","binding protein; cell nucleus receptor; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; retinoic acid; retinoid; retinol; article; cell differentiation; fatty acid metabolism; gene expression; gene expression regulation; ligand binding; multigene family; priority journal; protein metabolism; protein structure; Animal; Carrier Proteins; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation; Human; Receptors, Retinoic Acid; Retinoids; Retinol-Binding Proteins; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027304219

The oocyte expresses a receptor that binds both major yolk lipoprotein precursors, vitellogenin (VTG) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). In the present study, in vivo transport tracing methodology, isolation of coated vesicles, ligand- and immuno-blotting, and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry were used for the analysis of receptor-mediated yolk formation. The VTG/VLDL receptor was identified in coated profiles in the oocyte periphery, in isolated coated vesicles, and within vesicular compartments both outside and inside membrane-bounded yolk storage organelles (yolk spheres). VLDL particles colocalized with the receptor, as demonstrated by ultrastructural visualization of VLDL-gold following intravenous administration, as well as by immunocytochemical analysis with antibodies to VLDL. Lipoprotein particles were shown to reach the oocyte surface by passage across the basement membrane, which possibly plays an active and selective role in yolk precursor accessibility to the oocyte surface, and through gaps between the follicular granulosa cells. Following delivery of ligands from the plasma membrane into yolk spheres, proteolytic processing of VTG and VLDL by cathepsin D appears to correlate with segregation of receptors and ligands which enter disparate sub-compartments within the yolk spheres. In small, quiescent oocytes, the VTG/VLDL receptor was localized to the central portion of the cell.

A transient electric current was observed by the selective photoexcitation of S and was ascribed to the net electron transfer from D to A. The resulting charge separation state in the ASD device survived for a few minutes. Applying electric biases and/or lowering temperatures caused the charge-separated state to last much longer. The charge recombination process observed for the ASD structure could not be described by the usual first-order reaction kinetics. We have elucidated the charge recombination mechanism on the basis of the Marcus theory by taking account of some distribution effects of both the activation energies and distances between the dye layers. The results of the lowering of the temperature (290 ➛ 110 K) indicated a wide distribution of the activation energy (DE), suggesting a distribution of free energy change during the electron transfer. The free energy change distribution (Dg) was found to be nearly in accordance with the product of the Gaussian distribution of the energy levels for charge-separated states and the Fermi distribution of the electric charges. Insertion of insulator layers between A and S also brought a distance distribution between A and S, which was probably caused by some structural defects in the insulator layers.

A similarity exists, in this respect, with when a model is used and load reversal is applied on a single dislocation segment. With an experimental approach, through the study of the deformation flow curves when load reversal is applied or the hysteresis loop shape in cyclic deformations, this elastically stored energy can be quantitatively assessed. This, in turn, allows one to calculate, approximately, the two major components relating to elastic and frictional resistance towards dislocation movements during uniaxial and cyclic deformations. As the cyclic state is monitored, the change between the average elastic resistance to dislocation movements and the average frictional resistance to dislocation movements appears to be a very sensitive index in predicting changes in cyclic conditions. This method is then explored in relation to persistent slip band formations and fatigue performances generally. It is concluded that the frictional resistance to dislocation movements is more damaging in fatigue than the resistances offered by dislocation interactions resulting in elastic stresses. © 1993.",,"Deformation; Dislocations (crystals); Fatigue of materials; Hysteresis; Stresses; Bauschinger effect; Cottrell model; Elastic energy; Mechanical deformation; Polycrystalline materials; Crystalline materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027594970

During the static isothermal hydrogenation, an amorphous hydride phase is observed at about 200 °C without decomposition. From the variations in the charging conditions (temperature, time and pressure), it is found that amorphization is a thermally activated process and that some critical amounts of hydrogen atoms should be supplied to the matrix. Temperature-induced hydrogen absorption-desorption cycling results in a decrease in the reversible hydrogen content with increasing number of cycles. As a result of intrinsic degradation, amorphous or mixed ErH2+Fe phases are formed. The thermal energy released during the hydriding reaction and the repetitive strain induce a phase decomposition. However, in the case of a smaller heat effect, the crystal structure is transformed to an amorphous state by the cyclic strain accumulation. Therefore, from the observed results, it is suggested that the amorphous phase is an intermediate and metastable phase formed during phase decomposition and that the corresponding reaction mechanism is closely related to the motion of the iron atoms. Also, amorphous phase formation is one of the possible degradation mechanisms of the metal hydrides during cyclic operation. © 1993.",,"Amorphous materials; Crystal structure; Decomposition; Desorption; Erbium compounds; Gas absorption; Hydrides; Hydrogenation; Iron compounds; Phase transitions; Strain; Thermal effects; Amorphization; Cyclic strain accumulation; Erbium iron intermetallic compounds; Hydriding; Hydrogen storage materials; Reaction mechanism; Intermetallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027593479

A simulation programs has been applied to the calculation of ion trajectories during consecutive ion isolation; both a collision-free system and one in which collisons with helium atoms occurred were considered. The simulation program used here was similar to that used previously for the investigation of resonance excitation of stored ions and for concurrent ion isolation. The working points of three ion species (m/z 206, 207 and 208), located initially on the qz axis with qz ≈ 0.2, were moved off-axis first to the vicinity of the βz = 1 boundary at which ions of m/z 306 were ejected, then off-axis to the βz = 0 boundary at which ions of m/z 208 were ejected. Stable trajectories were maintained only for the ion species of m/z 207; other ion species were ejected axially. The simulation process extended over a real time of 2.84 ms.

The implications that this cross section has with regard to lithium ion beam heating and/or current drive in tokamaks are discussed. Since the expected cross section is quite small, non-standard techniques were employed to make this measurement. Singly ionized lithium ions, formed in a magnetically insulated racetrack diode, were passed through an energy selector and then directed along the axis of a theta pinch produced hydrogen plasma. The selector restricted the energy range of the lithium beam to the neighbourhood of 400 keV. The theta pinch coil was 71 cm long and had an inner diameter of 10.5 cm. It was energized by a 25 kj main capacitor bank operating at 150 kHz. After exiting the theta pinch plasma the ion charge states were analysed with a Thomson spectrometer. The cross section was determined by comparing the measured charge state distribution of exiting lithium ions to the results of a Monte Carlo code which used a theoretical expression for . It was determined that the theoretical value for the cross section needed to be scaled by a factor of 1.51 ± 0.75 to best fit the data. These experimental results were therefore in general agreement with theory. At a lithium impact energy of 406 ±23 keV the experimentally measured cross section, had a value of 2.64±1, 31 x 10-18 cm1. Scaling to beam energies that would be required for injection into the centre of a tokamak reactor results in values for the stripping cross section that predict lithium beams would be appropriate for heating and current drive. © 1993 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Beam energies; Best fit; Capacitor bank; Charge exchanges; Charge state distribution; Charge stripping; Cross section; Current drives; Energy ranges; Experimental measurements; Hydrogen plasmas; Impact energy; Inner diameters; Ion charge state; Lithium ions; Magnetic fusion; Monte Carlo codes; Neighbourhood; Pinch plasma; Theoretical expression; Theoretical values; Thomson spectrometers; Tokamak reactors; Capacitors; Charge transfer; Digital storage; Impact ionization; Lithium; Pinch effect; Tokamak devices; Lithium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867800017

The relative humidity was kept to less than 1% and the contact pressure was chosen to be very small to prevent the formation of wear debris at the interface. The tangential force and acoustic emission were recorded continuously during tests. The dielectric properties of samples were characterized before and after tribological tests using scanning electron microscopy. The effect of X-ray irradiation on the dielectric and friction properties was investigated. Sapphire samples annealed at 1500 °C did not charge, but after X-ray irradiation the charging capacity was highly increased, as was the friction coefficient (by a factor of 4). After the friction tests, the charging capacity of sapphire was observed both inside and outside the wear track. X-ray irradiation of the samples outside the wear track also modified the friction behaviour. Based on the results, others from the literature and on the increasingly understood correlation between the mechanical and electrical properties of dielectrics, an energetic explanation of the friction and wear behaviour of insulator materials is proposed. Friction and wear are shown to be related to the mechanisms of storage and dissipation of energy. Because of the dielectric properties of insulators, this energy results from electrostatic interactions: polarization of the material and displacements of electrical charges. Polarization is quickly achieved and increases during friction because of the build-up of a space charge in the material owing to the trapping of charge carriers. This trapping of defects already present in materials before testing or created during friction allows the storage in the lattice of very high amounts of energy (5 eV or more per charge) which, when dissipated, can lead to catastrophic failure. © 1993.",,"Dielectric properties; Failure analysis; Tribology; X ray analysis; Insulator tribological behavior; Single-crystal alumina friction; X-ray irradiation; Electric insulating materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027574923

This study evaluates the ability of a third-generation cardioverter-defibrillator to abort energy delivery and the importance of electrogram storage in analyzing the aborted events. Background. In the Cadence Tiered Therapy Defibrillator, when a tachycardia satisfies detection criteria for cardioversion or defibrillation therapy, high voltage capacitors begin charging. The Cadence defibrillator continues monitoring the rhythm during charging and if the rate decreases to below the rate triggering therapy, charging is terminated. This event is registered as an aborted shock. The defibrillator also has the ability to store intracardiac electrogram recordings of the electrical events that precipitate device therapy or aborted shocks. Methods. During a mean follow-up interval of 10 ± 7 months, 55 aborted events were registered by the Cadence defibrillator in 18 of the 49 patients who received it. Thirty-two stored ventricular etectrograms of events leading to aborted shocks were available for analysis in 15 patients. Results. Intracardiac electrogram recordings demonstrated the probable electrical events leading to these aborted shocks included nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 10), nonsustained rapid polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (n = 5), supraventricular tachycardia (n = 2) and electrical noise (n = 13). Eleven patients had a therapeutic intervention initiated as a consequence of the diagnostic information provided by analysis of intracardiac electrogram recordings. Four of the 15 patients had no changes made. During a follow-up period of 9 ± 5 months after therapy was altered, no patient had subsequent aborted shocks. Five patients have had seven appropriate shocks for sustained ventricular tachycardias. Conclusions. The ability of Cadence defibrillator to continue tachycardia sensing during capacitor charging and to abort shock therapy for self-terminating events prevented unnecessary shocks in 18 (37%) of the 49 patients. Intracardiac electrogram recordings were critical for instituting appropriate therapy that may have prevented unnecessary device charging and inappropriate discharges. © 1993.",,"antiarrhythmic agent; article; coronary artery disease; defibrillation; device; diagnostic value; electrocardiogram; follow up; heart arrhythmia; priority journal; Adult; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Defibrillators, Implantable; Electrocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Male; Middle Age; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tachycardia, Supraventricular; Tachycardia, Ventricular; Ventricular Fibrillation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027411763

Cod fed upon whole herring and enriched-herring paste showed the highest growth rates but tended to store increasing amounts of lipid in the liver. Cod fed upon the leanest diet, prawn, showed, however, better efficiencies of energy and nutrient conversion. The effect of decreasing food particle size, by mincing the herring, was to slightly impair growth and to substantially lower the efficiency of food conversion. The fatty acid compositions of the body lipids tended to reflect dietary input. The major lipid class in the muscle was the phospholipid whereas the main lipid storage depot consisted of triacylglycerols in the liver. There were some indications that either 20:5n-3 was chain elongated to 22:6n-3, or was selective utilized. Dietary 22:1 appeared to have been used as an energy source by the cod, a predator that naturally feeds on prey such as herring which are rich in these fatty acids. © 1993.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249003766

The intact joint was first loaded and then tested under two different loading conditions after a complete medial meniscectomy. The first set of test conditions attempted to simulate those used by previous investigators, by ignoring the spacer effect of the meniscus. The second set of tests were carried ouf following varus rotation of the joint (to account for the loss of the meniscal spacer) to assure initial contact in both tibiofemoral compartments at the start of test cycle. It is presumed that this varus realignment occurs during weight bearing following meniscectomy in vivo. As in previous studies, the joints experienced slightly larger displacements (although not statistically significant) and had lower stiffness values following medial meniscectomy than when intact. However, following varus realignment of the joint after meniscectomy, the displacement was markedly smaller (-35% to -40%;P<0.01) and the structural stiffness was much greater (47-123%;P<0.05) over the range of forces analyzed, compared with the intact joint. The ratio of dissipated to input energy was 42% for the intact joint, and increased following meniscectomy to 54% (P<0.05) with realignment and 55% (P<0.05) without realignment. Measured contact area decreased by 17% (P<0.05) following meniscectomy alone, and by 12% (P<0.05) following meniscectomy with realignment. Scince varus rotation of the joint following meniscectomy resulted in an increase in structural stiffness, it was concluded that the medial meniscus reduces the structural stiffness of the intact joint. In addition, the meniscus has a role in elastic energy storage and increasing contact area. A model is presented to explain both the decrease in stiffness after meniscectomy without varus rotation and the increase in stiffness after meniscectomy with varus rotation, employing linear springs of unequal length and different stiffnesses. After removal of the softer meniscal element and allowing joint approximation to occur, loading of the stiffer articular element results in an initially stiffer preparation. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Biomechanics; Knee; Meniscctomy; Meniscus; Varus","animal; article; biomechanics; dog; histology; in vitro study; knee; knee meniscus; physiology; reference value; theoretical model; weight bearing; Animals; Biomechanics; Dogs; Knee Joint; Menisci, Tibial; Models, Theoretical; Reference Values; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027899386

The step-up nine-switch matrix convertor consists of nonideal voltage and current sources, such as occur in practical inductance and capacitance filters. The energy storage elements of inductors and capacitors are not simplified into ideal current and voltage sources, as in most previous works, so that the dynamic behaviour of the convertor can be explored. Several static and dynamic features of the convertor, such as steady-state input/output voltage gain, input power factor and transient response, are predicted analytically and verified by computer simulations. The signal flow graph is adopted to solve the complex fourth-order equivalent convertor and thus the nine-switch matrix convertor is analysed fully in explicit form. It is found that the voltage gain and input displacement angle cannot be inde-pendently controllable, unlike the ideal nine-switch matrix convertor case; however they are controllable to a certain extent by a properly selected switch modulation function. The paper compares computer simulation results with those obtained by analytic technique. The authors expect to report on practical circuit work in due course. © 1993, The Institution of Electrical Engineers.

In some cases, when p increases, the coercive field has an initial increase followed, after a distinct maximum, by a decrease. This behavior is ascribed to the formation of chains of particles whose effect is opposite to the effect due to the formation of clusters. The chain formation increases the maximum anisotropy field because of the increase of the shape anisotropy.

Both the sigmoidicity in the Na++ activation of transport (positive cooperativity) and the upward deviations from linearity in the Eadie-Hofstee plots relative to glucose concentrations (negative cooperativity) can be rationalized within the concept of allosteric kinetic mechanisms corresponding to either of two models involving sequential or mixed concerted and sequential conformational changes. Such models also allow for 2 Na++: 1 S and 1 Na++: 1 S stoichiometries of cotransport at low and high substrate concentrations, respectively, and for partial inhibition by inhibitors or substrate analogues. Moreover, it is shown that the dimeric models may present physiological advantages over the seemingly admitted hypothesis of two different cotransporters in that tissue. We next address the reevaluation of Na++-d-glucose cotransport kinetics in rabbit intestinal brush border membrane vesicles using stable membrane preparations, a dynamic approach with the Fast Sampling Rapid Filtration Apparatus (FSRFA), and both nonlinear regression and statistical analyses. Under different conditions of temperatures, Na++ concentrations, and membrane potentials clamped using two different techniques, we demonstrate that our data can be fully accounted for by the presence of only one carrier in rabbit jejunal brush border membranes since transport kinetics relative to glucose concentrations satisfy simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Although supporting a monomeric structure of the cotransporter, such a conclusion would conflict with previous kinetic data and more recent studies implying a polymeric structure of the carrier protein. We thus consider a number of alternatives trying to reconcile the observation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics with allosteric mechanisms of cotransport associated with both positive and negative cooperativities for Na++ and glucose binding, respectively. Such models, implying energy storage and release steps through conformational changes associated with ligand binding to an allosteric protein, provide a rational hypothesis to understand the long-time debated question of energy transduction from the Na++ electrochemical gradient to the transporter. © 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","(dimer, tetramer); allosteric kinetics; brush border membrane vesicles; Na++-d-glucose cotransport; positive and negative cooperativities; rabbit jejunum","carrier protein; dimer; tetramer; allosterism; animal tissue; article; glucose transport; intestine absorption; jejunum; membrane vesicle; nonhuman; priority journal; protein structure; rabbit; sodium transport; transport kinetics; Allosteric Regulation; Animal; Biological Transport; Cell Membrane; Glucose; Intracellular Membranes; Jejunum; Kinetics; Male; Membrane Potentials; Microvilli; Models, Biological; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Rabbits; Regression Analysis; Sodium; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027401194

Colony foraging ranges and sites visited increased slightly during the dearth period, yet foraging continued to be concentrated within less than 10 km2. The degree to which fluctuations in foraging patterns were correlated with colony energy status varied with the availability of floral resources. During periods of relative forage abundance, increases in foraging range and number of sites visited were significantly correlated with increases in brood rearing and colony weight. In contrast, colonies examined during periods of resource dearth exhibited no correlations between foraging areas, foraging distances, and fluctuations in brood rearing, food storage, or colony weight.

Deusinglaan 2, 9713 AW Groningen, Netherlands","The effects of several metabolic inhibitors on the uptake of tri-n-butylmethylammonium (TBuMA) were studied in isolated rat liver mitochondria, isolated rat hepatocytes and isolated perfused rat livers, in order to characterize further the mechanisms for carrier-mediated uptake and cellular accumulation of organic cations in the liver. Treatment of isolated hepatocytes with valinomycin, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP), dinitrophenol, oligomycin or antimycin resulted in a rapid decrease in cellular ATP within 3 min of addition. The initial uptake rate of TBuMA was generally largely affected by these treatments. However, fructose at 10 mM had no effect at all on the uptake rate of the cation whereas cellular ATP was decreased to an extent comparable to that after treatment with the metabolic inhibitors. Consequently it was hypothesized that the metabolic inhibitors affected the initial cellular uptake rate of organic cations due to either altered intracellular sequestration (e.g. mitochondria) or alternatively to direct effects on the plasma membrane rather than by decreasing cellular ATP. Isolated rat mitochondria were shown to take up organic cations very efficiently. Accumulation in this organelle is probably driven by the negative membrane potential as measured by the uptake of the lipophilic cation [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium. Treatment of the isolated mitochondria with various metabolic inhibitors decreased the membrane potential in parallel to the effects on the uptake of TBuMA. Since mitochondria constitute a considerable intracellular volume, they may contribute largely to the storage of the organic cation in the hepatocyte. In isolated perfused livers, preloaded with either TBuMA or tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+), the addition of valinomycin or CCCP leads to a marked backflux of the cations from the liver into the perfusion medium. This suggests strongly that a large part of the intracellular storage capacity is lost after metabolic inhibitor treatment, probably as the consequence of dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Since the metabolic inhibitors in contrast to TBuMA uptake did not decrease the initial uptake rate of TPP+ into isolated hepatocytes, it was concluded that mitochondrial uptake (mitochondria are the major storage sites for TPP+) is not an essential determinant of the initial uptake rate in intact hepatocytes. It is concluded that: (i) carrier-mediated uptake of TBuMA in the rat hepatocyte is not directly dependent on cellular ATP; (ii) unlike uptake into the cells, uptake of this cation into rat mitochondria is electrogenic; (iii) since the metabolic inhibitors largely affect mitochondrial uptake of TPP+ without influencing its initial uptake rate in hepatocytes, these processes (including those for TBuMA) should be seen as unrelated phenomena; (iv) metabolic inhibitors as used in the present study and many other studies, apart from ATP depletion, may directly influence hepatocyte uptake of organic compounds, e.g. by aspecine interactions with the carriers involved in translocation across the plasma membrane. © 1993.",,"2,4 dinitrophenol; adenosine triphosphate; carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone; citrinin; fructose; oligomycin; radioisotope; tetraphenylphosphonium; tributylmethylammonium; valinomycin; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cation transport; cell membrane potential; controlled study; electron microscopy; energy metabolism; isolated liver; liver cell; liver mitochondrion; liver perfusion; male; metabolic inhibition; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Adenosine Triphosphate; Ammonium Compounds; Animal; Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone; Cations; Liver; Male; Mitochondria, Liver; Onium Compounds; Organophosphorus Compounds; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Valinomycin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027468854

The surface-discharge cathode was very useful for generating stable flash x rays. This flash x-ray generator consisted of the following essential components: a high-voltage power supply, an energy-storage condenser of 97 nF, a two-stage Marx type pulser, an oil diffusion pump, and a flash x-ray tube. This x-ray tube was of a diode which was connected to the turbo molecular pump and had plate-shaped anode and cathode electrodes. The cathode electrode was made of ferrite, and its edge was covered with a thin gold film by means of the spattering in order to decrease contact resistance. The space between the anode and cathode electrodes could be regulated from the outside of the x-ray tube. The two condensers in Marx circuit were charged from 50 to 70 kV by a power supply, and the condensers were connected in series after closing a gap switch. Thus the maximum output voltages from the pulser were about two times the charged voltages. In this experiment, the maximum tube voltage and the current were about 110 kV and 0.8 kA, respectively. The pulse widths were less than 140 ns, and the maximum x-ray intensity was 1.27 μC/kg at 0.5 m per pulse.

The capsules were fabricated from Inconel 617® (Inco Alloys International, Inc.) and contained eutectic fluoride mixtures of sodium, magnesium, lithium, and potassium. Samples that were thermal cycled for 20,000 and 30,000 hr were analyzed for corrosion effects. Radiography indicated neither flaws nor inhomogeneities, and there were no significant microstructural changes in the container alloy. The microstructural damage penetrating the inside surface was as deep as 120 m and that penetrating the outside surface was approximately 150 m. Microprobe results on the containers revealed a concentration gradient of alloying elements. The aluminum concentration was reduced from 1.34% in the original matrix to 0.4% at 10 m from the inside surface, and chromium was reduced from a nominal value of 23% to 10% at the outer surface. The depletion of aluminum and chromium from the outer surface was due to vacuum vaporization at elevated temperature. X-ray diffraction revealed the formation of possible protective films consisting of MgNaF3 and MgF2. The measured and theoretically predicted concentrations of aluminum and chromium were in good agreement.

Our procedure is of particular value when its representation requires an orthonormal basis set of large dimension. In order to obtain the excited state of H nearest in energy to any chosen trial energy Et, we consider the auxiliary operator A=(H-Et)2. We show that a reasonable number of relaxations on appropriately generated low-order Krylov subspaces for A is sufficient to produce better and better approximations of its ground state; a high-accuracy final refinement of the ground state of A is then possible through the standard Lanczos procedure. An important feature of our method is that storage memory limitations, encountered in the conventional determination of all eigenvalues of large systems, are here overcome.

We refer to the oxidation process in a generic sense, and the model can be used for the formation of oxides, nitrides and sulphides in general. The oxidation process is modeled for oxides which form n-type semiconductors with the defects in the form of interstitial cations and electrons (e.g., A12O3) in terms of mass and energy transport phenomena. It accounts for the release of metal cations and electrons at the metal-oxide interface, the transport of these species through the oxide layer due to concentration and electric field gradients, and the formation of the metal oxide at the outer interface. As a result a hollow oxide sphere develops as the metal is converted to oxide. If the energy released by the oxidation reaction exceeds the heat losses, self-heating will occur. Such a rise in temperature accelerates the release of cations and electrons from the metal into the oxide as well as the transport of cations. This can eventually lead to the total combustion of the particle. The model is solved numerically by the Galerkin Finite Element Method. The effects of several process variables are investigated for the aluminum-oxygen case study: initial passivating oxide layer thickness, average particle size, storage temperature and oxidant partial pressure, and heat losses. For certain limiting conditions, a simplified model is developed, and an approximate analytical treatment is presented. © 1993, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

At that time, numerous 'experts' foresaw oil and fossil fuels running out early in the twenty-first century. As a result, a number of key issues came to the fore under the broad heading 'energy conservation'. A major part of this initiative was the need for a rethink of the automotive vehicle - the electric vehicle was considered a solution. In the event, the oil crisis of the 1970s came and went and the pressing debate for energy conservation and new vehicles went back into a more considered perspective. What emerged in the early 1980s was a new way of looking at automobiles. Cars were to become generally smaller and more fuel efficient. To add to the development of the car of the 1980s came a further new issue - the environment itself. The car became known as the single largest contributant to pollution. Increasing numbers of vehicles came to be seen as literally choking to death the planet earth. The next step in the story of the evolution of the vehicle was to control exhaust-gas emissions. One city, Los Angeles, even went so far as to legislate that by 1998, 2% of all new vehicles in the State must be 'zero gas' emitting. More North American states were to follow, to a point that every major car manufacturer in the world took note and has now embarked on a programme to develop a 'zero-gas' emitting vehicle. Today, the concept of an electric vehicle is back in focus. Throughout the world, the media are highlighting the electric vehicle as the next generation of transportation. The cynics argue that they have heard it all before, others believe that this time it could actually happen. For the battery industry, the implications could be enormous, and would change the industry as it is known worldwide. This paper discusses the options and likelihood of an electric vehicle programme going into mass manufacturer, and its ramifications for the battery industry. © 1993.",,"Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Manufacture; Storage battery vehicles; Battery industry; Oil prices; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027132135

When system peak demands are at their highest levels on the hottest days of the year, the generating capacity of the combustion turbines are at their lowest values. This lost generating capacity can be recovered by cooling the air entering the combustion turbines.

The films studied were those commonly used as charge transport materials in organic photoconductors, and are comprised of a small organic molecule and a polymer binder. The PDS spectra indicate the formation of charge transfer complexes between the two components, in the solid state. The strength depends on the various combinations and can be correlated to relative energy level offsets between the HOMO of the small molecule and the LUMO of the polymer hinder. Reversible photochemistry resulting from UV exposure can also be detected at the surface. In addition, using PDS, it has been possible to obtain, for the first time, the vibrational overtone spectra in the range from the near IR to the visible (0.4 - 2 eV) for polymeric thin films.3 The absorption spectra of polycarbonate, for instance, exhibits C-II stretch modes for Δn &gt; I where ii is the vibrational quantum level. Previous measurements were constrained to either long fibers, which OSC the problem of scattering, or to a restricted wavelength region in the visible accessible by dye laser sources. The unparalleled sensitivity of PDS allows precise determination of frequency, lineshape and intensity of the various modes, even for films just a few microns thick over a very broad energy range. The overtone spectra can he used as a probe of various basic molecular properties such as bond energy, anharmonicity, and vibrational energy localization. In a manner similar to NMR spcctroscopy, it is possible to study specific atomic bonds. © 1993 SPIE.

Data of tube voltage and tube current from the flash x-ray source can be entered either through the data-storage units automatically or by manual input operation.

The gating pulse is usually applied to the cathode of the IIT while the voltages across the MCP and the anode remain constant. Due to the transparency of the cathode, which is in the range of 10, and the low emission energy of the MCP-material, which can be below 2 eV, a small portion of radiation is able to pass the cathode during its not gated state and releases electrons directly from the MCP-material. These electrons will be amplified by the MCP which may result in an aliased picture. Therefore the amount of radiation which can be applied to the IIT during its not gated state is limited. In order to increase the gating efficiency of the IIT combined gating of the cathode and the MCP is used. This allows to take pictures from predischarge phenomena with very low luminosity followed by the intensive radition of the high current arc. Similar problems exist during investigations of the recovery phase of high current switches. In addition gating of the MCP reduces all kind of noise caused by the MCP during the relatively long integration time of the video-camera usually connected to the IIT. A single frame high speed camera with gated photocathode, gated MCP and variable exposure times between 700 ps and 5 ns has been developed.

These are usually accompanied by a large number of small amplitude, high frequency loadings that may contribute little or no damage and often are merely a measure of system noise. Over sampling by factors of five to ten relative to the sampling theorem is often recommended to achieve the time domain resolution necessary for an accurate capture of peaks and valleys used in component fatigue evaluation. This over sampling limits the elapsed time capacity of digital recording devices used for field tests, slows data transfer rates, and expands database storage requirements. The authors propose the application of sampling rate interpolation to allow for the effective decimation of data while at the same time achieving high time domain resolution of the damaging events. To demonstrate the approach, a rosette time history will be analyzed at different sampling rates, showing how histogram statistics and ultimately fatigue life predictions are preserved.

While the federal initiatives require the use of substantial numbers of alternative fuel vehicles nationwide in both government and private fleets, there is still a great deal to learn about the development, maturation, and use of alternative fuels and vehicles-vehicle durability, reliability and performance, fuel composition and purity requirements, emission characteristics, fuel availability and storage, and a host of other technology and infrastructure issues. There is a need and an opportunity to identify and prioritize the short-term and long-term technology and human factors issues to be addressed. This paper summarizes the results of a methodology used at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) to identify the technology needs for successful, large-scale use of AFVs in the U. S. The alternative fuels considered include natural gas [compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG)], alcohols (methanol, ethanol), hydrogen, and battery-powered electric and hybrid electric vehicles. A quality function deployment approach was used to identify the AFV technology needs. This involved using a Juran matrix to characterize the alternative fuels and vehicles ""customer base"" (such as the commuters, service station owners, fuel suppliers, and fleet operators) and their requirements, and to translate these requirements into customer satisfaction. The customer requirements gave insight into the overall AFV needs, which were subsequently prioritized based on these requirements.

Both O2 and H2 are envisioned to be used in a variety of processes including crew life support, spacecraft propulsion, extravehicular activity, electrical power generation/storage as well as in scientific experiment and manufacturing processes. Life Systems, Inc., in conjunction with NASA, has been developing an alkaline-based Static Feed Electrolyzer (SFE). During the development of the water electrolysis technology over the past 23 years, an extensive engineering and scientific data base has been assembled. Major breakthroughs and improvements have been made on electrode performance, cell design, module construction, integrated ancillary mechanical components, packaging, maintainability and Control/Monitor Instrumentation hardware through years of design effort and thousands of hours of testing. As a result, SFE technology has been selected as the Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) for the Space Station Freedom. The ECLSS application utilizes O2 for the crew, the air lock repressurization and to replenish other external leakage. The ECLSS application also utilizes H2 for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). The energy storage application utilizes O 2 and H2 as reactants for a fuel cell. The propulsion application utilizes high pressure O2 and H2 as propellants. The EVA application utilizes ultrahigh pressure O2 to recharge the O2 bottle in the extravehicular mobility unit. The special applications have unique O2 and H2 requirements to support in-space science and/or manufacturing activities. The application of SFE technology as a space exploration utility is illustrated in Figure 1. It should be noted that although the primary focus of the flight experiment is the SFE electrochemical process, the information obtained from the flight experiment is applicable to a diverse range of electrochemical processes such as electrochemical CO2 separation, water vapor electrolysis and regenerative fuel cell processes. The Electrolysis Performance Improvement Concept Study (EPICS) flight experiment described herein is sponsored by NASA Headquarters as a part of the In-Space Technology Experiment Program (IN-STEP). The objective of the EPICS is to further contribute to the improvement of the SFE technology, specifically by demonstrating and validating the SFE electrochemical process in microgravity as well as investigating performance improvements projected possible in a microgravity environment. This paper defines the experiment objective and presents the results of the preliminary design of the EPICS. The experiment will include testing three subscale self-contained SFE units: one containing baseline components, and two units having variations in key component materials. Tests will be conducted at varying current and thermal conditions. The EPICS program, which currently is in Phase C/D, is being monitored by NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC).

Engineering considerations for ANG were compared with direct storage of methane as compressed natural gas (CNG). In an ANG storage vessel, about one-third of the methane is stored as free gas and two-thirds as ANG. At 20 MPa (3000 psig), ANG and CNG vessels store the same amount of methane per unit vessel; below 20 Mpa (3000 psig), ANG stores more. The heat released during filling of ANG tanks is low enough to be easily manageable. The super high surface area (3000m 2/g) of Amoco PX-21 provided high expectation for storing natural gas as an alternative fuel for future automobile use. However, the low bulk density (0.26 g/cc) of the powder activated carbon is at a disadvantage for the delivery of gas on the volume bases. A technique of producing high density (0.45 g/cc) monolith carbon was developed resulting in an adsorbency capacity of 124 v/v (Volume of delivered gas per unit volume of adsorbent).

The technique utilizes a mathematical model of the vehicle to determine energy usage, and combines this with a mathematical model of the battery pack to determine apparent depth of discharge (DOD). This technique has been applied using the characteristics of a pasted plate, flooded, lead-acid battery pack and the Federal Urban Driving Schedule (FUDS). The results are compared to test data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). As lead acid batteries have a cycle life which is strongly related to DOD, it is possible to then relate battery life to the distance driven between charging. This model was run on a wide variety of vehicle types, and the results were used to plot the relationship between cost/mile (both energy and battery replacement) to the number of miles driven between each charge (Depth of Discharge). The curve for any given vehicle has a minimum which falls at 30-40% of the possible driving range for that vehicle. The curves for some vehicles have a well defined minimum, while others have a flat broad shape, corresponding to an insensitivity to variations in the usage patterns. The lack of information regarding drive-train efficiencies in actual usage has lead to the development of an inexpensive data logger for measuring in situ performance, driving cycle requirements and battery pack demands. © Copyright 1993 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Charging (batteries); Costs; Digital storage; Operating costs; Vehicles; Battery replacements; California Air Resources Board; Cost of operations; Depth of discharges; Diffusion based; Lead-acid battery packs; Sacramento municipal utility districts; Vehicle design; Lead acid batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072441733

If such a system has a high storage density application in electrical and hybrid vehicles may be interesting. The SWEAT system, in which SWEAT stands for Salt Water Energy Accumulation and Transformation, has led to a new heat storage and cooling system for automotive applications. The system can best be discribed as a thermochemical heat storage system which stores low temperature heat for instance waste heat from car motors. At a later stage heat or cold can be produced by using the thermochemical heat pump function. The basic problems with comparable systems in the past were: Poor stability and side reactions of the materials used. Low power output per kg Low storage capacity Low efficiency Research conducted by a team of De Beijer RTB B.V. in cooperation with the Delft University of technology in the Netherlands and some industrial companies improved the system considerably. The possibility of using waste motor heat of motor vehicles for cooling and heating of the passengers' compartment is being investigated in cooperation with a German automotive supplying company.

The method operates on the one-dimensional differential conservation equations for a variable-area duct network with friction and heat transfer at the walls. The latter processes are represented by appropriate drag and heat transfer coefficient correlations, as also are the losses which occur at junctions and other geometrical irregularities. The equations are solved by a time-marching finite-volume method, on a computational mesh in which the velocities are located between the pressures which drive them. The main novelty of the approach is the use of an efficient non-iterative implicit solution algorithm which allows the size of the computational time step to be controlled solely by accuracy, rather than numerical stability, considerations, in the interests of economy The method is assessed by application to flow calculations in the intake manifold of a motored four-cylinder engine, for which time-varying velocity data and overall volumetric efficiency information is available, for a range of engine speeds. For this purpose the manifold calculations are coupled with overall conservation equations for the mass, momentum and energy exchanges with each cylinder.

Maxwell Laboratories, Inc., a manufacturer of high energy density film capacitors, is working with the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and Auburn University to develop energy storage, capacitor products based upon double layer technology which uses electrode materials consisting of carbon and metal fibers in a sintered matrix configuration. Maxwell's ultimate goal is to mass produce an energy storage capacitor which will improve performance of an electric vehicle (EV) to the level of current internal combustion engines (ICE). In California, the push for all electric automobiles is primarily driven by tough new air-quality regulations which mandate that two percent of a manufacturer's cars sold in California, in 1998, must have zero tailpipe emissions. An automotive capacitor, powered by and working with the batteries in an EV, is a pulsed power source for pulling away from a light, merging into traffic, passing and emergency maneuvers.

The package utilises the fast cumulant techniques for simulating the random outages of the generating units and the load. To ensure good accuracy, the expansion technique based on Laguerre Polynomials is used. One of the disadvantages of the traditional probabilistic simulation packages is that the chronology is lost when the hourly load is converted to a load duration curve. This produces unacceptable errors if the system contains energy limited units, such as pumped storage units or non-dispatchable technologies, such as solar, wind etc. A new technique in scheduling these units have been incorporated into FEPSS. The hourly thermal incremental cost is evaluated using an ingenious technique, which avoids hourly evaluation.

The exchange and transmission equipment, centralized or distributed, need less and less power. The power is essentially used under electronic voltage (80 % under 5 V and 3 V for new technologies and some 12 V). Only 20 % of the power is delivered under 54 V for the remote power supply of the subscriber line. This voltage is no longer useful for the GSM radio network and FTTC optical network. Until now, the standardized voltage interface 48 V or 60 V remains the reference for telecommunication equipment. This voltage is supplied by decentralized DC cabinets having 1 hour autonomy, installed near the system or even integrated in the system itself. These cabinets are powered by the high availability GEODE AC source under 3 phase AC 400 V voltage of the public mains. Associated computers for complementary services, are powered by UPS providing an autonomy of 10 to 15 min. The standardized interface with the equipment is in this case the single phase public AC mains 230 V voltage. So, in the same centers, two uninterrupted power sources, DC 48 V and AC 230 V, run together with two standardized voltage interfaces, DC and AC.

A second very interesting aspect is the application of these membranes as solid polymer electrolytes in modern energy conversion technologies. Water electrolysers and hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells using polymeric ionic conductors offer the possibility for the efficient utilization of solar energy and hydrogen technology. The principle of a system for the long time storage of energy with hydrogen technology is shown. Electricity, produced by solar systems, is used to split up water into hydrogen and oxygen. These gases can be stored and now offer the possibility of a long-time storage of the chemical energy. When needed the fuel cell combine hydrogen and oxygen to water again, producing directly electricity.

CHD is a secondary controlled hydrostatic transmission with integrated energy storage, mainly designed for use in vehicles together with a combustion engine. It provides good fuel economy and low exhaust gas emissions, especially at driving conditions with frequent speed variations and moderate average speed. These benefits depend on three factors: energy recovery in a pressure accumulator; high overall efficiency of the transmission; and optimal operation of engine.

The purpose of the study was to look for anisotropic seismic properties in recrystallized and thermomechanically altered salt using highresolution seismology and a tomographic type of experimental design. A pillar of potash ore (roughly 30% halite) at a depth of 1050 m was selected for the experiment on the basis of accessibility and rock integrity. A hammer was employed as the energy source (frequencies from 96 to 2000 Hz), while a 24-channel Bison GeoPro was used for data recording and storage. Each record was obtained by vertically stacking five records from five repeated hammer blows. Geophones were affixed to one face of the pillar in three orthogonal orientations. Records were acquired in three separate steps, each with identical geometry but different geophone orientations: first normal to the wall, then tangential to the wall and vertical, and finally tangential and horizontal. As salt crystals are anisotropic, we would expect subsurface salt units to be either anisotropic or isotropic, depending on the type of alteration and subsequent crystal alignment. Shear waves were effectively generated by the hammer source and have been employed in studying anisotropy. As a first result, we have found in-situ recrystallized and thermomechanically altered salt to exhibit shear-wave velocity anisotropy of-5% for propagation along the pillar face and ∼ 13% for propagation through the pillar. © 1993 SEG Annual Meeting.

The purpose of the present investigation was to study the myocardial metabolic adaptation to this stress. Methods: Eighteen male patients with ischaemic heart disease were studied by biopsies taken from the left ventricular septum during bypass surgery. Citrate synthase, total lactate dehydrogenase and its H and M subunits, coenzyme Q10, and myoglobin were determined in all biopsies. Concentrations of ATP, ADP, and AMP were determined and energy charge calculated in the biopsies from the patients with ischaemic heart disease. Biopsies from the septal region of hearts obtained from brain dead kidney and liver donors were used as reference and preoperative myocardial thallium scintigraphy was performed in the patients with ischaemic heart disease to relate the myocardial biochemical markers to thallium uptake at the biopsy site. Results: Myocardial activities of citrate synthase as well as contents of coenzyme Q10 and myoglobin in patients with ischaemic heart disease were not different from those of the reference group, and no linear relation was found between these three markers on the one hand and thallium uptake on the other. The energy charge was directly related and the M subunit of lactate dehydrogenase inversely related to the thallium uptake. Conclusion: The results suggest an absence of adaptation to ischaemia in terms of increased myocardial oxidative capacity and 02 transport and storage capacity. Furthermore, it is indicated that a stressed energy metabolism with increasing severity of ischaemic heart disease enhances anaerobic metabolism and induces a shift in myocardial lactate dehydrogenase subunit fractions.Cardiovascular Research 1993;27:1300-1305.","Adaptation; Citrate synthase; Coenzyme QIO; Energy charge; Ischaemia; Lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes; Myoglobin; Thallium-201 uptake","citrate synthase; lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme; thallium 201; ubidecarenone; adult; article; energy metabolism; heart muscle ischemia; heart scintiscanning; human; intravenous drug administration; major clinical study; male; oxygen transport; priority journal; Adolescent; Adult; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Comparative Study; Exercise; Female; Human; Isoenzymes; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Middle Age; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Myoglobin; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Thallium Radioisotopes; Ubiquinone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047680123

However, the available simulation methods cannot be applied to the analysis of heterogeneous or anisotropic subjects in nature. For this reason, these codes do not enable analysis of ATES in practical terms. Consequently, we have developed two simulation codes. One, called the “full-scale code”, can be applied to any case. The other, called the “rapid code”, enables rapid analysis of ATES while incorporating the consideration of heterogeneity in thermal dispersion due to the flow domain.

The reversion from the QC groups to the NBD moieties was carried out using the tetraphenylporphyrinate Cobalt(II) (Co-TPP) as a catalyst. The reversion proceeded very smoothly. The observed rate constant plotted against the catalyst concentration showed a straight line.

Platelets of 3 dogs were stored in whole blood in PVC bags containing CPDA‐1 stabilizer. The bags were kept at 4 °C for 50 days. Changes in the energy metabolism of the platelets during storage were determined by successive measurements of the following nucleotides: adenosine‐diphosphate (ADP), adenosine‐tri‐phosphate (ATP) and guanosine‐tri‐phosphate (GTP). In preparation for the measurement of their nucleotide content, the platelets were isolated from the blood at regular intervals and their membranes destroyed by deep freezing, thawing, double sonification in ice and protein precipitation with perchloric acid. The concentration of nucleotides within the platelets was determined by “High Pressure Liquid Chromatography” (HPLC). ADP, ATP and GTP were identified in the peak areas of the HPLC using 3 different techniques: comparison of retention time of standard nucleotide solutions as control samples, enzyme tests and thin layer chromatography. Adenosine‐mono‐phosphate (AMP), adenosine, hypoxanthine and inosine mono 5‘‐phosphate (IMP) were not found in dog platelets. Platelet ATP concentration decreased significantly during 50 days of storage (p < 0.001), and was reduced to 24% of the concentration measured after 1 hour of storage on day 50. ADP concentration also dropped significantly during 50 days of storage (p < 0.001). On day 50 the average ADP concentration was reduced to about 34% of the concentration measured after 1 hour of storage. The greatest reduction was observed in GTP concentration (p < 0.001): after 50 days the GTP concentration was only 5% of the concentration measured after 1 hour of storage. In freshly drawn blood samples, the average ATP/ADP‐ratio was 1.7 and the average ATP/GTP‐ratio was 5.5. In all 3 dogs the ATP/ADP‐ratios reached their lowest values between the 36th and 43rd day of storage, at which time the ratios were clearly below 1. After this time the ATP/ADP‐ratios increased and were bigger than 1 after 50 days (an average of 75% of the values measured after 1 hour of storage). During storage the GTP concentration decreased much faster than the ATP concentration. On day 50 the ATP/GTP‐ratio was 33.3.

It holds promise for truly sustainable development. Despite the many benefits of using solar energy, its frequent unavailability makes it inappropriate for many applications. Consequently it is often necessary for photovoltaic (PV) systems to have an energy storage capability such that the excess output of the PV cells can be used at a time when solar energy is unavailable. Of the many schemes that have been developed to do so (based on mechanical, chemical, thermal, or magnetic principles, to name a few), the one chosen as the focus of this paper is that of kinetic energy storage in a rotating flywheel. Although this paper describes an integrated energy conversion and storage system, the emphasis is on the flywheel energy storage system since there is already a large body of literature dealing with PV generators. © 1993 IEEE.",,"Energy storage; Environmental impact; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Magnetic storage; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Wheels; Conversion equipment; Energy conversion and storages; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel energy storage system; Photovoltaic power generation systems; Photovoltaic systems; Rotating flywheels; Storage capability; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994111739

Ethylenediamine‐tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the inner aqueous compartment was used as a sacrificial electron donor to the FMN triplet, and ferredoxin in the outer aqueous compartment served as the final electron acceptor (mediated via triplet electron transfer chain in this multicomponent system to be elucidated. By itself, EDTA does not function as an effective donor to membran‐bound oxidized chl (chl+.), which is formed by electron transfer from triplet chl to the viologen follwed by transbilayer electron migration. This is a consequence of electrostatic repulsive interactions with the negatively charged membrane. This limitation is avoided when FMN is used as a photomediator between EDTA and chl+.. The overall reaction is dramatically increased in rate by enclosing cytochrom c together with EDTA and FMN in the inner compartment. The rate constant of the key step in the reaction, i.e. elctron transfer from reduced cytochrome c, generated via photoreduction by the FMN/EDTA system, to chl+. is increased 20‐fold over that obtained with cytochrome c alone as the elctron donor. One of the important constraints that limited the net electron transfer across the bilayer to 50% of the added cytochrome, i.e. inhibition by oxidized cytochrome c formed in the inner compartment, is avoided by the inclusion of the second photoreaction in this system, thus allowing photoreduction of all of the added ferredoxin to be achieved. This system provides a model for a photochemical energy storage process that utilizes two photorections operating in series resulting in electron flow across a lipid bilayer membrane.

C. Ag. The fluorescent stain Nile Red revealed large lipid droplets in the posterior end of the cell, which comprised 20–41% of cellular carbon in newly released spores. Flow cytometric analyses of newly released spores stained with Nile Red revealed considerable variation in the neutral lipid content among spores that was independent of spore size. Lipid droplets were consumed during germination in spores maintained either under constant light or in continual darkness. The availability of light appeared to delay, but did not preclude, lipid use. The rate of lipid use during germination varied considerably among germlings with some cells consuming all of their lipid reserves within 5 h after release. In addition to zoospores, lipid droplets were observed in both male and female gametes. Numerous droplets were observed in eggs, while single lipid droplets were observed in sperm. Neutral lipid droplets were not observed in gametophytes or sporophytes except in developing gametes and spores. Large lipid reserves thus seem to be confined to the microscopic life history stages that presumably have relatively high energy demands. By serving as a supplemental fuel reserve, neutral lipids may be important in extending the effective range of zoospore dispersal. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Metals used for the resin‐bonded prostheses were gold, a cobalt‐chromium (Co‐Cr) alloy, and titanium. Silicoating increased the bond strength to sandblasted specimens. The original Silicoater technique produced the highest bond strengths, especially when used with the Co‐Cr alloy and titanium. The Silicoater MD technique showed the lowest bond strengths for all of the test metals. Storage for 7 days with protective film on the silicoated surface did not affect the bond strength, as compared with specimens bonded immediately. The retention of the resin to the gold specimens (Rocatec system) decreased after thermocycling, but retention to the Co‐Cr alloy and titanium was not affected. Various resin cements were tested and showed the same retention with the exception of Microfill Pontic, which gave a weaker bond. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis (EDAX) of the specimens before and after the measurements gave no clear explanation of the differences in bond strengths between the test metals. However, it was concluded that silicoating of the metal surfaces contributed to the retention of the resin by chemical action, as no differences in adaptation of the resin to the metal were seen between specimens pretreated by sandblasting and those which were also silicoated.

Previous morphological studies showed that the fins consist of a tightly packed array of musculature similar to that found in other muscular hydrostats. However, an electromyographical study of low amplitude, low frequency fin beating found that, unlike other muscular hydrostats, synergistic muscle contractions do not provide the support required for fin bending. Three computer simulations were performed. The first, a force analysis. considered the resistance to lateral compression provided by the crossed connective tissue fibres of an unbent fin. The second, an energy minimization analysis, considered the shape and deformation of the fin when subjected to lateral compressive forces confined to either the dorsal or ventral surface of the fin. The results from these first two simulations were combined in a third simulation that calculated the upper limit for connective tissue strain as a function of the angle subtended by the arc of the fin. This last simulation suggests that the connective tissue array provides the support required. It also predicts that the connective tissue strain is slightly non‐linear as a function of fin angle and that the connective tissue fibres on the concave side are considerably more strained than those on the convex side of a bent fin. Further, the original fibre angle of the connective tissue is such that the total amount of elastic energy stored in the array is parabolic as a function of fin angle, suggesting that the array may allow the fin to function as a harmonic oscillator. The ‘spring stiffness’ predicted by the model approximates the optimal value calculated for a harmonically oscillating fin at the frequency and wavelength observed. This suggests that elastic energy storage in the connective tissue fibre array may increase the efficiency of the fins during locomotion. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

A database consisting of 451 observations gathered using black bean samples at 38 different storage conditions and 155 experimental data points corresponding to white beans stored at 12 different conditions was utilized to validate the proposed equations. Compared to other published models, the ones developed in this study were not limited to mild storage conditions or short storage times. Hardening showed an initial lag period, followed by a period of fast hardening, and ending in a period of declining hardening rate as hardness plateaued to equilibrium values at adverse storage conditions. Hardening rates increased with either the water activity of beans or storage temperature, whereas equilibrium values were only determined by sample water activity, for black beans, or temperature, for white beans. Both models used the activation energy and equilibrium constant of the hardening reaction as parameters, which could be assumed to be independent of the sample storage conditions and still allow an adequate fit between experimental and predicted values.

Changesoccurring in both the physical state and the composition of the surface layer during chemical etching and electrochemical activation were studied by scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and cyclic voltammetry. Severalnew anodic maxima were observed in cyclic voltammograms after long-term cycling and were attributed to the oxidation of hydrogen atoms stored in low-energy fourfold coordinated interstitial sites, Zr4 and NiZr3. The kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the alloy under investigation was studied in terms of the cathodic polarization curves. The Tafel plots contain two different ranges: (i) a low-overpotential range, in which the slope of the linear η vs. log i is characteristic for charge transfer controlled processes; (ii) a high-overvoltage range, in which a combined mechanism, charge transfer and hydrogen diffusion into the bulk, is operative. To get information about the parameters influencing the hydrogen charging and discharging processes, chronopotentiometric experiments were performed. The changes of anodic overvoltage with time during constant current discharge were used to determine the electrochemical parameters io and p, as well as the diffusion coefficients (D) of the H atoms in the bulk of the alloy. Both io and D increased with hydrogen concentration, an observation which is consistent with a broad distribution of interstitial sites in the amorphous alloy. © 1993, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

As this paper describes, the potential applicability covers most of the well known fields of electrical power engineering, such as motors, power transmission cables and transformers, and novel devices such as superconducting energy storage systems and fault current limiters also become feasible. However, the complexity of superconductivity technology sets technical and economic limits to the use of this technology in all these areas. A major component is the superconductor itself, which has to meet stringent operating conditions. There is no doubt that the potential for superconductor applications in energy technology will greatly increase when, besides the already well developed classical superconductors with liquid helium cooling, high temperature superconductors for use at liquid nitrogen temperature become available with the necessary properties for these applications. As shown, for some applications, power transmission cables for example, only with cooling temperatures ≥77 K will the use of superconductors have the possibility of becoming economic. Another critical design area is high voltage components in cryogenic environments, where specific techniques are needed. In spite of advanced experimental results for several applications such as generators and energy storage systems, commercial implementation will take another decade at least. © 1993 The Institute of Materials.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974919597

Traditionally, basic principles of myocardial protection included hypothermia, potassium-induced diastolic cardiac arrest, buffering, membrane stabilization, and control of osmolarity and osmotic pressure. As the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion are further shown, methods of providing myocardial protection continue to expand. Current trends favor blood cardioplegia administration via a more complex approach to protect as much of the myocardium as possible; exogenous metabolic substrate enhancement in the presence of oxygen to allow aerobic metabolism to continue, with an end result of additional available myocardial energy; and warm (37°C) blood CS to optimize the metabolic rate for cellular repair. Thus, today the cardiothoracic surgeon can offer patients with energy-depleted hearts and those requiring more complex surgery improved myocardial protection with active myocardial resuscitation before and after the aortic cross-clamp is placed and removed. To this end, the pharmacist, ideally an operating room (OR) pharmacist, has a vital role in ensuring proper preparation, composition, storage, and quality control/assurance of CS. The basic principles of myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury and how they relate to myocardial protection, CS composition, and methods of administration are described. By understanding these principles, in addition to surgeon and institution-specific factors, the pharmacist can build the foundation needed to maximize the role of pharmacy in ensuring optimal myocardial protection during open-heart surgery. © 1993, SAGE Publications.

With the simultaneous application of external fields the hole-burning technique is a true two-dimensional spectroscopy method. Hole-burning can also be used for enhancing the schemes of presently used optical memories by many orders of magnitude.

The response of the material to hot deformation is simulated by adding recrystallization nuclei and stored energy continuously with time. The simulations use an energy storage rate schedule that models both work hardening and dynamic recovery of metals by way of a parabolic work hardening law. Recrystallization nuclei, having zero stored energy, were added at a rate which is related to the level of work hardening. Departing from a previously applied scheme, the nucleation rate is chosen to be proportional to the strain rate. Also considered is a more intuitive, local model in which the creation of a nucleus occurs with a probability proportional to exp(−δE), where δE is the energy change associated with the introduction of an embryo into the matrix. The evolution of the stress and the mean grain size is similar to those obtained with use of the constant nucleation rate. It was found, however, that the relations between steady-state parameters are different from the results obtained earlier but are more consistent with the experimental literature. Careful numerical analysis of data obtained for the exponential nucleation model yield new power-law relations between steady-state parameters and nucleation attempt rate. The kinetics of dynamic recrystallization are analysed with use of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation which is shown to be sensitive to the rate of deformation. Higher than expected values of the JMAK kinetic exponent were obtained that are attributed to the use of the parabolic work hardening model in the simulations. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953963551

The inherent advantages of the PULSAR technology greatly increase the power and energy density over conventional lead/acid design, allowing total volume (always a critical factor for Naval applications) to be reduced. These features also make the battery well suited for high power pulse mode operation as required by the EM launchers.

Energy management is accomplished by diverting the supply current into large dump resistors capable of dissipating the inductively stored energy through resistive heating. After the most of the energy has been resistively dissipated, a low residual current exists in the resistor circuit due to the applied battery voltage of the battery power supply. This current is interrupted with final interrupter switches in series with the dump resistors. Both the divert and final interrupt switches are explosive opening switches. Details of BUS (a 5 MA battery power supply charging of pair of inductors to 560 MJ) are presented in companion papers.

However, small sample volumes and, in some cases, very low enzyme activities make high demands on sample processing, storage, and performance of continuous measurements, if the enzyme activities are to be measured with acceptable reproducibility. In the presented study several aspects of homogenization, storage, and continuous measurement were scrutinized, to identify critical steps and consider ways of optimizing the method. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated from the blood of healthy subjects by sedimentation and density gradient centrifugation. After ultrasonic homogenization, 13 enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glycogen metabolism were determined photometrically. The variation of several conditions showed: 1. The duration of exposure to ultrasound for the homogenization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes has no influence over a wide range of time. 2. Addition of the detergents Triton X-100 and deoxycholic acid, as well as the SH-group protector dithio-threitol, to the homogenizing medium increased the measured activities of only a few enzymes. 3. Considerable inaccuracy was encountered-when the suspension was divided into parts for homogenization with different additives; such splitting of the suspension should therefore be performed only when necessary, as in the determination of reference values (e. g. protein or DNA content of the cell suspension). 4. Twenty four-fold determination of enzyme activities from one homogenate resulted in precisions between 4.5% (citrate synthase) and 14.4% (transketolase), which is satisfactory for the low activities (as low as 1 U/l) in the homogenate. 5. The reproducibility of enzyme activities, measured in homogenates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from different blood samples drawn simultaneously, was only slightly worse than that of the continuous measurement method itself. Thus, the precision of the measurement of enzyme activity seems to be the main determinant of the overall method.

These results were compared with standard heavy ion accelerator (Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)) measurements of the same SRAMs. With heavy ions, the LETth of the Honeywell HC6364 was 27 MeV-cm2/mg at 125°C compared with a value of 24 MeV-cm2/mg obtained with the laser. In the case of the second type of 64K SRAM, the IBM6401CRH, no upsets were observed at 125°C with the highest LET ions used at BNL. In contrast, the pulsed dye laser tests indicated a value of 90 MEV-cm2/mg at 25°C for the SEU-hardened IBM SRAM.

The modeled inductors include both surface mount "" chip"" inductors with nominal values ranging from 4.7nH to 330nH, and wire-wound "" leaded"" inductors with nominal values from 7.5nH to 470nH. The test fixture for the surface mount inductors consists of a CoilCraft 1-port coaxial fixture, whereas a modified SMA connector was used as a test fixture for the leaded inductors. In both cases, the measurements were taken using an HP8510B network analyzer, to allow for careful modeling of the fixture. The fixture models were used to de-embed the time-delay and energy storage effects of the fixtures from the coaxially calibrated HP8510 measurements of the fixtured inductors. Using EESof's Libra CAD package and de-embedded 1-port S-parameter data, models were developed for 33 samples of 21 inductance values of chip inductors, and 22 samples of leaded inductors. The models are seen to fit the measured data over a broad band, from low RF through resonance. Models for devices which self-resonate above 1 GHz maintain close tracking to measured data over the L-band (1-2 GHz). TRL calibrated 2-port microstrip measurements of the inductors were performed to verify the models obtained from the 1-port measured data. The 2-port measurement data is seen to track the 1-port measurements well, with some uncertainty caused by the effect of the microstrip mounting gap. Simple lumped/distributed filter circuits employing the inductors also were fabricated and tested. © 1993 IEEE.",,"Computer aided design; Digital storage; Fixtures (tooling); Parameter estimation; Scattering parameters; Surface mount technology; Uncertainty analysis; Inductance values; Inductor modeling; Inductor models; Measurement data; Measurements of; S-parameter data; S-Parameter measurements; Surface mount inductors; Electric inductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939041463

In some cases, a dedicated and properly sized power supply may be feasible to provide adequate electric gun system performance. However, in many cases the prime power source must be shared with the ship’s propulsion system due to limits in available ship space, allowable weight, and cost. In both of these instances, the dynamics of the propulsion power supply may have significant effect on the performance of the EM or ETC gun. This paper examines the dynamic simulation of an ETC gun system utilizing capacitor based energy storage and gas turbine prime power.

Because heating-ventilating-air conditioning (HVAC) systems are electrically powered, vehicle range is reduced when the HVAC system is operating. Consequently, it is necessary to devise new approaches which significantly reduce the HVAC energy requirements. Specifically, the summertime interior heat load must be reduced by limiting infrared (IR) energy transmission into the passenger compartment, and, heat pump coefficient of performance (COP) needs substantial improvement. Furthermore, wintertime heating and defrosting requirements may consume half the electrical energy stored in the battery if based on electrical heaters. The scope of this paper is limited to identifying and evaluating the alternative solutions to HVAC battery electric vehicles. These include: basis for determining HVAC boundary design assumptions and showing mathematical methods for estimating the HVAC load and energy requirements; evaluation of the new European and Japanese approaches to wintertime heating, such as: NaS battery, motor and component waste heat recovery, electric seat warmer, radiant foot warmer, electric windshield and backlight defrost, molten salt latent heat storage, metal hydride hydrogen storage and catalytic heater, and, liquid fueled heater. © 1993 IEEE",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880782421

The resulting flood, released near Red Rock Pass, Idaho, followed the present courses of Marsh Creek, the Portneuf River, and the Snake and Columbia Rivers before reaching the Pacific Ocean. For 1,100 km between Red Rock Pass and Lewiston, Idaho, the Bonneville Flood left a spectacular array of flood features that have allowed for geologic reconstruction and quantitative evaluation of many aspects of the flood hydrology, hydraulics, erosion, and sediment transport. Geologic evidence of maximum flood stages in conjunction with step-backwater flow modeling has furnished estimates of peak discharge and local hydraulic flow conditions for 10 separate reaches along the flood route. Peak discharge was approximately 1.0 million m3-sec-1 at the Lake Bonneville outlet near Red Rock Pass. Downstream, near Lewiston, Idaho, the maximum discharge attenuated to 0.57 to 0.62 million m3-sec-1. In part, attenuation of the peak discharge was probably the result of flow storage in the wide alluvial valleys of the western Snake River Plain. Diverse geologic and geomorphic environments along the flood route resulted in large spatial variations in the channel geometry as the flood moved downstream. Consequently, the local hydraulic conditions (flow depth, velocity, boundary shear stress) of the Bonneville Flood varied substantially within and between the study reaches. The rate of energy expenditure was also highly varied; local calculated stream power magnitudes ranged from less than 10 watts-m-2 in ponded reaches to more than 100,000 watts m-2 in major constrictions. More than 50% of the total energy loss at peak discharge was expended over a distance that encompassed less than 6% of the flood route. These spatial variations in local hydraulic conditions were profoundly important in controlling the distribution of flood processes and the resulting flood features. The deposition of tractively transported cobbles and boulders (measured clast diameters ranged from less than 10 cm to more than 10 m) were deposited in reaches of decreasing flow competence within quantitatively definable limits. The hydraulic conditions at areas of erosion were more difficult to precisely evaluate; however, erosion of basalt bedrock was primarily in reaches that had stream power magnitudes that exceeded 20,000 watts m-2. Cavitation was probably an important erosional process in areas of most intense flow conditions.",,"Energy dissipation; Erosion; Hydraulics; Lakes; Rivers; Sediment transport; Shear flow; Shear stress; Boundary shear stress; Channel geometry; Erosional process; Hydraulic conditions; Quantitative evaluation; Snake river plains; Spatial variations; Total energy loss; Floods; basalt; bedrock; depositional environment; flow modeling; fluvial geomorphology; hydraulic property; hydrological regime; peak discharge; Pleistocene; reconstruction; shear stress; watershed; Columbia [Missouri]; Great Salt Lake; Idaho; Lewiston [Idaho]; Marsh Creek; Missouri; Portneuf River; Snake River Plain; United States; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879640146

This configuration combines the flexibility of a pulse forming network (PFN) with the high average power of an alternator and the high energy density of a flywheel. The alternator can be designed to directly charge the capacitors without the inverter/transformer typical of battery charged capacitor systems. Optimization will require trade-offs between energy density, voltage and efficiency. System integration is facilitated by direct coupling of the flywheel/alternator to a turbine or motor and modularity of the components. This paper presents the conceptual design of a system to power an 18 shot, salvo fire 30-mm railgun. The performance of components was selected to be slightly beyond the state of the art but achievable in the near term. For instance, the baseline PFN utilizes a 935 kJ capacitor bank made up of Aerovox 1.3 J/g, 2.5 A/J, 80% efficient capacitor technology. It was sized assuming a 33% efficiency from capacitor to launch package. These capacitors would require some development and are based on the 1.5 J/g technology developed under the BTI/Army Pulse Power Module program. The 1.5 J/g technology is based upon high voltage (24 kV), low current capacitors. 1.3 J/g is estimated for lower voltage (8 kV) higher current devices. The alternator has a power density of about 12 kW/kg. This power density is beyond the state of the art (≈ 9 kW/kg) [1] but is considered reasonable because the system does not require continuous power providing opportunities between charging cycles for cooling. Compulsators have demonstrated peak powers of 100 kW/kg [2] and are being designed to produce 500 kW/kg [3]. The energy storage flywheel design is based on the minimization of overall system mass. It is mounted integrally with the alternator rotor and is enclosed in a containment vessel. Consideration of both the flywheel and containment yields a specific geometry that has minimum mass. © 1993 IEEE",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870427963

Larval development was indicated by weight loss of infested seeds and five larval instars were detected. Breaking through the emergence disk demands much energy, and was registered by a large weight loss of the beetle. Despite a strong host specificity, the chemistry of S. impressithorax resembled that of other bruchid beetles. During larval development zinc and copper were extracted strongly from food, and accumulated, whereas all other divalent metals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn) were mostly excreted. The development time from egg to emergence is reduced with increasing ambient temperature in the range from 20 to 30°C. At 4°C no development occurs, so that seed storage at this temperature is very favourable. Ovipositing beetles have an olfactory preference for seeds of E. abyssinica as host, but after a long delay accept seeds of other species in the absence of the host seed. Larval development terminated after the first instar in seeds of non-host species of the co-occurring miombo woodland trees Acacia erioloba and Brachystegia spiciformis and the pulses Cajanus cajan, Phaseolus vulgaris and Vigna unguiculata, thus S. impressithorax will not affect other stored seeds of forest trees. © 1993.","Erythrina abyssinica; host specificity; larval development; seed storage; Specularius impressithorax",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249007024

It was found that the cool-down time tc during the transient or start-up period is dominated by the time constant of the pulse tube wall τpt and that the dynamics of a basic pulse tube (BPT) refrigerator approaches that of a first-order system. For steady state operation, the cold-end temperature TL was found to vary with τpt, and the cooling load QL increases monotonically with increasing τpt. This indicates that heat pumped by the gas from the cold to the hot end increases with decreasing hpt (i.e. less energy exchange between the gas and wall). The process of heat storage or release of the pulse tube wall is thus shown to have a negative effect on the performance of a BPT refrigerator. It was thus found experimentally that the gas compression/expansion process inside the pulse tube, which is similar to a Brayton cycle but lies between isothermal and adiabatic, can explain the performance of BPT refrigerators. The present experiment also shows that the performance of a pulse tube refrigerator at transient and steady states is mainly dominated by the time constant of the pulse tube wall τpt. © 1993.","performance; pulse tube refrigerators; thermodynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249002550

During January the solar energy collection factor of the greenhouse with the solar sleeves increased by up to 90%.

The agreement between the experimental results and the calculations based on the heat transfer model was excellent.

In particular, Fourier coefficients analysis has been performed to determine, from the large and progressive line broadening, the structural evolution of Pd grains in terms of average size (D) and lattice distortions (G2). A comparison with pure palladium powder samples, milled under the same conditions has been used to analyse better the response of palladium under ball milling. MA induces, on pure palladium, effects which are similar to conventional cold working. A minimum average size is soon reached after 1 h of MA which depends on the crystallographic direction: &lt;D[111],) ≈ 22/23, &lt;D[100]&gt; ≈ 13/14(nm). From the unequal peak broadening along the [100] and [111] crystallographic directions, a lattice distortion parameter G2= &lt;£2(L))L ≈ 2x 10-4(nm) (L is a length in the physical space perpendicular to the diffracting planes and &lt;E2&gt; is the mean square microstrain) and a deformation and twin faults-probability of l 5α + β ≈ 0 01/0 015 have been estimated. Accounting for planar defects the average grain size is increased to about 35/40(nm) in both [111] and [100] directions. The microstructure evolution of the Pd80Si20sample can be interpreted as a two-step process. At the beginning, up to 1 h of MA, the behaviour is similar to pure palladium. Thereafter MA induces a further particle size refinement to about &lt;D&gt; ≈ 3/5(nm), before promoting solid state amorphization. The lattice distortion parameter approaches, after a steep increase, the values measured for pure palladium, so that the crystalline structure destabilization seems to be achieved, in this system, by grain boundary energy storage. © 1993 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3743048844

In this limit, the dominant forces in the momentum conservation equation are the elastic and surface tension forces; the viscous forces enter as a subdominant correction. Zero stress boundary conditions are applied at the free surface, while two different types of boundary conditions are considered at the other surface - for ""grafted"" gels zero displacement conditions are applied, while for ""adsorbed"" gels the displacement normal to the surface is zero but the surface is permitted to move in the lateral direction. There are multiple frequencies of oscillation, all of which are consistent with the boundary conditions, and it is found that the frequency and the decay rates of the oscillations are lower for the adsorbed gels. The static structure factor is calculated from the energy storage due to the elastic strain, surface deformation, and kinetic energy of motion. The structure factor has a peak at a nonzero value of the wave number for a grafted gel, while the maximum occurs at zero wave number for an adsorbed gel. An increase in the surface tension reduces the magnitude of the peak, and shifts it to lower values of the wave number. © 1993 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448999380

Visceral obesity is associated with multiple central endocrine aberrations. The hypothalamo‐adrenal axis is apparently sensitive to stimuli, sex steroid hormone secretion blunted, and hyperandrogenicity is found in women. In addition, there seem to be signs of central dysfunctions in the regulation of hemodynamic factors after stress, and growth hormone secretion appears to be particularly blunted. Several of these endocrine abnormalities are associated with insulin resistance, particularly glycogen synthesis in muscle. Fiber composition with low type I/type II ratio might be secondary to the prevailing hyperinsulinemia, but low capillary density in muscle may well be of importance. In combination with elevated turn‐over of free fatty acids (FFA) this will probably provide powerful mechanisms whereby insulin resistance is created. Portal FFA, from the highly lipolytic visceral depots may, in addition, affect hepatic metabolism to induce increased gluco‐neogenesis, production of very low density lipoproteins as well as to perhaps inhibit clearance of insulin. By these mechanisms a Metabolic Syndrome may arise in which visceral obesity is a central part. Visceral adipocytes seem to have a high density of several steroid hormone receptors, directing steroid hormone effects particularly to these depots. The net effect of cortisol is apparently a stimulation of lipid storage, with opposing effects of sex steroid hormones which also facilitate lipid mobilization, regulations most often found at the gene transcription level. Growth hormone inhibits cortisol effects on lipid accumulation, and amplifies the lipid mobilizing effects of steroid hormones. The combined perturbations of hormonal secretions will therefore probably direct triglycerides toward visceral depots. Circulatory and nervous regulatory mechanisms require, however, more attention. The multiple central endocrine and nervous aberrations of visceral obesity suggest neuroendocrine dys‐regulations, and have features characteristic of the hypothalamic arousal seen after certain types of stress, alcohol intake, and smoking. Such factors can be traced to subjects with visceral fat accumulation. Standardized stress, eliciting a “defeat reaction” in primates is followed by an apparently identical syndrome. This integrated picture of the multiple symptoms of visceral obesity is based on epidemiological, clinical, experimental, cellular, and molecular evidence. The ingredients of positive energy balance, including physical inactivity, stress, smoking, and alcohol consumption are frequent features of modern, urbanized society. Visceral obesity may therefore be an expression of a “Civilization Syndrome.” 1993 North American Association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO)",,"fat; hormone; adipose tissue; anthropometry; biological model; body composition; body constitution; body height; body mass; body weight; endocrine system; female; human; lifestyle; male; metabolism; nutritional status; obesity; pathology; practice guideline; review; risk; syndrome; Adipose Tissue; Anthropometry; Body Composition; Body Constitution; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Endocrine System; Fats; Female; Guidelines; Hormones; Humans; Life Style; Male; Models, Biological; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Risk; Syndrome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644822875

A mathematical frame-work based on the relationship between energy local minima (capacity of the neural net) and noise-free recall is established. The robust capacity conditions of this multi-layer associative memory are derived and it leads to forming the energy local minima at the exact training pairs. The proposed strategy not only maximizes the total number of stored images but also completely relaxes any code-dependent conditions of the learning pairs. © 1993 IEEE.",,"Associative processing; Associative storage; Learning algorithms; Memory architecture; Network layers; Adaptive learning algorithm; Artificial neural net; Associative memory; Associative neural network; Bi-directional associative memory; Continuity conditions; Layered neural network; One-shot associative memory; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30144444384

The concept used was that of a collapsing field accelerator. This concept was chosen because of its passive operation, and because it lent itself to existing power supplies. The trade-offs described, however, should be performed on any concept in order to achieve a successful design. The trade-offs described in the paper concern stress, maximum temperature rise in conductors, efficiency, time constants of energy storage element, and weight. An example of such a trade-off concerns the mass of coilgun armatures. The more massive an armature, the greater its ability to absorb resistive losses and the higher its time constant. However, larger armatures lower payload efficiency. Another trade-off concerns the fraction of armatures weight that is devoted to structure. More highly stressed armatures have more attractive electrical performance at the expense of parasitic weight. These and other trades are discussed.

The effects of varying the volume fraction of the polymer, the molecular weight of the added free polymer (PEO), the volume fraction of the latex, and the latex particle size have been systematically investigated. Above a critical volume fraction of polymer, φ+p, a rapid increase in the storage and loss moduli was observed for all the systems studied. This increase corresponds to flocculation of the latex particles by the free nonadsorbing polymer due to the depletion phenomenon. The values of φ+p obtained from these viscoelastic data corresponded closely to the values estimated from Bingham yield stress values reported previously. Increasing the molecular weight of the (nonadsorbing) polymer caused φ+p to decrease, in line with other studies for depletion flocculated systems. Over the range of volume fraction of latex particles studied, however, there was little dependence of the onset of flocculation on the latex volume fraction φs. It was noted that the smaller particles had considerably larger storage moduli following flocculation than the larger ones. This is essentially a surface area-to-volume effect. It was found that on increasing φp above φ+p the storage modulus reached a plateau value, whereas the Bingham yield stress values continuously increased. This is a consequence of the yield stress values being due largely to the energy of separation between the particles which is predicted theoretically to increase with φp, while the storage modulus is a measure of the number of bonds formed in the flocculated structure, which may not increase above a certain φp. Optical micrographs of the flocculated suspension revealed that over this polymer volume fraction range the floc structures were very similar, confirming the above hypothesis. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344684367

The specific energy required to do the processing work decreased with the increase of benzylated wood in the composite. The mixture can be molded or extruded easily. The study of the viscoelasticity of the compression‐molded composite products using a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMTA) revealed, regardless of the mixing ratios, a single damping peak (tan δ). This suggested good compatibility between the two polymers. The glass transition temperature and the storage modulus of these composites decreased as the amount of benzylated wood increased. A composite with comparable mechanical properties of polystyrene was obtained from those composites with mixing ratios (benzylated wood/polystyrene) ranging from 0.4 to 0.6. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

To exploit this strategy in a practical context, a way must be found to impede the back-reaction in which the electron is transferred from A to D (ref. 1). Previous attempts to achieve long-lived charge separation have involved the use of D-A combinations held in well defined geometries by spacer groups 2,3 or immobilized on supports such as porous media4-12. Immobilization of the redox species poses problems, however, for their subsequent separation in order to reclaim the stored energy. Here we report a system that achieves efficient D-A electron transfer, a slow back-reaction and easy separation of the products. We trap the photosensitizer donor, trisbipyridine ruthenium(II), in the supercages of zeolite Y, and use as the acceptor a neutral, zwitter-ionic viologen in the surrounding solution. Electron transfer from the ruthenium centre to the viologen is mediated by N,N′-tetramethylene-2,2′-bipyridinium ions loaded into the zeolite by ion exchange. Isolation of the donor within the zeolite from the acceptor in the solution outside makes the photochemically generated products easily accessible. Practical utilization of this trimolecular redox assembly will, however, require improvement of the quantum yield. © 1993 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Charge transfer devices; Energy storage; Organometallics; Photochemical reactions; Quantum theory; Redox reactions; Solutions; Zeolites; Donor-acceptor photoelectron transfer; Immobilized redox species; Molecular redox assemblies; Organometallic photosensitizer donors; Organoruthenium compounds; Photochemical light energy storage; Photoexcited electron donors; Sensitized zeolite/solution interfaces; Zeolite-entrapped photosensitizers; Zwitterionic viologen acceptors; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027908368

In addition the high external energy requirement is disadvantageous. For switching of high currents with high repetition rate therefore an alternative concept is also persued.

Since then, more than 227,000 m3 (60 Mgal) of waste have accumulated in 177 tanks. These caustic wastes consist of many different chemicals. The waste forms include liquids, slurries, salt cakes, and sludges. A number of safety issues have been raised about these wastes, and resolution of these issues is a top priority of the U.S. Department of Energy. A waste tank safety program has been established to resolve these high-priority safety issues. This paper will deal with three of these issues. The issues described are the release of flammable vapors from single- and double-shell tanks, and the existence of organic chemicals and/or ferrocyanide ion-containing fuel-rich mixtures of nitrate and nitrite salts in single-shell tanks. Extensive management controls are employed to ensure that the tanks in question continue to be maintained a safe manner through issue resolution. In addition, comprehensive monitoring, characterization, and applied and basic research efforts have been initiated to support resolution of issues and to prevent creation of future problems associated with potentially incompatible wastes. The safety efforts will also support actions related to the planned retrieval and disposal of the wastes in these storage tanks. Such efforts will also provide the basis for safe near-future remediation of these tanks on an as-needed basis and will define the envelope of safety to support the disposal of all high-level waste in the Hanford Site tanks. © 1993.",,"Environmental impact; Management; Radioactive waste disposal; Safe handling; Tanks (containers); Underground structures; Hanford Site radioactive waste storage tank; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Radioactive waste storage; caustic agent; ferrocyanide; organic compound; article; environmental monitoring; liquid; radioactive waste storage; safety; sludge; storage; tank; united states; vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027897719

After confirming the ability of the model to replicate the major features of each jump (i.e. muscle activation patterns, body-segmental motions, ground reaction forces, jump height, and total ground contact time), the time histories of the forces and shortening velocities of all the musculotendon actuators in the model were used to calculate the work done on the skeleton by tendons as well as the series-elastic elements, the parallel-elastic elements, and the contractile elements of muscle. We found that all the elastic tissues delivered nearly the same amount of energy to the skeleton during a CMJ and an SJ. The reason is twofold: first, nearly as much elastic strain energy was stored during the SJ as the CMJ; second, more stored elastic strain energy was lost as heat during the CMJ. There was also a difference in the way energy was stored during each jump. During the CMJ, strain energy stored in the elastic tissues came primarily from the gravitational potential energy of the skeleton as the more proximal extensor muscles were stretched during the downward phase of the jump. During the SJ, on the other hand, energy stored in the elastic tissues came primarily from the contractile elements as they did work to stretch the tendons and the series-elastic elements of the muscles. Increasing tendon compliance in the model led to an increase in elastic energy storage and utilization, but it also decreased the amount of energy delivered by the contractile elements to the skeleton. Jump height therefore remained almost the same for both jumps. These results suggest that elastic energy storage and utilization enhance jumping efficiency much more than overall jumping performance. © 1993.",,"Energy storage; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; Performance; Tendons; Countermovement jump; Direct dynamics; Elastic strain energy; Inverse dynamics; Squat jump; Strain; adult; article; controlled study; elastic tissue; elasticity; energy conservation; energy resource; extensor muscle; human; human experiment; jumping; male; muscle contraction; normal human; tendon; Adult; Ankle Joint; Biomechanics; Elastic Tissue; Electromyography; Energy Transfer; Hip Joint; Human; Knee Joint; Male; Models, Anatomic; Motor Skills; Muscle Contraction; Range of Motion, Articular; Sports; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Tendons; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027897653

These arise because of thermodynamic irreversibilities associated with the storage system itself and because of the need to degrade collected solar energy to the characteristic temperature of the reaction system chosen. General expressions for the exergetic and work recovery efficiencies of thermochemical storage systems have been developed by assuming that the reaction process is the only source irreversibility within the closed‐loop system. These have been used to plot contours of constant efficiency for the ammonia‐based thermochemical system. The effect of spontaneous separation of mixtures due to the preferential condensation of ammonia has been examined analytically and graphically.

MHD sources produce tens of megawatts of power and transmit tens of thousands of amperes, but can only be fired at infrequent intervals. An alternative method of attaining a high signal-to-noise ratio is to transmit multiple low-power pulses and stack the repeated signals for some period of time. Energy may be also be stored during the transmitter off-time and released in a narrow pulse, a technology known as energy storage or pulse-compression. Varying the pulse width has two opposing effects on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As the transmitter pulse width is increased the received signal increases, but the number of transients that can be stacked in a given period of time decreases. The optimum ratio of transmitter on-time to off-time is 1 for near-zone soundings (source-receiver separation less than the depth of investigation), increasing somewhat for large source-receiver separations. Analysis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) demonstrates that there are disadvantages in employing high-power sources such as MHD generators which can not deliver repetitive pulses. Low-power conventional transmitter technology, with signal stacking and adaptive noise cancellation at the receiver, can result in superior results at a much lower cost. In addition, energy storage or pulse-compression technology appears to offer relatively little advantage, and only a moderate gain in SNR is achieved. © 1993, Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences.

Gas guns, electrothermal guns and other railguns have been used to preaccelerate the projectile. Here, the new method using Plasma Initiation Separated from the Projectile (PISP method) is proposed, and its effectiveness is confirmed experimentally. A thin copper wire is placed near the edge of the railgun, which explodes and forms a plasma that has a fast flow velocity due to the Lorentz force. This fast flowing plasma collides with the projectile which obtains an initial velocity mainly by the momentum transfer. Since the current increases while only the plasma is accelerated, the driving force of the projectile just after the collision of the plasma with the projectile is large. In other words, the PISP method works as an inductive energy storage circuit with an opening switch. © 1993 IEEE",,"Acceleration; Copper; Energy storage; Plasma collision processes; Plasma flow; Plasmas; Projectiles; Wire; Lorentz flow; Momentum transfer; Plasma initiation separated from the projectile method; Rail guns",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027874124

Up to 3 m of incision has occurred. The change from a slow and relatively steady degradation in the lower reaches to separate degradation events in the higher reaches is attributed to the differential rate of headcut retreat and to the control exerted by mid‐channel bars upon the rate of river‐energy dissipation. Progressive outwashing of finer grains from bed material has followed the diminishing sediment yield of the basin and the increase in stream power. The ensuing growth in mean grain size and changes in sediment fabric have increased boundary resistance to flow and reduced particle susceptibility to entrainment. Downstream magnification of peak discharges has become increasingly pronounced with the advancing incision. The decrease in flood‐plain storage and self‐acceleration of flows passing the relatively deep and straight channel has caused flood waves to become progressively more flashy in nature. An increase in channel depth and reduction in gradient caused by downward and backward erosion, as well as bed material coarsening has promoted the re‐establishment of an equilibrium. Conversely, flow velocity increases due to flow concentration in the deepened channel. Reduction in grain mobility allows the river to attain a new equilibrium at flow‐velocity and stream‐power levels higher than before the channelization. Numerous disadvantages of the applied regulation scheme and its failure to reduce flood hazard raise the question of its maintenance. To be successful, any regulation design must take into account changes in sediment supply and flood hydrographs resulting from the simultaneous alterations in basin management.

Furthermore, several roughness indices and geostatistical procedures were tested for their ability to characterize microrelief. Runoff boxes filled with soil from the plough layer of a silty Luvisol were subjected to simulated rainfall. Two types of microrelief (rough and fine) were tested at two rainfall intensities (30 and 60 mm/h). A photogrammetric technique was used to develop digital elevation models (DEMs) of the soil surface before and after rainfall with a resolution in height of 0.2 mm and a grid spacing of 2 mm. The random roughness coefficient according to Currence & Lovely (1970) was found to be sensitive to surface microrelief variations. Semivariograms of the data indicated that big clods were the main elements determining microrelief and the ratio of total surface are to map area. The observed variations in runoff as a function of microrelief were best explained by rainfall energy per total surface area and by the relative contribution of the effective normal component of kinetic energy with respect to the impact angle of raindrops.

I conducted experiments evaluating interspecific competition, density‐dependent growth and lipid content and habitat‐specific growth and mortality rates of juvenile bluegills in this reservoir. Enclosure experiments showed that the growth rates of bluegills were unaffected by presence of other Lepomis species but decreased with increasing bluegill density. However, at densities corresponding to those found in the reservoir, the growth rates of bluegills were high, and competition appeared to be relatively unimportant. The percentage lipid content of bluegills was unaffected by the presence of other species, density of bluegills or habitat. The growth rates of bluegills in vegetated refuge areas were significantly higher and mortality rates were significantly lower compared with open water habitats. The low densities and high growth rates of juvenile bluegills in refuge environments suggests that there is a strong lethal effect of predators on this population of bluegills.

Differential scanning calorimetric (d.s.c.) measurements were performed on specimens of three glassy polymers: polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Materials were subjected to both a quenched and a well annealed heat treatment and subsequently deformed in compression to various levels of strain. Stress-strain curves and companion d.s.c. scans were compared. The well known enthalpy overshoot at Tg was observed for the annealed samples, showing that ageing is accompanied by enthalpy relaxation. The annealed material was also found to require a higher stress to yield, and the additional work required to strain-soften the annealed polymer to the flow stress level of its quenched companion was found to correlate well with the area of the enthalpy overshoot of the annealed specimen. Inelastic deformation was found to increase the specific enthalpy of both annealed and quenched specimens. In the annealed material, the enthalpy overshoot at Tg was found to decrease with inelastic strain and was completely erased by about -20% strain. Simultaneously, a pre-Tg exotherm was observed to develop with inelastic strain over a wide range of temperature. The pre-Tg exotherm was found to evolve until essentially reaching a steady-state profile at approximately -25% strain. This evolution coincided with the strain-softening phenomenon observed in the corresponding stress-strain results. A pre-Tg exotherm was also found to evolve with straining of the quenched material. Furthermore, the steady-state exotherms of the quenched and annealed materials were found to be nearly identical, as were their corresponding flow stress values after strain softening. Finally, a second, post-Tg exotherm was found to develop with further straining beyond strains of -25%. This exotherm was found to increase with inelastic strain and coincided with the occurrence of strain hardening (due to chain orientation) in the materials. The presence of two distinct and separately evolving exotherms in the inelastically deformed polymers indicates the existence of two separate deformation resistances in glassy polymers, one related to the initial yield and strain-softening behaviour, and the other to the orientation-induced strain hardening of the material. The observation that the pre-Tg exotherm is spread over a wide temperature range reflects the distributed nature of the structural state and may be quantified using a distribution in activation energy for the local rearrangements. The results therefore provide valuable information about the processes that must be accounted for in the development of accurate constitutive models of mechanical behaviour. © 1993.","ageing; glassy polymer; inelastic deformation","Aging of materials; Annealing; Calorimetry; Deformation; Glass transition; Hardening; Polycarbonates; Polymethyl methacrylates; Polystyrenes; Quenching; Relaxation processes; Stress analysis; Chain orientation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Enthalpy overshoot; Flow stress; Inelastic deformation; Strain hardening; Strain softening; Polymeric glass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027848390

In addition, location of the valve and all protected systems must also be given careful consideration in completion design since this type of well is prohibitively expensive to kill if workover is required. A direct-control subsurface safety valve has now been developed to meet these stringent requirements. The valve, which can be installed in the tailpipe below the packer, can be expended into the cavern, if necessary, and has the capability to provide efficient operation with minimal pressure loss at anticipated high flow rates. This paper will discuss the history and field testing of the earlier prototypes of this valve and how the unique design criteria of the new design address the problems of valve mechanism damage that are generally attributed to high-flow-rate closures. An actual case history from a storage facility in Germany will demonstrate the advantages that the newly-designed valve can provide. At present, two valves have been installed, with one being used to conduct long-term evaluations. All closures have been as predicted with no subsequent leakage or damage to the valve or lock. The new valve design has demonstrated excellent reliability in a demanding, high-flow-rate environment and maintains structural integrity during high-energy valve closures. Elimination of a hydraulic control system also allows unrestricted setting depths. Design analyses, surface testing, field testing, and wireline applications all indicate that a poppet-closure mechanism can be combined with 'up-to-set' and 'down-to-set' lock mandrels to successfully to address the problems previously associated with high-flow-rate closures in applications of this type.",,"Accident prevention; Codes (standards); Gas fuel storage; Industrial economics; Natural gas wells; Oil well testing; Packers; Pressure control; Reliability; Direct control gas storage safety valves; Environmental restraint; Flow rates; Gas cavern storage system; Hydraulic control system; Minimal pressure loss; Poppet closure mechanism; Safety valves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027848206

Lipid may constitute >50% of dry weight at the end of summer. Reproduction is synchronized with season and environmental conditions to enable offspring to exploit the brief period of intense primary production. Fertilization occurs only once in the copepods studied, which make up >98% of the total zooplankton by numbers, and males are short lived, but in one species (Calanus hyperboreus) females may survive into a second productive season, thereby sorting sufficient reserves to spawn a second time. Several planktonic species, including larval invertebrates, start growth early by utilizing algae that develop on the under-ice surface several months before the pelagic phytoplankton bloom. Minimum water temperature (-1.8°C) is constant and much warmer than the atmosphere, so overwintering should be less stressful for aquatic species than for terrestrial forms. Additional adaptations used by zooplankton in winter include seeking deeper water to escape predation, reducing swimming costs by regulating buoyancy, and further lowering metabolic rates by limiting synthesis of enzymes and increasing the fraction of lipid used in respiration. -from Authors",,"copepod; dark-season; lipid; overwintering; strategies; survival; zooplankton; Arctic; Canada; Northwest Territories; algae; Calanus hyperboreus; Calanus hyperboreus; Copepoda; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027843845

Similar planimetric shapes have been used to infer uniform fan deposition; however, Cedar Creek alluvial fan is composed of four fan deposits of Quaternary age, Qf1 (oldest) to Qf4 (youngest), indicating that fan deposition was nonuniform in both time and space. Field studies indicate that deposition of Cedar Creek alluvial fan is related to glaciofluvial outwash activity during the Pleistocene and upper-fan entrenchment and lower-fan deposition during the Holocene. Qf1 and Qf2 deposits are sub-horizontally bedded, clast-supported sandy gravels uniformly imbricated upfan. Comparison of soil profiles developed in these deposits to radiogenically-dated chronosequences within the region indicates that Qf1 and Qf2 are correlative with Bull Lake and Pinedale-age deposits, respectively. These relationships are substantiated by physical correlation of Qf1 and Qf2 with Bull Lake and Pinedale moraines, respectively, in the Cedar Creek drainage basin. The sedimentology and timing of Qf1 and Qf2 indicate deposition in high-energy, proglacial, braided streams. Furthermore, the present morphology of Cedar Creek alluvial fan was established largely during aggradation of Qf1 and Qf2 when sediment supply to the fan was sufficient to activate 60% to greater than 90% of the total fan area. During Bull Lake glaciation, the apex of Qf1 deposition formed the apex of Cedar Creek alluvial fan as Qf1 covered more than 90% of the present fan area. During Pinedale glaciation, Qf2 deposition shifted downfan; Qf2 is inset into Qf1 above the intersection point, but below the intersection point it eroded and/or buried Qf1 as it activated as much as 60% of the fan area. Qf3 and Qf4, comprising 21% of the fan area, are inset into Qf2 in the lower fan area. Soil development in Qf3 and Qf4 deposits indicate episodic deposition and entrenchment beginning in early Holocene and continuing to present. A post-glacial decrease in sediment supply to Cedar Creek alluvial fan is indicated by sediment storage within the Cedar Creek drainage basin. Decreased sediment supply to the fan resulted in upper-fan entrenchment of Qf2 and deposition of Qf3 and Qf4 in the lower-fan area. © 1993.",,"alluvial fan; Bull Lake; glaciofluvial outwash; Pinedale glaciation; Quaternary evolution; USA, Montana, Madison River Valley, Cedar Creek",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027837227

There was an inverse relationship between nutrient concentrations of perennial parts and diameter at breast height. The relative contributions of standing state of nutrients in different tree components of mature plantations were in the order; bole - branch - below-ground part - twig and leaf - catkin. Sequential arrangement of nutrient storage in tree components was: N - K. - Ca - P. Soil total N and available P increased with plantation age. Annual inputs of nutrients (kg ha-1) to the forest-floor via litterfall were: 183-235 N, 4* 9-7-0 P, 33-5-39-5 K, and 9*2-10-8 Ca. Total annual accretion of N through biological fixation ranged from 29 to 117 kg ha-1 in different plantations. Turnover rate and turnover time for different nutrients in the age series of plantations fluctuated between 0-10-0-55 year-1 and 1-8-9*3 years, respectively.

First, by introduction of reasonable assumptions in addition to the perfect piston flow, an idealized model is developed. Governing equations derived from the model appear to be characterized by the only parameter, Peclet number. Application of the Laplace transform technique to the equations results in a simple closed-from solution for the transient temperature distribution. The model is validated by examining a distinction from a simpler one which is heat conduction between two semi-infinite regions in contact with a moving interface. Temperature profiles for representative cases as well as the effect of the Peclet number on them are illustrated and discussed. Also, the storage efficiency is analytically expressed in terms of the Peclet number. The efficiency by the present model presents similar trends, but is smaller in value in comparison to that by the semi-infinite case. Consequently, the feasible range of the storage efficiency by the present model, which is the difference between the upper and lower limits of the efficiency, becomes more specific. For the convenience of the usage, a simple correlation of the efficiency is proposed as a function of the Peclet number. © 1993.",,"Correlation methods; Energy conservation; Heat conduction; Heat engines; Laplace transforms; Mathematical models; Mixing; Parameter estimation; Solar energy; Temperature distribution; Thermal stratification; Transients; Charging process; Hot water storage tank; Peclet number; Piston flow; Stratified thermal storage tank; Temperature profile; Transient temperature distribution; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027833878

The overlay accuracy for the EB direct writing layer to the mark detection layer was improved to under 0.075 μm(∣x∣+3<r), which is sufficient for the required alignment tolerance. The resist system was optimized for each EB direct writing layer considering a deposited energy distribution, which was calculated by the Monte Carlo method. To reduce data conversion time (central processing unit (CPU) time), a vector processing technique and a 1-dimensional calculation method applied to proximity effect correction were developed, and a drastic reduction to about 30-60 min was achieved.

In principle, a large variety of X-ray spectra can be obtained from a laser plasma source depending on the laser-target parameters. However, high conversion efficiencies, in a given spectral range, can only be achieved under specific plasma conditions (target atomic number, plasma temperature, plasma volume and spatio-temporal expansion.....). This leads to some restrictions in possible target materials and irradiation conditions (laser wavelength, laser intensity, pulse duration). In this paper, we will discuss this physical aspect basing our analysis on both the theoretical and experimental studies of the X-ray spectra in different X-ray energy ranges and for various target atomic numbers.

The plate deflection function is assumed in the form of a power series expansion in terms of the radial coordinate. The procedure accounts for the interactions between the tank wall and the plate foundation, and between the plate foundation and the soil medium. The principle of minimum potential energy is used to evaluate the unknown coefficients appearing in the assumed power series expansion and also the unknown interacting forces at the tank wall-plate foundation junction. Any number of terms can be considered in the assumed deflection function. Analytical expressions are obtained for the plate foundation deflections and radial moment, the contact stress distribution, the tank wall displacements, and the tank wall stress resultants.

This paper examines the time dependency of energy-matter flux in ecosystems modeled as flow-storage networks. The temporality of passage is governed by storage, which can be viewed as transport delay, a process contributing to the availability of energy to ecosystem compartments over time. Availability is a prior condition for utilization, which nevertheless is measurable from flow considerations alone. Combined flow-storage analyses are required to determine the temporality of substance availability; flow-only analyses are sufficient to specify utilization. The relations between the two are developed. What we term ""tempo"" involves the transport and delay as standing stocks of variously aged substance over the direct and indirect pathways of ecosystem networks. Our concept of ""mode"" refers to utilization alone, without regard for timing or the age distribution of flowing substance. Temporal analysis highlights the importance of turnover time, and thus body size and mass of individual organisms, in the dynamics of energy dependencies in ecosystems. © 1993.",,"energy transfer; network analysis; trophic dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027801555

Whole body energy content of complete fish (∼ 3472 J g−1 wet wt) was minimal in May for females as their overwintering phase ended, then increased to ∼ 4456 J g−1 prior to spawning. The ovarian index [(g.w./t.w.) × 100] and energy content of ovaries (J g−1) was highest in June and May respectively, and then declined markedly by August as spawning occurred. Throughout the year male whole body energy content of complete fish ranged from 3351 to 4590 J g−1 with the lowest values in May and highest values occurring during June to September, the feeding season. The testes index [(g.w./t.w.) × 100] and total energy content of testes (J g−1) were high in March and lowest during June and July. On a weight‐specific basis, males and females had similar whole body energy values throughout the year. Juveniles followed the same seasonal trends in energy storage as adults and had similar whole body energy values. Whole body energy content was linearly related to wet and dry weight condition factor with r2 values of 0.70 and 0.87, respectively. Dry body weight as percent of wet body weight was the best predictor of body energy (r2=0.91). Yellowfin sole had an annual energy cycle with energy accumulation and growth from May to September. Thereafter they utilized stored energy for metabolic and reproductive needs. Spawning began in late May or early June and fish were spent by August. Whole body energy content increased by 28, 33 and 35% between May and June, for females, juveniles, and males, respectively, the most dramatic change during the year long survey. This suggests that intense feeding in May must be an important aspect of their energy storage cycle. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

These best estimates are compared with estimates derived from using substitute data to determine the effect of using less accurate sensors, simpler methods, or remotely measured data. Calculations were made for approximately biweekly periods during five open water seasons. For most of the data substitutions that affected the Bowen ratio, new values of evaporation differed little from best estimates. The three data substitution methods that caused the largest deviations from the best evaporation estimates were (1) using changes in the daily average surface water temperature as an indicator of the lake heat storage term, (2) using shortwave radiation, air temperature, and atmospheric vapor pressure data from a site 110 km away, and (3) using an analog surface water temperature probe. Recalculations based on these data substitutions resulted in differences from the best estimates as much as 89%, 21%, and 10%, respectively. The data substitution method that provided evaporation values that most closely matched the best estimates was measurement of the lake heat storage term at one location in the lake, rather than at 16 locations. Evaporation values resulting from this substitution method usually were within 2% of the best estimates. This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

Removal of debris changed the primary flow path, thereby altering the size and location of bars and pools and causing local bank erosion and channel widening. Marked bed adjustments occurred almost immediately following experimental treatment in May 1987 and continued through to the end of the study period in 1991. Increased bed material mobility was attributable to destabilization of sediment storage sites by removal of debris buttresses, elimination of low-energy, backwater environments related to debris, and an inferred increase in boundary shear stress resulting from the removal of debris-related flow resistance. In contrast to these changes, which favored sediment mobilization, deposition was favored by the elimination of debris-related scouring turbulence and by increased flow resistance from a developing sequence of alternate bars. A more regularly spaced sequence of alternate bars replaced the pretreatment bar sequence, whose location, size, and shape had been strongly influenced by large woody debris as well as by bank projections and channel curvature. Following initial readjustment of the stream bed during the first posttreatment year, loss of scouring turbulence and increased flow resistance from alternate bars resulted in deposition of approximately 44 m3 of sediment within the 96 m study reach. The loss of 5.2 m3 to bank erosion left a net increase in sediment storage of 39 m3. Mean spacing of thalweg cross-overs and pools did not change measurably following debris removal, although variability of spacing between thalweg cross-overs tended to decrease with time as the location of bars stabilized. No consistent pattern of change in mean residual depth of pools or in distribution of depths occurred within the first 4 years following debris removal. © 1993.",,"bar; channel morphology; flow path; forest; gravel bed stream; woody debris removal; Forestry; Gravel; Morphology; Sediments; Shear stress; Gravel bed streams; Woody debris; Stream flow; Bars-River; Beds-Gravel; Forest/Debris Removal; Streams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027787647

British Coal has set up a programme to contribute to the international responses to the threat. It is concentrating on investigating options for removing carbon dioxide from fossil-fuelled power plants in case expensive fallback options become necessary. Screening of the options commenced with flowsheeting studies which estimated the thermal efficiency of a number of process schemes. These screening studies concluded that carbon dioxide (CO2) control could be retrofitted to existing coal-fired power stations, but that the new generation of gasification-based systems is more promising. CO2 separation could be more easily integrated into advanced power plants as they operate at high pressure, resulting in increased CO2 partial pressure which reduces the energy penalty associated with the separation. The CO2 would need to be exported as a liquid stream for storage in exhausted oil or gas fields. Costs of such power plants and CO2 disposal options have been developed. These studies suggest that, using proven technology, the cost of electricity would rise by about 42 per cent. If novel gas separation systems based on membranes can be developed, the increase in electricity cost could be limited to around 34 per cent.

Accordingly, disposal of radioactive waste can mean only its transfer from a place where it represents some hazard to somewhere else where it can be retained without undue risk. Radioactive waste arises in health care institutes as a result of diagnostic, therapeutical or research uses of unsealed radioactive substances. Sometimes, sealed sources withdrawn from further use might also be subject to disposal. Most radionuclides used in medicine are short-lived beta-, or beta-gamma emitters and represent a low risk, if properly handled, that is if due care is taken to prevent significant contamination of the workplace and personnel. Low-activity gaseous and liquid waste can usually be discharged to the environment directly; medium-activity or high-activity waste should be stored for variable periods to allow natural decay before specialized disposal. This paper presents a review of the different types of radioactive wastes produced in hospitals, and introduces many of the sources of generation and subsequent disposal options.

Diesel generator sets placed in areas where servicing and spare parts have been problematic generally have not provided the best answer.

The present paper details the operating experience of 224 such systems installed in Fiji over a period starting in 1983. Some reference is made to similar surveys of installations in Tonga and Tuvalu. The conclusion show that PV technology has not worked as well as it was first hoped. Some of the problems have been poor equipment, undersizing of the systems and a lack of maintenance. In particular the householders tended to use the lighting 'to the limit' with the result that the lead acid battery pack was often in a state of near continual discharge leading to the eventual failure of the battery. © 1993.",,"Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Solar cells; Household electrification; South Pacific Nations; Renewable energy resources; developing country; electricity generation; electrification; energy source; energy use; household energy; lighting; photovoltaic system; renewable energy; solar power; Fiji; Pacific, (South)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027787146

Moreover, advances in wind turbine technology in the next 20 years (such as advanced materials for airfoils and transmissions, better controls and operating strategies, and improved high-power-handling electronics) will substantially reduce capital costs as well as operation and maintenance costs. In areas with good wind resources (450 watts per square meter [m-2] wind power density at hub height), wind turbines now generate electricity at a cost of $0.053 per kilowatt-hour (kWh-1) (6 percent interest, all taxes neglected). With a mature wind turbine technology, the cost is expected to decline to less than $0.03 kWh-1rendering wind-generated electricity fully competitive with electricity from coal-fired generating stations. In addition, economically exploitable wind resources (wind power density &gt; 300 watts m-2at 50 meters) are extensive and widely distributed, and, in general, wind-generated electricity can be easily integrated into utility grids without provision for storage.

Detailed models of the individual components of a 1200 MWe reactor plant were developed, including the reactor blanket, boiler and turbine generator. Using a drum boiler as a thermal energy store, full output could be maintained for reactor off-periods up to only 40 seconds, compared with an expected off-period for a pulsed tokamak fusion reactor of up to 300 seconds. Two possible solutions to this mis-match problem are considered, the first involving an externally fired superheater and reheater, which would allow the off-period to be extended to 105 seconds, and a second involving an auxiliary boiler, which would allow an indefinite off-period. Under these conditions, the plant and operating costs are estimated to be higher than the estimated cost of incorporating non-inductive current drive into a tokamak, and therefore the study suggests that it would be advantageous to develop a continuously operating tokamak fusion reactor, although other possible solutions relevant to the pulse operation should be further investigated. © 1993, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

At rest, Ca2+ is not in equilibrium across the cell membrane, it enters the cell down a steep electrochemical gradient. The free [Ca2+] at rest is maintained at a value close to 200 nM by a combination of internal buffering systems, mainly the SR, mitochondria, and the fixed and diffusible Ca(2+)-binding proteins, as well as by an energy-dependent extrusion system operating across the external cell membrane. This system relies upon the inward movement of Na+ down its own electrochemical gradient to provide the energy for the extrusion of Ca2+ ions. As a result of electrical excitation, voltage-sensitive channels for Ca2+ are activated and permit Ca2+ to enter the cell more rapidly than at rest. It has been possible to determine both the amount of Ca2+ entering by this step, and what part this externally derived Ca2+ plays in the development of force as well as in the free Ca2+ change. The latter can be determined directly by Ca(2+)-sensitive indicators introduced into the cell sarcoplasm. A combination of techniques, allowing both the total and free Ca2+ changes to be assessed during electrical excitation, has provided valuable information as to how muscle cells buffer their Ca2+ in order to regulate the extent of the change in the free Ca2+ concentration. The data indicate that the entering Ca2+ can only make a small direct contribution to the force developed by the cell. The implication here is that the major source of Ca2+ for contraction must be derived from the internal Ca2+ storage sites within the SR system, a view reinforced by caged Ca2+ methods. The ability to measure the free Ca2+ concentration changes within a single cell during activation has also provided the opportunity to analyse, in detail, the likely relations between free Ca2+ and the process of force development in muscle. The fact that the free Ca2+ change precedes the development of force implies that there are delays in the mechanism, either at the site of Ca2+ attachment on the myofibril, or at some later stage in the process of force development that were not previously anticipated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"calcium; animal; metabolism; muscle; muscle contraction; physiology; review; Thoracica; Animals; Calcium; Muscle Contraction; Muscles; Thoracica; MLCS; MLOWN",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027752216

Ideal technologies would minimize health and environmental hazards, reduce amounts of wastes, and use energy in the most efficient way, while reducing attendant greenhouse gases. Beyond technology, public policy and research need to be directed to permitting requirements, storage, and deferred treatment of wastes (sequestering) and to encouraging source reduction and recycling. Best management practices will reduce resource consumption and maximize the use of wastes in beneficial ways. The focus on hazardous, municipal and petroleum production wastes is supported by examples from incineration, the use of limestone, and composting. Incineration is flagged as a technology that is in direct conflict with emerging global climate policy. Attention is drawn to the use of limestone as an underestimated source of greenhouse gases. Limestone is widely used in waste management systems and is closely tied to the material standard of living of people everywhere because of its extensive use in manufacturing and agriculture. Policy to convert the organic portion of municipal waste to compost has failed to take into account possible greenhouse consequences. A futuristic “manufacturing ecosystem”; in which clusters of enterprises both produce and feed upon one another's wastestream is suggested as an alternative. Finally, the causal connection between volumes of wastes and climate‐changing gases with production, consumption, and population size is noted. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Compost; Global climate change; Greenhouse effect; Incineration; Limestone; Manufacturing ecosystems; Public policy; Waste management","climatic change; greenhouse gas; policy approach; technological application; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027749998

During mechanical ventilation in the open-chest state, Rti and Edyn,L were estimated by fitting the appropriate signals to the equation of motion of the single-compartment linear model of the lung. Data were analyzed in relation to the structural damping hypothesis, which assumes that energy dissipation (Rti) and energy storage (Edyn,L) within the lung tissues are coupled at a fundamental level; the coupling parameter, termed hysteresivity (η), = Rti-ω/Edyn,L, where ω is angular frequency. Under baseline conditions, elevation in PEEP resulted in significant increases in both Rti and Edyn,L, with η remaining unchanged. During induced constriction and after lung lavage, Rti and Edyn,L significantly increased relative to their baseline values. During histamine- induced constriction, increasing PEEP was associated with increases in Edyn,L, whereas Rti and η were reduced. After lung lavage, elevation in PEEP from 5 to 7 cmH2O was associated with proportional increases in Rti and Edyn,L, resulting in a relative constancy of η. By contrast, when PEEP was decreased from 5 to 3 cm H2O, the values of Rti increased, whereas Edyn,L remained unchanged, resulting in significant increases in η. Collectively, these findings suggest that the effects of PEEP on Rti during agonist- induced constriction and after perturbations of the gas-liquid interface are dependent on the state of alveolar/airway stability.","airway resistance; histamine challenge; hysteresivity; lung constriction; lung tissue resistance; pulmonary elastance; surfactant","airway resistance; animal experiment; article; human; lung compliance; lung lavage; lung resistance; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; rabbit; statistical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027731251

As the coal thermally matures, stored hydrocarbons are expelled from the pores and vesicles. This phase change causes a significant volume increase, which may overcome the storage capacity of these coals, fracturing them and allowing primary migration of hydrocarbons.

The IDT structure is divided into cells, each modelled by a sequence of mismatched transmission lines consisting of a metallized and unmetallized region. The model includes: (1) the impedance difference between metallized and free regions, the reflection coefficient at the metallization upstep, the reflection coefficient at the downstep for a counterpropagating wave, all deduced from the Datta–Hunsinger perturbation formula; (2) the velocity difference between the free and metallized regions obtained using our SAW propagation calculation software for arbitrarily orientated multilayers; and (3) the energy storage susceptance at each finger discontinuity. Since only ordinary network elements are combined in accordance with the IDT geometry, this model permits good physical insight into the structure's characteristics and allows simple procedures for finding high directivity (socalled NSPUDT) orientations. Additionally, this unit-cell-based IDT model applies to any desired IDT geometry and material orientation. For regular and split-finger transducer structures as well as for two-transducer structures along NSPUDT directions, performance predictions obtained with the network model are in excellent agreement with measured data found in the literature.

An experimental set-up was designed for three different storage systems, namely a water storage system, an unstratified air storage system, and a stratified air-based system. The performance of the storage units, i.e. the heat accumulated by the storage material (soil in air storage systems, and water in water storage system) was calculated. A computer program was developed to determine the temperature distribution of the air-based storage systems. The numerical model uses finite difference techniques to solve the governing equations for both the storage material and the circulating fluid.

Explicit expressions for the overall number of entropy generation units that account for heat transfer and pressure drop irreversibilities are derived. Optimization of this figure of merit with respect to the freezing point of the phase-change material and with respect to the number of heat transfer units is analyzed.

Since the late 1970's many workers have striven to produce materials which hold the important electronic and optical properties of semi-conductors and metals. The ultimate aim of molecular electronics is believed to be the development of molecular scale devices. Molecules may perform active roles in processing, transmitting and storage of information. If the capabilities of biological membranes are represented as the ultimate goal information storage in the order of 106 Tbit cm2 1 can be expected. Dreaming aside molecular conducting systems are already with us and have uses as varied as reprographics and printing, wire and cable and energy storage systems. The printed circuit board industry too has taken its first steps towards embracing electrical conducting organic materials, in an attempt to solve the production cost and environmental difficulties which go hand in hand with conventional electroless copper chemistry.

Reduction in the average energy (shaping gain) is obtained at the price of increasing the constellation-expansion ratio (CERs) and the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR). In this paper, we describe some practical means to select the boundary so as to achieve a point with low addressing complexity near the knee of the corresponding tradeoff curves (shaping gain versus CERs or PAR). One class of addressing schemes is based on using a lookup table. We introduce a method to facilitate the realization of the addressing lookup table. This method is based on the decomposition of the addressing into a hierarchy of addressing steps, each of a low complexity. This avoids the exponential growth of the complexity. Based on this addressing decomposition, by using a memory of a practical size, we can move along a tradeoff curve which has negligible suboptimality. Another class of addressing schemes is based on using a Voronoi constellation in a space of half the original dimensionality. We also introduce hybrid multilevel addressing schemes which combine the two classes. These schemes provide single points with moderate addressing complexity near the knee of the optimum tradeoff curves. © 1993 IEEE","addressing decomposition; addressing lookup table; half integer grid; Shell addressing; shell index; shell-addressed Voronoi constellation; truncated cube","Computational complexity; Data reduction; Hierarchical systems; Indexing (of information); Signal processing; Storage allocation (computer); Table lookup; Addressing decomposition; Addressing lookup table; Constellation expansion ratio; Half integer grid; Multidimensional signal space; Peak to average power ratio; Shell addressed constellation; Shell index; Truncated cube; Voronoi constellation; Data processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027696296

Experimental inlet air temperature (at three different flow rates) was utilized as input data to test the model output results and their reliability. Excellent agreement was obtained for the outlet air temperature when compared with the experimental measurements, and differences did not exceed 0.5°C over the simulated period.

A brief overview of the Icelandic energy consumption and available resources is given. The cost of producing hydrogen by electrolysis is calculated for various alternatives such as plant size, load factors and electricity cost. Comparison is made between the total cost of liquid hydrogen delivered to Europe from Iceland and from Northern America, showing that liquid hydrogen delivered to Europe from Iceland would be 9% less expensive. This assumes conventional technology. New technologies are suggested in the paper and different scenarios for geothermally assisted hydrogen production and liquefaction are discussed. It is estimated that the use of geothermal steam would lead to 19% lower hydrogen gas production costs.

Glycosidase treatments (chondroitinase ABC and Streptomyces hyaluronidase) were used to alter the proteoglycan structure and content of the tissue. The dynamic viscoelastic shear properties of control and treated tissues were measured and statistically compared. Specifically, cylindrical bovine cartilage specimens were subjected to oscillatory shear deformation of small amplitude (γo = 0.001 radian) over a physiological range of frequencies (0.01–20 Hz) and at various compressive strains (5, 9, 12, and 16%). The dynamic complex shear modulus was calculated from the measurements. The experimental results show that the solid matrix of normal articular cartilage exhibits intrinsic viscoelastic properties in shear over the range of frequencies tested. These viscoelastic shear properties were found to be dependent on compressive strains. Our data also provide significant insights into the structure‐function relationships for articular cartilage. Significant correlations were found between the material properties (the magnitude of dynamic shear modulus, the phase shift angle, and the equilibrium compressive modulus), and the biochemical compositions of the cartilage (collagen, proteoglycan, and water contents). The shear modulus was greatly reduced when the proteoglycans were degraded by either chondroitinase ABC or Streptomyces hyaluronidase. The results suggest that the ability of collagen to resist tension elastically provides the stiffness of the cartilage matrix in shear and its elastic energy storage capability. Proteoglycans enmeshed in the collagen matrix inflate the collagen network and induce a tensile prestress in the collagen fibrils. This interaction of the collagen and proteoglycan within the cartilage matrix provides the complex mechanism that allows the tissue to resist shear deformation.

Carbon fiber/epoxy composites with fiber volume fractions of 12, 17, 38 and 61 vol% were subjected to flexural deformation on a Dupont DMA 983 instrument. The dependencies of dynamic mechanical properties of the composites on experimental parameters such as oscillation mode, amplitude, frequency, and temperature were investigate. As opposed to the storage modulus, the loss modulus is found to be sensitive to all parameters. In a fixed multiple frequency mode, the loss modulus of the composites increases with oscillation amplitude and decreases with frequency and the number of tests. The information produced in the resonant mode is more reproducible. An additional damping at the interfaces, apart from those of the constituents, suggests a poor interface adhesion in these composites. A linear relationship between the excess damping at the interfaces and the fiber volume fraction shows a similar interface quality for these composites having different fiber volume fractions. The detection of interfacial properities was found to be more sensitive in the flexural deformation mode than in the torsional mode. At temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature of the matrix, the effective volume fraction of the matrix is reduced. Such a reduction can be interpreted from the mismatch of thermal expansion of the matrix and the fibers.

It was proven that the modulation of the optical properties mainly tests upon a reorientation of the long molecular axis of the chromophores and of the mesogenic units. This change of the alignment of the side chains occurs after numerous trans-cis-isomerization cycles of the azo dye. Spectroscopic investigations show that by irradiating the samples completely new and well ordered textures appear. The characteristic features of the new textures depend on the structure of the liquid-crystalline polymer before irradiation and on the polarization state of the actinic light. We investigated cholesteric polysiloxanes which were either irradiated with linearly or with circularly polarized light (unpolarized light respectively). The characterization of the new textures was done with different spectroscopic methods. The photochemically induced changes of the texture are usable in applications like optical information storage, e.g. for the generation of holograms or for the production of displays. We further investigated samples with dipolar azo dyes which were reoriented with light under the influence of an electrical field. The cooperative effect of light and field results in a polar alignment of the azo dye which was proven by second harmonic generation (SHG). We compare material properties like longterm stability and efficiency of the SHG in samples which were prepared by this new procedure, by contact poling and by corona poling.",,"Azo dyes; Energy absorption; Harmonic generation; Optical data storage; Optical properties; Polysiloxanes; Radiation effects; Second harmonic generation; Silicones; Optical information storage; Cholesteric liquid crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027677506

Here, demands on the available resources (processing equipment, storage capacity and electricity) are placed simultaneously by a number of final products. Significant change-over costs and delays may be incurred whenever a mill is switched from one type of cement to another. Furthermore, the cost of electricity varies over a 24 hour cycle. The methodology presented formulates the planning problem as a mixed integer linear program, the solution of which is guaranteed to produce the optimal production plan.

This article (Part 1) is a general survey of the technologies which it is possible to apply within the so-called solar-hydrogen concept. This report illustrates several routes to convert solar energy to electricity and techniques to store electricity. The main objective is to estimate the costs for erection and operation of a solar-hydrogen power plant design in a near and long perspective, i.e. the years 1995 and 2010. The proposed plant is called the photovoltaic solar-hydrogen power plant (PVSHPP) and is hypothetically located in India for rural electrification. The PVSHPP is divided into two parts: the photovoltaic (PV) system, comprising photovoltaic generator, power conditioning, etc., and the storage system, comprising advanced electrolyser, pressurised gas storage, alkaline fuel cell, etc. The total investment and cost of electricity are estimated for both the PV system and the whole PVSHPP. A PV system with a capacity of around 3.5 MW peak power requires a total investment of about $ (US) 13 million for the year 1995 and $ (US) 5.2 million for the year 2010. This could be cost competitive around the beginning of next century at $ (US) 0.07 kWh-1 at an interest rate of 8% for the year 2010. The PVSHPP has a power capacity of 0.5 MW and will require a total investment of around $ (US) 19 million for the year 1995 and $ (US) 11 million for the year 2010.

These features are desirable for a component of large scale neural networks. Moreover, superconducting transmission lines have no power dissipation and signal depression and current rise times in them are faster than in conventional transmission lines.

This principle addresses the following important issues in high-speed operation; 1. (i) the reduction of memory cell size 2. (ii) a decrease in the total inductance of one control line on the memory cell array 3. (iii) the use of impedance-matched lines as signal lines. In addition, reducing the power consumption is also a significant issue because large scale integrated and high-speed circuits generally induce large power dissipation. To reduce the power dissipation, it is necessary to reduce the number of current injection gates or decrease operating currents. According to the guiding principle, we have designed 16-Kbit Josephson RAM's in the both cases that using decoders with ""AND"" gates and using decoders with ""NOR"" gates. The former is aimed at high-speed operation, and the latter gives the first priority to decreasing the power consumption.

In a 1-week survival study, 33 orthotopic liver transplants were performed using Wistar rats. In group A, untreated livers were stored with modified UW (mUW) solution at 4°C. In group B, livers from OP-pretreated donors (2 μg/kg, iv) were stored with mUW solution containing OP (1 μg/ml) at 4°C. After 24 h storage, the donor grafts in each group were transplanted to untreated recipients. OP treatment (group B) significantly improved 1-week survival (62.5%, 10/16, P &lt; 0.01 versus group A; 11.8%, 2/17). For the measurement of adenine nucleotides and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) in liver tissue before preservation, after preservation, and 3 h after transplantation, 20 rat livers in groups A and B were studied. In both groups, the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) declined 6 h after cold preservation, but this degradation of ATP was significantly halted at the level of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in the OP-treated livers after 24 h of storage. However, OP treatment showed no significant difference in the degree of ATP recovery after transplantation. On the other hand, OP treatment resulted in suppression of the increase in MDA levels and histological amelioration of microcirculatory disturbance 3 h after transplantation. Our data suggested that the combined use of the stable PGI2analog (OP-41483) and UW solution is beneficial in liver preservation.

Food consumption during the scotophase was negligible. Peak food consumption during the photoperiod occurred at the beginning of the photoperiod and in the late afternoon. 3. During the photoperiod, the crop and proventriculus/gizzard contained only small quantities of ingesta. However, at the beginning of the scoto-period, dried ingesta content of crop and proventriculus/gizzard increased by 10·5- and 2·76-fold respectively. This increase was followed by a gradual decrease towards the end of the scotoperiod. 4. Food transit time during the scotoperiod was significantly longer than that during the photoperiod. 5.

It was found that the charge loss due to ac stress is more severe than that due to dc stress. Experimental results reveal that the more positive the floating gate potential, the more severe is the drain ac disturbance observed. The main reason for the charge loss is the displacement current which agitates the charges in the floating gate, creating a leakage path from the floating gate to the drain, in which the drain-to-floating-gate overlapping capacitance Cfd plays an important role. The drain dc stresses of interpolyoxide/nitride/oxide (ONO) EPROMs were also measured under different bias conditions and temperatures. The data show that higher dc electric field of the floating gate to the drain results in larger Vth shift, which can be accelerated by elevated temperature. In addition, the control gate ac stress-enhanced drain dc disturbance was also measured. We proposed that the dc drain stress is applied during the ac gate stress, which results in a heating effect. The results support the concept of dielectric ac heating. © 1993 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","AC stress; Coupling ratio; Displacement current; EPROM; Heating; Program disturbance","Charge carriers; Electric currents; Electric field effects; Electron energy levels; Gates (transistor); Leakage currents; ROM; Stresses; Thermal effects; AC stress; Alternating current pulses; Charge loss; Coupling ratio; DC drain stress; Displacement current; Erasable programmable read only memories (EPROMs); Floating gate potential; Program disturbances; Semiconductor storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027667788

A tube plate reactor in which adsorption and desorption take place is proposed here to make the system compact, to enhance heat transfer, and to provide heat storage capacity. As a simple measure to evaluate heat and mass transfer in adsorbent beds, the concept of equivalent thermal conductivity was defined and identified through fundamental heat and mass transfer experiments and simulations. However, the equivalent thermal conductivity obtained is so small that fins must be adopted. In this paper, thermal design of the adsorption reactor is developed through simulations using the equivalent thermal conductivity of adsorbent beds, and as a result, the relationship between heat storage capacity, COP, and required area for the adsorption reactor is quantitatively evaluated. © 1993, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Tests were conducted on a cylindrical water filled storage container of L/D equal to 3:1 and capacity of (500 kg) using a low cost stimulator. The design of the simulator was based on a relatively inexpensive micro-computer linking into a mains power regulator with an 8-bit digital control system (0-255 useful states) which drives a resistor chain. The output from this network is a voltage which determines the power level of an electrical heater in an 11.5 litre water filled copper vessel. With any useful energy profile of interest the user is able to control, through the micro-computer, the logic level of the userport and decide on the time step interval for the test by acessing the internal clock of the micro-computer. Meteorological data were used to compute radiation income on any inclined plane, and the output to the power regulator is controlled by the computed instantaneous rate of energy gain from the collector system undergoing simulation. The stimulator could be used to stimulate any solar water heating system, apart from the storage container. It is particularly useful in estimating long term system performance. Therefore, the long term system performance for the storage container was determined and the long term system efficiency was found to be 52%. © 1993.",,"Computer aided design; Computer simulation; Cylinders (containers); Digital control systems; Energy storage; Microcomputers; Performance; Solar radiation; Solar water heaters; Systems analysis; Simulator design; Stratified solar storage container; System efficiency; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027659133

The production of H2 from electrolysis and Cl2 from photolysis of a 6M HCl solution containing IrCl63 -/IrCl62 - was investigated for this purpose. Using a 1 m2 solar concentrator, the photolysis of IrCl62 - was carried out, forming IrCl63 - and converting aqueous Cl- ions to gaseous Cl2. The amount of IrCl62 - destroyed under photolysis was established using light absorption at 425 nm; corresponding yields for formation of Cl2 were inferred by stoichiometry. Electrolysis of the solution was carried out at a constant current density. During electrolysis the H3O+ is reduced at the cathode to form H2, while IrCl63 - formed during photolysis is oxidized back to IrCl62 - at the anode. Electrolysis in the presence of the iridium complex proceeds at a lower voltage than the electrolysis of HCl solution itself.

BMW began to examine the use of liquid hydrogen as a fuel for motor vehicles as long as 10 years ago. In addition to investigating the storage technology inside the vehicle, work focussed particularly on engine development. The conflicting interests which that engine design provoked with regard to engine output, NOx emissions, backfiring into the intake pipe and the costs of a mixture preparation system caused BMW to start planning a special test rig for hydrogen engines in 1987. The test rig was designed to operate a stationary hydrogen-driven engine in an enclosed room at fuel temperatures of between -240° and + 100°C and pressures of up to a maximum of 200 bar. Since there was no precedent for such a test rig system anywhere else in the world, it was necessary to develop an independent safety concept based on existing technical principles. © 1993.",,"Accident prevention; Automobile engines; Automotive fuels; Exhaust gases; Fuel storage; Liquid fuels; Materials handling; Nitrogen oxides; Safety testing; Systems analysis; Engine test rig; Hydrogen engines; Liquid hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027656246

The retention time for CO2 increases rapidly with depth of disposal, from a few years in the mixed layer up to several centuries as the depth increases beyond 1000 m, suggesting that deep oceans should be considered as potential storage sites for CO2. However, CO2 collection and disposal consumes energy and produces extra CO2. We show that some of this extra this CO2 reaches the atmosphere, so that atmospheric concentrations from systems with marine disposal ultimately exceed those from systems without controls. In some circumstances they do so rapidly, making marine disposal less favorable than direct atmospheric release. Global Warming Potential can be used to compare systems.

OX11 ORA, USA","Global warming is said to be caused by the build up of active greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and carbon dioxide - released on the combustion of fossil fuels is thought to be the most important of these. Agricultural crops, grown specifically for use as a fuel source, might play an important role in reducing our consumption of fossil fuel sources through substitution. However, in order to fully qualify as a ""beneficial crop"" it must be clearly shown that production entails a net benefit in terms of energy output to energy input i.e.; it has a positive energy balance. This paper considers the difficulties in assessing both carbon and energy budgeting. It describes a recently developed computer model which attempts to define the energy and carbon inputs and outputs of the leading UK energy crop, that is of short rotation coppice (SRC). Preliminary results show that SRC, when displacing fossil fuel, has a very positive energy yield with the added benefit of carbon saving in terms of offset emissions. The computer model takes account of direct and indirect energy and carbon inputs to the crop, allowing the model user to determine the sensitivity of individual cropping operations including establishment, fencing, harvesting operations, rotation and cutting cycle variations, the impact of field size, transport distance from the farm to the point of utilisation, the energy cost of storage and drying. Each management decision influences the final energy or carbon ratio of the SRC crop. Such complexity makes a definitive statement on the energy/carbon ratio for crop production difficult, however if a standard management system is adopted (as described later) the energy ratio of growing SRC for fuel may be assigned. In the case examined here a ratio of 30 : 1 (energy units produced : used) is reported. However, this ratio is sensitive to variation in crop yield and management efficiency and so, although the ratio is positive, this should not encourage a wasteful attitude to crop management systems. In terms of carbon balances, the most important consideration is the substitution value of the material in relation to fossil fuels. In this paper, figures presented refer to wood substituted for coal use and pertain to a field area of 1 hectare (ha). If field size is increased up to 3ha, then the energy and carbon ratios improve by approximately 15 %. © 1993.",,"Air pollution control; Computer simulation; Costs; Crops; Cultivation; Energy conversion; Greenhouse effect; Renewable energy resources; Systems engineering; Carbon budget; Crop management systems; Energy budget; Energy crops; Global warming; Short rotation coppice (SRC); Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027656169

Whole blood reperfusion was performed using a «support animal’. Twelve dog hearts were arrested by a single dose of Bretschneider cardioplegic solution and stored cold (0.5°C) for 24h. Thereafter they were reperfused for 60 min without (n = 6) or with (n = 6) superoxide dismutase treatment. Myocardial tissue biopsies were taken for determination of high-energy phosphates before explantation, after the preservation period and during reperfusion. Early reperfusion in both groups resulted in an initial recovery of high-energy phosphates and was followed by a decrease during the subsequent reperfusion phase. The latter was associated with the appearance of left ventricular contracture, and cessation of heart beat. Electron microscopic examination of the myocardial tissues after reperfusion revealed a severe reperfusion injury in both groups.

The effect of acute exposure to CPA was assessed by flushing the hearts with CP-14, a cardioplegic solution, containing methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), ethylene glycol (EG), or propylene glycol (PG) for 2 min and reperfusing immediately with Krebs-Henseleit buffer in a working-heart model. The maximal doses that did not cause irreversible suppression of heart function were: MeOH, 1.78 M ; EtOH, 1.27 M; EG, 0.84 M; and PG, 0.87 M. For nonfreezing storage, the hearts were flushed with CP-14 containing the highest tolerable concentrations of MeOH, EtOH, EG, or PG, stored for 6 h at - 3,7, - 2,8, and - 1.4°C, respectively, and then reperfused. Control cardiac output (CO) was 76.2 ± 1.8 ml/min. Post-reperfusional recovery of CO was 86% in MeOH hearts, 82% in EtOH hearts, 76% in EG hearts, and 79% in PG hearts. Thus MeOH offered not only the least cardiac-suppressing effect but the lowest nonfreezing storage temperature. When storage time was extended, recovery and myocardial ATP level decreased with time in hearts flushed with CP-14 + 1.78 M MeOH and stored at -3.7°C. The decay of function was faster than the decay of ATP level, suggesting energy was better preserved than function. The low return of function, however, may be related to CPA toxicity, osmotic stress, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Nonfreezing storage at subzero temperatures using these CPAs may provide a novel approach to long-term cardiac preservation. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.",,"adenine nucleotide; alcohol; cryoprotective agent; ethylene glycol; ethylene glycol derivative; methanol; propanediol derivative; propylene glycol; animal; article; cryopreservation; drug effect; energy metabolism; heart; hemodynamics; in vitro study; male; metabolism; methodology; organ preservation; physiology; rat; rat strain; Adenine Nucleotides; Animal; Cryopreservation; Cryoprotective Agents; Energy Metabolism; Ethanol; Ethylene Glycol; Ethylene Glycols; Heart; Hemodynamics; In Vitro; Male; Methanol; Organ Preservation; Propylene Glycol; Propylene Glycols; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027648893

On the basis of the idea that the release of sensible heat will be taken into account if the heat release fraction is used as an independent variable instead of the frozen fraction, a new method for calculating the heat exchanger effectiveness utilizing the similarity curve of the heat release fraction has been proposed and developed. The comparison between numerical and experimental results on a concentric-circular-tube-type storage unit with n-eicosane as a phase change material shows that the new method is especially advantageous in the solidification process after the inlet frozen fraction exceeds unity. In the similarity curve of the heat release fraction, however, the similarity rule is less applicable than in that of the frozen fraction. © 1993, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

The computer program is based on the transient model of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations governing heat and mass flow in soils. The model is two‐dimensional and delineates the operation of ground heat storage with the HGHE and such phenomena as freezing/thawing and drying/rewetting of soil moisture. Comprehensive climatological data, such as ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind velocity, rainfall, snowfall, snow characterstics, and water vapour pressure is used to simulate conditions at the ground surface over any required length of time. The package can be applied to any geographical location by changing climatic and soil data input. The designer has the possibility of selecting any of 12 types of soils from sand to clay, 12 commercial heat pumps, nine different configurations of the HGHE, 16 plastic pipes for ground coils, and 13 ground coil fluids. The program, however, does not calculate the length of the HGHE but it evaluates the thermodynamic performance of a ground heat pump system and provides comprehensive data on thermal and hydraulic conditions in ground heat storage. The length of the ground heat exchanger is obtained from a line source theory model or from site dimensions and pipe spacing. Computed results for ground heat exchanger operation correlate fairly well with experimental data. Simulation of temperature and moisture content in the ground for natural conditions (no heat extraction/deposition) showed a fair agreement with field data. The entire computer program is user‐friendly, interactive, menu‐driven, and written in FORTRAN 77.

The power generated by the photovoltaic system is being used for light and fan loads in the school building. To study the performance of the photovoltaic system under field conditions, a monitoring system has been installed. The monitoring system acquires the PV parameters and associated component efficiency related data on floppy disks at an interval of 5 min. The variation in energy output due to changes of the climatological condition is also studied to make the system a reliable power supply for a given load throughout the year. The 20 kWp PV array consists of four subarrays. These are fixed latitude tilted (15, 3, 1 kWp) and a tracking type (1 kWp). A single axis passive tracker is used to investigate the advantage of single axis tracking in India. The energy generated by the 20 kWp system during the year 1990 was 15 MWh. The energy generated by the PV system is stored in lead acid batteries of rated capacity (1080, 360 and 120 Ah of 2V). The details of the energy distribution in the various storage units are discussed in the paper. To supply energy for a.c. loads, three inverters of 5 kVA rating each are used.

Amongst these is the need to protect the system from islanding caused by the loss of the utility grid supply and the possible subsequent out-of-synchronism reconnection of that supply. This paper examines the requirements of an islanding, or ‘loss of grid’, protection and outlines the principal methods used for this type of relaying. A new protection algorithm is introduced which is based on the rate of change of power as measured at the generator's terminals. The responses of the different measurands are examined for a selection of power system operating conditions to demonstrate the operation of this type of protection.

Opportunities appear to exist where SMES at a given location could provide multiple benefits either simultaneously or sequentially as system conditions dictate. These benefits, including diurnal storage and system stability and dynamics cotnrol enhancement, increase the application potential of SMES to a larger number of opportunities than might be justified by the value of its diurnal storage capability alone. However, the benefits an individual utility may realized from SMES applications are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the utility system, the location of the SMES unti, and the timing of its installation in the system. Such benefits are typically not evaluated adequately in generic studies. This paper summarizes results of case studies performed by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) with funding provided by the Bonnevillle Power Administration (BPA) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The derivation of SMES benefits and costs are described and benefit/cost (B/C) ratios are compared in system-specific scenarios of intereste to BPA. Results of using the DYNASTORE production cost model show the sensitivity of B/C ratios to SMES capacity and power and to the forecast system load. Intermediate-size SMES applications, which primarily provide system stability and dynamic control enhancement are reveiwed. The potential for SMES to levelize the output of a wind energy complex is also assessed. Most of the cases show SMES to provide a positive net benefit with the additional, sometimes surprising indication, that B/C ratios and net present worth of intermediate-size units can exceed those of larger systems. © 1993.",,"Efficiency; Energy storage; Benefit cost ratio; Cost efficiency; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Superconductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027634905

The specific problem addressed is the on-line scheduling of pulp digesters that operate in two parallel production lines under common resource limitations. Each line has a storage tank which is installed after the batch section and feeds continuously operated line downstream. The problem of scheduling is to determine the digester sequence and the corresponding batch start and completion times in order to maintain continuous production downstream while also maximize batch cycle time to improve pulp quality and reduce energy consumption. The proposed solution procedure is based on a heuristic algorithm combining neighborhood search technique and linear programming. Searching for the batch sequence enables to set the production rate for each line individually. Using linear programming, the problem is formulated generally enough to be adapted to frequent changes of control requirements quickly and easily. The algorithm was first tested off-line for a set of different operating conditions. Also, it was included into a pulp cooking simulation package and tested as a part of control algorithms designed for computer automation. © 1993.",,"Batch Processes; Control Algorithms; Digesters; Scheduling; Batch digesters; Scheduling theory; Algorithms; Chemical operations; Computational complexity; Control systems; Heuristic methods; Linear programming; Mathematical models; Online systems; Process control; Production control; Scheduling; Pulp digesters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027628278

Polymers prepared from monomers of this type are highly cross-linked thermosets with high storage moduli. Spectroscopic analysis of partially polymerized monomers suggests that the dominant mode of polymerization is the Diels–Alder reaction of a reactive intermediate o-quinodimethane with α,β-disubstituted olefin. The rate of polymerization appears to be controlled by the first-order rearrangement of benzocyclobutene to o-quinodimethane. Rate constants for polymerization of two such monomers were calculated from residual monomer and FT-IR analyses. A relationship between molecular weight growth and functional group conversion based on the approach of Macosko and Miller23 has been applied to the polymerization of monomers containing two benzocyclobutenes and one or two olefins. Molecular weight growth and gel point for a divinyltetramethyldisiloxane-linked bis(benzocyclobutene) was found to be well predicted by this model, and an energy of activation of 37 kcal/mol was calculated for the polymerization of this monomer. trans-l,2-Bis(3-benzocyclobutenyl)ethylene monomer was found to deviate substantially from the proposed mode of polymerization at functional group conversions approaching the gel condition.

Several methods for doping Mg powders with Ni were tested, in which commercial Ni compounds are used as doping agents. The storage properties of these Ni-doped materials are comparable with those of a so-called standard material, Mg doped via bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)Ni in solution. The mechanical mixing of Mg powder with Ni powder in the dry state turned out to be by far the simplest and least expensive doping method. The storage materials obtained by mechanical mixing showed, besides satisfactory kinetics and hydrogen loading capacity, the highest cycling stability in long-term tests. The results of the cycling tests reveal a different behavior for the Ni-doped and undoped MgH2-Mg storage materials at low vs high H2 pressures and temperatures; an increase of hydrogen loading when cycling is carried out under close-to-equilibrium hydrogenation conditions; and reversibility of loading losses.

Methods to reduce reperfusion injury could lead to improved clinical renal transplantation. Glycine has been shown to suppress reperfusion injury in rabbit renal tubules and rat hepatocytes. In this study we have determined the effects of glycine on viability of isolated canine renal tubules. Renal tubules were cold stored at 4°C under hypoxic conditions for up to 96 h in the UW solution and rewarmed to 37°C for up to 2 h under oxygenated conditions to simulate reperfusion of an organ after cold static storage. Short-term storage (24 to 48 h) did not cause membrane injury (leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) on rewarming. However, after 72 and 96 h cold storage reperfusion injury was evident and LDH leakage increased from about 25% to 59 ± 3% and 71 ± 2% at 72 and 96 h cold storage, respectively. The presence of 3 mM glycine in the reperfusion medium suppressed injury to cold-stored renal tubules. After cold storage for 72 and 96 h LDH leakage was reduced to control concentrations (31 ± 3% and 29 ± 1%, respectively). After cold storage for 72 h there was a reduction in ATP concentration in rewarmed renal tubules (3 nmol/mg protein at 48 h to 1.25 nmol/mg protein at 72 h). Also, there was a loss of mitochondrial functions including decreased stimulation of oxygen consumption by uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Although glycine suppressed LDH leakage in renal tubules cold stored for 72 h it had no effect on the regeneration of ATP or mitochondrial functions, which remained depressed. Thus, the cytoprotective effect of glycine does not appear related to maintenance of energy-linked functions in cold-stored renal tubules. This study shows that glycine prevented reperfusion injury to the membranes of cold-stored canine renal tubules and may be a useful agent to improve clinical renal preservation for transplantation. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.",,"adenosine triphosphate; cryoprotective agent; glycine; lactate dehydrogenase; animal; article; cryopreservation; dog; drug effect; female; kidney tubule; metabolism; methodology; organ preservation; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen consumption; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Cryopreservation; Cryoprotective Agents; Dogs; Female; Glycine; Kidney Tubules; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Organ Preservation; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen Consumption; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027620680

It has established the present power systems of high quality. On the other hand, in the large power systems with complex configuration, an undamped power swing with low frequency caused by the synchronous power between interconnected systems tends to occur as well as an undamped power swing caused by the synchronous power of specific generators. Several coordinated stabilizing control schemes for the power systems by sets of power system stabilizers (PSSs) have been investigated so far. PSS is very effective for the stabilization of power swing among a few specific generators because the function of PSS is achieved by the voltage control using the generator field winding circuit. However, it seems that PSSs do not have sufficient ability to stabilize the power swings between interconnected systems. In this paper, the superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) which is significantly effective for the power swings between interconnected systems is introduced and a coordinated power system stabilizing control by SMES and PSSs is proposed. The advantages of the proposed control scheme are: 1) high efficiency of the controller by the distribution of functions; 2) independency of the control design for PSS and SMES; and 3) robustness of the controller, and so on.

The requirement of donor platelets for fuels, plasma and calcium were studied using platelets washed, filtered to remove leucocytes and resuspended in a new glucose‐free minimal platelet storage medium with low citrate (3 mmol/1), low buffer capacity and no calcium. This is the first study of platelets stored without plasma, glucose or calcium and it was shown that platelets continued to aggregate with collagen plus adrenaline for 48 h and showed only a 50% fall in ‘swirl index’, an objective morphology score, after 3 days, showing that by these criteria human platelets do not require glucose. Sodium acetate extended the storage time by between 2 and 4 days, depending on the index parameter. This is the first evidence showing that failure of platelets in these conditions is at least partly due to exhaustion of fuel, and the first evidence that acetate prolongs in vitro survival. As little as 10% low‐glucose plasma extended the storage time, but it was no better than acetate. New observations using this system included a very rapid fall in pH during resuspension of the washed platelet pellet, a rising pH in the absence of added fuel and an increased pH with added acetate.

The measurements and calculations are made in comparison with a nearby open agricultural location or ""control site"". The measurement program was conducted during the summer of 1981 in Davis, CA, and consisted of a series of paired observations in which simultaneous measurements were made at a control site, located in a nearby rural area, and one suburban site at a time. Results indicate that this methodology was generally successful. The various suburban sites were as often cooler than the rural site as they were warmer. In one case, a suburban site was found to be substantially cooler, averaging 7.38°C over a 5 day period, than the rural site. This special case was observed to be associated with unusually dry environmental air resulting in large evaporative cooling in the plant canopy. Comparison between the suburban temperature deficit and the physical nature of the various sites reveals that canopy height explained most of the variance of this data set. Two generally important mechanisms are hypothesized to be operating in this system: the effect of canopy size on turbulent mixing and on site shading, especially of paved areas. A simple energy balance model was applied to study the processes that control the daytime suburban temperature deficit. In particular, it is found that suburban sites can be as cool as observed when the following conditions are obtained: low-canopy humidity, large canopy size, low wind speed and high radiation load. The model simulated the overall average suburban temperature deficit of all sites for physically reasonable choices of model parameters. It is pointed out that the fact that suburban areas may be cooler than surrounding rural areas may have significance to the problem of assessing the role of the urban heat island in relation to possible global warming. © 1993.","observations; urban canopy; Urban climate","Evapotranspiration; Geographical regions; Greenhouse effect; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Temperature measurement; Daytime suburban temperature deficit; Energy balance model; Microclimatic variations; Suburban environment; Urban canopy; Urban heat island phenomenon; Climatology; air quality; article; comparative study; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; meteorology; methodology; microclimate; radiation exposure; rural area; summer; urban area; wind; microclimate; suburban environment; temperature deficit; urban canopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027611204

Current technology employs a two-phase Li alloy negative electrode, low melting point LiCl-rich LiClLiBrKBr molten salt electrolyte, and either an FeS or an upper-plateau (UP) FeS2 positive electrode. These components are assembled in an ""electrolyte-starved"" bipolar cell configuration. Use of the two-phase Li alloy (α + β LiAl and Li5Al5Fe2) negative electrode provides in situ overcharge tolerance that renders the bipolar design viable. Employing LiCl rich LiClLiBrKBr electrolyte in ""electrolyte-starved"" cells achieves low-burdened cells that possess low area-specific impedance; comparable to that of flooded cells using LiClLiBrKBr eutectic electrolyte. The combination of dense U.P. FeS2 electrodes and low-melting electrolyte produces a stable and reversible couple, achieving over 1000 cycles in flooded cells, with high power capabilities. In addition, a family of stable chalcogenide ceramic/sealant materials was developed that produce high-strength bonds between a variety of metals and ceramics, which renders lithium/iron sulfide bipolar stacks practical. Bipolar LiAl/FeS and LiAl/FeS2 cells and four-cell stacks using these seals are being built and tested in the 13 cm diameter size for EV applications. To date, LiAl/FeS cells have achieved 240 W kg-1 power at 80% depth of discharge (DOD) and 130 Wh kg-1 energy at the 25 W kg-1 rate. LiAl/FeS2 cells have attained 400 W kg-1 power at 80% DOD and 180 Wh kg-1 energy at the 30 W kg-1 rate. When cell performance characteristics are used to model full-scale EV and hybrid vehicle (HV) batteries, they are projected to meet or exceed the performance requirements for a large variety of EV and HV applications. © 1993.","bipolar battery; electric-vehicle battery; iron-disulfide electrode; lithium battery; molten-salt electrolyte","Electric automobiles; Iron compounds; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Storage battery vehicles; High temperature; Lithium/sulfide batteries; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027607876

By expanding displacements in spatial coordinates, integral expressions for strain and kinetic energy are converted to quadratic sums involving time-dependent generalized coordinates. Hamilton’s principle provides ordinary differential equations for these coordinates. This viewpoint yields physical insight into the mechanisms of energy storage and avoids the geometrically thin assumption inherent to many formulations. A set of Legendre polynomials multiplied by a radial factor represent the radial dependences of displacement components, while circumferential variations are represented by sinusoidal functions. Excellent agreement in natural frequencies is found between this approach and analytical solutions over the entire range of shell thicknesses, including the limiting case of a solid cylinder. Comparisons to several thin shell theories are given, leading to conclusions about the range of validity of these theories. © 1993 by ASME.",,"Cylinders (shapes); Kinetic theory; Polynomials; Strain; Vibrations (mechanical); Legendre polynomials; Ritz expansions; Thickness expansion; Thin shell theories; Shells (structures)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027607860

The PHA productivity is maximal at a dilution rate of 0.20 h-1 and yields 0.17 g PHA l-1 h-1. To improve the PHA productivity of this two-liquid-phase chemostat, the density of PHA-accumulating cells growing at a rate of 0.20 h-1 was raised by increasing the concentration of the limiting nutrient ammonium in the medium feed in discrete steps from 16.7 to 116.6 mm. After medium optimization with retention of ammonium-limiting conditions and an increase of oxygen transfer rates (the stirrer speed was increased from 1000 to 1800 rev min-1 and the airflow from 200 to 550 ml min-1), the cell density could be raised to 11.6 g l-1 with a PHA productivity of 0.58 g PHA l-1 h-1.

Elucidation of the heat transfer mechanism in such a case is of special importance in designing cost-effective ice storage and heat storage systems employing the latent heat of fusion thermal energy storage (TES) concept. Experimental results are presented on melting heat transfer in horizontal cylindrical capsules. This phenomenon includes both close-contact heat transfer in a narrow layer between the solid and the capsule wall and natural convection in the liquid melt. Hitherto, attention has been focused mainly on close-contact melting, and the contribution of natural convective heat transfer in the liquid phase has been neglected. The contribution of natural convection in a cylindrical capsule was clarified when Rayleigh and Stefan numbers were caried over a wide range of values. In most previous studies, these parameters were kept within a relatively narrow range, and the effect of varying parameters was not discussed. It is shown in the present paper that the contribution of close-contact heat transfer is reduced as the Stefan number increases and therefore the contribution of natural convection in the melt region becomes significant. Experimental results are compared with numerical results in which both close-contact and natural convection effects are included. The results facilitate the design of practical latent heat TES systems using various capsules. © 1993.","combined melting; contact melting; cylindrical capsule; natural convection; thermal energy storage","Convection; Heat Transfer; Melting; Storage; Cylinders (containers); Experiments; Heat convection; Heat storage; Solids; Wall flow; Close contact melting; Combined melting; Horizontal cylindrical capsules; Ice storage systems; Latent heat of fusion thermal energy storage; Natural convection; Rayleigh numbers; Stefan numbers; Melting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027579870

Evaporation, which consumes large amounts of energy, is the most widely used operation for concentrating liquid foods. The paper describes a novel system to concentrate liquid foods by using liquid desiccants. In the proposed system, water vapour, evaporated from the liquid food at reduced pressure, passes to the liquid desiccant, where it is absorbed while liberating its latent heat. The liquid desiccant temperature thereby increases. The warm liquid desiccant can then be used to provide a portion of the thermal energy for the evaporation of the water in the liquid food. A vertical, double‐falling‐film evaporator which uses calcium chloride solution was built and was used to concentrate liquid foods. The experimental set‐up was tested to study the influence of the liquid‐desiccant flow rate, the liquid‐food flow rate, and the liquid‐desiccant concentration and temperature. Some of the experimental results are discussed in this paper.

It is expected that the EV load will be contained within system off-peak hours without affecting the peak demand, thus increasing the sale of low cost electricity. However, the impact of electric vehicle charging on the energy and power demand is determined not only by the number of EV's in use and their usage pattern, but also by the number of EV's being charged at an instant and the charging profile of the battery module. The daily energy consumption by an EV will be limited by the range/cycle and the charging time, while its impact on the system demand will depend on the hour and pattern of charging. The case studies in this paper have revealed several important issues regarding the impacts EV load may have on utility distribution systems. Firstly, it is not adequate to have only sufficient generation capacity during off-peak hours to assure a system's ability to absorb EV loads without adverse effects. The constraints at the distribution level must be studied properly. Secondly, a sizable EV load can introduce a new peak in the early off-peak period. It may have scheduling implications, and completely throw any load management programs off balance. Thirdly, at the present state of EV technology, including those of battery modules and chargers, a typical distribution system may not be able to supply EV loads beyond 20% penetration level. This constraint is created by the long (up to 12 hours) charging cycle of batteries. © 1993 IEEE",,"Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Storage battery vehicles; Charging time; Electric vehicle loads; System demands; System off peak hours; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027576693

Both NPG and AMPL have monoclinic low temperature a-phase and cubic high temperature 7-phase structures. These polymorphic changes in structure occur at 41 and 80°C, for NPG and AMPL, respectively. Below the a — 7 transition, these compounds are dielectric materials with conductivities on the order of 10“8S/m (at 22°C) and 10“9S/m (at 25°C), for NPG and AMPL, respectively. The lack of appreciable conductivity in the low temperature phase is consistent with charge transport via low temperature structural reorientation. There is a significant increase in the conductivity through the a 7 phase transition with a maximum of 10“6S/m (at 82.05°C) for NPG and 10~5S/m (at 133.25°C) for AMPL in the high temperature phase. The conductivities in both the a- and 7-phases have been found to be thermally activated. The temperature dependent conductivity follows the Arrhenius equation with the activation energy of the a -»7 transition being larger in the case of NPG. Remarkably, the activation energies of the high temperature 7-phases are nearly equivalent, suggestive of similar conduction mechanisms and charge carriers. The charge carrier diffusion coefficients, D are in the range of 1 and 3 X 10“10 cm2/s (45 T 56°C) for NPG, and between 6.9 and 7.3 X 10“10 cm2/s (85 T 92°C) for AMPL. The ac conductivity in the a-phase exhibits behavior representative of a double well potential energy profile where thelow and high frequency conductivities are constant with a Debye-like transition at intermediate frequencies. The 7-phase ac conductivity is frequency independent as is the case in simple hopping conductivity processes. AC impedance spectroscopic measurements on NPG and AMPL have been made and frequency and temperature effects on the conductivities, relaxation times, and diffusional parameters of NPG and AMPL are presented. © 1993, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The multidimensional phase change problem is tackled with an enthalpy-based method coupled to the convective heat transfer from the HTF. The numerical predictions are validated with experimental data. A series of numerical experiments are then undertaken to assess the effects of various thermal and geometric parameters on the heat transfer process and on the behavior of the system. Results show that the shell radius, the mass flow rate, and the inlet temperature of the HTF must be chosen carefully in order to optimize the performance of the unit. © 1993.",,"Computer simulation; Energy storage; Numerical methods; Phase transitions; Tubes (components); Phase change materials; Shell and tube latent heat storage units; Thermal energy storage; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027576330

An experimental comparison of the electrochemical properties of “electrocoated” (EC) and solution cast (SC) Nafion film modified electrodes is described. Specifically, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been studied at bare and Nafion-modified stainless steel-carbon composite electrodes in 0.1M NaOH and at bare and Nafion-modified platinum disk electrodes in 0,7MH3PO4 using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and ac impedance analysis. The reduction currents, reduction current enhancement factors, Tafel slopes, and exchange current densities observed at the Nafion-modified electrodes are compared with the values observed at the bare electrodes in the same solution. The EC film electrodes show improved electrode kinetics compared with the SC film electrodes based on the anodic shift of the reduction current Ep/2 values. In addition, the EC film electrodes exhibit larger peak of limiting current densities per unit weight of Nafion. The increased kinetics and larger reduction currents result from a higher concentration of oxygen available at the electrode surface due to an increased interfacial contact area between the polymer and the electrode surface provided by the electrocoating method. Contact resistance between the polymer and the electrode surface may be reduced at EC film electrodes leading to less ohmic loss. © 1993, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

A mathematical method, which utilizes as input data the monthly average values of solar energy density on a horizontal surface is presented, which permits us to size the PV array as a function of the annual load diagram for a given solar site.

When irradiated with low-energy (40 kVp) X-rays at room temperature in air, Teflon-AF is found to develop a broad, structureless UV-absorption band in the wavelength interval 200-350 nm. While the UV absorption increases as a function of X-ray dose, with relative rates of approx 2 × 10-5 Gy-1 (1 × 10-5 Gy-1) in Teflon-AF 1600 (Teflon-AF 2400), its optical transparency for a given dose of 67.5 kGy, however, remains unaffected. Additional measurements conducted using electron spin resonance (ESR) technique reveal that the observed UV absorption is caused by the X-ray induced peroxy radical (POO. ̇). The results also suggest that the inclusion of dioxole monomer in the PTFE chain not only improves the optical clarity of Teflon-AF, as reported, but also increases its radiation tolerance. During a post-irradiation storage in air at RT for about 30 days the peroxy radical is observed to decay, with a concomitant decrease in UV absorption.

It takes two and a half months (conduction time), however, for the pond to settle in a quasi-stationary state. Then, 90% of the solar energy flux can be utilized. The variation principle is generalized to prove that length scales of thermal conduction and viscous forces acting in a porous pond are reduced so much that the Rayleigh number may be lowered below the critical value for the onset of convection. Piles of coarse sheets of transparent artificial lawn or vertical strings or rods, one in each 4-mm-square area, will be sufficient to prevent convection.

The variance achieved by the proposed method is smaller than those obtained with the other control methods. Thus, the proposed control method is superior to other control methods.",,"Control systems; Electric loads; Electric losses; Electric power systems; Fuzzy sets; Simulation; Superconducting devices; System stability; Control methods; Fuzzy control; Load power fluctuation; Lukasiewicz logic; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027560304

They are used by three main groups: power generating utilities; power distributing utilities; and major power consumers (such as electric furnace foundries). The principal advantages of battery energy storage systems to generating utilities include: load leveling; frequency control; spinning reserve; modular construction; convenient siting; no emissions; and investment deferral for new generation and transmission equipment. Power distributing utilities and major power consumers can avoid costly demand changes by discharging their batteries at peak periods and then recharging with lower cost off-peak power (say, at night). Battery energy storage systems are most cost effective when designed for discharge periods of less than 5 h; other systems (for example, pumped water storage) are better suited for longer discharges. It is estimated that by the year 2000 there will be a potential need for 4000 MW of battery-energy storage.

Results indicated that alumina-slurry polishing of CW66 memory-disc substrates produces a slightly thicker and more hydrated aluminium oxide film compared to diamond-turned only discs.

The SSD system provides rapid response backup power by means of a superconducting magnet connected to the load through a current to voltage converter and a dc to ac inverter. Power flows from the magnet to the load when the line voltage drops below a preset value. The magnet is designed with terminal characteristics matched to the inverter dc voltage, connected load and required carryover time.

Considering the world population structure and the upcoming industrialization of the developing countries it is evident that the electric power demand will continue to increase although less rapidly in industrialized nations. The future trends of the electric power producing chain in the conversion area may move from today’s technology with mainly rotating generators towards additional electrochemical and renewable energy devices, in addition, increasing utilization of non grid connected renewable energy sources requires new electrochemical storage devices with characteristics most effectively adapted to for instance photovoltaic systems. In future, for any new type of technology, utility industry will heavily be forced to consider environment protecting actions in terms of recycling to approach minimum disposal volumes and to save raw materials. The German government is trying to satisfy the increasing public as well as political interest by rising the research and development (R&D) budget for the renewables by approximately 25% in the fiscal year 91; fossil and fission is relatively stable.

The presence of elastomer in polycarbonate is able to enhance precrack hysteresis and, therefore, toughens the polycarbonate matrix. Higher precrack hysteresis means that a greater fraction of the input energy converts into plasticity and leaves less storage energy available to strain the crack tip for crack Initiation. If the precrack plastic zone is above the critical value before onset of initiation, the crack growth developed thereafter will be effectively contained within the domain of the plastic zone and results in mass shear, yielding ductile fracture. In this paper, the elastomer toughening is classified as promotion of ductile failure through mass shear yielding and the localized energy dissipation processes. The localized energy dissipations are further divided into the activities occurring on and underneath the fracture surface.

Some thermal analysis showed that the compressional and frictional heating exerted by the expanding hot helium could heat the helium away from the normal zone above the superconductor current sharing temperature. Thus an acceleration of the quench propagation could be realized. This phenomenon was termed thermal hydraulic quench-back (THQ). A setup has been built specifically to investigate this phenomenon. The test sample consists of a 50-m-long NbTi superconducting cable enclosed in a stainless steel conduit. Heaters 0.2 to 8 m long are provided to quench the conductor.

The electric auto is a prime example. Storage systems for the electric utilities, and for wind or solar power, are other examples. While electrochemical cells could in principle supply these needs, existing E-C batteries have well-known limitations. This article addresses an alternative—the electromechanical battery (EMB). An EMB is a modular unit consisting of an evacuated housing containing a fiber-composite rotor. The rotor is supported by magnetic bearings and contains an integrally mounted permanent magnet array. Recent developments in high-strength fibers, in permanent-magnet materials, and in solid-state power electronics open up new possibilities, allowing the design of small (1 kW-h) modular EMB’s for full-or hybrid-electric vehicles, and larger size modules (25 kW-h), for a variety of stationaryy storage needs. The article addresses design issues for EMBs with rotors made up of nested cylinders. Issues addressed include: rotational stability, stress distributions, generator/motor power and efficiency, power conversion, and cost. An important conclusion; the use of EMB’s in electric autos could result in a five-fold reduction (relative to the 1C engine) in the primaryy energy input required for urban driving, with a concomitant major positive impact on our economy and on air pollution. © 1993 IEEE",,"Electric automobiles; Electric power generation; Electromechanical devices; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Magnetic materials; Electromechanical batteries; High-efficiency batteries; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027554722

The equalization is accomplished using dc-to-dc converters to divert portions of the charging current past selected cells (or groups of cells.) When no converters are operating, the charging current through the string is equal to that of the charging source. As the string charges, one cell eventually reaches a threshold voltage VA. At threshold, a shunt converter is activated to divert current around the cell, thus maintaining the cell at VA. The diverted current extracts energy which is placed back into the charging bus, and appears as an additional charging current to the source. This positive feedback of current, with a gain of less than one, increases the current available for charging the string. This recirculated current allows the lowest charged cells, or cells of larger capacity, to be charged at higher rates than available directly from the source. If a cell fails open, the converter across the cell maintains a constant terminal voltage during charging while allowing current to flow in the entire battery string. During discharging, the converters across the remaining cells supply energy to the bus, while the converter across the open cell maintains a constant terminal voltage. The maximum current gain of the system is equal to the number of converters used in the system. © 1993 IEEE",,"Electric batteries; Electric converters; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Active charge equalization; Dc to dc converters; Dynamic equalization; Maximum current gain; Serial energy storage elements; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027554082

It is difficult to scale-up a particular monolithic design to achieve higher current. Overall magnet design issues are also more difficult to tackle with monolithic conductors.

A capacitor self-excited induction generator has emerged as a suitable candidate of isolated power sources. The utilization of a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor as an autonomous self-excited induction generator is reviewed. Variations of electrical power due to changes in wind speed should be as small as possible. This is obtained by using an induction generator driven by a wind turbine. The system incorporates use of turbine blade angle pitch control to control the wind turbine speed and shaft torque. Variable pitch turbines operate efficiently over a wider range of wind speeds. Self excitation with capacitors at the stator terminals of the induction machines is well demonstrated experimentally on a d.c. motor-induction machine set. The parameters and the excitation requirements of the induction machine, run in self-excited induction generator mode, are determined. The effects of variations in prime mover speed, terminal capacitance and the load power factor on the machine terminal voltage are studied. A problem related to the fluctuation of power and frequency is the voltage regulation, this problem is mainly associated with wind turbines coupled to induction generators. Ways of overcoming the problem of voltage and frequency control in self-excited induction generators have been proposed in this work. The saturable reactors in parallel or series capacitors connected with the load are suggested for voltage regulation. The system frequency deviation due to random load perturbations is then reduced, using a superconducting magnetic energy storage unit connected to the system. © 1993.","Self-excited induction generators; Wind turbine power generation","Induction motors; Wind power; Wind turbines; Capacitor self-excited induction generators; Superconducting magnetic energy storage units; Three-phase squirrel cage induction motors; Electric generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027553697

These species can be either mobile ions or holes in the valence band. Two models are presented that take into account particularities of ion and hole transport. In the small-modulation approximation, solutions for the steady state and the dynamic evolution of the photorefractive effect are given. The maximum space-charge field Eq that can be reached depends on the effective number of electron traps in the crystal. However, in the steady state, while the component of the space-charge field that is due to electrons and the one that is due to the compensating carriers both approach the value Eq, an almost complete compensation of these two components occurs. The speed of compensation is slower for larger grating spacings than for smaller grating spacings and can be increased by applying an electric field. Applying an external electric field also produces a phase shift between the two gratings, therefore increasing the total space-charge field. Experiments performed in KNbO3 confirm the theoretical predictions and indicate that the ionic model is more appropriate for this crystal.

Conceptually, this is similar to the function of ETS under time of use (TOU) rates. However, under RTP, because of variability of prices and absence of demand charges, ETS charging can occur at any hour of the day and energy can be stored across several days. This paper addresses the issue of storage sizing under RTP rates by presenting the results of a simulation study. Parameters of the simulation, as well as building loads and prices used as inputs, are based on the results of an actual experiment on the RTP based control of ETS carried out in the winter season of 1989–1990.

It is proved that, if a heat transfer tube is made of a high-thermal-conductivity material, the formation of the similarity rule can be assured over wide variations in thickness of the tube.

The maximum absorbed power was 8.5 kW. The reforming was run under variable insolation conditions, including partly cloudy days. The flux input was regulated by opening the doors of the concentrator building. The product gas temperature followed a predetermined set point that automatically controlled the flow of reactants to ensure constant composition of the reformer products.

In the multinode approach, the tank is divided into N nodes, with an energy balance written for each node. This approach results in a set of N differential equations that can be solved for the temperatures of the nodes as a function of time. In the plug flow approach, segments of liquid of different temperatures and sizes are assumed to move through the tank in a plug flow manner. The sizes of the fluid elements are determined mainly by the simulation time step and the flow rates. Whenever the incoming fluid from the heat source is colder than the fluid at the top of the tank, ""plume entrainment"" occurs. A model describing plume entrainment has been incorporated into both the multinode and the plug flow models in the TRNSYS program[1]. A performance study of the TRNSYS tank models has been carried out with experimental data from two different sources. Three performance numbers have been defined for quantifying the accuracy of the models compared with experimental data.

However, if the energy storage in the ground beneath the pond is enhanced, the thickness of the lower convective layer, and hence the salt requirement, can be reduced. A method is proposed for the enhancement of ground storage. It requires formation of deep trenches at the bottom of the pond, in which the salt solution can circulate either heating or cooling the ridge (i.e., ""fin-like"" projection of the ground in between trenches) to affect the energy storage. Studies on the feasibility of the method are presented. The results show that the method of enhancement of energy storage is feasible if the depth of water table is more than 10 m. Also, it is found that the heat loss to the ground is lower in the case of the pond with trenches compared to the one with a flat bottom. © 1993.",,"Energy storage; Heat convection; Heat storage; Salts; Soils; Surface waters; Energy storage enhancement; Ground beneath solar ponds; Solar ponds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027539224

The predicted pattern was found in an earlier study of avian communities in central North America, where snowfall is frequent. The authors tested predictions of the hypothesis that 1) when ground- and tree-feeding guilds are compared between geographic regions of harsh and mild winter climate, only ground-feeders will have relatively high fat reserves, resulting in a significant guild × climate interaction term in a two-way analysis of variance, and 2) ground- and tree-foraging guilds will show both low fat reserves in a mild winter environment. Visible subcutaneous fat class was measured in both guilds in Wisconsin and Michigan (harsh winter environments) and SW British Columbia, NW Washington, and Tennessee (mild winter environments). Both predictions were supported. The energy storage strategy appears to be a major life-history trait in the nonbreeding period. Trade-offs that reduce reserves can lead to lower survival in severe winter weather than would occur at masximum fat levels. Individual birds are sensitive to, and can control, both predation and starvation risks. Recent theory of population limitation indicates that as food abundance declines, birds feed to avoid starvation, but at the expense of increased mortality from predation. Studies suggest that populations are limited by interacting (predation, food supply) instead of single (food supply) factors. -from Authors",,"bird; fat reserve; life history; trade-off; winter; British Columbia; Canada; Michigan; Tennessee; USA; Washington; Wisconsin; Aves; Galliformes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027532820

ATP has also been reported to be released from the heart and endothelial cells in some studies. Ecto ATPase, ADPase, and 5′‐nucleotidase activities capable of hydrolyzing ATP sequentially to adenosine are present in many cell types and may serve to terminate the actions of the nucleotides. The opposing effects of adenosine and ATP on the same cell types have suggested a modulatory role for adenosine of the actions of extracellular ATP and that the rates of hydrolysis of nucleotides might be regulated. Consistent with this it has been found that the balance between feedforward inhibition of 5′‐nucleotidase by ADP and/or ATP and preferential delivery of AMP from ADPase to 5′‐nucleotidase determines the rate of adenosine production and that this differs in different cell types. Alternatively, adenosine may be produced intracellularly as a result of an imbalance between energy demand and supply. There are at least two different cytosolic forms of 5′‐nucleotidase. Degradation of ATP during increased metabolic activity results in an increase in intracellular AMP concentration. Either cytosolic enzyme has a high KM (2–5 mM) and would thus respond to this increase with a proportional rise in the rate of adenosine production. The nucleoside transporter is essential to allow the diffusion of adenosine to extracellular receptor sites. In general, adenosine must be taken up via the nucleoside transporter before it is inactivated either by phosphorylation by adenosine kinase in the micromolar range or by deamination by adenosine deaminase at higher concentrations. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Despite unchanged food consumption, progesterone strongly induced fat deposition, with higher protein accrual efficiency coupled with lowered energy losses through thermogenesis. Estrogens lowered body weight but maintained higher protein levels and protein accrual rates; β-estradiol induced the loss of lipid and diminished food intake. Heat production was unchanged or lower in all estrogen-treated animals; β-estradiol had a more marked effect on body weight (through food intake, heat production and lipid mobilization/storage combined) than estrone. Testosterone and 5-androstendiol increased the proportion of protein, but none of them had a significant effect on lipid deposition or heat production. Nortestosterone, increased energy expenditure, fuelled in part by a higher food ingestion, a trait shared by 4-androstenedione, but not by the other androgens. The effect of androgens on body weight may thus be a combination of their actions on a) food intake, b) efficiency of protein deposition and c) activation of heat production or of lipid (energy) storage. Practically all increased the efficiency of protein deposition. Nortestosterone increased heat production. Androstenedione increased lipid storage. Dehydroepiandrosterone did not decrease body weight or metabolic rate. Cortisol depressed heat production and food intake, with a net loss of weight. Cortisol and cortisone did not increase protein deposition, but corticosterone did; deoxycorticosterone showed a high efficiency of protein deposition and increased the size of fat stores, also increasing the metabolic rate by a mean 26% versus controls, compared with a reduction of about the same magnitude induced by cortisol.

However, it has been shown that end-diastolic compliance decreases in donor heart during reperfusion. Excessively cold temperatures may affect membrane-bound enzymes (CA2+ ATPase and Ca2+ uptake) which are necessary for calcium homeostasis. To study the effect of temperature on Ca2+ ATPase and Ca2+ uptake activities over the temperature range to which a donor heart is usually exposed (4°-37°C), sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was isolated from human atrial appendages. SR was also isolated from atrial appendages which had been stored in saline at 4°C for 4 or 24 h or 24 h in St Thomas' cardioplegic solution (ST). Ca2+ ATPase and Ca2+ uptake from these samples were compared with those found in the SR of unstored appendages. The activity of Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ ATPase showed great sensitivity at assay temperatures below 22°C, while no such sensitivity was identified in SR NADPH/cytochrome C reductase (NCR). After storage of atrial appendages for only 4 h in saline at 4°C, Ca2+ uptake activity was reduced 50% in the SR when compared to unstored controls (80 ± 9.9 nmol/mg/min and 155.24 ± 2.4 nmol/mg/min, respectively; P &lt; 0.02) whereas Ca2+ ATPase was not affected until 24 h of storage, when the activity was also decreased &gt; 50% (P = 0.0002). However, NCR was not affected. In addition, storage at 4°C significantly decreased the SR protein yield (mg/g homogenate protein) at 4 or 24 h in saline as well as 24 h in ST. However, there was no decrease in the enzyme activities (Ca2+ ATPase, 229 ± 25.3; Ca2+ uptake, 221 ± 27.1; NCR, 24.9 ± 0.48 nmol/mg/min). Following exposure to low temperature, alteration of Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ ATPase may result in disruption of calcium homeostasis, thereby interrupting excitation-contraction coupling and relaxation. The damaging effects of hypothermia should be taken into account when assessing the peri-operative complications and the long-term results of cardiac transplantation. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.","Ca2+ ATPase; Ca2+ uptake; Human; Hypothermia; Myocardial preservation; Sarcoplasmic reticulum","adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); article; calcium transport; heart; heart preservation; human; human tissue; priority journal; sarcoplasmic reticulum; temperature; Analysis of Variance; Animal; Biological Transport, Active; Ca(2+)-Transporting ATPase; Calcium; Cold; Heart Atrium; Human; In Vitro; Myocardium; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Organ Preservation; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027522232

Both the hypothesis and the model are based on the principle of a critical point in local energy (entropy ?) storage, at a certain level of structural organisation within the cells. This principle has been previously formulated by the author from the rules of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The model introduces a new terminology and explores the concepts of both high work value of energy and bufurcation. The ability (A) of cells is suggested to be the most important cellular feature in respect to cell survival. This ability implies that the cells follow the requirement Kir &gt; 1, even in dangerous situations and under harmful environmental influence. But, when the cells have lost their ability (A) and all levels of the cell defence machine have been exhausted, then the local energy storage may provoke a cascade of harmful events within the cells. The S-stage is the most unstable state of the cell cycle. If such harmful events take place during DNA synthesis within the 'premalignant' cell, in the phase 'promotion' at the 4th bifurcation, they lead ultimately to carcinogenesis (i.e. malignant transformation). The 7-phase model of carcinogenesis is consistent and offers many advantages in comparison to the previous hypotheses. This model could help the design of experiments, development of new drugs and optimization of medical treatment. The new hypothesis could contribute to a better understanding of the processes of carcinogenesis and the uncontrolled division, growth and lability of tumour cells. © 1993.",,"animal cell; carcinogenesis; cell transformation; human; human cell; hypothesis; nonhuman; priority journal; review; tumor cell; Animal; Cell Cycle; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cocarcinogenesis; Human; Models, Biological; Neoplasms; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Thermodynamics; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027515490

Within spawning seasons, males and females deplete the same amount of storage energy. Percent somatic lipid content is positively correlated with body size during spring but shows no relationship to body size in autumn. These patterns indicate that spring spawners (lengthy gonad maturation period) allocate proportionally more storage energy to routine and active metabolism than autumn spawners (brief gonad maturation period). The low intercept and steep slope of the gonad weight-length relationship for spring spawners reflect the interaction between decreasing metabolic rate with body size and increasing storage energy capacity with body size.

The purpose of the present study was in this context to obtain information on the digestible energy (DE) of different prey selected by minke whales. An in vitro three-stage digestion technique, simulating the different compartments of the digestive system, has been developed. The initial step simulated the anaerobic microbial fermentation of substrate in the forestomach. The next stage included the addition of pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1)-HC1, simulating ventricle enzymic decomposition, and finally, in the third step, fresh extract from duodenal contents was used to simulate enzymic intestinal degradation of the remaining components of the food. The inoculum was normally obtained from animals which had recently eaten the prey to be tested. In such tests we obtained a dry matter disappearance (DMD) and a DE for herring (Clupea harengus) of 80•4 (sd 5•0) % (n 18) and 92•1 (sd 3•7)% (n 16) respectively, and a DMD of krill (Thysanoessa sp.) of 83•4 (sd 4•9)% (n 6).

Pseudemydura umbrina, a critically‐endangered species, is active during winter and spring when the ephemeral swamps it inhabits contain water and aestivates during summer and autumn (November to May/June) when the swamps are dry. The vitellogenic growth of ovarian follicles commences during aestivation in summer and continues during autumn and winter. The timing of the vitellogenic cycle is remarkably similar to that of many other Australian chelids and that of many other chelonians of temperate and subtropical regions, but the patterns of energy harvest, storage and allocation to ovarian follicles is different. Ovulation occurs between late September and early November and is preceded by a feeding bout and a sharp increase in female body mass. One clutch of 3–5 eggs (exceptionally of one or two) is laid in November/December. Sub‐adult females show cycles of follicular growth, followed by atresia, for several years before ovulating and laying eggs. Females taken into captivity may miss the following vitelogenic cycle, but captivity does not generally affect vitellogenic cycles. Ovulation and egg production of captive animals is easily suppressed, however, under stress or sub‐optimal food intake in spring. The sensitivity of ovulation to sub‐optimal conditions and the subsequent reabsorption of the yolk material may enhance survival of the reproducing individual during long dry periods in an unpredictable environment.

Knowing the relative contributions of these components is of obvious energetic interest since fat yields about eight times as much energy as fat‐free muscle tissue. Several recent studies have failed to demonstrate convincingly, due to flaws in their analyses, that fat‐free mass in addition to fat is accumulated before long‐distance flights. We point out that regressions of fat or the non‐fat component on total body mass cannot yield reliable estimates of the composition of individual mass changes in view of inter‐individual variation in structural size, reserve levels or timing of storage. We suggest that studies over time of synchronous populations or marked individuals will give better answers. A re‐analysis of published data indicates the widespread existence of fat‐free tissue deposition during migration, whereas in some species fat alone explained the increase in total body mass. Larger species tend to incorporate a relatively higher proportion of non‐fat components when increasing in mass. However, the comparative data set is not yet of sufficient quality to allow general statements on why, and to what extent in different individuals and species, non‐fat tissue in addition to fat is deposited before take‐off on migratory flights.

One tunnel served a railroad in Colorado and was constructed in sedimentary rock with plain concrete and timber as a lining. The lining buckled in response to vertical and sidewall rock loosening loads. A transit tunnel on the west coast was constructed in mixed face conditions of sand over stiff clay with initial timber support and a lightly reinforced concrete lining. The lining failed in the mixed face segment in shear due to eccentric loading from the differing sand and clay materials having a sloping boundary at the tunnel elevation. Brick and mortar lining was used for storage tunnels in Wisconsin constructed in weak soil and fill. The 150+ years of seeping water exposure and creep, with limited maintenance, led to the collapse of severely-deformed out-of-round tunnels whose linings were nearly strengthless. In a caving-method mine in granitic rock, plain or lightly-reinforced thick concrete lining of modern rail haulage mine tunnels are situated such as to receive very high compressive and extension strains during various phases of the mining activity. Initially the tunnel linings are torn apart by vertical extension, then crushed by vertical compression. The roof remains intact, while the walls crush. In the same mine, blasting energy and vibration destruction of thick shotcrete linings was observed under controlled conditions; it was found that hairline cracks evolved into shears of the roof closest to the blast, and finally, cratering of the roof into the tunnel occurred. © 1993.",,"Deformation; Failure Analysis; Lined; Tunnels; Blasting; Buckling; Deformation; Tunnel linings; Caving method mine; Colorado; Wisconsin; Tunnels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027475905

Currently, however, available devices have limitations. In this report we describe our experience with a programmable, tiered therapy device with anti-ventricular tachyarrhythmia pacing and VVI pacing capabilities (Cadence V-100, Ventritex Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.). This device offers certain advantages compared with conventional implantable cardioverter- defibrillators: (1) tiered, anti-ventricular tachyarrhythmia therapy incorporating programmable, rate-adaptive burst pacing in addition to energy- programmable cardioversion/defibrillation, (2) biphasic cardioversion/defibrillation waveforms, resulting in lower defibrillation thresholds, (3) the ability to abort therapy for nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, (4) electrogram storage of detected events for later retrieval and analysis, (5) noninvasive, device-generated programmed stimulation for system testing, and (6) backup VVI pacing capability. Forty patients (aged 14 to 79 years) with ventricular tachyarrhythmias refractory to medical therapy received this device. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 33 % ± 16 %. Preoperative electrophysiologic testing revealed inducible monomorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia responsive to rapid ventricular pacing in 36 patients (90 %). An extrapericardial two-patch configuration was used with either epicardial screw-in or bipolar endocardial sensing/pacing wires. No operative mortality and no device-related infection occurred. During a follow-up period of 16 ± 7 months (range 3 to 30 months), 38 patients remained active with the implanted device; one patient died of congestive heart failure 4 months after implantation, and the system was explanted in one patient who underwent cardiac transplantation. In 33 patients a total of 1815 ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected that resulted in therapy. Rate-adaptive burst pacing was used as the initial therapy in 1470 episodes and was successful in 1352 instances (92 %). Pacing- induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia acceleration occurred in 4 % of episodes. The remaining ventricular tachyarrhythmia episodes were treated with cardioversion. In 18 patients (45 %) cardioversion therapy was aborted after spontaneous termination of ventricular tachyarrhythmia. This device may be advantageous for patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias treated by implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in whom (1) the ventricular tachyarrhythmia can be terminated with burst pacing, thus avoiding shocks, (2) frequent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia occur, and reconfirmation of the presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia is desirable to avoid unnecessary therapy, (3) electrogram retrieval can guide future therapy, and (4) VVI pacing may be needed for bradycardia, particularly after cardioversion.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; cardioversion; clinical article; defibrillator; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart transplantation; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; implantation; male; patient selection; postoperative care; postoperative complication; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; surgical risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027474883

A control group was fed on the balanced diet for 4 months. At the end of malnutrition and at various times of refeeding, activities of amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1), lipase (EC 3.1.1.3), phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) and cholesterolesterase (EC 3.1.1.13) in pancreas and pancreatic juice were measured. Recovery of body and pancreas weights was obtained after 3 months of refeeding. Pancreas offered a higher resistance to the low-protein diet; a quicker recovery than that of the whole organism was observed during refeeding. Protein and RNA contents of pancreatic cells were depressed by protein depletion. At the end of refeeding, pancreatic and cell RNA contents were still depressed. In pancreas and pancreatic juice, protein depletion produced a decrease in enzyme activities, with the exception of phospholipase A2 and cholesterolesterase. During refeeding, activities were increased to various levels in pancreatic juice and pancreas. In pancreatic juice, a deficit in enzyme activities still prevailed at the end of refeeding. The retention thresholds (total activity in pancreas v. activity per h in pancreatic juice) of hydrolases were increased by malnutrition. They were all decreased by refeeding at various rates, but after 3 months of refeeding the thresholds were still markedly increased for all enzymes studied. After malnutrition and during refeeding, the dissociated enzyme activities in pancreas and pancreatic juice could be the expression of an alteration at different stages: synthesis, intracellular transport, storage mechanisms and secretion. © 1993, The Nutrition Society.

The authors participated in the realization of such a project and developed a piston-type gas holder featuring a new sealing device with a cylindrical wall structure capable to operate under the condition of large amounts and high pressure of stored gas. This paper deals with the description of the above sealing device mechanism and also discusses various developments concerning the gas sealing ability, sliding conditions, service life, and the relative displacement at local deformations for the new sealing device.

The subjects received a 4.2 MJ/day energy-deficit diet for 13 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess abdominal fat areas before and after weight loss. Weight reductions of 12.6±3.2 kg in men and 11.7±3.8 kg in women resulted in larger reductions in the fasting serum levels of total cholesterol (p&lt;0.05), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.06), and triglycerides (p&lt;0.01) and a larger increase in the high density lipoprotein cholesterol/low density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (p=0.05) in men compared with women. Men also lost more visceral fat (p&lt;0.0001), whereas the reductions in the total and subcutaneous abdominal fat depots were similar. In women, visceral fat loss was significantly related with an increase of the high density lipoprotein cholesterol level, independent of the degree of total fat loss. In men, however, no significant correlations were observed between changes in visceral fat and any of the serum lipids. Comparisons of average changes in obese men and women suggest that visceral fat loss is associated with an improvement of the serum lipid profile. However, correlation analysis does not support a critical role of visceral fat in determining serum lipid concentrations on an individual level, except for an improvement of the high density lipoprotein cholesterol level with visceral fat loss in obese women.","Cholesterol; Fat distribution; Lipids; Magnetic resonance imaging; Obesity; Triglycerides; Weight reduction","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; article; body distribution; body fat; controlled study; diet therapy; female; human; lipid blood level; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; priority journal; sex difference; subcutaneous fat; viscera; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Body Composition; Female; Human; Lipids; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Age; Obesity; Sex Characteristics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Viscera; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027465473

However, small sample volumes and, in some cases, very low enzyme activities make high demands on sample processing, storage, and performance of continuous measurements, if the enzyme activities are to be measured with acceptable reproducibility. In the presented study several aspects of homogenization, storage, and continuous measurement were scrutinized, to identify critical steps and consider ways of optimizing the method. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated from the blood of healthy subjects by sedimentation and density gradient centrifugation. After ultrasonic homogenization, 13 enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glycogen metabolism were determined photometrically. The variation of several conditions showed: 1. The duration of exposure to ultrasound for the homogenization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes has no influence over a wide range of time. 2. Addition of the detergents Triton X-100 and deoxycholic acid, as well as the SH-group protector dithiothreitol, to the homogenizing medium increased the measured activities of only a few enzymes. 3. Considerable inaccuracy was encountered-when the suspension was divided into parts for homogenization with different additives; such splitting of the suspension should therefore be performed only when necessary, as in the determination of reference values (e.g. protein or DNA content of the cell suspension). 4. Twenty four-fold determination of enzyme activities from one homogenate resulted in precisions between 4.5% (citrate synthase) and 14.4% (transketolase), which is satisfactory for the low activities (as low as 1 U/l) in the homogenate. 5. The reproducibility of enzyme activities, measured in homogenates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from different blood samples drawn simultaneously, was only slightly worse than that of the continuous measurement method itself. Thus, the precision of the measurement of enzyme activity seems to be the main determinant of the overall method. In conclusion, the described procedure of separation, homogenization, and enzyme measurement in human polymorphonuclear leukocyte meets the requirements of biochemical or clinical trials and can be recommended for clinical metabolic studies.",,"citrate synthase; deoxycholic acid; dithiothreitol; glycolytic enzyme; leukocyte extract; transketolase; triton x 100; accuracy; analytical error; article; cell free system; cell suspension; citric acid cycle; density gradient centrifugation; dna content; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme isolation; gluconeogenesis; glycogen metabolism; glycolysis; human; human cell; neutrophil; normal human; photometry; priority journal; reference value; reproducibility; technique; ultrasound; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; Citric Acid Cycle; Enzymes; Glycogen; Glycolysis; Hexosephosphates; Human; Neutrophils; Photometry; Reproducibility of Results; Staining and Labeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027463802

ATP precursors were administered to resuscitate the postischemic myocardium. Methods: Hearts isolated from male Wistar adult rats were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (pH, 7.40), subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia at 36°C, followed by 30 minutes of retrograde reperfusion with the postischemic intervention of ruthenium red (1 μM), ribose (1 mM), and adenine (1 mM). Multiple analysis of variance was used to compare means between groups (eight rats in each group). Results: In comparison with the nonischemic group, the postischemic nontreated group had a decrease in the maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise (+dP/dt, P &lt; 0.0005) and level of myocardial ATP (P &lt; 0.0005) but an increase in level of mitochondrial Ca2+ (P &lt; 0.005). In comparison with the nontreated group, ribose and adenine had no effect on all the above-mentioned parameters, and ruthenium red elevated maximum left ventricular +dP/dt (P &lt; 0.05) and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ (P &lt; 0.05) with no change in ATP (P &gt; 0.05).

Conclusion: Acute postischemic cardiac failure may be related to Ca2+ overload in mitochondria. Ruthenium red may reduce mitochondrial Ca2+ overload.

The hepatopancreas is the main energetic-storage organ in this animal. An adequate replenishment of energetic reserves after these periods of fasting is critical for the proper growth and reproduction in this species. Mercury compounds enter the biological environment from natural discharges and anthropogenic sources. Mercuric chloride is one of the most toxic metallic salts found in polluted waters. In these studies, we report the effect of mercuric chloride in the biochemical composition of crayfish hepatopancreas during the recovery period after prolonged starvation. Adult intermolt crayfish (P. clarkii) were kept starved for 15 days, and a diet of pork liver ad libitum was then supplied. After feeding, animals were divided into two groups, one of them was exposed to 0·25 mg/litre HgCl2, and the second served as control. Total protein, total lipids, and glycogen concentrations were measured in hepatopancreas after 12, 48, and 96h of mercury exposure, and caloric concentrations were calculated. Whereas, in the control group, total lipids and caloric concentration increased with time after feeding, a decrease in the levels of these parameters was found in the mercury-exposed group. The differences between both groups were statistically significant after 96h of toxicant exposure. Thus, sublethal concentrations of mercuric chloride are able to inhibit the replenishment of energetic reserves in crayfish hepatopancreas after starvation. This could have adverse effects during molting or reproduction periods, when these reserves are dramatically needed. © 1992.",,"glycogen; lipid; mercuric chloride; mercury; protein; animal experiment; chemical composition; conference paper; controlled study; crayfish; diet restriction; energy balance; energy metabolism; exposure; growth; hepatopancreas; nonhuman; reproduction; starvation; water pollution; Animalia; Astacoidea; Procambarus clarkii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027458462

Relative to solitary birds (controls), birds in pairs generally spent more time in flight, due primarily to increased rates of visiting the feeder or to agonistic encounters, with a consequent increase in energy expenditure. Greatest asymmetries in energy effects occurred in heterospecific pairs, in which Amazilia aggressively interfered with access to the feeder by Chlorostilbon. In these trials, Amazilia boosted intake sufficiently to maintain adequate rates of energy storage; Chlorostilbon did not increase intake and thus suffered significant loss of energy stores. Conspecific pairs of each species experienced energy effects intermediate to the extreme responses of heterospecific pairs. Individuals of either species had greater energy success when paired with a Chloristilbon rather than with an Amazilia.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 1-hexanol as an arresting agent and pyruvate as a substrate in a cardioplegic solution. Background. Heart transplantation is limited in part by the short preservation time of donor hearts. Better preservation techniques would improve patient survival and the time and geographic area for using donor hearts. We previously showed that a cardioplegic solution containing ethanol and pyruvate was superior to a conventional high potassium cardioplegic solution in 24-h cold storage of hamster hearts. Hexanol, a more potent arresting agent than ethanol, might be a more suitable alcohol. Methods. Rat hearts were arrested and stored for 18 h at 4 °C with an ethanol (3 vol% = 510 mmol/liter) or 1-hexanol (4 mmol/liter) and pyruvate (10 mmol/liter) cardioplegic solution, St. Thomas' Hospital solution and Stanford solution and subsequently reperfused for 1 h at 35 °C. In other groups of hearts, basal oxygen consumption and rest intracellular calcium (Indo 1 technique) were evaluated during ethanol-, hexanol- and potassium-induced cardiac arrest. Results. The percent recovery of left ventricular developed pressure and rate-pressure product were significantly better with the hexanol cardioplegic solution (67 ± 21% and 58 ± 19%, respectively; p < 0.05 for all comparisons) compared with the ethanol (10 ± 7% and 5 ± 4%), St. Thomas' Hospital (14 ± 6% and 10 ± 5%) and Stanford solutions (2 ± 2% and 2 ± 1%, respectively). Exclusion of ethanol and hexanol from storage Solutions did not influence functional recovery. Values for oxygen consumption after 15- and 30-min ethanol- and hexanol-induced arrest were significantly lower than those after potassium-induced cardiac arrest. There was no difference in the rest intracellular calcium during cardiac arrest induced by the three arresting agents. Conclusions. A hexanol and pyruvate cardioplegic solution was more favorable than ethanol or conventional solutions for long-term cold storage of rat hearts. The beneficial effects of hexanol may have been provided in part by lower energy consumption during hexanol-induced cardiac arrest. These results may have implications for preservation of hearts for heart transplantation. © 1993.",,"alcohol; hexanol; preservative; pyruvic acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; heart preservation; heart transplantation; nonhuman; preservation and storage; priority journal; rat; Animal; Bicarbonates; Calcium Chloride; Cardioplegic Solutions; Comparative Study; Heart; Hemodynamics; Hexanols; Magnesium; Organ Preservation; Oxygen Consumption; Potassium Chloride; Pyruvates; Pyruvic Acid; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium Chloride; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027450589

This study was undertaken to examine ultrastructurally the location of TG available for utilization in energy metabolism in these spermatozoa. Each spermatozoon contained several lipid globules at the bottom of the midpiece. Following incubation with sea water, both the number and size of the lipid globules decreased significantly. The total volume of lipid globules in each spermatozoon was roughly halved after 1 h of incubation. Similarly, about half of the TG was metabolized during the same incubation period. Oxygen consumption by spermatozoa during the incubation indicated the oxidation of fatty acid derived from TG.

We tested the hypothesis that the functional recovery of these hearts could be improved by exposure to two interdependently formulated preservation solutions throughout this four-step sequence. Solution I was used as a perfusion and storage medium during the first three steps, and solution II served as a modified reperfusate. The two solutions share the following principles of formulation: prevention of cell swelling (high concentrations of mannitol, a myocardium-specific impermeant) calcium overload (ionic manipulations), and oxidative damage (reduced glutathione) and enhancement of anaerobic energy production (glutamate). The two solutions differ with respect to the calcium content and buffering capacity. One hundred rat hearts perfused with isolated isovolumic buffer were subjected to cardioplegic arrest; cold (2° C) storage for 5 hours, global ischemia at 15° C for 1 hour, and normothermic reperfusion for 1 additional hour. In a first series of experiments (70 hearts), our kit of solutions was compared with six clinical preservation regimens that involved cardiac arrest with St. Thomas' Hospital or University of Wisconsin solutions followed by storage of the hearts in saline, Euro-Collins, St. Thomas' Hospital, or University of Wisconsin solutions. In a second series of experiments (30 hearts), the effects of the kit were more specifically investigated in relation to two types of additive-oncotic agents (dextran) and thiol-based antioxidants (reduced glutathione and N-acetyl-L-cysteine). According to comparisons of maximal rate of ventricular pressure increase and left ventricular compliance after reperfusion, the best myocardial protection was afforded by our kit of solutions. The addition of dextran during storage did not provide additional protection. Conversely, the omission of reduced glutathione was clearly detrimental; the replacement of reduced glutathione with N-acetyl-L-cysteine failed to improve recovery beyond that provided by antioxidant-free solutions, thereby suggesting the importance, in this model, of an anti-free radical compound that, like reduced glutathione, is operative extracellularly. We conclude that the preservation of heart transplants can be improved with the sequential use of two closely interrelated solutions, the formulations of which integrate the basic principles of organ preservation with those of myocardium-specific metabolism.",,"acetylcysteine; calcium; dextran; glutamic acid; glutathione; mannitol; St Thomas Hospital solution; University of Wisconsin solution; article; cardioplegia; cryopreservation; graft preservation; heart arrest; heart function; heart graft; heart left ventricle compliance; heart muscle injury; heart muscle ischemia; heart protection; heart ventricle pressure; human; human tissue; organ donor; priority journal; reperfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027450051

Column experiments, using native groundwater and aquifer sediment, were performed to study the controlling factors in the kinetics of carbonate precipitation for a natural system by injection of groundwater in a sediment core at 90°C. The temperature increase induced a fast precipitation of a CaFe-carbonate, containing Mn and phosphate, and a CaMgFe-carbonate, containing Mn, within at most 10 h. Both precipitates varied in composition and were partly amorphic, partly crystalline. Prolonged precipitation, after almost all Fe[II] had been removed, was extremely slow despite a twelve-fold supersaturation with respect to end-member calcite. The resulting supersaturation cannot be explained by either calcite precipitation kinetics, Mg-inhibition, Mg-calcite solubility control, or Ca-organic acid complexing, because these factors may explain a two-fold supersaturation at most. The maintenance of supersaturation is attributed to inhibition of precipitation by phosphate and/or organic acids. The influence of secondary reactions, as cation-exchange and silicate weathering, is of minor importance on the carbonate chemistry. Cation-exchange was observed in the initial stages of heated water injection. Potassium, NH4 and Fe become desorbed upon temperature increase. Related Ca-adsorption is insufficient to avoid Ca-carbonate precipitation. Weathering of silicates occurs continuously and leads to the release of Na, Ca and Mg. © 1993.",,"carbonate; groundwater; precipitation; supersaturation; thermal energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027449540

Seven untrained glycogen‐depleted subjects were offered naturally 13C‐labelled high carbohydrate meals (97% by energy) at 30 min intervals for 5 h and asked to consume as much as possible. Mean intake averaged 757 ± 211 (SD) g. Exogenous carbohydrate oxidation over 16 h calculated from gas exchange and isotope ratio measurements averaged 161 ± 45 g, and endogenous carbohydrate oxidation averaged 31 ± 25 g. Net carbohydrate storage, calculated as the difference between amount ingested and oxidized, was 563 g which was more than twice the measured hepatic and muscle carbohydrate oxidized during the depletion phase. After correction for body size the major determinant of glycogen storage was the amount of carbohydrate consumed (r = 0.97, P &lt; 0.001) which in turn was determined by each subject's dietary tolerance. Post‐repletion exercises (12 h after last meal) were used to remobilize freshly stored glycogen. 13CO2 enrichments indicated that a substantial part of the new glycogen was derived from the exogenous carbohydrate provided by the repletion meals. © 1993 Scandinavian Physiological Society","13C‐glucose; exercise; muscle; whole‐body calorimetry","glycogen; adult; article; calorimetry; carbohydrate metabolism; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; female; food intake; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; Adult; Breath Tests; Calorimetry; Carbohydrates; Carbon Isotopes; Exercise; Female; Glucose; Glycogen; Human; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027448062

EmdexR (a mixed-sugar diluent containing approximately 8 percent moisture) and stearic acid (a lubricant) made up the remainder of the formulation. Both tablets and uncompressed powder blend were manufactured, packaged in storage containers and placed on stability at different storage temperatures. Stability samples were assayed for aspirin and salicylic acid using a stability indicating analytical method. Analysis of the stability data showed that the rate of aspirin decomposition accelerated with time. Also, the aspirin decomposition rate increased with temperature. The data were fit to the empirical equation y = 100 - ktn, where y is the percent aspirin remaining, t is time, and k and n are constants. The formulation showed good stability, with less than one percent decomposition occuring after 1.75 years of storage at room temperature. This result indicates that although the aspirin formulation contained approximately 8 percent moisture, at room temperature the majority of the moisture present in the formulation is not available to react with the aspirin. The apparent activation energy of the solid-state aspirin decomposition was 46 kcal/mole, which is higher than expected. This result may be due to a temperature dependent release of moisture from the EmdexR.

Glucose kinetics, plasma lipid and blood lactate levels, whole body substrate oxidation rates and energy expenditure were measured following ingestion of 75 g fructose, in 8 cirrhotic patients and 6 controls. Fasting plasma glucose levels and rates of glucose appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) were similar. The basal rate of lipolysis was higher in cirrhotic patients (P < 0.05), but whole body lipid and carbohydrate oxidation rates and energy expenditure were similar. After fructose ingestion, plasma fructose levels were much higher in cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001) and the incremental area under the plasma glucose curve was twice that of controls (P < 0.05). The increase in glucose in patients with cirrhosis was due to an increase in glucose Ra and an initial reduction in glucose Rd. Plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels fell to similar low levels in both groups. Glycerol levels fell in controls (P < 0.05) but not in cirrhotic patients. Blood lactate levels, fasting and after oral fructose, were similar in cirrhotics and controls. The time course of suppression of lipid oxidation and stimulation of carbohydrate oxidation was more closely related to fructose levels than to serum fatty acid levels in both groups. The percent suppression and total quantity of lipid oxidized in 4 h after fructose were not significantly different, but the suppressed lipid oxidation rates and elevated carbohydrate oxidation rates were sustained for longer in the cirrhotics. The data suggest that fructose uptake and metabolism inhibits oxidation of intracellular lipid. There was a smaller increase in energy expenditure after fructose in cirrhotics (P < 0.001), but normal overall storage of fructose; the likely explanation is reduced first pass hepatic fructose uptake in cirrhotics making more fructose available to the periphery for incorporation into muscle glycogen. The energy cost of storing fructose as muscle glycogen is less than that of storing it as liver glycogen. Preferential incorporation of fructose carbon into muscle glycogen, with lower rates of hepatic glycogen and triglyceride synthesis, would therefore result in less energy expenditure after a fructose load in cirrhotics. © 1993 Elsevier Scientific Publishers Ireland Ltd.

Under intermittent cold loads simulating the periodic thermoregulatory stimulation experienced in the nest, differences between the amounts of body fat deposited by artificially reared fatty (fa/fa) and lean (Fa/-) pups were as large as those seen in mother-reared pups. The decreased V̇O2 of the cold-reared fatty pups could account for 90-100% of their extra fat deposition. At thermoneutrality, 16-day-old littermates reared with low feeding rates showed small but significant genotype differences in body fat that were not energetically accounted for by differences in V̇O2 or lean body mass. Slightly but significantly lower fecal energy losses indicated that differences in resorption might account for the positive energy balance of thermoneutrally reared fa/fa pups. Reduced energy expenditure thus efficiently fuels excess fat deposition but is not essential for the onset of excess fat deposition in fa/fa pups. Other factors than reduced sympathetic activation of brown adipose tissue must be considered as a primary cause for the development of fa/fa obesity.","artificial rearing; development; energy balance; thermoneutral; thermoregulation","animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body fat; body temperature; cold exposure; controlled study; energy expenditure; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; priority journal; rat; thermogenesis; thermoregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027443807

As vesicular ACh is free in solution, energy input is required to establish the gradient of concentration. This is accomplished in a process having at least two macromolecular components that reside in the vesicular membrane. The first component is a proton-pumping ATPase known as a V-type ATPase. It pumps protons into the synaptic vesicle, thus acidifying the vesicle core to about pH 5.4. The enzyme is found in the vacuolar-type intracellular organelles, and it is evolutionally related to the mitochondria1 ATPase. The second component is the ACh transporter (AChT). It exchanges one or more vesicular protons for cytoplasmic ACh, thus accomplishing secondary active transport of ACh. The ACh exhibits a transport Michaelis dissociation constant (KM) of about 0.3 mM, which is less than the 4 mM that can be estimated for the concentration of ACh in the cytoplasm. Proton-exchanging transporters appear to account for vesicular storage of all of the classical neurotransmitters. As a class, these transporters are poorly characterized. A structure-activity study has demonstrated that the potency of vesamicol analogues, as assessed by inhibition of active transport, is highly dependent upon the structure of the analogue.

Available evidence indicates that in humans skeletal muscle is a site for such substrate competition, which involves both pyruvate oxidation and glycogen synthesis. The insulin resistance of obesity is thought to be mostly of metabolic origin, and fully reversible. A reduction in FFA supply by weight reduction can, however, reverse this defect. The insulin resistance associated with NIDDM is thought to be primary, with a strong genetic basis, and partially irreversible. Patients with NIDDM are unable to increase their glucose oxidation normally in response to insulin to meet the energy demands of the body. Increased oxidation of lipids represents a compensatory phenomenon to meet these demands. Therapeutic use of the glucose-FFA cycle to lower blood glucose levels has yielded conflicting results. Studies are in progress to develop agents that inhibit gluconeogenesis by interfering with FFA oxidation. Nicotinic acid derivatives seem to enhance glycogen synthesis acutely by activating glycogen synthetase. Whether these or similar agents can be used to restore impaired glycogen synthesis, the most characteristic genetic defect in NIDDM, cannot be answered until the effect has been proven in chronic studies. The existence of substrate competition between amino acids and glucose, and an intrinsic hypoaminoacidaemic property of amino acids, makes it possible to expand the Randle cycle into a glucose-FFA-amino acid cycle, which integrates control of substrate disposition at the whole body level. © 1993 Baillière Tindall.",,"fatty acid; glucose; glycogen; insulin; nicotinic acid derivative; fatty acid metabolism; gluconeogenesis; glucose metabolism; glycogen synthesis; hormone action; human; insulin resistance; liver metabolism; metabolic regulation; muscle metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; rat; review; skeletal muscle; storage; Animal; Binding, Competitive; Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Glycogen; Human; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lipids; Liver; Muscles; Niacin; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027428101

Comparisons of performances of different-sized animals yield different results if made using relative, rather than absolute scales. Absolute speed may be a reasonable way to evaluate the locomotor performance of an animal that must escape predators in real time. However, comparisons of metabolic power in animals of different size can only be made meaningfully on a mass-specific basis. Numerous factors associated with the mechanics, energetics, and storage of elastic energy during locomotion change with body size, which results in allometric relationships that make the energetic cost of locomotion (α M(b)-0.3) more expensive for small mammals than for large mammals. Small mammals have lower enzymatic capacities for anaerobic glycolysis (α M(b)0.15) and higher specific aerobic capacities (α M(b)-0.13) than large mammals. However, the energetic cost of transport increases more than aerobic power as mammals get smaller. The higher ratio of cost to available power in small mammals may explain why they run more slowly than large mammals, as a rule. Maximum aerobic capacity is allometrically related to body size. Limits to V̇(O2max) can be imposed by mitochondrial oxidative capacity, as in goats, or by the O2 transport system, as in humans and horses. No single step in the O2 transport system can limit the flux of O2 by itself; however, in an average non-athletic species of mammal, any of the steps in the system might appear to be the weakest link. In highly aerobic athletic species, and possibly elite athletic individuals of other species (e.g. humans), the malleable elements of the O2 transport system may develop to the point that their O2 transport capacities approach that of the least malleable element in the system, the lung. V̇(O2max) is very high in such individuals, and appears to be limited by simultaneous failure of all components of the O2 transport system.","aerobic capacity; allometry; energetics; exercise; running","animal experiment; body mass; controlled study; exercise; human; mouse; muscle metabolism; muscle strength; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027415390

Based upon supplementation studies, cystine was observed to be the first-limiting amino acid in both fresh and expired TwoCal-HN, and tryptophan was not second limiting. Protein efficiency ratio (PER) of expired, but not fresh, TwoCal-HN was lower than that of the casein control diet, but with cystine supplementation, PER of the TwoCal-HN products was equal to or greater than the PER of the casein control. With a diet containing 10 g protein/100 g that also contained energy-furnishing ingredients simulating TwoCal-HN, maximal growth enhancement occurred with a supplement of 1 g cystine/kg diet. Both glutathione and N-acetyl-L-cysteine were observed to be equivalent to an isomolar level of L-cystine in stimulating growth. Using a chemically defined amino acid diet that was singly deficient in tryptophan, bioavailability of tryptophan was determined for casein, fresh TwoCal-HN, expired TwoCal-HN and D-tryptophan. Slope-ratio bioefficacy values relative to L-tryptophan (weight gain regressed on supplemental tryptophan intake) indicated that none of the experimental sources of tryptophan had bioavailabilities different from 100%. The results indicated that tryptophan did not deteriorate, as measured analytically or biologically, as a result of storing TwoCal-HN beyond shelf life. Adding bioavailable sources of cysteine activity to casein-based enteral products markedly improves protein quality when these products are fed to young rats.","cystine; enteral formula; glutathione; rats; tryptophan","acetylcysteine; casein; cysteine; cystine; glutathione; tryptophan; amino acid deficiency; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; article; bioassay; bioavailability; controlled study; diet supplementation; enteric feeding; food analysis; food storage; growth rate; male; nonhuman; priority journal; protein quality; rat; weight gain; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027410216

In this study the viability of cultured sinusoidal endothelial cells from rat liver was assessed during storage in University of Wisconsin solution at 4°C. The vast majority of cells (83±12%) died within 24 hr of storage. Addition of KCN (1 mM) to the solution to simulate hypoxia markedly increased survival: only 3±2% of cells had lost viability after 24 hr in the presence of cyanide. Further experiments showed that other inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP formation (antimycin A 1 μM, rote-none 1 μM, oligomycin 10 μM, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone 1 μM) were protective as well, whereas glucose (10 mM) greatly diminished the protective effect of cyanide (loss of viability 38±7% after 24 hr). ATP measurements confirmed the correlation between the energy state of the cells and cell death: ATP levels after 6 hr of incubation were 19.9±4.0 nmol/106 cells in UW solution, 13.7±2.9 nmol/10e cells in UW + glucose, 6.9±1.9 nmol/106 cells in UW + KCN + glucose and 1.9±1.5 nmol/106 cells in UW + KCN. In contrast to the protective effect observed in UW solution, addition of KCN to Krebs-Henseleit buffer led to increased endothelial cell damage upon cold storage. We therefore conclude that in UW solution damage to the sinusoidal endothelium is energy-dependent. © 1993 by The Williams and Wilkins Co.",,"adenosine triphosphate; buffer; carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone; citrinin; glucose; lactate dehydrogenase; oligomycin; potassium cyanide; rotenone; university of wisconsin solution; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell damage; cell death; cell energy; cell hypoxia; cell viability; cryopreservation; endothelium cell; liver preservation; liver sinusoid; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; respiratory chain; Adenosine Triphosphate; Aerobiosis; Animal; Anoxia; Antimycin A; Cell Survival; Cryopreservation; Cyanides; Endothelium; Glucose; Liver; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reperfusion Injury; Rotenone; Solutions; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027406593

A simple electrolyte solution with a pH of 6.5 was developed for washing PCs. The platelet‐rich plasma collected with acid‐citrate‐dextrose solution by apheresis in a 0.6‐liter polyolefin bag was centrifuged. After removal of the supernatant plasma from pelleted platelet buttons, 200 ml of a washing solution consisting of 90 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 17 mM NaH2PO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 23 mM Na acetate, 17 mM Na3 citrate, 23.5 mM glucose, 2 mM adenine, 0.1% dextran, and 28.8 mM maltose (pH 6.5) was added to the pelleted platelet button. Steam sterilization of the solution was carried out under nitrogen to avoid caramelization of glucose. After resuspension of the pelleted platelet button with a washing solution and a second centrifugation, Seto additive solution (Seto sol, pH 7.4) was introduced into the bag to resuspend the platelet buttons for storage for 3 days at 22 °C. All of these procedures were completed within 3 h using a sterile docking device. In washed PCs, 99.1% of the plasma was removed and platelet recovery was 96%. The washed PCs were compared for 3 days with plasma‐poor PCs consisting of 11% plasma and 89% Seto solution. There were no significant differences in percent hypotonic shock response, aggregation, energy metabolism, and morphology of platelets between the two groups during 3 days, except for significant swelling of 3‐day‐old platelets in washed PCs. We conclude that washing PCs with a newly developed medium and resuspension by Seto sol (pH 7.4) had minimum detrimenal effects on further storage for 3 days. It is indicated that the procedure described here is relatively simple and can be finished within 3 h after the collection of platelets, and since plasma removal was sufficiently high, a new plasma‐depleted PC product may be a valuable therapeutic tool for hemostasis therapy with reduced side effects from plasma proteins. © 1993 S.

Indirect calorimetry was used to measure oxidative and nonoxidative metabolism. Basal plasma glucose levels (cirrhotics, 5.6±0.4[SE], controls, 5.1±0.2 mmol/liter), and rates of glucose appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) were similar in the two groups. After 75 g of oral glucose, plasma glucose levels were higher in cirrhotics than controls, the curves diverging for 80 min despite markedly higher insulin levels in cirrhotics. During the first 20 min, there was very little change in glucose Rd and the greater initial increase in plasma glucose in cirrhotics resulted from a higher Ra of ingested [1-14C]glucose into the systemic circulation, suggesting a reduced first-pass hepatic uptake of portal venous glucose. The continuing divergence of the plasma glucose curves was due to a lower glucose Rd between 30 and 80 min (cirrhotics 236±17 mg/kg in 50 min, controls 280±17 mg/kg in 50 min, P &lt; 0.05, one- tailed test). Glucose metabolic clearance rate rose more slowly in cirrhotics and was significantly lower than in controls during the first 2 h after glucose ingestion (2.24±0.17 vs. 3.30±0.23 ml/kg per min, P &lt; 0.005), in keeping with their known insulin insensitivity. Despite the higher initial glucose Ra in cirrhotics, during the entire 4-h period the quantity of total glucose and of ingested glucose (cirrhotics 54±2 g [72% of oral load], controls 54±3 g) appearing in the systemic circulation were similar. Overall glucose Rd (cirrhotics 72.5±3.8 g/4 h, controls 77.2±2.2 g/4 h) and percent suppression of hepatic glucose output over 4 h (cirrhotics, 53±10%, controls 49±8%) were also similar. After glucose ingestion much of the extra glucose utilized was oxidized to provide energy that in the basal state was derived from lipid fuels. Glucose oxidation after glucose ingestion was similar in both groups and accounted for approximately two-thirds of glucose Rd. The reduction in overall nonoxidative glucose disposal did not reach significance (21±5 vs. 29±3 g/4 h, 0.05 &lt; P &lt; 0.1). Although our data would be compatible with an impairment of tissue glycogen deposition after oral glucose, glucose storage as glycogen probably plays a small part in overall glucose disposal. Our results suggest that the higher glucose levels seen in cirrhotics after oral glucose are due initially to an increase in the amount of ingested glucose appearing in the systemic circulation, and subsequently to an impairment in glucose uptake by tissues due to insulin insensitivity. Impaired suppression of hepatic glucose output does not contribute to oral glucose intolerance.","glucose intolerance; glucose kinetics; insulin resistance","glucose; glycogen; insulin; adult; article; calorimetry; clinical article; controlled study; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; glucose utilization; human; liver cirrhosis; oral glucose tolerance test; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027400826

The subjects, 19 unacclimatized males, were assigned to exercise at either a light intermittent (LI) (N = 4), light continuous (LC) (N = 5), moderate continuous (MC) (N = 5) or heavy continuous (HC) (N = 5) metabolic rate. For groups LI and LC, exercise involved walking on a treadmill at 4.0 km · h-1 with a 0% grade and lifting 10 kg boxes. LI alternated between 15 min of exercise and 15 min of rest. Group MC walked at 4.8 km · h-1 with a 3% grade and lifted 15 kg boxes. Group HC walked at 4.8 km · h-1 with a 7.5% grade and lifted 20 kg. Subjects were tested wearing three levels of clothing protection: combat clothing (L); combat clothing and a semi-permeable BC overgarment (M); combat clothing and BC overgarment, gloves, boots and respirator (H). TT was the time until rectal temperature reached 39.3°C, heart rate reached 95% maximum, dizziness or nausea precluded further exercise, or 5 h had elapsed. For group LI, TT was similar for L (137 ± 15 min) and M (117 ± 9 min) clothing. TT was significantly reduced for H (67 ± 6 min) clothing. For group LC, TT was greater for L (91 ± 11 min) compared with either M (68 ± 7 min) or H (55 ± 2 min) clothing. For group MC, TT was greater for L (51 ± 5 min) compared with H (35 ± 2 min) but TT for both of these levels of protective clothing was not different from M (44 ± 2 min) clothing. Finally, for group HC, TT was significantly reduced from L (43 ± 6 min) to M (32 ± 6 min) and to H (25 ± 3 min) clothing. The decreasing curvilinear relationship between TT and the average metabolic rate was described by a hyperbolic function for each level of BC protection. The vertical asymptote of these functions defined the metabolic rate associated with infinite TT. For each level of BC protection, a resting metabolic rate was above the value associated with infinite TT. These findings implied that even under resting conditions body heat storage and the increase in core temperature would continue. Although intermittent rest periods alone may not reduce the risk of heat casualties, tolerance time will be increased.",,"adult; article; canada; heart rate; heat tolerance; human; human experiment; job performance; male; metabolic rate; nausea; normal human; protective clothing; rectum temperature; temperature acclimatization; treadmill exercise; vertigo; Adult; Biological Warfare; Body Temperature; Canada; Chemical Warfare; Energy Metabolism; Exercise Tolerance; Heart Rate; Heat; Human; Male; Military Personnel; Protective Clothing; Sweating; Work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027385990

A central argument of the FEH is that large mammals will not starve to death as quickly as smaller sized ones when deprived of food because of fundamental allometric differences in their metabolic rate and energy storage patterns. The authors suggest, however, that the FEH is overly simplistic and applies strictly only when the temporal pattern of resource variability and the organism's response to this variability are independent of body size: relationships that are unlikely. Biogeographic models based on the assumptions implicit in the FEH, that large mammal species are better able to withstand periods of seasonal food shortage, do not consider fully other important allometries. Although large mammals appear to have an advantage in terms of mass-specific metabolic rates and ease of fat store transport, smaller mammals may be better able to exploit torpor, hibernation, food catching, and microhabitat climatic differences. Thus, viable strategies for surviving in seasonally food-limited environments are potentially available to mammals of all body sizes and no body size is favoured clearly in seasonal environments or under enforced seasonal fasting. Intraspecific inferences regarding Bergmann's rule, stemming from consideration of the FEH, are based on an interpretation of the increase in fat stores with body size within species that is tautologous. Data on fat stores in free-ranging polar bears Ursus maritimus, a species that displays considerable variation in body fat stores, are used to support the argument. -Authors",,"adaption; allometry; bear; fasting endurance hypothesis; fat storage; mammal; mammals; polar bear; seasonal environments; Mammalia; Ursus maritimus; Ursus maritimus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027385807

From midpregnancy to term in ad libitum-fed rats consuming rodent chow, 30% more saturates and monounsaturates accumulated in the whole body than were consumed, whereas 28% of dietary n-6 fatty acids and 55% of dietary n-3 fatty acids were apparently oxidized. After 48 hours of fasting during midpregnancy (days 13 to 15) followed by refeeding to term, net accumulation of saturates and monounsaturates was equivalent to intake, but whole-body disappearance of n-6 fatty acids exceeded intake by 6% (NS), whereas n-3 fatty acid disappearance exceeded intake by 43%. Thus during refeeding after fasting, dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids were apparently completely oxidized and there was actually a net loss of n-3 fatty acids from whole-body stores. Fasting during midpregnancy did not significantly affect fetal weight gain or maternal gestational hyperlipidemia toward term.

We found the highest phosphomonoester/inorganic phosphate (MP:Pi) ratio in the group of kidneys stored in the Rg solution (Rg, 0.93 ± 0.04; UW, 0.36 ± 0.02; EC, 0.28 ± 0.02). This medium has been demonstrated in previous physiological studies to give poor results in terms of organ preservation compared to the solutions that mimic the “intracellular” fluid, such as the EC and UW solutions. Because the commonly used cold storage solutions contain phosphates, which superimpose on the intracellular Pi and, thus, can distort the results, we attempted to eliminate the contaminating solution around the kidney and in the vasculature by flushing the kidney with a phosphate-free solution (Rg). The MP:Pi ratio increased in the UW and EC groups (UW, 0.82 ± 0.04; EC, 0.64 ± 0.04) in identical proportion in the 2 groups. It remained highest in the Rg group (1.02 ± 0.03). Comparisons of data before and after flush showed that external phosphate contamination was not predominant. There was no equilibrium in phosphate distribution between intra-and extracellular spaces at 24 hr of storage We conclude that the validity of the MP:Pi ratio, as a viability index of renal transplant, might have to be restricted to comparisons of kidneys preserved in the same storage conditions. Therefore, it would be necessary to establish normal and pathological values of this ratio for each cold storage solution. © 1993 by Williams and Wilkins.",,"euro collins solution; phosphate; ringer solution; university of wisconsin solution; animal tissue; article; cryopreservation; intracellular fluid; kidney graft; nonhuman; organ preservation; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; rabbit; Animal; Culture Media; Kidney; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Organ Preservation; Organophosphorus Compounds; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Rabbits; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027384324

The synthesis of the chloromethyl ketone group generally involves the reaction of a blocked amino acid with a chloroformate to produce a mixed anhydride. in these reactions, the principal difficulties are avoiding hydrolysis of the α-chloro ketone and the cyclization reactions of the peptide derivatives. Hydrolysis of the chloromethyl ketone to the hydroxymethyl derivative can occur rapidly in basic aqueous media; and nucleophilic reagents, such as amines and thiols, can react rapidly in nonaqueous solvents. for these reasons, a major factor in designing synthesis, purification, and storage strategies is the minimization of times when the derivatives are subject to basic conditions. The most commonly used method for attaching peptides to the chloromethyl ketone-derived amino acid is mixed anhydride coupling. The rapid reaction rates, nonaqueous solvents, and minimum amounts of base required are favorable. The chapter describes the applications of labeled peptide chloromethyl ketones, such as the determining activity of protease/zymogen molecules, the exhaustive removal of protease from zymogen preparation, and the fluorescence polarization techniques. © 1993",,"acetone; amino acid sequence; animal cell; binding affinity; covalent bond; energy transfer; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; enzyme mechanism; enzyme synthesis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein processing; review; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027382523

Thermogenesis of carbohydrate comprises two distinct components: an obligatory component, which corresponds to the energy cost of carbohydrate absorption, processing, and storage; and a facultative component, which appears to be related with a carbohydrate-induced stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, and can be inhibited by β-adrenergic antagonists. Fructose ingestion induces a greater thermogenesis than does glucose. This can be explained by the hydrolysis of 3.5-4.5 mol ATP/mol fructose stored as glycogen, vs 2.5 mol ATP/mol glucose stored. Therefore the large thermogenesis of fructose corresponds essentially to an increase in obligatory thermogenesis. Obese individuals and obese patients with non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus commonly have a decrease in glucose- induced thermogenesis. These individuals in contrast display a normal thermogenesis after ingestion of fructose. This may be explained by the fact that the initial hepatic fructose metabolism is independent of insulin. This observation indicates that insulin resistance is likely to play an important role in the decreased glucose-induced thermogenesis of these individuals.","non-insulin-dependent diabetes; obesity; Thermogenesis; weight loss","adenosine triphosphate; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; fructose; glucose; glycogen; insulin; adrenergic system; diet therapy; energy expenditure; fructose metabolism; glucose metabolism; human; ingestion; insulin resistance; liver metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; review; thermogenesis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027370572

The greatest potential effect of diet composition occurs not during weight reduction but during maintenance of a reduced body weight. During weight reduction, the extent of negative energy balance is the greatest determinant of the amount and rate of weight loss, and any effects of diet composition are likely to be very small. Conversely, during the maintenance period after weight reduction, maintenance energy requirements are reduced and the rate of fat oxidation may be low.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of extended cardiac preservation with University of Wisconsin solution by assessing the time-related changes of purine metabolites using two different models of cold storage. Isolated rat hearts (n = 6/group) or human ventricular myocyte cultures (n = 7 dishes/group) were assessed after 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours in University of Wisconsin solution at 0 °C using high-performance liquid chromatography. Adenosine triphosphate content decreased from 18.1 ± 5.4 to 9.6 ± 2.7 μmol/g dried weight by 12 hours and to 1.0 ± 0.6 μmol/g by 24 hours (p < 0.0001 by analysis of variance) in the rat model. Adenosine triphosphate content decreased from 0.64 ± 0.42 to 0.14 ± 0.11 nmol/μg DNA at 6 hours and to 0.04 ± 0.03 nmol/μg DNA by 24 hours (p < 0.00001) in the cardiomyocytes. Inosine monophosphate content increased from 0.1 ± 0.2 to 10.8 ± 1.0 by 24 hours (p < 0.0001) in the rat studies. Inosine monophosphate values tended to increase up to 12 hours (p = 0.06) in the cell cultures and then declined. Adenosine concentration increased from 0.3 ± 0.3 to 2.3 ± 0.9 μmol/g at 6 hours and declined thereafter (p < 0.0005) in the rodent hearts. Adenosine concentration increased from 0.03 ± 0.02 to 1.53 ± 0.72 nmol/μg DNA at 6 hours (p < 0.0001) in the cardiomyocytes. Human cell cultures may represent a more sensitive model to evaluate adenine nucleotides after cardiac storage conditions and avoid species-specific changes in purine degradation.

Common beans are a good source of proteins, vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6) and certain minerals (Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, P, K, and Mg). They are an excellent source of complex carbohydrates and polyunsaturated free fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic). However, common beans have several undesirable attributes, such as long cooking times, being enzyme inhibitors, phytates, flatus factors, and phenolic compounds, having a “beany” flavor, and being lectins and allergens, which should be removed or eliminated for effective utilization. Grain quality of common beans is determined by factors such as acceptability by the consumer, soaking characteristics, cooking quality, and nutritive value. Acceptability characteristics include a wide variety of attributes, such as grain size, shape, color, appearance, stability under storage conditions, cooking properties, quality of the product obtained, and flavor. Storage of common beans under adverse conditions of high temperature and high humidity renders them susceptible to a hardening phenomenon, also known as the hard-to-cook (HTC) defect. Beans with this defect are characterized by extended cooking times for cotyledon softening, are less acceptable to the consumer, and are of lower nutritive value. Mechanisms involved in the HTC defect have not been elucidated satisfactorily. Attempts to provide a definitive explanation of this phenomenon have not been successful. The most important hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the cause of bean hardening are (1) lipid oxidation and/or polymerization, (2) formation of insoluble pectates, (3) lignification of middle lamella, and (4) multiple mechanisms. Most researchers have reported that the defect develops in the cotyledons. Recently, some authors have suggested that the seed coat plays a significant role in the process of common bean hardening. A better knowledge of cotyledon and seed coat microstructure may lead to a better understanding of the causes of seed hardness. In order to prevent the development of the HTC defect several procedures have been proposed: (1) appropriate storage, (2) controlled atmospheres, and (3) pretreatments. Probably, the most workable solution to the hardening phenomenon may be the development of materials less prone to HTC phenomenon. Decreasing cooking time, increasing nutritive value, and improving sensory properties of seeds with HTC defect would have great nutritional and economical impact. Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanisms leading to reversibility of this phenomenon would provide insight into the development of the defect itself and would aid in the search for appropriate methods to prevent it. Efforts to develop technological processes are needed in order to transform the HTC beans into edible and useful products. Several economic alternatives to utilize HTC common beans have been proposed: (1) dehulling, (2) extrusion, (3) solid state fermentation, (4) quick-cooking beans, and (5) production of protein concentrates and isolates and starch fractions. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Trees in the area of the 1991 fire in Oakland stored approximately 14 500 metric tons of carbon, 10% of the total amount stored by Oakland's urban forest. National urban forest carbon storage in the United States (28% tree cover) is estimated at between 350 and 750 million metric tons.

The dominant photolithotrophic members of this community were nonheterocystous cyanobacteria, but other potential nitrogen-fixing microorganisms were also present. Pronounced dieI variability in rates of acetylene reduction was observed, with nighttime rates a factor of three to four higher than daytime rates. Acetylene reduction measured at night was dependent upon the occurrence of oxygenic photosynthesis the preceding day; mats incubated in the dark during the daytime reduced acetylene at rates comparable to those of light-incubated mats but were not able to reduce acetylene at the normally high rates the following night. The addition of various exogenous carbon compounds to these dark-incubated mats did not elicit nighttime acetylene reduction. Nighttime acetylene reduction apparently proceeds under anoxic conditions in these mats; the highest rates of acetylene reduction occur late at night. Additions of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (an inhibitor of oxygenic photosynthesis) to mats resulted in a pronounced stimulation of acetylene reduction during the day, but acetylene reduction the next night proceeded at greatly reduced rates (relative to untreated mats). This daytime stimulation, under the 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea-induced anoxic conditions in the experimentally treated mats, was light dependent. These results suggest that nitrogen fixation in these mats may be attributed to the activities of nonheterocystous cyanobacteria utilizing storage products of oxygenic photosynthesis under anoxic conditions at night.",,"acetylene; anaerobic metabolism; article; Cyanobacterium; energy metabolism; energy resource; light; marine environment; night; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; photosynthesis; priority journal; reduction; Cyanobacteria; energy source; microbial mat community; nitrogen fixation; physiological characterization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027336566

The atmospheric forcings used are derived from two different sources: the operational Atmospheric General Circulation Model of ECMWF (over two 12-month periods: August 1985-July 1986 and the full year 1990) and climatologies (Esbensen and Kushnir, EK, 1981; Hsiung, H, 1986; Oort, 1983). At the site, depending on the data base, the annual mean of the total energy flux at the ocean-atmosphere interface differs in sign and intensity and its monthly evolution presents significant variation both in amplitude and timing of the maximum. The monthly wind stress evolution due to the regular north-east trade winds prevailing in this region is quite consistent as derived by the different data sources. In our area, a net evaporation rate occurs throughout the year. The simulated ML depth, based on GGL's ML depth definition, is always shallower than climatological observations of ML depth, whatever the surface atmospherical forcing used, the exception being the simulation performed with the atypical ECMWF85-86 forcing. The simulated SST's using H forcing compare rather well (within 1°C) with the observed SST's of the climatologies of Lamb and EK. Sampling experiments on the surface boundary conditions showed that simulated evolutions of the ML depth and SST differ quite significantly due to differences in data bases rather than differences in forcing frequencies. An error analysis on the ocean surface energy fluxes and the prescription of evaporation and precipitation rates under various forms demonstrate the crucial need for heat, momentum and freshwater fluxes estimates as accurate as possible. From the distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget on different time scales, it is found that most often shear production and viscous dissipation dominate in the ML. Gravitational production or destruction, turbulent diffusion and storage of TKE are of second-order. The use of a daily instead of a 3-hour forcing creates an underestimation of 19% of the total annual energy produced by the shear. When taking into account freshwater fluxes, gravitational production becomes of first order during fall and winter and intervenes in the balance between shear production and viscous dissipation. © 1993.",,"atmospheric forcing; climatological forcing; eddy-kinetic-energy model; mixed layer; ocean model; oligotrophic site; vertical mixing; Atlantic, EUMELI Site",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027332991

These processes collectively give rise to energy-matter flow-storage networks, of which food webs, defined by ingestion and assimilation transformations, are the most studied as discrete subwebs. How to deal with mixed trophic and nontropic processes has been problematic in trophic ecology since Lindeman (1942) first applied Hutchinson's (1941) concept of trophic chains to lacustrine food cycles. In this paper we develop a method to separate feeding from non-feeding flows in the conversion of arbitrary networks to transfer macrochains by network unfolding (Higashi et al., 1989, 1991, 1992). This enables analysis of the quantitative role of different flow processes in the transfer marochain. We apply the method to a 24-compartment. Okefenokee Swamp marsh ecosystem model which is 21% connected and has a Finn cycling index of 0.445 (Finn, 1976, 1978). Trophic versus nontrophic flows oscillate in their relative contributions to successive levels of the unfolded macrochain for this model, but by the 24th transfer level the oscillations damp and converge toward a point where the proportion of nontrophic flow equals the cycling index. Thus, the majority of trophic flows are essentially acyclic in this cyclic model, despite the presence of food cycling by carnivorous plants and instances of mutual predation. This corresponds to the typical acyclic structure of literature food webs. Work will continue toward being able to suppress incrementation of transfer levels when the transfer processes are nontrophic. This will enable a strict definition of trophic levels within networks of mixed trophic and nontrophic structure. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.",,"marsh; network analysis; trophic ecology; USA, Georgia, Okefenokee Swamp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027329640

The surface potential, which introduced electrostatic repulsion to liposomes against aggregation, increased dose-dependently with the addition of BZC, which gave a positive charge. However, a further addition of BZC caused unexpected aggregation during storage, so the optimum addition of BZC was defined. On the other hand, taurine, which forms a zwitter ion in an aqueous solution, did not reduce the surface potential, suggesting that taurine is of possible utility as an isotonic solute. As the result of stability testing, the liposomal system using taurine and BZC was stable against aggregation during 6 months at 40 °C. We were successful in developing a stable, positively charged liposomal system during long-term storage, and our liposomal system is believed to be of wide utility as a drug carrier for therapeutic drugs applied topically to negatively charged mucosal tissues. We applied the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory to estimate the colloidal stability of liposomes. As a result of stability testing, positively charged liposomes had a good correlation between maximum total repulsive energy (VT(max)/kT) between two liposome particles and colloidal stability, suggesting that the VT(max)/kT value is useful for estimating stability and for designing liposomal preparations containing some ionic substances. © 1993, The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

Intrauterine malnutrition led to an imbalance in the control of energy metabolism that was influenced by gender. In males, the intrauterine malnutrition resulted in impairment of normal weight gain and fat deposition during 1 to 53 d of age, in association with low plasma total triiodothyronine concentration, in spite of normal food intake. In contrast, the intrauterine malnutrition in females led to a marked fat accumulation by 53 d of age with normal food intake, and decreased brown adipose tissue weight, protein content and cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicating a lower sympathetic activity. These data indicate that nutrient availability during the first 2 wk of intrauterine life determines the control of energy utilization during early post-weaning period.","brown adipose tissue; intrauterine malnutrition; obesity; rats; triiodothyronine","cytochrome c oxidase; liothyronine; animal experiment; animal model; article; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; diet restriction; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; female; fetus; liothyronine blood level; lipid storage; male; malnutrition; metabolic regulation; newborn; nonhuman; obesity; prenatal growth; priority journal; protein content; rat; sympathetic tone; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Animals, Suckling; Body Weight; Brown Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Eating; Female; Food Deprivation; Male; Nutrition Disorders; Obesity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Sex Factors; Triiodothyronine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027326022

Glycogen and protein stores are closely controlled, and increasing the intake of nonfat nutrients stimulates their oxidation rates proportionally. Thus, chronic imbalance between intake and oxidation of nonfat nutrients cannot lead to obesity. On the other hand, fat stores are not controlled and their capacity for expansion is enormous. Because an increase in fat intake does not stimulate fat oxidation, a positive fat balance results, which has the potential to become chronic. Obesity is therefore due to a long-standing positive fat balance, which may simply be due to a high-fat diet. The use of the fat-balance equation instead of the energy-balance equation adds another option for the treatment of obesity- that of changing the quality of the diet, ie, lowering the fat content.","dietary fat; indirect calorimetry; Obesity; weight loss","conference paper; energy balance; energy consumption; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; lipid storage; obesity; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027324962

Numerous techniques have been developed to assess visceral fat because this fat seems to be most strongly associated with metabolic disorders. This review focuses on methods for the direct and indirect assessment of visceral fat ranging from multiple-scan computerized tomography to anthropometric measurements. The principles of techniques, their accuracy and reproducibility as well as aspects of costs and safety are discussed. Comparison of the different methods shows that imaging techniques, such as computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are the optimal techniques available for accurate assessment of visceral fat. Methods other than imaging techniques have limited potential in the measurement of changes in visceral fat deposition. Anthropometric measurements can be useful to classify subjects into different types of fat distribution for diagnosis of abdominal obesity, and for general application in epidemiological studies. The choice of a particular technique should be based on a balance of practical and financial considerations and the aim of the study. Involvement of ionizing radiation exposure may be an important element in the decision-making process.","Anthropometry; Computerized tomography; Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry; Dual photon absorptiometry; Fat distribution; Magnetic resonance imaging; Techniques; Ultrasound; Visceral fat","accuracy; anthropometry; body fat; computer assisted tomography; cost; human; intermethod comparison; lipid storage; measurement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; photon absorptiometry; priority journal; radiation exposure; reproducibility; review; safety; technique; ultrasound; viscera; Adipose Tissue; Anthropometry; Body Composition; Human; Viscera",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027321961

We have cloned a set of cDNAs encoding proteins involved in glucose metabolism to allow us to examine the expression of these genes during this transformation. We first obtained and characterized Schistosoma mansoni cDNA clones encoding the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (SMDH) and the mitochondrial encoded electron transport protein, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (SCOX1). Northern blots were then prepared using mRNA isolated from whole cercariae, cercarial tails, schistosomula, adult males and adult females. The Northern blots were successively hybridized with a variety of probes including those for SMDH, SCOX, the glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and several control probes. Probes were additionally hybridized to mRNA dot blots and the signals were quantified using storage phosphor technology. These studies reveal that transcripts encoding these metabolic enzymes are localized at much higher levels in cercarial tails than in whole cercariae or transformed schistosomula, and support the notion of a dominant aerobic metabolism in tails. Male and female adult worms express each of the mRNAs at roughly equal levels. Adults express the metabolic mRNAs, including those involved in oxidative glucose metabolism, at relatively high levels suggesting that adult schistosomes retain a significant capacity to produce energy through aerobic metabolism. © 1993.","Metabolism; Schistosoma mansoni; Schistosome; Transcription","article; cercaria; gene expression; genetic transcription; glucose metabolism; nonhuman; parasite development; priority journal; schistosoma mansoni; Amino Acid Sequence; Anaerobiosis; Animal; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Cytochrome-c Oxidase; DNA; Female; Gene Expression; Genes, Helminth; Glucose; Malate Dehydrogenase; Male; Molecular Probes; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidation-Reduction; Schistosoma mansoni; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Schistosoma; Schistosoma mansoni",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027319514

Of these, only two met the recommendations for the overall level of these nutrients. Sixteen of the foods were high both in total and saturated fats. Essential fatty acids were below the recommended lower limit in six of the meals and above the upper range in four. Most were virtually devoid of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids. Twelve of the samples had marginal to inadequate levels of a‐tocopherol and this may be particularly significant because lipid hydroperoxides and other reactive free radicals may be generated during storage and reheating. Ready‐meal foods are often highly processed and important nutrients are lost and it is possible that harmful products are produced during preparation, storage, cooking and reheating. Consumers should therefore be encouraged to eat other foods along with these meals to offset possible nutrient imbalances and/or deficits. Nuts, seeds or grains would help to balance the relative insufficiency of a‐tocopherol and complex carbohydrates such as rice and potatoes can provide bulk and reduce the proportions of energy from fat and saturates. Due to changes in life‐style and purchasing patterns, ready meals are increasing in popularity and some are purported to promote health.

A need exists for commercial bakers operating high-speed, high-volume mixing equipment to be able to sense non-intrusively, in real-time and in-plant the dynamic gluten development in the dough being mixed. Although several approaches are available for monitoring the mixing of dough at different stages in the mixing process, none of them can sense in real-time the exact states of gluten development. Since the three phase instantaneous input power to the mixer has a significant relationship with the gluten development, this paper discusses the instantaneous input power data acquisition system (DAS) and digital signal processing (DSP) system that was constructed, and employed. The DAS has solid-state Hall effect power transducer as the front end measurement device, a Hewlett-Packard (HP) digital oscilloscope for displaying the power flow, and a HP 9600 computer for acquisition control and data storage. With the DAS, the development of gluten protein was empirically determined to be related to the instantaneous input power signal. With the DSP system, the signal's mean was related to the dough's ″stretch″ strength, its standard deviation was related to the dough's cohesiveness, and its Fast Fourier Transform low frequency energy was related to the dough's viscoelasticity. Since no one of these signal parameters consistently gives the correct indication of optimum gluten development, fuzzy set theory was used to combine there three crisp parameters to form a gluten development index.

The other Generator Waste category contributes approximately 10% of the total GTCC LLW volume projected to the year 2035. DOE-Held Potential GTCC LLW accounts for nearly 33% of all waste projected to the year 2035. Potential Sealed Sources GTCC LLW is less than 0.2% of the total projected volume. The base case total projected volume of GTCC LLW for all categories was 3,250 m3. This was substantially less than previous estimates.",,"Characterization; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste storage; Generator waste; Greater than class C low-level waste; Held potential; Nuclear utilities waste; Potential sealed sources; Radionuclide activities; Waste forms; Radioactive wastes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027294458

In this study, we investigated the effect of pioglitazone, a novel antidiabetic agent known to lower plasma glucose in animal models of diabetes mellitus, on expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 in 3T3-F442A cells. Treatment of confluent 3T3-F442A preadipocyte cultures for 7 days with pioglitazone (1 mM) and insulin (1 gg/ml) resulted in nearly 100% differentiation of cells to lipid-accumulating adipocytes, and such adipocytes showed a markedly increased capacity for glucose uptake. Analysis of messenger RNA transcripts encoding GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporters over the 7-day differentiation period indicated time-dependent increases in abundance of each type that were maximal at more than 5fold with the combined presence of insulin and pioglitazone. In accord, GLUTl and GLUT4 protein levels also increased to maximal levels of 10-fold and 7-fold, respectively, over those in undifferentiated preadipocytes. Increased messenger RNA half-lives from 2.2 to greater than 24 h for GLUTl and from 1.2 to greater than 24 h for GLUT4 correlated with this induced adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, these findings indicated that pioglitazone markedly enhanced expression of cellular glucose transporters, and the mechanism for this action was mainly stabilization of transporter messenger RNA transcripts. Such increased expression of glucose transporters in adipocytes establishes the cells in a state active for glucose uptake, thus ultimately facilitating storage and metabolism as well. © 1993 by The Endocrine Society.",,"pioglitazone; adipocyte; article; diabetes mellitus; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; homeostasis; human; human cell; priority journal; rna transcription; 3T3 Cells; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Biological Transport; Cell Differentiation; Drug Stability; Gene Expression; Glucose; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Mice; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Thiazoles; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027292038

In December 1992, the Secretary of Energy announced that the current negotiated siting process is not expected to lead to an operational monitored retrievable storage (MRS) facility by January 1998. Therefore, DOE outlined a strategy for initiating spent fuel acceptance from utilities in 1998 that includes the use of federal government sites for interim storage and the development of the UCS concept. (Within this paper, references to the MRS facility also include interim storage facilities.) Issues that must be addressed by the utilities and DOE prior to implementing a UCS include: universal container systems design, universal container system options, delivery of universal containers to reactor sites, procurement of universal containers, interface between UCS overpack designs, containment verification requirements, effects on current waste program activities, effect of repository design considerations on utility fuel selection, and total systems cost comparison.",,"Containers; Electric utilities; Management; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive wastes; Spent fuels; Department of Energy; Reference waste management system; Universal container system concept; Radioactive waste transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027289840

The range of line pressures and hole diameters used in the experiments were 70 to 140 kPa (10 to 20 psi), and 0.4 to 0.7 mm (0.015 to 0.030 in.), respectively. Application of a leak location algorithm based upon the technique of coherence function analysis resulted in mean differences of approximately 10 cm between predicted and actual leak locations. Standard deviations of the location estimates were approximately 30 cm. Spectra computed from leak-on and leak-off time series indicate that the majority of acoustic energy received in the far field of the leak is concentrated in a frequency band from 1 to 4 kHz. The strength of the signal within this band was found to be proportional to the leak flow rate and line pressure. Energy propagation from leak to sensor was observed via three types of wave motion: longitudinal waves in the product, and longitudinal and transverse waves in the steel. The similarity between the measured wave speed and the nominal speed of sound in gasoline suggests that longitudinal waves in the product dominate the spectrum of received acoustic energy.

Initial flowsheets for this process call for the stripping (back extraction) of TRUs with 0.2 M 1-hydroxyethane-l, 1-diphosphonic acid (HEDPA) followed by washing of the process solvent with 0.25 M sodium carbonate. The stripped TRU stream is to be neutralized with caustic for interim storage in carbon steel tanks prior to vitrification. Such a scenario would result in a considerable amount of phosphorus and sodium in the TRU stream, which could preclude this material from being efficiently vitrified in the proposed Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP). An examination of alternative stripping processes suggests that the amount of phosphorus and sodium in the feed to HWVP can be reduced by 1) using a less concentrated solution of HEDPA in the strip step, or 2) using sodium carbonate as the stripping agent. The latter approach would eliminate the introduction of phosphate into the TRU waste stream. It would also greatly simplify the process by combining the strip and solvent wash steps. Furthermore, less caustic would be required to prepare vitrification feed streams for interim storage. A third approach involving the use of a combined sodium carbonate/NaHEDPA solution to strip the TRUs also shows promise. The distribution behaviors of Am(III) and Pu(IV) between HEDPA solutions or sodium 1-Hydroxyethane-l, 1-diphosphonic acid is a very efficient reagent for the stripping of transuranic elements from the TRUEX process solvent. An equation was derived from the experimental data which can be used to predict the Am distribution coefficients between HEDPA solutions and TRUEX process solvent. Sodium carbonate shows promise as a stripping reagent, but in the processing of Hanford NCRW sludge, complexants such as HEDPA must be added to prevent lanthanum precipitation. Combined NaHEDPA/Na2CO3 strip solutions are effective at removing the TRUs from the solvent. © 1993, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

The CBTAOP model is used as a forecasting tool whereby various alternative operating plans can be examined to ensure that priorities can be maintained. Stochastically generated four year low flows were used as the natural inflows, based on nine hypothetical cases, each at five different levels of nonexceedance probability. Each of the probability levels relates to an entire 30-40 year synthetic hydrologic record and the four year low flow period is selected from each of those levels, therefore the actual probability of the inflows used in the model is in the range of 3-5%. The nine cases are defined by combinations of 0°, 2° and 4° C temperature increases and 0 and ±10% precipitation change. These changes allow the program to interpret variations in the operation of the system which could be specifically attributed to the defined climate change cases. Interpretation of the results places emphasis on risk analysis and worst case scenarios for drought in terms of impacts on Lake Granby synthetic inflows and end of month storage volumes, Adams Tunnel transfers and power generation. The results indicate that it might be possible to define firm energy as approximately 40% of average. The model meets 100% of the stated average or most probable supply condition deliveries except for specific cases with -10% precipitation which exhibit failure to meet average deliveries at all probability levels.

A sudden rise of impedance during ischemia is supposed to indicate the closure of gap junctions. Although similar effects on energy state do exist at low temperature, the impact of glycogen on the electrical impedance under storage conditions has still to be evaluated. Therefore, in a model with protected porcine livers, we examined the intraischemic effects of a preischemic glucose and potassium feeding on impedance changes, lactate production and ATP-content at a storing temperature of 5°C. Impedance was measured both in the low frequency α- and the higher frequency β-dispersion range. In addition, the same parameters were determined in a group of unprotected livers. In this group all animals had received glucose and potassium orally prior to ischemia. Whereas in case of preischemic glucose feeding the rise of impedance in the range of the β-dispersion (e.g. 5 kHz) roughly coincided with the exhaustion of ATP, the corresponding impedance changes in the protected group without a glucose premedication only occured when glycolysis had already stopped and ATP had reached basal values for some hours. In contrast, in the α-dispersion range the impedance changes in the latter group just began at the time when ATP became exhausted and lactate production ceased. A similar temporal dissociation between α- and β-dispersion of impedance also became evident in unprotected livers despite their higher glycogen content. Ouite in accordance with literature reports and former own results on the energy dependency of bleb formation and based on preliminary morphological results from the present experiments we introduce the hypothesis that the main factor for the energy-correlated disappearance of the α-dispersion is an increase of membrane conductance which again - at least in part - might be induced by membrane stretching in the course of bleb formation.",,"gap junction protein; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; impedance; liver ischemia; liver transplantation; low temperature procedures; nonhuman; organ preservation; swine; Adenine Nucleotides; Animal; Energy Metabolism; Hypothermia, Induced; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Liver Circulation; Liver Glycogen; Liver Transplantation; Membrane Potentials; Organ Preservation; Oxygen Consumption; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Swine; Tissue Survival",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027276661

To achieve these objectives, OCRWM plans to institute a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)-approved security program at its facilities including the Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility. This program will safeguard nuclear information and provide not only for the physical protection of facilities but also for the nuclear material being handled and stored. Several key regulatory issues were identified during the development of the safeguards and security (S&S) program for the MRS. These issues relate to developing a realistic definition of the security threat at the MRS and establishing a single set of regulatory requirements. Resolution of these issues is important to implementing a realistic S&S program whose scope is commensurate with the potential risk at the MRS and complies with all appropriate regulatory requirements. OCRWM is working toward a timely resolution of these issues and on the formulation of an S&S program for implementation at the MRS. As an initial step, DOE has proposed an S&S strategy for the MRS based on a set of assumed resolutions to the key regulatory issues. With this approach, the facility designers will be able to evaluate possible S&S concepts for integration into the MRS early in the design process.",,"Geological repositories; Management; Nuclear industry; Nuclear materials safeguards; Radioactive materials; Radioactive waste disposal; Rocks; Safe handling; Monitored retrievable storage facilities; Nuclear facilities security; Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027274489

In conjunction with the use of the forecast model, a reservoir operational model was also developed. Based on the forecast streamflow from each sub-area and utility's energy demand, the operational model will predict the hourly and average daily lake water level, daily generated energy, lake water level at the end of forecast period, and the total energy generated during the forecast period.

What should be the average throughput for spent nuclear fuel? How much lag storage capacity will be needed? Where are the potential bottlenecks for waste handling at the repository? How many shifts per day should the repository operate? Computer models can be developed which accurately simulate the proposed operations at hypothetical repositories. However, as with most complex computer models, only a very few people, other than the model developers, would be able to understand the model's logic and its simulated results. In a program such as the Department of Energy's (DOE) Civilian Radioactive Waste Management program, where public understanding and acceptance are so important, new ways must be found to simplify the mathematical maze of complex results. Through the explanatory power of computer animation, these shortcomings can be overcome. Back in the early 1980's, a computer simulation model was developed for analyzing the waste handling operations at a hypothetical nuclear waste repository. Although the model is based on the material flow and process times contained in the Conceptual Reference Repository Description (CRRD), an early generic repository design, it is still quite capable of answering many 'what if' types of questions concerning nuclear waste handling operations. Basically, the model tracks the movement of spent nuclear fuel and transuranic waste from their initial receipt at the repository to their ultimate emplacement underground. What sets this model apart from other repository simulation models is its computer animation capability. A computer-generated film, which was produced from the model output, was shown in the hope of stimulating a renewed interest in using computer simulation and animation to support repository design.",,"Computer applications; Computer simulation; Films; Photographic films; Radioactive waste disposal; Computer generated films; Nuclear waste repositories; Repository operations; Geological repositories",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027274347

DLE has been observed in a suspension of aggregated Chl. It was shown that the intensity and decay rate of DLE from aggregated Chl depend on several factors, such as the intensity and duration of illumination, the presence of electron donors and acceptors, and the presence of deaggregating reagents. Of special interest is the fact that not only do unilluminated pheophytin, Chlb, and carotenoids have effects on the DLE from aggregated Chla, but the illuminated pigments can also induce DLE from unilluminated aggregated Chla, although no DLE can be detected after illumination. These phenomena can be used to probe energy storage and transfer between aggregated Chl and other photosynthetic pigments. By injecting solutions of carotene having various concentrations, illuminated at different light intensities, and for different durations into cuvettes containing aggregated Chl in the dark chamber, a group of DLE curves is obtained. © 1993, Elsevier Inc.

The light was transmitted via a 600 μm bare fibre and adjusted to an energy density of 3.5J/cm2. The acoustic signals generated by the laser pulse were measured with two types of hydrophones consisting of polyvinylidenefluoride with active diameters of 0.3 mm and 0.5 mm and recorded on a dual channel digital storage oscilloscope using either a 0.5 m coaxial cable or a broadband fibre‐optic transmission system. Tissue was retrieved from nine cadaver human aortas and macroscopically classified as either normal or calcified atherosclerotic plaque. Histological analysis (Haematoxylin eosin, elastica van Gieson, and immunohistochemical staining) was carried out after the experiments to verify the macroscopic diagnosis and to correlate the acoustic responses with the tissue characteristics. For normal arterial wall, maximum peak pressure was 1.28 MPa ± 0.85 MPa, rise time 163 ns ± 43 ns, and pressure increase 8,2k Pa ± 5,4k Pa/ns. For calcified, atheromatous segments, a maximum peak pressure of 2,02 MPa ± 1,16 MPa, a rise time of 69,9 ns ± 25,8 ns, and a pressure increase of 32,3 kPa ± 21,3 kPa/ns was found. Statistical analysis showed a significant shorter rise time (P &lt; 0.0001) and a higher pressure increase (P &lt; 0.0001) for calcified tissue in comparison to normal arterial wall, whereas maximum pressures alone did not allow a differentiation of tissue characteristics. Several hundred kPa are generated during Excimer laser ablation. The results suggest that focal tissue fragmentation is one mechanism of plaque ablation. A differentiation of tissue characteristics is possible by analysis of rise time and pressure increase, potentially providing the possibility of acoustic ablation control. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Most metabolic myopathies (like glycogenoses and mitochondrial myopathies) are related to inborn errors of muscle energy metabolism and often present clinically as exercise intolerance (inability to sustain normal exercise). We investigated whether the previously observed absence of normal exercise-induced variation in the T2 of muscle in McArdle's disease (a metabolic myopathy caused by muscle phosphorylase deficiency) was specific for this disease and whether the variations in T2 could be used for screening patients suspected of having metabolic myopathy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Exercise-induced variations in proton MR signal and in intracellular pH were studied in the forearm flexor muscles of nine healthy subjects and 49 patients with exercise intolerance due to muscle pain, suggesting a metabolic myopathy. The relative increase in T2, ΔT2/T2, was measured from MR spin- echo images before and after exercise. Phosphocreatine (used as a control of the degree of exercise) and intracellular pH were measured from phosphorus- 31 spectra before and during exercise. The progressive 4.5-min handgrip exercise reached maximal exertion capability at the end of exercise and decreased phosphocreatine to less than 50% of its rest value. RESULTS. Variations in T2 and end-exercise pH were correlated. The nine healthy subjects showed a ΔT2/T2 ranging from +19% to +44% (but little T1 variation). Ten patients with McArdle's disease showed only slight ΔT2/T2 (0-10%). There was no overlap with values for healthy subjects, but there was some with values for other patients. Of the 21 subjects with a ΔT2/T2 less than 19%, 19 had a metabolic myopathy. The other two had a congenital neuromuscular disorder (one central core disease, one nemaline myopathy) with type I fiber predominance (type I muscle fibers are characterized by a high oxidative metabolism and a low lactic acid production). CONCLUSION. The altered increase in T2 was sensitive but not specific for McArdle's disease. However, as variations in T2 reflect variations in pH, they seem to be specific for myopathies in which there is little exercise-induced decrease in pH (some metabolic myopathies and congenital neuromuscular disorders with type I fiber predominance) among patients in whom exercise intolerance is the main symptom. Our results suggest that MR imaging might be useful as a screening test for these diseases.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; exercise; exercise tolerance; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; inborn error of metabolism; male; myopathy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pH; priority journal; screening test",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027259214

In disorders such as diabetes, adipocyte function is markedly altered. In this study, we investigated the effect of pioglitazone, a novel antidiabetic agent known to lower plasma glucose in animal models of diabetes mellitus, on cellular differentiation and expression of adipose-specific genes. Treatment of confluent 3T3-F442A preadipocyte cultures for 7 days with pioglitazone (Pio; 1 μM) and insulin (Ins; 0.17 μM) resulted in &gt;95% cell differentiation into lipid- accumulating adipocytes in comparison with 60-80% cell differentiation by treatment with either agent alone. Analysis of triglyceride accumulation showed increases of triglyceride content over time above untreated preadipocytes by treatment of the cells with Ins, Pio, and especially with Ins + Pio. Basal glucose transport, as measured by cellular uptake of 2- deoxy-D-[14C]glucose, was likewise enhanced in a time-dependent manner by treatment of preadipocytes with Ins, Pio, or Ins + Pio, such that a synergistic effect resulted from the combined treatment with both agents. It was further determined that RNA transcript abundance for genes encoding glucose transporters GLUT-1 and GLUT-4, as well as the adipose-specific genes encoding adipsin and aP2, were increased by the Ins, Pio, or Ins + Pio treatment. Taken together, these findings indicate that pioglitazone is a potent adipogenic agent. By promoting differentiation, this agent may move cells into a state active for glucose uptake, storage, and metabolism.","glucose transporter; hypoglycemic drug; triglyceride","adipsin; antidiabetic agent; carbon 14; deoxyglucose; glucose; glucose transporter; insulin; messenger RNA; pioglitazone; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell differentiation; controlled study; drug effect; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; glucose transport; glucose utilization; lipid storage; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; Northern blotting; priority journal; RNA transcription; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027256247

North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7400, United States","In the suckling rat, chick embryo, and hibernating marmot, fatty acids provide the major source of energy, and despite the high rate of hepatic β- oxidation, these animals selectively retain long-chain polyunsaturated derivatives of C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3. To determine whether the hepatic microsomal activity monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) (EC 2.3.1.22) could provide a mechanism to selectively acylate monoacylglycerols that contain essential fatty acids, we tested the ability of MGAT activity from each of the three species to acylate sn-2-monoC18:1-, sn-2-mono-C18:2-, sn- 2-monoC18:3-, and sn-2-monoC20:4-glycerols. Hepatic MGAT activity acylated sn-2-monoC18:3-glycerol and sn-2-monoC18:2-glycerol in preference to sn-2- monoC18:1-glycerol in each of the three different lipolytic animals. MGAT's acyl group specificity could not be explained by invoking differences in membrane fluidity because the apparent affinity for sn-2-monoC20:4-glycerol was not increased. Further, sn-2-monoC18:3-glycerol remained a preferred substrate under assay conditions when both the C18:3 and C18:1 species were present in equal amounts. As would be predicted in the presence of high activity of a selective MGAT, the hepatic glycerolipids from neonatal rats showed increases in dienoic, trienoic, and C22:6 fatty acids and relative decreases in monoenoic, saturated, and C20:4 fatty acids. We hypothesize that, during lipolysis, the reacylation of sn-2-monoacylglycerols by MGAT may provide a mechanism by which essential fatty acids are retained within specific tissues.","acylglycerols; essential fatty acids; fasting; hibernation; lipolysis","acyltransferase; essential fatty acid; monoacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; chick embryo; controlled study; embryo; fatty acid oxidation; food deprivation; hibernation; lipid storage; lipolysis; liver microsome metabolism; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Sciuridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027254878

We measured ATP level (using high-performance liquid chromatography), energy charge, and lactate level during 2 hours of normothermic ischemia in deflated lung tissue (n = 6), in lung tissue inflated with room air (n = 6), and in lung tissue inflated with 100% oxygen (n = 6). To determine the onset of anaerobic metabolism in lung issue inflated with 100% O2, ATP and lactate levels were measured in another group (n = 6) during 8 hours of normothermic ischemia. Rabbit lungs were flushed in situ with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (60 mL/kg). They were isolated and immersed in 0.9% Nacl at 37 °C. In deflated lung tissue, ATP level (control value, 9.4 ± 0.58 μmol/g dry wt) decreased and lactate level (control value, 5.6 ± 1.16 μmol/g dry wt) increased after 15 minutes of ischemia (ATP, 5.2 ± 0.86 μmol/g dry wt; lactate, 13.3 ± 1.58 μmol/g dry wt). When the lung was stored inflated with room air, ATP breakdown and increase of lactate concentration only occurred after 90 minutes of normothermic ischemia (at 60 minutes: ATP, 8.0 ± 0.58 μmol/g dry wt; lactate, 6.3 ± 1.1 μmol/g dry wt). In lungs stored inflated with 100% O2, ATP breakdown and lactate accumulation only occurred after 5 hours of normothermic ischemia (at 4 hours: ATP, 8.1 ± 0.74 μmol/g dry wt; lactate, 5.9 ± 1.28 μmol/g dry wt). These data suggest that the breakdown of ATP and the onset of anaerobic metabolism in lung tissue is related to the alveolar oxygen concentration during storage, and that in the isolated inflated lung, aerobic metabolism continues for 4 hours even when perfusion has stopped. © 1993.",,"adenosine triphosphate; lactic acid; anaerobic metabolism; animal experiment; article; catabolism; controlled study; ischemia; lung transplantation; nonhuman; organ preservation; oxygen concentration; priority journal; rabbit; Adenosine Triphosphate; Air; Anaerobiosis; Animal; Body Temperature; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Comparative Study; Energy Metabolism; Half-Life; Hypoxanthine; Hypoxanthines; Ischemia; Lactates; Lung; Organ Preservation; Oxygen; Rabbits; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027252776

The Vapor Jet System utilizes a pressurized stream of produced water to serve as the operating medium for a jet pump (also known as a venturi, eductor or ejector). The potential energy (pressure) of the produced water stream is converted to kinetic energy (velocity) in the jet pump. The high velocity water stream entrains the near atmospheric pressured vapors and returns them to the facility's low pressure system for separation and sale. The water is returned to the water tankage for further degassing and reuse, disposal or waterflood injection purposes. The Vapor Jet System is simple, cost effective and virtually maintenance free when compared to the small conventional vapor recovery units (VRU's) in use in the industry today. The Vapor Jet System is ideally suited for facilities with hydrocarbon vapor volumes too small to economically justify conventional vapor recovery systems. The Vapor Jet System will operate at weather minimum volume level emission control is desired. The Vapor Jet System can be installed for 50% of the cost of the small conventional VRU and realize significant savings in operating expenses over the conventional VRU.",,"Economics; Environmental protection; Jets; Oil well flooding; Vapors; Vapor jet system; Vapor recovery; Vapor recovery technology; Enhanced recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027246912

Further, it was postulated that the ATP-actin polymer was more rigid due to storage of the energy released by ATP hydrolysis during polymerization (Janmey et al. 1990. Nature 347:95–99). Electron micrographs of our preparations of ADP-actin and ATP-actin polymers show no major differences in appearance of the filaments. Moreover, the dynamic viscosity parameters G' and G"" measured for ATP-actin and ADP-actin polymers are very different from those reported by Janmey et al., in absolute value, in relative differences, and in frequency dependence. We suggest that the relatively small differences observed between ATP-actin and ADP-actin polymer rheological parameters could be due to small differences either in flexibility or, more probably, in filament lengths. We have measured nucleotide exchange on ATP-actin and ADP-actin polymers by incorporation of alpha-32P-ATP and found it to be very slow, in agreement with earlier literature reports, and in contradiction to the faster exchange rates reported by Janmey et al. This exchange rate is much too slow to cause ""reversal"" of ADP-actin polymer ATP-actin polymer as reported by Janmey et al. Thus our results do not support the notion that the energy of actin-bound ATP hydrolysis is trapped in and significantly modifies the actin polymer structure. © 1993, The Biophysical Society.

Another group of rats had 6.5% of the lard replaced by ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The rats were fed these diets for 6-8 weeks. Body weight gain was similar for the two groups and absorption of fat was complete in animals fed both types of fatty acids. Indirect calorimetric measurements, after 3-5 weeks on these diets, by continuous registration of O2 consumption and CO2 formation showed no difference in mean energy expenditure during the experimental period. However, the mean respiratory quotient (RQ) was significantly increased for animals fed the n-3 fatty acid-supplemented diet. This was noted both under fasting conditions and after receiving a test meal of similar fatty acid composition for both feeding groups. Thus, mean substrate utilization demonstrated reduced oxidation of fat and increased oxidation of carbohydrate, during fasting as well as fed periods for the n-3 fatty acid group as compared to the lard group. After an additional 2-3 weeks, blood plasma, liver, and muscle samples were collected, and adipocytes and hepatocytes were isolated. Reduced postprandial plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol, phospholipids, unesterified fatty acids, and glycerol were promoted by the n-3 fatty acid diet as compared to lard. Plasma concentration of glucose was slightly increased, and liver and muscle content of glycogen were decreased in the n-3 fatty acid-fed rats. Experiments with isolated adipocytes showed decreased basal lipolysis after feeding n-3 fatty acids for 6-8 weeks for suspended epididymal adipocytes, whereas stimulated lipolysis by isoproterenol (0.1 μM) was higher in both epididymal and mesenteric adipocytes from rats fed n-3 fatty acids as compared to animals fed lard. In addition, epididymal adipocytes from rats fed n-3 fatty acids were significantly smaller than cells from animals fed lard. Hepatic peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation was significantly higher for n-3 fatty acid-supplemented animals, but total fatty acid oxidation was similar in both dietary groups. The hepatic content of triacylglycerol and phospholipids was similar for both diets. These results demonstrate that n-3 fatty acid replacement of a high- fat diet containing mostly saturates and monoenes for several weeks promotes reduced use of fat as energy source. This may be explained by decreased plasma concentration of unesterified fatty acids. Along with reduced plasma concentration of glycerol, our data could be interpreted as reduced lipolysis. These changes in plasma lipids may promote reduced triacylglycerol storage in certain adipose tissues, as well as decreased fatty acid availability to the liver for synthesis and secretion of VLDL, and increased carbohydrate utilization.","adipocytes; DHA; EPA; indirect calorimetry; respiratory quotient","carbohydrate; docosahexaenoic acid; glucose; glycogen; icosapentaenoic acid; triacylglycerol; very long chain fatty acid; adipocyte; animal cell; animal tissue; article; calorimetry; cell size; controlled study; diet supplementation; energy expenditure; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; glucose blood level; glycogen liver level; glycogen muscle level; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipolysis; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; respiratory quotient; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Calorimetry, Indirect; Carbohydrates; Comparative Study; Dietary Fats; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Lipids; Liver; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen Consumption; Phospholipids; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027240172

The new ceramic high-temperature superconductors have the advantage that they can be cooled in a far simpler way with liquid nitrogen.

Such vents exist in enclosed regions such as rooms and energy storage and ventilation systems. It is important to understand the basic nature of the transport processes that arise because of finite, nonzero density and pressure differences that usually exist across such vents. The flow is driven by these two mechanisms and very complicated flow patterns arise, depending on the governing variables in the problem. For instance, a dominant pressure effect results in a unidirectional flow, whereas significant buoyancy effects lead to a bidirectional flow exchange. The heat and mass transfer associated with the flow is similarly strongly influenced by the flow regime. There is a strong need for visualization to determine if a unidirectional or a bidirectional flow exists across the vent and to study the basic characteristics of the transport processes involved. This paper presents a study of this heat and mass transfer problem employing water and air as the fluid media for two different experimental systems. Pure and saline water are used in the first case to obtain the unstably stratified circumstance with a pressure difference across the vent. Air at different temperature levels is used in the second case. A laser sheet, with smoke, is used for visualization in air and a shadowgraph for water. Other visualization techniques are also used to obtain qualitative and quantitative results on the flow direction, transport rates and the relevant mechanisms. Since transient effects are important in many cases, video recordings are employed to obtain the frequency of observed oscillations in the transport and for determining the transition from one regime to the other. Visualization is crucial to the understanding of these processes and to the determination of the transport regime under various operating conditions.",,"Density (specific gravity); Flow of fluids; Flow visualization; Mass transfer; Oscillations; Pressure effects; Stability; Thermal effects; Transients; Ventilation; Vents; Video recording; Buoyancy; Flow direction; Flow patterns; Flow regimes; Horizontal vents; Transport rates; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027235274

This package was designed to allow complex designs to be put into modulus containing two or more integrated circuits mounted on ceramic substrates that have several routing layers. The PolyHIC package evaluated here was designed for use on multilayer printed circuit boards in a telecommunications central office environment with an intended life of 25 years. Early in the design phase, two potential reliability issues were identified and addressed; mechanical shock resistance, and thermal fatigue performance. This paper describes the analyses and tests used to evaluate the long term surface mount attachment reliability of the polyHIC package. Mechanical shock resistance was predicted by analysis and verified by mechanical shock testing. The polyHIC has a large thermal expansion mismatch with the bare printed circuit board due to the ceramic substrate and heat sink metals. The combination of this mismatch and the polyHIC's large size resulted in significantly higher solder joint strains during thermal cycling than in smaller Plastic Quad Flat Pack (PQFP) and Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC) packages. thermal cycling life predictions made using the figure of Merit Model predicted failures would occur very early in the design life due to environmental stress testing, transportation, and storage environments. Preliminary small sample thermal cycling tests showed much greater solder joint fatigue life than predicted. A complete thermal cycling test was then performed to characterize the long term attachment reliability. Using acceleration factors based on solder joint strain energies induced by global and local thermal expansion mismatches during temperature cycling, the experimental results were extrapolated to design use conditions and failure rates were predicted. The poyHIC was found to have adequate attachment reliability for its intended application. It was apparent that the figure of merit model was entirely too conservative at life predictions for this type of component. This led to the development of the new Comprehensive Surface Mount Reliability (CSMR) model (presented in a companion paper by Clech, Manock, Noctor, Bader and Augis).",,"Electronic equipment manufacture; Electronics packaging; Failure analysis; Fatigue of materials; Integrated circuits; Reliability; Surface mount technology; Testing; Comprehensive surface mount reliability model; Figure of Merit; Premolded polyHIC package; Solder joint attachment reliability; Soldered joints",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027229898

Efficient functioning as an energy source dictates that lipids must be transportable in the plasma from the point of synthesis and assembly to the storage depots and finally to the tissues to provide energy through oxidative metabolism. Complex lipid forms are transported through the plasma as lipoprotein particles. These particles, secreted from the intestine and liver, have a nonpolar core consisting of triglycerides and cholesterol esters and a polar outer surface composed of cholesterol, phospholipids, and apolipoproteins. Apolipoproteins are essential for the production, secretion, and continued structural integrity of the various lipoprotein particles and thus play a pivotal role in the control mechanisms of lipid transport. Apolipoproteins regulate specific enzyme activities and modulate plasma lipoprotein clearance through receptor- mediated processes. Quantitative information regarding the rates of synthesis and catabolism of apolipoproteins is vital to an understanding of their metabolism in health and disease. General considerations are followed by a specific use of stable-isotope methodology to quantitate the rate of synthesis of very-low-density-lipoprotein apolipoprotein B-100 (VLDL apo B- 100) in control and familial-combined-hyperlipidemic (FCHL) patients.","apolipoproteins; familial combined hyperlipidemia; Lipoproteins; stable isotopes","apolipoprotein; stable isotope; very low density lipoprotein; conference paper; energy consumption; enzyme regulation; hyperlipoproteinemia; lipid transport; lipoprotein blood level; lipoprotein metabolism; plasma clearance; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027225149

The response of the material to hot deformation is simulated by adding recrystallization nuclei and stored energy continuously with time. The simulations presented in this work use an energy storage rate procedure that models stage III hardening in metals and thereby incorporates both work hardening and dynamic recovery. This model reproduces many features found recently by Rollett et al. in a more simple model that did not include an explicit dynamic softening mechanism. It is found, that the type of work hardening law ssumed results in relationships between transient and steady state crystallization parameters which more closely approach those observed in physical experiments.

On the first day of life, AGA and SGA infants had the same weight and total body water content. At 6±2 days (mean ± SD), AGA infants had had significant weight loss (94±45 gm) and body water loss (67±80 ml), whereas weight and total body water content in the SGA infants at the same age (5±1 days) did not differ from the values at birth. Loss of weight and total body water in AGA infants was accompanied by a greater diuresis than in SGA infants at the same amount of fluid intake. At the end of week 1, AGA and SGA infants had the same total energy expenditure (184±33 vs 171±17 kJ·kg-1·day-1); energy intake, which had exceeded total energy expenditure from the third day of life and beyond, already provided 188±46 (AGA) or 209±109 kJ·kg-1·day-1 (SGA), respectively, for energy storage. Nitrogen balance was positive. Subsequent weight gain occurred at the same rate in AGA and SGA infants; both total body water and solids increased. Energy intake, total energy expenditure, and the amount of energy stored (measured during stable weight gain on a regimen of full enteral feedings) had significantly increased compared with week 1, but both groups maintained similar energy storage. We conclude that the initial weight loss in infants is caused by a contraction of body water that does not occur in SGA infants; both groups have a subsequent weight gain at the same rate, with similar proportional increase in total body water and solids. © 1993 Mosby-Year Book, Inc.",,"article; body water; body weight; controlled study; energy expenditure; human; intrauterine growth retardation; newborn; prematurity; priority journal; small for date infant; weight gain; weight reduction; Body Composition; Body Fluids; Body Weight; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fetal Growth Retardation; Human; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Longitudinal Studies; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Weight Gain; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027219440

These improved cryosections gave images comparable to those from conventional plastic sections. They were thin enough (≤1.0 elastic mean free path) to use established dark-field techniques, modified for thickness-dependent nonlinearities, to measure the dry mass fraction of individual organells, and hence to deduce their water content. Digital STEM imaging in combination with electron and X-ray spectroscopy has important biological applications, as illustrated by studies on calcium regulation in Purkinje neurons. Calcium concentrations per unit dry weight of dendritic compartments were determined by the peak/continuum method of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), which necessarily overstates elemental concentrations because of beam-induced mass loss. The dry mass content of organelles at low dose and the percentage of dry mass retained after analysis at high dose were as follows: mitochondria (46.0 g dry mass/100 g hydrated mass, 67% mass retained); endoplasmic reticulum (27.9 g/100 g, 57%); and cytoplasm (16.3 g/100 g, 41%). These values were used to correct elemental concentrations for mass loss. Results indicated that the major calcium storage organelle in Purkinje cell dendrites is the endoplasmic reticulum, of which there are two types distinguished by their levels of calcium. Parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy of dendritic organelles corroborated EDXS measurements, with an improved sensitivity that indicates the feasibility of quantitative calcium mapping. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027219096

Using red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) tonoplast vesicles, rates of substrate-dependent H+ transport were estimated by (I) a mathematical model describing the time course of ΔpH formation, (II) the rate of H+ leakage following H+ pump inhibition at a steady state ΔpH, and (III) the initial rate of alkalinization of the external medium. When compared with rates of substrate hydrolysis measured under identical conditions, all three methods yielded an H+/ATP stoichiometry of 2 while the H+/PPi stoichiometry was determined to be 1 using methods I and II. Experimental limitations did not permit an analysis of the H+/PPi, stoichiometry by method III. From these results and the estimated level of substrate and product typically found in the cytoplasm of plant cells, it is suggested that the H+-ATPase and H+-PPase as primary H+-pumps are poised toward net substrate hydrolysis under in vivo conditions thereby operating in parallel to generate a proton electrochemical gradient across the tonoplast. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; phosphatase; animal cell; article; energy transfer; enzyme activity; enzyme substrate; hydrolysis; insect; nonhuman; priority journal; stoichiometry; Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone; Cell Membrane; Edetic Acid; Electrochemistry; Energy Metabolism; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Plants; Potassium Chloride; Proton Pumps; Proton-Translocating ATPases; Protons; Pyrophosphatases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Valinomycin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027218604

The drug is dissolved in an organic solvent and a water‐soluble surfactant is dissolved in water. These two solutions are mixed to form an emulsion in which the organic solution is emulsified into small droplets in the aqueous phase. The surfactant decreases the interfacial tension between the water and the organic solution, and thus increases the ease of emulsification, and stabilizes the droplets formed against aggregation or coalescence. The final step includes removal of the organic solvent by evaporation. The drug precipitates and one particle is formed from each droplet. If the surfactant is sufficiently effective in stabilizing the particles formed against coagulation, a suspension of small spherical drug particles is formed. A model system consisting of cholesteryl acetate and toluene is described. Particles with a diameter as low as 50 nm were obtained. The particle size was dependent on the surfactant concentration and on the emulsification energy.

The stability of metronidazole in solutions containing propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol 400 was also investigated. The reaction order for metronidazole in these aqueous and solvent systems followed pseudo‐first‐order degradation kinetics. The degradation rate of metronidazole was invariant under various total buffer concentrations at each specific pH within the investigated pH range. These results indicate that no general acid/base catalysis imposed by acetate, phosphate, and borate buffer species is responsible for the degradation of metronidazole. The catalytic rate constants for hydrogen ion, water, and hydroxyl ion for the degradation of metronidazole were 6.11 x 10−5 M/s, 3.54 x 10−8 L/s, and 4.10 x 10−3 M/s, respectively. The pH‐rate profile shows a pH‐independent region of pH 3.9–6.6. Maximum stability of metronidazole was at pH 5.6 under zero total buffer species conditions. The ionic strength effect on metronidazole degradation in acetate and phosphate buffers followed the modified Debye‐Huckel equation well. The Arrhenius plot showing the temperature dependence of metronidazole degradation indicates estimates of activation energy of 15.35 kcal/mol and a half‐life of 963 h at room temperature in 0.1 M pH 3.1 acetate buffer solution (ionic strength = 0.5). Irradiation with UV light (254 nm) of the metronidazole solutions (pH 3.1 acetate buffer) accelerated degradation in comparison with light‐protected samples. Incorporation of propylene glycol into the metronidazole solution at pH 3.1 increased stability; however, an adverse effect on the stability of metronidazole was seen when polyethylene glycol 400 solvent system was used.

Rats were fed for 4 wk on high-fat (HF) diets (20% fat) containing very low (L), medium (M), and high (H) amounts of n-3 PUFA but similar amounts of saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA. A fourth group was fed a standard laboratory diet (control group) to estimate changes in adipose tissue mass related to growth. At the end of the dietary treatment, the lipid mass (LM) of the four major adipose depots (subcutaneous, SC; mesenteric, MES; retroperitoneal, RP; epididymal, EPI) and total adiposity were significantly higher in each of the three HF groups than in the control group. The lipid gain in EPI was due to fat cell hypertrophy alone, whereas RP showed both hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Energy intake, fatty acid excretion, and body mass were the same in the three groups fed HF diets. Similarly, there was no difference in the LM or in lipid gains specifically caused by HF feeding of SC and MES between the HF groups. In contrast, the LM of RP was significantly lower in the H than in the L and M groups (50 and 30%, respectively). The LM of EPI was also 30% lower in the H than in the L group. The lipid gains specifically caused by HF feeding were 2.5- and 5-fold lower in the H than in the M and L groups, respectively, for RP and 2-fold lower in the H than in the L group for EPI. Lower RP and EPI LM in the H and, to a lesser extent, M groups were related to reduced hypertrophy, since fat cell numbers were the same. RP hyperplasia induced by HF feeding was maintained in rats fed the H diet. Plasma triglycerides were markedly depressed in rats fed the H and M diets compared with the L group, and they correlated positively with the fat cell size in RP and EPI. In growing rats fed HF diets, n-3 PUFA from fish oils limit the hypertrophy of two abdominal adipose tissues (RP and EPI) but do not affect other major depots or hyperplasia in RP. This regional effect seems dose dependent and is possibly mediated through a lowering in circulating triglycerides.","dietary fatty acids; fat cell number; fat cell size; fatty acid digestibility; obesity; plasma triglycerides; regional adiposity","fish oil; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body mass; caloric intake; cell count; cell hyperplasia; controlled study; drug effect; epididymis fat; hypertrophy; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mesentery; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; retroperitoneum; subcutaneous fat; triacylglycerol blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027215407

A new Spent Fuel and HLW Technology Development program was subsequently initiated to develop technologies for immobilizing ICPP spent fuels and HLW for disposal, in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The Program elements include Systems Analysis, Graphite Fuel Disposal, Other spent Fuel Disposal, Sodium-Bearing Liquid Waste Processing, Calcine Immobilization, and Metal Recycle/Waste Minimization. This paper presents an overview of the ICPP radioactive wastes and current spent fuels, with an emphasis on the description of HLW and spent fuels requiring repository disposal.",,"Chemical plants; Geological repositories; Nuclear reactors; Spent fuels; Chemical processing plants; Defense spent fuel disposal; High level radioactive wastes; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027206185

During the heating season waste heat is recovered from the condenser to assist in heating the building. The results for the ice storage system with heat recovery are compared to the results for the base building. The base building uses a conventional cooling system with electrically heated hot water for heating. The Building Loads Analysis and System Thermodynamics (BLAST) energy analysis program is used for part of this analysis. This program performs the detailed hourly energy analysis for a prototypical office building. The hourly chilled and hot water demand calculated by BLAST is input into separate ice storage simulation programs, with and without heat recovery, to determine how the energy use is affected by different control strategies. BLAST and the ice storage programs are executed for four representative locations throughout the United States. The operating costs for each system in all locations are estimated using four different rate structures to assess the effect of high demand charges and time of day usage charges. In general, the energy consumption for ice storage systems without heat recovery is higher than conventional systems, but operating costs are lower assuming a time-variant rate structure. The effectiveness of heat recovery is highly dependent on location and whether or not hot storage is used.

The study, which is composed of both full-scale experiments in an outdoor test room and computer simulations, had the following objectives: 1. investigation of the performance of an electric floor radiant heating system with thermal storage, and 2. development of control strategies for reduced operational costs of radiant heating systems using thermal storage. A detailed thermal model of a zone with a floor heating system was employed for this study to determine improved control strategies through simulation. The simultaneous effects of these strategies on thermal comfort and energy efficiency were tested under various weather conditions to improve building operation. Conventional and improved control strategies were implemented in a series of experiments performed in an outdoor test room with a computer-controlled floor heating system with thermal storage. Analysis of the results led to the following significant observations and conclusions (for an electric floor heating system): 1. Proportional control results in improved thermal performance of the system with thermal storage compared to on/off control; on/off control causes much cycling of the system and possibly overheating. 2. Use of simple thermostat setpoint night setback (square wave set-profile) contributes to energy conservation but often leads to a high increase (over 100%) in the peak heating load on cold days. Thus, a smoother setpoint profile is desirable with a ramp change in the setpoint, particularly for buildings with thermal storage. The ramping rate of the setpoint required to limit the maximum heating load to the capacity of the heating system depends on the amount of thermal storage used and may be determined from simulations.",,"Computer simulation; Costs; Floors; Heat storage; On-off control systems; Proportional control systems; Radiant heating; Thermostats; Electric floor heating system; Thermostat setpoint night setback; Electric heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027204365

The power circuit of this BES system is simple, since only one current-forced subharmonic PWM switching converter is used. The precise current control is achieved by applying feedforward control. If the utility power is off, the BES system operates in the inverter mode to supply power to the load. A sinusoidal output voltage with low distortion and good regulation is obtained by using instantaneous voltage control and average voltage control techniques. When the utility power recovers, the BES system minimises the power from the utility to the load in the peak load period. Conversely, the power from the BES system is minimised in the medium load period. During the off-peak load period, the utility supplies power to the load and also charges the battery bank. In addition to real power conditioning, the BES system can also compensate the load reactive and harmonic powers. Thus the current waveform and the power factor on the utility grid are much improved. The modelling, design and implementation of the proposed controllers are described and some experimental results are given to show the performance of this BES system. © 1993, The Institution of Electrical Engineers.

Increased efficiency of pushoff in the Seattle Ankle/Lite Foot exists as evidenced by the decrease loading on the opposite limb during double support and a less shortened step length on the sound side compared to the SACH foot. The natural frequency of oscillation for the prosthetic feet was determined to be too high to provide energy storage and release synchronized with kinematic requirements because neither metabolic cost savings nor differences in metabolic efficiency were found.

The uptake of glucose was measured as a function of time and;or the external glucose concentration on cells grown at high or low growth rate with glucose either as growth rate-limiting substrate, or present in excess.Glucose uptake as a function of its external concentration could be described as consisting of two components (1) a rapid equilibration owing to facilitated diffusion, followed by (2) a much slower uptake that involves an enzymatic component. This slower accumulation of label could be explained as the conversion of glucose into metabolites and a storage carbohydrate. Uptake experiments in the presence of inhibitors indicated that the conversion of glucose was an energy dependent process.

Magnesium is an essential cofactor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions, including those responsible for the production, storage, and use of energy. It influences impulse generation and action potential propagation of the cardiac and pacemaker cells and affects muscular contraction within the myocardium and arterial smooth muscle. Magnesium has been used successfully for the treatment of arrhythmias and has been shown to produce hemodynamic changes including suppression of vasospasm and reduction of vascular resistance. In clinical trials to assess the usefulness of intravenous magnesium in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, several beneficial effects were found, including a smaller mean infarction size, a reduction in the occurrence of supraventricular tachycardia, fewer occurrences of serious ventricular arrhythmias, and a lower incidence of early mortality. A bolus dose of magnesium followed by a prolonged infusion to maintain elevated serum magnesium levels appears necessary to obtain the beneficial effects. Studies indicate that magnesium may reduce the incidence of early mortality after acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism of action is still unclear, but it may be a direct cardioprotective effect.","Cardiac drugs; Magnesium; Mechanism of action; Myocardial infarction","calcium chloride; gluconate calcium; magnesium chloride; magnesium sulfate; acute heart infarction; antiarrhythmic activity; bolus injection; drug effect; drug infusion; drug mechanism; gastrointestinal symptom; heart infarction size; heart protection; heart ventricle arrhythmia; human; hypotension; intravenous drug administration; magnesium blood level; nonhuman; priority journal; respiration depression; review; supraventricular tachycardia; Hemodynamics; Human; Magnesium; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Randomized Controlled Trials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027194153

On this thought a model of the organ of Corti (OoC) is developed in which (in every cross section) the tectorial membrane (TM) is considered to consist of two stiff segments connected by a hinge. Movements of the TM then induce movements of the fluid contained in the inner spiral sulcus (ISS) and the fluid dynamics of the sulcus will play an important part in restraining the top ends of the hair cells. Since the model is meant to reflect low-level phenomena, it is conceived as linear. For simplicity, it operates in the long-wave mode. The sulcus is considered as a narrow channel that is closed at both ends. Since the sulcus fluid is an independent energy-storage element of the system, the entire cochlear model, consisting of two main fluid channels, the organ of Corti (OoC), the three-element TM and the sulcus, and equipped with motile OHCs, can be described by a fourth-order differential equation, with four boundary conditions. It is shown that the model can ideally produce response curves that reflect more than 40 dB of cochlear gain. When the actual effect of the sulcus is taken into account, however, the maximum gain is reduced to approximately 30 dB.

We tested the hypothesis that the variability of this ratio may be related to differences in skeletal muscle metabolism. Since lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a pivotal role in partitioning lipoprotein-borne triglycerides to adipose (storage) and skeletal muscle (mostly oxidation), we postulated that a low ratio of fat/CHO oxidation was associated with a low skeletal muscle LPL (SMLPL) activity. As an index of substrate oxidation, 24-h RQ was measured under sedentary and eucaloric conditions in 16 healthy nondiabetic Pima males. During a 6-h euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp, muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline, 3, and 6 h. Heparin-elutable SMLPL activity was 2.92±0.56 nmol free fatty acids/g · min (mean±SD) at baseline, was unchanged (2.91±0.51) at the third hour, and increased significantly (P < 0.05) to 3.13±0.57 at the sixth hour of the clamp.

Similar measurements were made for a common screen-film system. The s(b)/p values for the IPs were 0.05-3.80.

This technique may predict the eventual recovery of regional function more accurately than assessment of myocardial blood flow. Considerations for assessing myocardial viability exists for both FDG and palmitate in myocardial reperfusion. The degree of glucose utilization in reperfused myocardium depends on the nutritional state, the level of circulating free fatty acids, insulin levels, and glycogen stores. C-11 Palmitate clearance does not only depend on the oxidation of free fatty acid but is influenced by the size of the free fatty acid and triglyceride pools, palmitate incorporation into triglycerides, and the rate of subsequent triglyceride utilization. Conclusions with regard to metabolic imaging during reperfusion are influenced by the duration of ischemia preceding reperfusion and the radiotracer. With myocardial stunning after relatively brief periods of ischemia, free fatty oxidation may return promptly to at least control levels and indicate myocardial viability. With more prolonged ischemia associated with some degree of myocardial infarction, the heart may have decreased palmitate clearance but increased FDG, indicating residual viable myocardium. The assessment of overall myocardial energy utilization cannot be measured by any one particular labeled substrate. The influence of endogenous storage pools, the effect of back diffusion on clearance curves, and the inability of PET to distinguish the various substrate metabolites contribute to these limitations. The assessment of myocardial oxygen consumption with C-11 acetate PET imaging is an approach in the future that offers promise for the assessment of regional oxygen utilization. Acetyl CoA is the result of multiple biochemical processes before oxidation in the mitochondria. The latter may account for the ability of this radionuclide to be independent of changes in substrate utilization. The myocardial turnover-rate constant of C-11 acetate is not altered by changes in myocardial substrate utilization or plasma substrate concentrations. Efforts to provide an overall index of oxidative metabolism may be helpful and potentially accomplished using C-11 acetate. A comprehensive noninvasive metabolic index of myocardial metabolic reserve may provide a meaningful index of viable myocardium and the degree to which functional recovery may be expected to return. An accurate marker of myocardial oxidative flux will allow a more accurate assessment of those interventions used within the acute clinical setting aimed at limiting myocardial injury.",,"acetic acid c 11; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; palmitic acid c 11; animal model; conference paper; controlled study; dog; heart muscle metabolism; heart muscle reperfusion; intravenous drug administration; positron emission tomography; Animal; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial Reperfusion; Palmitates; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027164111

The rapeseed oil diets increased the cardiac triacylglycerol content 5-fold and 25-fold, respectively, above control values. Hearts were removed from the animals and perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37°C. The calculated rate-pressure product was used as a measure of contractile function. 31P NMR spectra were acquired throughout a protocol that consisted of 12 min control perfusion, followed by 12 min perfusion with 20 μM isoproterenol, 12 min washout, 12 min total global ischemia, and 28 min reperfusion. The steady state levels of creatine phosphate, ATP, intracellular pH, contractile function, and the free energy of ATP hydrolysis (ΔG(ATP)) were determined for all three groups of hearts. Isoproterenol more than doubled the rate-pressure product of the hearts on all diets and decreased the concentrations of creatine phosphate and ATP with a concomitant rise in Pi. After global ischemia, creatine phosphate levels recovered fully, ATP levels remained low, and most hearts developed ventricular fibrillation. Changes in intracellular pH were the same for all groups: pH was 7.1 throughout the equilibration and isoproterenol perfusion period, decreased to pH ~6.4 during ischemia, and returned to 7.0 during reperfusion. The results indicate that the fat accumulation that occurs in the hearts of rats fed diets rich in high erucic acid rapeseed oil does not interfere with the cardiac high energy phosphate metabolism or contractile function.

Surprisingly, the Gibbs free energy of unfolding increased ∼ 30% by acidification. pH titration of insulin's conformational stability is described by a transition involving a single proton with an apparent pKa of 7.0. The acid stabilization of insulin's conformation was attributed to the protonation of histidine at position 5 on the B-chain (HB5) as determined by 1H-NMR of the histidines, selective amino acid alteration, and enthalpies of ionization. Further acidification (at least to pH 2) does not decrease the free energy of unfolding. A conformational change in the tertiary structure, as indicated by the near-UV circular dichroism spectrum, accompanies this change in stability.

Remarkably, the effect of chronic low dose glucocorticoid in muscle is vastly different, although it may induce changes in muscle glycogen metabolism as evidenced in animal experimental trials. However, there is no clear confirmation that these changes could develop similarly in patients. We evaluate clinical, functional, histological and metabolic muscle changes during chronic low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in 11 asthmatic patients. Remarkably, these patients did not develop clinical symptoms of myopathy nor significant muscle weakness or morphological changes in muscle histology. However, glycogen concentration and the activity of the main regulatory enzymes of glycogen metabolism, aldolase and creatine kinase were modified in comparison with controls. An increase in the synthesis and muscle cell deposition of glycogen and a decrease in the muscle glycogen degradation process have been suggested. These changes were not related with malnutrition. There was not correlation between histological and biochemical changes. We conclude that chronic treatment with glucocorticoid causes clear changes in glycogen metabolism in the skeletal muscle, resulting in glycogen muscle storage. The significance of these biochemical changes is unknown, but it can be well an associated phenomenon with glucocorticoid treatment. © 1993.","Glucocorticoid; Glycogen; Glycogen metabolism; Glycogen phosphorylase; Glycogen synthase; Steroid myopathy; Type 2 fiber atrophy","glucocorticoid; glycogen; prednisone; adult; aged; article; asthma; clinical article; controlled study; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; male; myopathy; oral drug administration; priority journal; Adult; Aged; Alanine Transaminase; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Asthma; Creatine Kinase; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase; Glycogen; Glycogen Synthase; Human; Isoenzymes; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Middle Age; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Proteins; Muscles; Phosphorylases; Prednisone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027162164

HPLC analysis after 3 months revealed the formation of a 1,4 Michael addition adduct in each case. No additional degradation products were detected. To pursue a less interactive formulation, 5 mg formulation equivalent mixtures of seproxetine maleate hemi-hydrate were prepared with pregelatinized starch, lactose, and talc; thus, three distinctly different excipient classifications. These were evaluated in additional isothermal stress experiments at 25°C, 40°C, and 50°C. The results indicated that each excipient interacted with the drug in a unique chemically and thermally dependent manner. Thus, the drug-pregelatinized starch data may be represented by an Arrhenius type relationship, with activation energy of 32 kcal/mol, and formation of the previously described adduct. However, the drug-lactose data suggest reaction with an impurity in which the equilibrium is temperature dependent. Finally, the drug-talc data correspond to either sigmoid kinetics or a threshold temperature which must be exceeded for formation of an amide.

However, comparing the energetics of a running shoe cushioning system with other passive energy exchange mechanisms in the running athlete suggests that the potential benefits of energy return are limited. The energetics of running shoe cushioning systems have been studied using a multiple-element, non-linear viscoelastic model to analyse the effect on the shoe of plantar pressure distributions recorded in vivo. The running shoe is a net dissipator of energy but small quantities of strain energy, of the order of 10J, are stored and recovered during a running step. The actual energy exchanges depend on the cushioning material properties and the runner's plantar pressure distribution. Energy storage and recovery occurs throughout the step in different regions of the shoe midsole. Energy dissipation is confined almost entirely, both spatially and temporally, to the impact phase of ground contact. Thus the proportion of input energy recovered from the shoe is higher than that predicted by mechanical tests which simulate only the impact phase of the step. Energy storage and recovery in the model shoe are large enough to have local effects on the energetics of the foot and lower leg but modest when compared with passive energy transfer within and between body segments or strain energy storage and recovery in the the lower limb. Similarly, differences in the energy dissipated by well-designed shoes are predicted to be small and unlikely to have a direct effect on the energetics of the body as a whole. The possibility of indirect, kinematically mediated effects remains open, however. © 1993.",,"Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Kinematics; Mathematical models; Pressure measurement; Product design; Sporting goods; Strain; Athletic shoes; Elastic energy storage; Plantar pressure distribution; Running shoe cushioning system; Biped locomotion; conference paper; energy recovery; energy resource; energy transfer; materials; nonlinear system; physical model; physical performance; pressure measurement; running; shoe; sports medicine; viscoelasticity; Biomechanics; Energy Metabolism; Energy Transfer; Human; Running; Shoes; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027155927

Although FO fats ate slightly less total energy than the other groups, there were no differences among groups in body weight at any time during the study. However, body composition, the composition of depot triglyceride, body fat distribution and insulin resistance were all influenced by the type of fat in the diet.

The bichromophoric molecules are composed of an aromatic ring connected by two methylene chains to an α-diketone moiety. Both the absorption and emission spectra of these compounds can be attributed to a superposition of the individual spectra of the separate chromophores. The critical transfer radia for electronic energy transfer from the aromatic (donor) chromophore to the α-diketone (acceptor) chromophore was calculated from the spectral overlap between the fluorescence spectrum of the aromatic ring with the absorption spectrum of the α-diketone chromophore. The results show that this series of molecules is well suited for a mechanistic study of short-range intramolecular electronic energy transfer (intra-EET). The temperature and the molecular structure dependence of the intra-EET efficiency in this series was measured and analyzed for both singlet-singlet and triplet-triplet routes. The results show that the transfer efficiency is strongly temperature and structure dependent, indicating that exchange interaction is responsible for intra-EET between close chromophores in a bichromophoric molecule. The relative contributions of interchromophoric distance and that of the relative orientation of the two chromophores to exchange interaction are discussed.",,"Data processing; Mathematical models; Molecular structure; Optical data storage; Optical properties; Bichromophoric molecules; Exchange interaction; Intramolecular electronic energy transfer; Macrocyclic systems; Spectral properties; Transfer efficiency; Optical materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027146821

Moreover, the intracellular energy status of the extracted rat liver was measured by 31P-NMR spectroscopy, and the results were compared with those of measurement of the electrical bio-impedance. The electrical bio-impedance was measured continuously over 6 h by a 4-electrode method, at temperatures of 2, 20, 25, 30 and 36°C, in six liver samples extracted from male Wistar rats. The resistance of the extracellular fluid (Re) increased rapidly after the rat livers were extracted, and decreased slowly. The Re value reached a peak after about 13 min at 36°C, and then decreased slowly, becoming constant after 3 h. There was a negative functional correlation between the Re Tmax and the storage temperature at the time (R=–0.973, 0.001). The capacitance of the cell membrane (Cm) showed a similar pattern of change to the Re value, and a negative correlation was also seen between these times and the storage temperature 0.969, p<0.001). Measurement of the 31P-NMR spectra at room temperature showed that the peak level of β-ATP decreased rapidly after the livers were extracted, and β-ATP could no longer be detected at 20 min after extraction. Inorganic phosphate (P1) increased after extraction, with the P1 peak shifted to the right. The intracellular pH declined gradually to acidosis. The findings in this experiment that the Re and Cm value increased up to a certain time after establishment of an ischemic condition indicated that their increases might reflect increases in the resistance of the extracellular fluid due to a reduction in the volume of extracellular fluid and an increase in the volume of the cellular membrane due to cell enlargement. There was a correlation between the results of measurement of the 31P-NMR spectra and the variation in the electrical bio-impedance with the passage of time. © 1993, Japanese Society for Medical and Biological Engineering.

Measurements of the Emerson enhancement of photosynthetic O2 evolution and the flash-induced reduction of the oxidized reaction center pigment of photosystem I demonstrated that selective denaturation of photosystem II in potato leaves started at a 'low' temperature of 32°C. Analysis of the characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence induction in sub- and super-saturating light revealed two targets of mild heat stress: (i) an irreversible inhibition of electron donation to PSII and (ii) a reversible reduction of excitation energy trapping by the PSII reaction centers, with the former effect being identified as the major determinant of the loss of photosynthesis. A second phase of thermal denuration of photosystem II occurred at temperatures higher than around 38°C, resulting in a dramatic loss of PSII-mediated electron transport. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence decay kinetics after short and long flashes of intense light indicated that high temperatures up to 42°C had no inhibitory effect on the acceptor side of photosystem II: the rate of electron transfer from the primary (QA) to the secondary (QB) electron acceptor of photosystem II and the fraction of QB-non-reducing photosystem-II centers remained unchanged whereas the intersystem electron flow appeared to be stimulated. It was also observed that photosystem-I photochemistry, as probed by the photochemical energy storage in far-red light, the quantum yield of photosystem I for the Emerson effect and the kinetics of P700 photooxidation by strong far-red light, was fully preserved in heat-treated potato leaves (at least, up to 45°C). From the presented data, one can propose the following sequence of events leading to the loss of photosynthetic electron transport in heated potato leaves: inhibition of water splitting (at leaf temperatures higher than 32°C)&lt; reduced efficiency of energy trapping by photosystem II centers &lt; alteration of the electron flow after QA ( &gt; 42°C) &lt; PSI ( &gt; 45°C). © 1993.","Electron transport; Heat stress; Photosynthesis; Photosystems I and II; Solanum tuberosum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027140792

Patients with GSD are usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, poor physical growth, and a deranged biochemical profile. Dietary therapies have been devised to use the available alternative metabolic pathways to compensate for disturbed glycogenolysis in GSD I (glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency), GSD III (debrancher enzyme deficiency), GSD VI (phosphorylase deficiency, which is less common), GSD IX (phosphorylase kinase deficiency), and GSD IV (brancher enzyme deficiency). In GSD I, glucose-6-phosphate cannot be dephosphorylated to free glucose. Managing this condition entails overnight continuous gastric high-carbohydrate feedings; frequent daytime feedings with energy distributed as 65% carbohydrate, 10% to 15% protein, and 25% fat; and supplements of uncooked cornstarch. In GSD III, though glycogenolysis is impeded, gluconeogenesis is enhanced to help maintain endogenous glucose production. In contrast to treatment for GSD I, advocated treatment for GSD III comprises frequent high-protein feedings during the day and a high-protein snack at night; energy is distributed as 45% carbohydrate, 25% protein, and 30% fat. Patients with GSD IV, VI, and IX have benefited from high-protein diets similar to that recommended for patients with GSD III. © 1993 The American Dietetic Association.",,"glucose 6 phosphatase; glycogen; liver enzyme; phosphorylase; phosphorylase kinase; starch; caloric intake; child nutrition; clinical feature; diet therapy; enzyme deficiency; genetic disorder; glycogen metabolism; glycogen storage disease; glycogen storage disease type 1; glycogen storage disease type 3; glycogen storage disease type 4; glycogen storage disease type 6; human; liver disease; onset age; review; Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Child, Preschool; Dietary Proteins; Enteral Nutrition; Glycogen Storage Disease; Glycogen Storage Disease Type I; Glycogen Storage Disease Type III; Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV; Glycogen Storage Disease Type VI; Human; Hypoglycemia; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Phosphorylase Kinase; Starch; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027133542

An intense modulated driving beam from the electron-positron booster (BEP), a storage ring, will be used to excite a nonlinear plasma wave in a dense plasma (n=1015 cm-3). Important advantages of this beam are its very low emittance (10-8 cm rad in the vertical direction), high energy (850 MeV), and high intensity ( 1012 particles). A new technique for modulating this beam at a submillimeter wavelength is proposed. A simple numerical code has been developed to simulate the plasma wave excitation with plasma nonlinearity and with three-dimensional effects taken into account.

This energy accounts for the work of lifting and accelerating the ejected mass as well as a significant amount left in the open magnetic field created by the ejection. It is pointed out that the total energy cannot be stored in the pre-eruption corona entirely in the form of force-free electric currents, based on a plausible magnetohydrodynamic conjecture of Aly. Storage in the form of cross-field electric currents held in equilibrium by pressure and gravitational forces seems possible, in particular if these currents are associated with closed magnetic fluxes entirely detached from the atmospheric base. The implications and physical issues of these results for the mass ejection are discussed, leading to several suggestions for future study. © 1993.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011311298

The primary motivation behind this review is to introduce the different areas involved, paying special attention to their interfaces. First, the optical non-linearities in semiconductor materials, semiconductor microstructures and photorefractive materials are introduced. For the semiconductors we discuss the third-order non-linear susceptibilities due to virtual transitions (e.g., bound electrons in intrinsic semiconductors and non-linear motion and energy relaxation of free carriers in doped semiconductors) and due to real transitions (e.g. valence-to-conduction-band transitions, free-carrier transitions, impurity transitions and transitions in excitons and excitonic complexes). Recent advances in engineering semiconductor microstructures are discussed and shown to enhance their third-order non-linear optical susceptibilities in comparison with the bulk semiconductors. The mechanism of the photorefractive effect is next introduced and analyzed in conjunction with several engineering approaches to enhance the performances of the photorefractive non-linearities (e.g., non-stationary recording, multiphoton excitation, combination of the photorefractive effect with the electrorefractive non-linearities near the band edge, etc.). Using the photorefractive materials as an example, we define a set of figures of merit based on the requirements from the optical devices for system applications. Using these figures of merit we evaluate and discuss the optimization of different photorefractive materials: ferroelectric oxides (e.g., LiNbO3, BaTiO3, KNbO3, tungsten bronze family, etc.), compound semiconductors (e.g., GaAs, GaP, InP, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, etc.), silenites (e.g., Bi12SiO20, Bi12GeO20), and ceramics. Finally, the applications of non-linear optical materials are discussed using the photorefractive materials as an example. Two types of devices are distinguished: passive devices that are based on volume holographic storage of information and active devices that are based on continuous two-wave and four-wave mixing of optical information carrying waves. These devices are evaluated and their optimization is discussed in conjunction with applications to analog and digital optical signal processing and computing. Examples of analog (e.g., inverse filter and linear algebra processor) and digital (e.g., parallel access optical memories and reconfigurable interconnects) optical computing applications will be also discussed. © 1993.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006861207

The body weight, epididymal and perirenal fat depot weights and glycerol 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase activity also increased with the energy intake, whereas the lactate dehydrogenase activity remained almost constant in all energy intake groups. These results suggest that the PAGF in fat depots functions in response to energy intake and contributes to the de novo formation of adipocytes and the growth of adipose tissue.

The latter behave as electric field intensifiers and are used to enhance the third order nonlinear optical response of the composite films. In chiral media, it or TM modes launched in the waveguides produce polarized Raman scattering that exhibits a complex dependence on the sample preparation conditions. Fractal aggregates of metallic nanoparticles confer unique properties on the optical response of the composite. The cubic optical nonlinearity of the fractal composites is evaluated by quadratic electrooptic phase modulation. χ(3) is enhanced by a factor of 1O in the wings of the extinction spectrum, far from the maximum associated with plasma resonances of individual metal particles. The enhancement is essentially dispersionless in the low energy region of the extinction spectrum of the composite. A fast d-electron response in the metal is thought to be responsible for the enhancement effect. Similarly, enhanced Raman scattering is observed from fractal-guides of blends of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) diluted in poly(vinylalcohol).

Tissue hydration increased with the length of the starvation period, reaching a new steady state after 4-5 weeks. Total protein concentration remained constant at about 60% of dry body mass. The concentration of glycogen decreased during food deprivation, a new steady state being reached at about 30% of control values after 4 weeks. Refeeding caused a dramatic increase of glycogen concentration which exceeded the value in fed controls by 6- to 9-fold. This is seen as a tactic for rapid storage of food energy, to be used later for the synthesis of body materials. With respect to their responses to food deprivation the 12 enzymes investigated formed four groups: (1) activity unaffected by food deprivation or refeeding (COX, THIOL, CK, GOT); (2) activity drops to about 60% of control value during the initial phase of food deprivation but remains constant thereafter (PK, LDH, Pase); (3) slow but continuous decrease in activity during the whole period of starvation, i.e. up to 7 weeks (PFK, OGDH, CS, FBPase); (4) activity increases during food deprivation, decreases again upon refeeding (GPT).

The main goal of this study was a preliminary evaluation of this kind of storage. Allowing for a large uncertainty in the geological properties, we arrived at the following tentative results. The average cost of disposal is $1.4 per ton CO2 stored. The enclosing layer of most aquifers seems impermeable enough to prevent the CO2 from rising to the surface within at least 10 000 years. The main technical uncertainty is whether the water in the reservoir can be pushed aside fast enough to prevent an intolerable pressure build-up in the reservoir. The disposal of CO2 in aquifers seems to be a feasible option in the light of existing geological knowledge. If it is a practical possibility, the opportunities are large and the costs appear to be relatively low. However, uncertainties remain in the technical sphere. These uncertainties have to be studied and dispelled before the disposal of CO2 in aquifers can be said to be called technically feasible. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002742969

It is first shown that the only field that may possibly be an energy minimizer in ℋ is the unique (and therefore axisymmetric) constant-α force-free field Bα contained in that set. Thus it is proved that B α minimizes the energy indeed if and only if 0≤\H\ ≤HC&lt; ∞, where Hc is an estimated critical value. For Hc&lt; \H\ &lt; ∞, on the contrary, it is possible to construct in ℋ nonaxisymmetric fields with an energy smaller than that of Bα and no minimum energy state does exist. However, B α still minimizes the energy for Hc &lt; \H\ ≤ Hcax (with possibly Hcax = ∞) if attention is restricted to the axisymmetric fields of ℋ. These results are used to put a limit on the validity of a popular model of the heating of the solar corona, in which the field of a coronal structure is supposed to release sporadically, by Taylor's relaxation, a part of the energy it continuously extracts from the kinetic energy of the photospheric motions. It is argued that, as a consequence of the results above, one of the basic assumptions of the model breaks down when the field becomes highly sheared. It is speculated that, in such a situation, a completely new regime should set up, in which helicity and energy are continuously ejected at large distances by the system. © 1993 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002154041

Above a dilute limit, sensitivity and time resolution are enhanced with the increase in brilliance, detector effeciency and focusing capability. It is shown that a multipole wiggler and multi-element solid state detector improve both sensitivity and time resolution by an order of magnitude. Applications to structural studies of dilute systems, in particular, surface and interfaces are presented. A ""tunable"" X-ray undulator inserted in an ultra-low (<10 nrad) emittance storage ring, which covers a hard X-ray (4-30 keV) region using the fundamental and third higher harmonic radiations, further improves the present limitations on sensitivity and resolutions in time, space and energy. Feasibility of a variable gap/bandpath undulator combined with new quick scanning techniques for applications in time-resolved studies is discussed. By optimizing an undulator band width for a scan, without varying undulator gap, XAFS is obtained by simple scanning of monochromator (Q-scan I). A new quick scanning technique for time-resolved studies on dilute systems based on an energy dispersive geometry (Q-scan II) is proposed. Design considerations of a ""tunable"" X-ray undulator XAFS beamline at SPring-8 are presented, in which either a high flux or a microfocus high energy resolution beam is obtained by a fixed-exit double-axis (2+2) crystal monochromator followed by crossed eliptical mirrors.

At 274 K, the optimal material is a porous carbon of pore size sufficient to contain two adsorbed layers of methane. At 500 psi (3.4 MPa), the energy density of such a material at 274 K is only a quarter that of gasoline.

Both are created from 'natural capital' (i.e., environmental resources) for the better exploitation of natural capital, promoting net energy flow from the environment to the owner. Current human economic behavior differs from that of non-human organisms in the following ways: 1. 1. Large-scale and quasi-irreversible transformation of natural capital into tools, toys and weapons designed further to speed up this very process. 2. 2. Extensive use of exosomatic energy to fuel such transformation, and to subsidize ecologically non-sustainable economic practices. 3. 3. Storage of energy reserves overwhelmingly exosomatically and not as food, including the accumulation of weapons arsenals. 4. 4. Bequeathing of energy stores, tools, and weapons beyond one generation, leading to the accumulation of wealth and power, which further promote resource transformation. 5. 5. Succesful channeling of interspecific energy interactions between humans and other organisms so as to benefit almost exclusively humans. 6. 6. Standardization of intraspecific energy interactions so as to be reciprocal in the form of business deals. 7. 7. Regulation of intraspecific competition by social agreements such as licenses, tariffs, insurance, pensions, etc. 8. 8. Use and storage of money as a symbol of energy credit in reciprocal intraspecific transactions. 9. 9. Debt, i.e., delayed reciprocity, with unharvested natural capital as the ultimate collateral. 10. 10. Practice of and belief in open-ended economic growth as a solution to economic injustice. In a nutshell, humans are characterized by (1) exploding their economic interactions (i.e., the transformation of natural to man-made capital and its use, storage, accumulation and transmission to the next generation) into the exosomatic sphere; (2) standardizing net energy flow (largely one-way interspecific, and reciprocal intraspecific); and finally by (3) debt which, as today's sale of tomorrow's yet unharvested and unowned natural capital, temporarily stretches the world's carrying capacity while irreversibly corrupting its foundations. © 1993.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001485561

The AES, XPS, and TPD spectra of thick layers of Li vapor deposited on clean polycrystalline silver (Ag(poly)) foils exposed to up to 100 langmuirs of TDF at room temperature showed no evidence for features other than those associated with clean Li/Ag(poly) surfaces. This indicates that the sticking coefficient of (gaseous) TDF on Li at ca. 300 K is negligibly small. Clearly defined C(1s) and O(1s) XPS features were observed, however, for submonolayer coverages of TDF (θ(TDF) &lt; 1) on Li/Ag(poly), obtained by first condensing a thick layer of TDF below 140 K and later gently warming the specimen to ca. 300 K. The binding energies of these peaks were smaller than those observed for condensed TDF recorded at ca. 135 K, for which the features were identical to those found for θ(TDF) &lt; 1 on bare Ag(poly) at the same temperature. The m/e = 48 TPD spectra of TDF condensed on Ag(poly) yielded for θ(TDF) &lt; 1 a well-defined peak centered in the range 210-240 K, a temperature much higher than that associated with the desorption of bulklike TDF (ca. 170 K). Very similar results were obtained for experiments involving Li/Ag(poly) surfaces, except that the m/e = 48 peak was broader and slightly shifted to higher temperatures. The fragmentation patterns of adsorbed TDF (either on Ag(poly) or Li/Ag(poly)) were consistent with cyclopropane and formaldehyde as the most likely thermally desorbed species. Unlike the behavior observed for TDF/Ag(poly) for which no TPD features were detected for T &gt; 300 K, the m/e = 4 TPD spectra for TDF/Li/Ag(poly) displayed a prominent peak centered at about 600 K attributed to D2 generated by the thermal decomposition of LiD.

For the simulation, the usual method uses causality resistors to insure integral causality to energy storage elements. The choice of those resistors is quite arbitrary and can lead to stiff systems. We propose, for linear systems, an approach without such resistors. When components lose the integral causality, the order of the state vector changes, provoking the use of pulse variables.

A correction vector method for the computation of linear and nonlinear optical properties of π-conjugated systems has been devised for use with a singly and doubly excited configuration interaction model (SDCI). The SOS approach and the correction vector method are equivalent when the same basis set of many-electron configurations is used in both. It has been verified that the values obtained from the correction vector method and by direct summation over eigenstates are identical. The correction vector method has been found to be very efficient for larger systems, both in terms of central processing unit (CPU) time and storage requirements. The direct SOS summation has been used to study the approach to the final SDCI values as excited states are added in order of increasing energy. Using the methods described in the previous paragraph, a study of the polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities for frequency doubling and tripling in unsubstituted polyenes and in amino-, nitro-, donor/acceptor substituted polyenes, and 4-nitroaniline (pNA) has been made. The basis set has been restricted to singly and doubly excited configurations between π orbitale (πSDCI) which have been extracted from the ground state obtained from a complete neglect of differential overlap (CNDO) calculation. The results are found to be in good agreement with other values reported in literature. They also show that the full πSDCI hyperpolarizabilities of the polyenes are largely accounted for by the contributions of a small number of low-lying excited states, tending to justify the use of simplified models such as the two and three state models in these systems. © 1993 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000754380

An organic and a clay soil stored for 3 yr at room temperature showed low ATP concentrations (0.36 and 0.26 nmol g-1, respectively) which markedly increased after moistening both soils; this indicates that the prolonged storage did not eliminate the capacity of ATP synthesis by these soils; in the organic soil bacteria and fungi were unaffected by moistening while only bacterial counts were increased in the clay soil. By moistening soil with NaN3 solution the ATP increase was annulled in the organic soil and only reduced in the clay soil. Air-drying a sandy clay-loam soil resulted in a 40% drop in ATP while microbial counts were unaffected; rewetting the air-dried soil to 50% of the water holding capacity (WHC) did not increase ATP. Decrease in the ATP content was more marked when moistened or rewetted soils rather than fresh or airdried soils were fumigated; the fumigation of soils moistened with the NaN3 solution generally decreased the ATP concentration. Sodium azide generally decreased recoveries of ATP, ADP and AMP especially in the organic soil; the effect of the inhibitor on enzymatic conversion of AMP to ADP and of ADP to ATP was also investigated in the soil extracts. Adenylate energy charge (AEC) values of moist field samples were 0.65, 0.70 and 0.80 for clay, sandy-clay loam and organic soils, respectively. Air-drying moist soils caused a marked drop in ATP and RNA and an increase in ADP, AMP and total adenine nucleotides. The AEC value of CHC13 fumigated fresh moist soil were very low ranging from 0.06 to 0.1 thus indicating a large prevalance of dead cells even if the bacterial numbers by plate count were moderately affected. © 1993.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000729015

For a 7.29-MeV Be+9 beam with an initial longitudinal temperature of 2700 K, the main characteristics of laser cooling in a storage ring are discussed. When undamped, the transverse betatron oscillations of the coasting ions limit the longitudinal temperature after laser cooling to typically 1 K. After damping the transverse motion by precooling the ions with an electron cooler, longitudinal temperatures of below 30 mK have been obtained in the subsequent laser cooling. In this case, the longitudinal ion-beam temperature can be understood as an equilibrium of the laser cooling rate with the heating rate due to intrabeam scattering. Moreover, single binary Coulomb collisions between the (still transversely hot) ions can cause such longitudinal velocity changes that ions are lost out of the critical capture range of the laser cooling force. In these two ways, intrabeam scattering imposes a substantial limit on the temperature or number of laser cooled ions in a storage ring. In our experiments, this process presently limits the ratio between the density-dependent Coulomb energy and the longitudinal thermal energy spread to a value on the order of 1, where liquid rather than gaseous behavior of the ion beam is expected to set in. © 1993 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000715091

This concentration is assumed to achieve physical properties under 1 atmosphere similar to those of solution VS4 used under 1000 atmospheres. The thermal range and the kinetics of nucleation and crystal growth are investigated by DSC through different thermal treatments. It is found that the nucleation thermal range is below - 90°C and that of crystal growth is above -85°C for a relatively long experimental time. The nucleation density is also studied through direct observations by cryomicroscopy and is related to the amount of crystallization calorimetrically recorded. The effect of storage below the glass transition shows the possibility of a slow increase in nucleation below the glass transition, as already observed by other authors for different aqueous solutions. Isothermal crystallization is analyzed within the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model for temperatures above -75°C. The corresponding samples have been cooled and warmed at the same rate of 40°C/min and calculations give, at constant nuclei numbers, an activation energy of 9.3 ± 0.3 kcal/mol and the Avrami exponent n = 2.2 ± 0.05. This shows a two-dimensional crystal growth as observed by cryomicroscopy. The estimated critical warming rate relevant to the preservation of rabbit kidneys by vitrification is 270° C/min with or without an increase in the nucleus density during storage.

Hence, the ideal recording material must possess adequate spectral sensitivity at the wavelengths of present day high power lasers and permit the desired shift of the operating wavelength by means of process control. The material should manifest a predictable diffraction efficiency as a function of the layer fabrication technique, of the exposure, and of the development process and display high spatial resolution and low noise.

The processing of the film after exposure is a sequence of chemical reactions and physical treatments.

In previous work, we showed that the generalized minimal residual (GMRes) algorithm is sometimes competitive in terms of computer time with direct methods for these dense matrices, even when complex-valued boundary conditions are used, leading to non-Hermitian matrices. This paper presents a preconditioning scheme to accelerate convergence and improve performance. We block the potential energy coupling into a series of distortion blocks, and we employ the outgoing wave variational principle with nonorthogonal basis functions, including both dynamically adapted Green's functions for the distortion blocks and also square integrable functions. The coefficient matrix of the resulting linear system couples the blocks. We have found that preconditioners formed from diagonal blocks of the coefficient matrix corresponding to the distortion blocks and vibrational blocks are effective at accelerating the iterative method in every test case, by factors of 2.9-20, with an average speedup of a factor of 6.5. The storage requirements and computational efficiency of the new scheme compare favorably to those for preconditioners based on banded matrices of variable bandwidth. The new preconditioners yield converged transition probabilities in less computer time than a direct solver even in cases which do not converge in a reasonable amount of time without preconditioning, and the average speedup compared to the direct solution is a factor of 7.6. © 1993 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000207929

H3C 3J7, Canada","We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy levels of polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation. The method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions in each of f dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more than cf+1 multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates. Choosing a (potential optimized) discrete variable representation (DVR) in each dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal. The rate-determining step is now the multiplication of a vector by the kinetic energy matrix and c is effectively (with rare exceptions) at most two. The nf+1 scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed second derivative operators. The method is directly applicable to any three-atom and any nonlinear four-atom molecule. We use a variety of coordinate systems (Jacobi, Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond), for which the total number of factorizable terms in the exact kinetic energy operator is never large, to calculate very well-converged band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1, of Hf up to 18 000 cm-1, and of CH2O up to 5700 cm -1; and low-lying levels of H2O2. The results for CH2O are new, and those for H3 + clarify the causes of discrepancies in published work. The product basis results in very large matrices (up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the cost is within an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis approaches using explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis approaches are molecule and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to apply the DVR-Lanczos method to all the examples presented here with a single computer program. The principal advantage of our method is thus its generality, and in this context it is efficient, with the cost scaling slowly with basis size. It is also easily parallelized. &amp;copy; 1993 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000112124

The importance of elastic deformation and storage of elastic energy is stressed. Different terms are suggested in order to differentiate between experimentally observed relations between joint angle and torque that are likely to have different nature. A review of studies measuring stiffness of joint subcomponents and intact joints is presented. We suggest to either abandon the term 'joint stiffness' as misleading or to state up front stiffness of which of the joint components or subsystems is analyzed in each particular study. We also suggest that each study of 'joint stiffness' should clearly state to what extent the results are defined by the system's properties and to what extent they are reflections of the particular experimental procedure. © 1993.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000111499

Infants aged 6-12 months are a major group of weaning food consumers. Their energy and protein requirements were used as a starting point to develop a strategy for the home or small-industrial scale manufacture of weaning foods. In addition such food must have an 'easy-to-swallow' consistency, and be microbiologically safe when consumed. On the other hand the level of anti-nutritional factors must be minimised. Ingredients must be locally available and acceptable. These would usually include a staple cereal or starchy tuber. The protein quantity and quality of the product can be optimised by adding legumes (beans, pulses) on the basis of their lysine content. Major problems to be solved include the bulkiness caused by starch gelatinisation and removal of the anti-nutritional factors which occur naturally in legumes. In addition, limited facilities for food preparation and storage allow contamination and rapid proliferation of micro-organisms which create risks of food-borne illness including diarrhoea. Several simple technologies are traditionally employed for the processing of cereals, tubers and legumes. These include roasting, germination and fermentation. Since these treatments have different effects on the quality characteristics of the final product, a combination of operations would therefore be a promising approach to optimise product quality at a minimum cost. © 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000003890
