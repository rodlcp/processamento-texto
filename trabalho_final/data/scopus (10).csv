This experiment, called ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-Ray Imaging Sensors), consists of six compact normal-incidence telescopes. ALEXIS will operate in the 70 - 110 eV band. The ultrasoft X-ray/EUV band is nearly uncharted territory for astrophysics. ALEXIS, with its wide fields-of-view and well-defined wavelength bands, will complement the upcoming NASA Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer and ROSAT EUV Wide Field Camera, which are sensitive broadzband survey experiments. The program objectives of ALEXIS are to 1) demonstrate the feasibility of a wide field-of-view, normal incidence ultrasoft X-ray telescope system and 2) to determine ultrasoft X-ray backgrounds in the space environment. As a dividend, ALEXIS will pursue the following scientific objectives: 1) to map the diffuse background, with unprecedented angular resolution, in several emission line bands, 2) to perform a 3-color survey of point sources, 3) to search for transient phenomena in the ultrasoft X-ray band, and 4) to provide synoptic monitoring of variable ultrasoft X-ray sources such as cataclysmic variables and flare stars. The six ALEXIS telescopes are arranged in pairs to cover three 40° fields-of-view. During each spin of the satellite, ALEXIS will monitor more than half the sky. Each telescope consists of a layered synthetic microstructure (LSM) mirror, a curved microchannel plate detector, background-rejecting filters and magnets, and readout electronics. The mirrors will be tuned to 72 eV, 85 eV, and 95 or 107 eV bands, chosen to select and deselect interesting line features in the diffuse background. The geometric area of each ALEXIS telescope will be about 15 cm2. The telescopes employ spherical mirrors with the curved detector at prime focus and are limited by spherical aberration to a resolution of about 1°. Assuming nominal reflectivities, quantum efficiency, and filter transmission, the 5σ survey sensitivity will be about 2 × 10-3 photons cm-2 s-1 for line emission at the center of the bandpass. ALEXIS is designed to be flown on a small autonomous payload carrier (a minisat) that could be launched from either a Shuttle Get-Away-Special Can or from an expendable launch vehicle. The experiment weighs 100 pounds, draws 40 watts, and produces 10 kbps of data. It can be flown in any low Earth orbit. Onboard data storage allows operation and tracking from a single ground station at Los Alamos. © 1988 SPIE.",,"Aspherics; Astrophysics; Digital storage; Mirrors; NASA; Orbits; Surveys; Telescopes; Cataclysmic variables; Expendable launch vehicles; Extreme Ultraviolet; Sandia National Laboratories; Satellite technology; Scientific objectives; Spherical aberrations; Transient phenomenon; Aberrations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956260863

Due to the corrosive nature of molten hydroxides, long term containment of LiOH is of concern. Pure nickel is thought to be a suitably resistant material, and a program has been instituted to measure the effects of prolonged exposure of liquid and gaseous LiOH on the mechanical properties of pure nickel alloys. Results to date indicate that negligible weight and thickness changes occurred in Ni alloys exposed to LiOH for as long as 2500 hr at 775 K, and essentially no difference in 77-900 K tensile properties could be detected between LiOH exposed and vacuum annealed Ni specimens. Although there was little sign of outward damage, microstructural examination revealed that all hydroxide contaminated tensile test specimens had surface connected intergranular cracks along the gage lengths. Two other potential problems, which have strong implications with respect to a LiOH/Ni energy storage system, were also noted during the corrosion experiments. In particular stress corrosion cracking of weld joints in pressurized vessels and permeation of hydrogen through nickel, which leads to the loss of LiOH, were observed. © 1988 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51649155503

Accompanying this decrease is the formation and growth of a second peak (peak-2) below midgap. Evidence will be presented which suggests that this is due to an interfacial defect transformation process. Measurements done after repeated irradiation-storage cycles indicate that peak-2 is not generated directly by the x-ray irradiation; rather, the existence of peak-1 is a necessary condition for the formation of peak-2 through the defect transformation process.

The influence of variation in the magnetization, anisotropy, and exchange in an amorphous rare-earth-transition- metal film on the position and size of recorded marks has been simulated by specifying random variations of a film's magnetic properties in the thermomagnetic writing step.

Histograms showing the effects of write-read imperfections on bit-position accuracy in MO recording were developed.

Hotels traditionally have a highly variable energy load and have been difficult to adapt to cogeneration techniques. The initial analysis based on peak load demands for chilled and hot water coinciding determined one configuration. A total system load analysis of chilled water, hot water and electricity over a daily cycle, however, showed that these peaks did not coincide and that by using hot water storage, the plant could be operated closer to its design capacity. In addition, it was determined that under certain conditions, it could be less expensive to purchase off-peak electricity from the utility rather than operate the cogeneration plant.

There are several possible explanations for the high prevalence of supersaturated bile in the Western adult human as compared to other adult mammals. First, the human liver is defective in converting cholesterol to bile acids; the majority of cholesterol is eliminated as cholesterol. Second, the large flux of cholesterol in vesicular form is not matched by a large flux of recycling bile acids. Third, humans live sedentary lives and voluntarily reduce their caloric requirement to prevent obesity. Low caloric intake decreases the circulation of bile acids (including the flux through the hepatocyte). Fourth, the human species is a defective bile secretor in terms of biliary volume (μl/kg-min) compared to other mammals. This is because human enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 'sluggish' and because bile acid-dependent flow is also lower than in all other mammals. The accumulation of deoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid formed in the colon, appears to cause secretion of bile that is super-saturated in cholesterol, and may also contribute. Five additional risk factors explain why cholesterol gallstone disease is so prevalent. First, the human species has a gallbladder, and the irregular meal pattern of humans may be responsible for prolonged storage of bile. Second, bile from cholesterol gallstone patients nucleates cholesterol more rapidly. Third, defective gallbladder contraction is associated with cholesterol gallstone disease in the majority of gallstone patients. Fourth, the healthy gallbladder adsorbs cholesterol and desaturates bile - protective functions that may be lost with chronic cholecystitis. Finally, the presence of gallstones stimulates mucous secretion, which traps cholesterol crystals.",,"bile acid; cholesterol; cholecystitis; gallstone; human; nucleation; priority journal; review; Animal; Bile; Bile Acids and Salts; Cholelithiasis; Cholesterol; Energy Intake; Human; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024244310

Analytically, Im(W) differs from A(PQ) by K · 2π, where K is a postulated constant of proportionality. To determine the value of K, 338 heartbeats obtained from 8 dogs under a wide range of hemodynamic conditions were analyzed. The relationship between A(PQ) and Im(W) remained highly linear (R = 0.98), and the pooled value of K was -1.19 ± 0.01. For the individual dogs, values of K differed at most by ± 9% from its average value. There was also a small offset in the relationship between A(PQ) and Im(W), probably caused by truncating the calculation of Im(W) at the 10th harmonic. Ignoring the small differences in the values of K and the offset, we found that A(PQ) still proved to be an excellent predictor of Im(W). We also found that A(PQ) was sensitive to changes in heart rate, left ventricular stroke output, and peripheral resistance.

We have established the mode of thermal decomposition of ClO3F mass spectrometrically using the low pressure Knudsen effusion method and, also, using a transpiration method in which a high pressure cell is directly sampled through a differentially pumped vacuum system. The results show that ClO3F begins decomposition at approximately 500°C and that by 700°C, decomposition to Cl2, F2, and O2 is nearly complete. We have also studied the reaction of dissociated ClO3F with liquid Al by Knudsen and transpiration mass spectrometry and by direct thermogravimetric analysis at 700-800°C. The experimental data indicate that reaction occurs primarily with the F2 component of the gas, resulting in formation of a passivating film of AlF3. Analysis of the kinetic data suggests that film growth progresses as follows: (1) nucleation and growth of AlF3 precipitation sites; (2) edge growth of AlF3 islands on the metal surface; (3) island coalescence; and (4) complete film coverage with diffusion-controlled thickening, according to a parabolic rate law. The reactant gas flow geometry is important since there is evidence for kinetically-favored gas phase reactions that can, under certain circumstances, interfere with formation of the AlF3 product layer. We conclude that under the experimental conditions studied, equilibrium is achieved only in an interfacial sense. In order to completely react the ClO3F and form chloride and oxide products, it may be necessary to first deplete the fluorine component of the gas, followed by disruption of any passivationg film to expose fresh aluminum.",,"Aluminum and Alloys--Molten; Fluorine Compounds--Chemical Reactions; Liquid Metals--Chemical Reactions; Chemical Reactions - High Temperature; Chlorine Compounds - Chemical Reactions; Fluorine Compounds - Chemical Reactions; Liquid Metals - Chemical Reactions; Mass Spectrometry; Aluminum Fluoride; Perchloryl Fluoride; Stored Chemical Energy; Knudsen Mass Spectrometry; Liquid Aluminum; Thermogravimetry; Transpiration Mass Spectrometry; Energy Storage; Aluminum and Alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024163945

According to this model, the value of synaptic efficacy of individual synapses is stored locally by the group of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II molecules contained within the post-synaptic density. 2) Calculations presented in a previous paper indicate that it is feasible for these kinase molecules to encode information with the stability required for long-term memory. These calculations were based on the assumption that the 30 phosphorylation sites on the enzyme are phosphorylated in a serial fashion, i.e. that the sites are not independent. This paper presents similar calculations based on the alternative assumption that the sites are phosphorylated independently. 3) Kinase molecules that have been switched 'on' undergo a continuous process of dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation. Estimates of the energy consumed by this cycle indicate that the energy required would not make unreasonable demands on neuronal metabolism. The necessity of energy consumption by molecular switches is discussed. 4) The rate of intramolecular autophosphorylation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase implies that the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration must stay elevated for several seconds in order for kinase molecules to switch 'on'. How such a sustained rise in Ca2+ might be achieved is discussed. 5) An alternative view is that long-term memory storage involves a change in gene expression. The principal evidence supporting this view is the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on memory. A model is presented showing that the observed effect of protein synthesis inhibitors does not necessarily imply that information storage is at the level of gene expression. 6) The distinction between 'presynaptic' and 'postsynaptic' associative learning mechanisms is discussed. It is concluded that this distinction can be misleading and that the possibility that the underlying mechanisms are similar should not be excluded.",,"calmodulin; protein kinase; controlled study; learning; mathematical analysis; memory; methodology; molecular biology; nonbiological model; nonhuman; plasticity; priority journal; protein synthesis; Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase; Calcium; Calmodulin; Memory; Models, Neurological; Protein Kinases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024160790

The underground 400Mw pumped storage station was conceived in the 1950s at a time when commercial nuclear power was in its early days of development. Pumped storage was introduced to store energy by pumping at night for generation during the day to meet the system load peaks. The load regime foreseen was a simple one of a single pumping period and two periods of generation to meet the morning and early evening peaks with an average of 4/5 load changes per day for each of the machines. The station was built in 1965. Since then the flexibility of the plant, and its ability to pick up full load from spinning reserve in less than 1 min, has allowed a change to system running conditions requiring the machines to perform 2 or 3 times that number of daily mode changes.

Writing and erasing is accomplished through the viscoelastic response of the heated layer. The marks are created mechanically by thermal expansion of response of the heated layer. The marks are created mechanically by thermal expansion of the elastomeric layer. The subsequent deformation of the surface is captured by the thermoplastic layer upon cooling. Erasure of the mark is caused when the thermoplastic layer is relaxed with heat. Material requirement trends have been identified which change media performance and lead to structures which create marks with higher read contrast and which write and erase with lower energy. The selection of materials is based upon modulus, glass transition temperature and relative crosslink density.",,"Data Storage, Optical--Plastics Applications; Surfaces--Deformation; Thermal Effects; Thermoplastics--Dyeing; Viscoelasticity; Abstract Form Only; Bump Forming Media; Dye-Polymer; Rewritable Dye Polymer Storage Media; Polymers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024136086

Compared to this effect, a small insular supply system is sensitive to, and interactive with, load variations. All questions of load frequency control and instantaneous reserve become matters of chief concern. The electricity supply of Berlin (West) is operated by the Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG)-Aktiengesell-schaft and has been running as an insular system since 1952. Due to the political situation, there is no connection to any of the European grid systems. To solve the aforementioned problems, the utility company was taking a fresh look at using large-scale storage batteries as a part of the BEWAG modernising program in order to reduce cost for load frequency control and instantaneous reserve.

With the proper definition of attractive and repulsive potentials between various memory sites, it is possible to minimize the energy of the collection of memories. The authors illustrate this procedure with the Coulomb potential and discuss a supervised learning algorithm using this method. This procedure may be applied to each layer of a multi-layer network. The method does not depend on the propagation of error through all layers; thus the system is modular, with each layer trainable independently.

Magnetic interactions in the film serve the role of weights in a connectionist neural net model. The film is taught a series of pattern vectors imposed by local laser heating in a magnetic field by allowing the magnetic spins of the system to move and seek a self-consistent energy minimum. The energy landscape created effectively stores a set of pattern vectors and permits their subsequent retrieval.

These beams can generate microwaves and millimeter waves with impressive intensity over a wide frequency range. Unfortunately, these high peak powers have been achieved, with few exceptions, with pulse lengths less than 100 ns, and, therefore low energy content. Moreover, the pulse repetition rate has been very low, with a measured peak of approximately 50 Hz. Such limitations in pulse length and repetition rate have been due to the characteristics of the accelerators and the nature of the cathode sources of the electron beams. However, lately, significant advances have been made in accelerator technology allowing the generation of pulses with microsecond pulse lengths and peak powers of 10 GW. © 1988 SPIE.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958498150

The frogs withstand the adverse abiotic conditions in exposed positions, clinging to dry vegetation. Only juveniles (300-700 mg) are able to adjust water economy and metabolism to a prolonged dry season. Wet season frogs attain low levels of evaporative water loss (EWL) within 6-8 days after incipient water shortage. This time course is mainly determined by the animal's ability to lower metabolism and activity level to the minimum demands of a dry season. Barriers against diffusion of water which most probably are built up by the stratum corneum and/or the overlying film of dried mucus seem not to be essentially modified during adjustment to dry season conditions. Changeover to dry season physiology is greatly accelerated through preconditioning frogs to water shortage. Adult Hyperoliusare unable to reduce activity and metabolism as fast and effectively as juveniles. Most probably these are the main reasons for their very restricted survival capability under dry season conditions; the generally poor energy reserves after the breeding period may further shorten their survival time. At the critical thermal maximum (CTM) Hyperolius uses skin gland secretions for evaporative cooling. Acclimation effects and regulation of evaporative cooling within some 1/10° C help to employ limited water reserves very economically. Dry adapted, dehydrated frogs take up water, whenever available, via specialized skin areas. Rate of uptake is high and is mainly determined by the actual stage of dehydration. The onset of the water-balance-response is also affected by preconditioning. Survival time of small (<500 mg) estivating Hyperolius is limited by their water reserves.Due to their unfavourable surface to volume ratio they loserelatively more water by evaporation than larger conspecifics. Therefore, smaller specimens should allocate energy preferably to growth, until reducing EWL so far to survive the average periods between the rare precipitations. In larger frogs (>500 mg) the amount of stored energy determines maximal survival time. When a critical size is reached in postmetamorphic growth, a change in energy allocation from body growth to energy storage would improve prospects of survival and should therefore be expected. Species specific differences in regard to EWL and CTM indicate a strong correlation between physiological properties and ecological demands. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","Estivation; Hyperolius; Thermoregulation; Water-balance","Anura; arid; frog; reed frog; thermoregulation; water use; Amphibia; Anura; Hyperoliidae; Hyperolius; Hyperolius viridiflavus; Phragmites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024188468

Irradiated male techniques revealed that the last male that mates with a female fertilizes an average of 95% (100% in 28% of the cases) of the clutch laid immediately after copulation, irrespective of any previous matings. Sperm volume estimates in both sexes and sperm opacity changes in females at 7 stages of copulation and oviposition indicated that males remove 41-87% of previously deposited sperm from the female's storage organs during the first 5 min of the copulation. Ejaculation takes place during the remaining 10-15 min. We maintain that indirect estimates of precedence in libellulids, based on sperm volume changes, always understimate reality because of the supplementing effect of a ""first-in, last out"" mechanism. Because males are skilled at achieving sperm precedence, they are forced to be good guards as well, since a risk of take-overs exists. Females are believed to benefit from contact guarding because it results in a lowered risk of male harassment and predation as well as a lower energy expenditure during oviposition. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",,"dragonfly; mate guarding; Odonata; sperm competition; Libellulidae; Sympetrum danae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024233725

Scallops were held in cages at two contrasting localities in Long Island, New York, U.S.A. Gametogenesis occurred mainly at the expense of adductor muscle protein and lipid reserves. Energy loss in the adductor muscle could potentially account for 63 to 99% of the gonadal buildup in the spring. In contrast to prior studies, digestive gland lipid and muscle carbohydrate made an insignificant contribution to the energy demand during reproduction. In first-year, pre-reproductive scallops, adductor muscle protein also contributed 63-66% of the total energy loss during overwintering stress. Senescence of older scallops was evidenced by a more rapid decline in mantle protein reserves than in young individuals. Twenty percent of the older population showed signs of anomalous, advanced oogenesis in March, coincident with the period of highest natural mortality.

The powertrain synthesis problem is formulated as an optimization problem of minimizing the engine fuel rate over a finite time interval. The solution process is driven by energy management and control strategies, which determine the transmission ratio and the hydrostatic pump/motor unit displacement such that the engine can be operated at its minimum fuel rate. This approach has identified a powertrain consisting of an automatic four-speed transmission plus a hydrostatic pump/motor unit and accumulator used to regenerate and store vehicle kinetic energy. Within the limitations of our analysis, the hydraulic hybrid system has shown potential for significant improvement in fuel economy over a conventional system. These limitations are: the use of an optimum energy management strategy which may be difficult to capture in a real-time controller; the practicality and transient effects of turning the engine on and off; the packaging of all the subsystems into a vehicle; and the lack of hydraulic noise assessment. Using the approach in this paper, optimal energy management and control strategies have been developed and their effects on fuel economy have been quantified. The analysis has shown that the fuel economy gains are due to turning the engine on and off and to using stored energy to power the accessories and/or launch the vehicle. This research effort has assessed the potential of a hydraulic hybrid powertrain vehicle system.

For this single-unit system, new electrocatalysts for the O2 electrode will be required which are not only bifunctionally active but also chemically and electrochemically stable between the voltage range of about 0.7 and 1.5 V. NiCo2O4 spinel is reported to have certain characteristics that make it useful for a study of electrode fabrication techniques. High surface area NiCo2O4 powder was fabricated into unsupported, bifunctional, PTFE-bonded, porous gas fuel cell electrodes by commercial sources using varying PTFE contents and sintering temperatures. The object of the present study was to measure the bifunctional activities of these electrodes and to observe what performance differences might result from different commercial electrode fabricators. O2 evolution and O2 reduction data were obtained at 80°C (31 percent KOH). An irreversible reaction (i.e., aging) occurred during O2 evolution at potentials greater than about 1.5 V. Within the range of 15 to 25 percent, the PTFE content was not a critical parameter for optimizing the electrode for O2 evolution activity. Sintering temperatures between 300 and 340°C may be adequate but heating at 275°C may not be sufficient to properly sinter the PTFE-NiCo2O4 mixture. Electrode disintegration was observed during O2 reduction. Transport of O2 to the NiCo2O4 surface became prohibitive at greater than about -0.02 A/cm2. A PTFE content of 25 percent (or greater) appears to be preferable for sintering the PTFE-NiCo2O4 mixture.",,"Catalysts--Activity; Chemical Reactions--Redox; Electrodes, Electrochemical--Materials; Oxides--Electrochemistry; Space Flight--Energy Storage; Bifunctional Electrocatalysts; Energy Storage Devices; Fuel Cell Oxygen Electrodes; Nickel Cobalt Spinels; Fuel Cells",Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024080096

Based on an idea of P. Kienle, such measurements now become possible. Moreover, the proposed measurements of weak interaction rates are in the isotopic states of interest; hence they will be much more readily acceptable than would indirect measurements via strong or electromagnetic interactions or theoretical calculations. One will soon be able to completely strip the electrons from atomic 205Tl and to maintain the bare nucleus in this state in the heavy ion storage ring to be built at GSI Darmstadt. This nucleus can decay by emitting a beta-minus particle into the bound K-level of the daughter 82205Pb1 2-81+ ion as the only energetically open decay channel (plus, of course, an antineut This single channel beta decay explores the same nuclear wave functions of initial and final states as does the neutrino capture in atomic 205Tl, and thus its probability or rate is governed by the same nuclear matrix elements that affect both weak interactions: 81205Tl1 2+81+→ 82205Pb1 2-81++ νν81205Tl1 2+0→ 82205Pb1 2-1++e- Measuring the rate of accumulation of 205Pb81+ ions in the circulating beam of 205Tl81+ ions gives directly the cross section of reaction (b). The calculations of the expected rates under realistic experimental conditions will be shown to be very favorable for the measurement, e.g., ∼104 ions per hour in a 100 mA beam. The great sensitivity of the rate to the 205Pb-205Tl mass difference will appear (12%/keV), showing the need to materially improve the uncertainty in this value, and several experiments will be proposed. A special calibration experiment to verify the method and check the theoretical calculations will be suggested. Finally the neutrino cross section calculation based on the observed rate of reaction (a) will be shown. Demonstrating bound state beta decay may be the first verification of the theory of this very important process that influences beta decay rates of several isotopes in stellar interiors, e.g., 187Re, that play important roles in geologic and cosmologic dating and nucleosynthesis. © 1988.",,"Lead and Alloys; Particle Detectors; Thallium and Alloys; Neutrino Absorption; Solar Neutrinos; Solar Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024054242

It is shown that release from isolated leaves (shoots) of Hg0 is a two-step process with a higher Ea value below 21 °C than above (28 vs 14 kcal mol-1). Open field air Hg measurements over a mixed stand of grasses and other plants in volcanic soil show strikingly similar behavior to detached organs. Mercury release from volcanic soil was uniform over a wide temperature range, resembling plant and open field emissions above 18 to 21°C with an Ea value of 13 kcal · mol-1. We conclude that Hg release below 18 to 21 °C is limited by a physiological process, whereas above that range, release is controlled by the physical process of vaporization itself.

At 300 °C, the catalyst initially supported primarily a dicarbonyl CO species but after use exhibited spectra characteristic of a surface mostly covered by linearly bound CO. A model that describes transient, diffusion-influenced CO adsorption and desorption for the supported catalyst is presented. It suggests that the CO desorption energy depends linearly on coverage and that the magnitude of this dependence is a function of temperature. Observed rate dependence on bulk CO concentration for O2 effluent levels of 0.5% and 0.25% is interpreted considering the effects of internal and external mass transport at 300 °C.

Interest in micellar polymerization arises primarily from the expectation that stable micelles, appropriate for technological applications, will be produced. Thus, in problems of conversion and storage of solar energy, chemical catalysis and inhibition drug carriers, adjuvants in immunology, etc., micelles can play an important role. Furthermore, polymerized micelles, owing to their covalent intermolecular bonds, have a closer physicochemical resemblance to biopolymers than their nonpolymerized counterparts. Also, the ion-containing polymers obtained from polymerization in the micellar state are closely related to interesting classes of polyelectrolytes and ionomers.

Space charge density was exceeded by an order of magnitude without instabilities. Three nondestructive diagnostic methods allowed measurements of ion orbit distribution, ion storage times, ion energy distribution, nuclear reaction rate, and reaction product spectrum. Migma formed a disc 20 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm thick. Its ion density was sharply peaked in the center; the ion-to-electron temperature ratio was TiTe ∼ 103; ion-electron temperature equilibrium was never reached. The volume average and central D+ density were n = 3.2 × 109 cm-3 and nc = 3 × 1010 cm-3 respectively, compared to the space charge limit density nsc = 4 × 108 cm-3. The energy confinement time was τc = 20-30 s, limited by the change exchange reactions with the residual gas in the vacuum (5 × 10-9 Torr). The ion energy loss rate was 1.4 keV/s. None of the instabilities that were observed in mirrors at several orders of magnitude lower density occurred. The proton energy spectrum for dd + d → T + p + 4 MeV shows that dd collided at an average crossing angle of 160°. Evidence for exponential density buildup has also been observed. Relative to Migma III results and measured in terms of the product of ion energy E, density n, and confinement time τ, device performance was improved by a factor of 500. Using the central fast ion density, we obtained the triple product: Tnτ ≅ 4 × 1014 keV s cm-3, which is greater than that of the best fusion devices. The luminosity (collision rate per unit cross section) was ∼ 1029 cm-2s-1, with o.7 A ion current through the migma center. The stabilizing features of migma are: (1) large Larmor radius; (2) small canonical angular momentum; (3) short axial length z (disc shape); (4) nonadiabatic motions in r and z; (5) precession and enegy spread; (6) ambipolar potential; (7) radial density gradient;(8) large ion-to-electron temperature ratio; (9) metal walls in z; (10) suitability for external stabilization techniques (small volume, recurrent surfacing of ions); and particularly (11) diamagnetic well. Extrapolition of the results to reactor densities led to a D + 3He reactor ""basic migma disc"" 0.5 m in diameter and 0.25 m thick, suspended in a 10 T field, generating 1.5 MW(th). A 2-MW(e) power plant would consist of 3 such discs in a common volume. referred to as a triplet migmacell. Its specific power is projected to be 1 MW(e)/ton. A large power plant of any size would consist of a large number of migma discs in a common volume. The advantages f such modular systems are: (1) economy of mass production: capital cost per kW will be 25% that of fission and 10% that of DT fusion; (2) plants will be economical for all sizes above 10 kW(e); (3) minimal heat pollution, thanks to direct conversion of the changed ion kinetic energy into electricity; (4) no proliferative potential; and (5) large power-to-weight ratio due to absence of shielding.

In particular the optical beam induced current (OBIC) mode of the SOM has been used to map the electronic properties of semiconducting devices. A new type of scanning microscopy method, as well as some results obtained by it, will be reported in this paper. Though similar, to a certain extent, to the standard scanning optical microscopy, this new investigation technique, from now on refered to as infrared beam induced contrast (IRBIC), differs from it in substance. The chopped light from a quartz halogen lamp is focused by a conventional microscope rearranged on the specimen surface, and a pin-hole is positioned so as to reduce the probe size (not the resolving power) to 1.5μm. The resulting beam power density is of the order of 1mW*cm-2. Such a low power density presents some disadvantages in comparison with the traditional laser sources, but, on the other hand, it allows a very high sensitivity in the investigation of the defect electrical activity. With this experimental set-up the specimen front surface is probed with band-gap radiation. Its back surface is illuminated by continuous light in the infrared, coming through a monochromator from a glow-bar. The radiation wavelength can be selected continuously so as the photon energy ranges over the whole valence-to-conduction energy gap. When the specimen is probed, the photoinduced carriers are separated by the built-in field due to the depletion zone of a p-n junction or a Schottky barrier, and the photocurrent is amplified by the lock-in technique. The application of a back-surface radiation of less than the band-gap energy modifies, in some way, the photoconductive response to the band-gap probe since the secondary illumination changes the occupancy of the traps in the forbidden gap active in the photoconductive process. This phenomenon, known as “quenching” of extrinsic photoconductivity, when applied to scanning optical microscopy allows localized investigations on energy levels. As a matter of fact, the beam induced contrast at a defect depends on the secondary illumination wavelength, that is on the trap level excited, as we observed in defective Si. © 1988 SPIE.",,"Electronic properties; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Photoconductivity; Probes; Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconductor junctions; Electrical activities; Illumination changes; Optical beam induced currents; Photoconductive response; Physical properties of materials; Quartz halogen lamps; Radiation wavelength; Scanning optical microscopy; Energy gap",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957524931

The heat production was calibrated either 'internally' by inhibiting photochemistry, i.e., closing the reaction centers, or by using solutions of CuCl2 as calorimetric standard. By this method detailed information on the energy partitioning between fluorescence, photochemistry and heat dissipation is obtained for each photosystem. The photoproducts formed within 1.4 ± 0.1 μs in the Photosystem I and II particles, i.e., the states P+-700 A-1 and Z+ P-680 IQ-A, were found to be associated with a relative energy storage of 0.83 (±0.08) and 0.65 (±0.07), respectively. From these data a difference of midpoint potentials (ΔEm) between P+-700 P-700 and A-1 A1 of 1520 ± 150 meV was calculated, which implies an Em( A-1 A1) of -(1040 ± 160) meV. The midpoint potential difference between Z+ Z and Q-A QA was 1190 ± 100 meV. The consequences for the value of Em( Z+ Z) are discussed on the basis of the variability of Em values reported for the quinone acceptors in the literature. In the case of Photosystem II particles with closed reaction centers a fraction of 5% of the absorbed energy stored for a time longer than 1.4 μs is attributed to the formation of triplet P-680. Data from intact Synechococcus cells, excited at 628 and 677 nm, is explained in terms of the results obtained from the isolated particles and the coupling of the antenna pigments in the phycobilisomes to Photosystem II. © 1988.","(Cyanobacterium); Electron transport; Energy storage; Optoacoustics; Photosynthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000146838

It is pointed out that the static force-free field is insufficient for a discussion of storage processes, and also the pure unsteady plasma rotation is not a perfect approach. In order to analyze the energy storage, we must consider the addition of poloidal plasma motion. The paper shows that because the unsteady poloidal flow is added and coupling occurs between the magnetic field and both the toroidal and the poloidal plasma flows, an unsteady process is maintained which changes the force-free factor with time. Hence, the energy in the lower levels can be transferred to the upper levels, and a considerable energy can be stored in the active region. Finally, another storage process is given which is due to the pure poloidal flow. The article shows that even if there is no twisted magnetic line of force, the energy in the lower levels may still be transferred to the upper levels and stored there. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250093948

The authors present the advantages and disadvantages of each type. A discussion is also presented of the gel pond in which the nonconvective zone is modified chemically or replaced by a chemically formed gel. Preliminary studies on gel ponds indicate that polymer gels that have good optical and thermal insulating properties might be able to replace the nonconvective zone. Because gels are semisolid, convective currents are inhibited and hence the gel acts as a good insulator. Further, the gel material could be used inside a bag made of Du Pont's Tedlar material, and gel 1 or 2 ft thick is enough to achieve a high storage zone temperature. 32 Refs.",,"ENERGY RESOURCES; ENERGY STORAGE; FALLING POND CONCEPT; GEL POND; HONEYCOMB SOLAR POND; PARTITIONED SOLAR POND; SATURATED SOLAR POND; VISCOSITY-STABILIZED POND; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024047633

Damage probability versus fluence curves and accumulation curves are plotted to investigate damage behavior as it correlates with morphology. Accumulation curves showed different damage behavior for crystals of different orientation. Threshold decrease due to accumulation was the largest on (111) Cu and Al surfaces, whidh also had the lowest single shot damage threshold. The threshold reduction in accumulation follows the equation FN = F1 NS-1 where FN is the N-pulse damage threshold, N the pulse number, and S the slope of the accumulation curve.

Because of the increased complexity and difficulty, it has become even more important to use least-squares statistics to judge the accuracy of parameter estimates and the goodness of fit of the model under consideration. But the increased size of analyses has resulted in computational times so large that a complete least-squares analysis is frequently infeasible. To resolve this difficulty and to provide an adequate computational base for the further growth of global methods, we have developed a comprehensive, efficient methodology, based on separation techniques, for global least-squares analysis of time-resolved data from time- and frequency-domain measurements. We have formulated these techniques so as to exploit the special form of fluorescence spectral models. In particular, we have been able to reduce the cubic rate of growth in the number of computations per data curve of previous methodologies to essentially a linear growth rate. For excited-state kinetics described by time-independent rates and for data that adequately determine the corresponding model, computational times suitable for interactive computing can thereby be obtained, regardless of the magnitude and complexity of the analysis. For example, we have simulated data for energy transfer between the two chromophores of the a subunit of phycoerythrin at 99 consecutive emission wavelengths, each with 500 channels. Parameter estimation required less than 0.4 seconds per iteration on an IBM 3081, a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude over previous methods. Computational storage requirements undergo a similar reduction. These techniques are equally applicable to error estimation. We have derived a separated form of the equations for standard deviations and algorithms for computing nonlinear joint confidence limits that are analogous to those for parameter estimation (requiring, therefore, essentially the same amount of time per iteration). Standard deviations and linear estimates of confidence limits are all computed in a single iteration. Two types of confidence limits, support-plane and principal axis, can be calculated. The latter allow the limits for strongly correlated parameters to be estimated simultaneously by means of more stable algorithms. If only linear joint confidence limits are computed for the emission intensities, which is standard practice in the literature, then a complete analysis of the above system, which includes parameter and error estimates for the two decay rates, the energy transfer rate and approximately 200 emission intensities, can be obtained in less than 10 seconds. Equations are still expressed in normal form, which is simpler and more familiar to most users than singular-value decompositions and allows a wider range of algorithms to be employed in their solution. In particular, this approach facilitates the use of a variety of algorithms of higher order (i.e., with stronger convergence properties) than those customarily available. We have found their use in more difficult analyses to be crucial for achieving rapid convergence to parameter estimates. © 1988 SPIE.",,"Biochemistry; Chromophores; Decay (organic); Digital storage; Energy transfer; Excited states; Frequency domain analysis; Iterative methods; Laser spectroscopy; Least squares approximations; Nonlinear equations; Singular value decomposition; Statistics; Accuracy of parameters; Computational technique; Convergence properties; Excited state kinetics; Global least squares analysis; Least squares analysis; Three orders of magnitude; Time and frequency domains; Parameter estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950585988

A global decrease in blood flow and oxygen utilization compared with normal values was found but the decrease was more marked in the frontal regions. The degree of impairment in oxygen utilization in the frontal region paralleled roughly the duration of the disease. Blood flow was impaired to a greater extent than oxygen utilization, resulting in raised oxygen extraction. This can partially be explained by a lower pCO2 in the patients. Alternatively it may imply involvement of brain vasculature in the pathophysiology of the disease in addition to neuronal degeneration. Striatal dopamine formation and storage, as indicated by L-(18F)fluorodopa uptake, was significantly decreased compared with control values.

The system addresses housekeeping, orbital maneuvering and burst mode power requirements, and offers an attractive alternative to the nuclear and solar space power systems currently envisioned for this application. This energy-conversion system incorporates six steps: (1) generate primary DC power at surface stations along the satellite ground-track, (2) convert to microwave (RF) frequencies, (3) transmit in a narrow beam to spacecraft using phased-array antennas which track and lock-on to satellite receivers as they pass in range during a fraction of their orbit, (4) receive the energy and convert to DC in space using lightweight and inexpensive rectennas; (5) store the energy onboard as chemical energy by electrolysis of water to oxygen and hydrogen and (6) recover free energy onboard the spacecraft during the balance of the orbit continuously or on demand as pulsed power with a high power-density fuel cell. Component and overall systems considerations of this scheme are discussed in comparison with alternatives, outstanding research problems are defined and preliminary analyses are described. These include orbital mechanics and ground tracks of satellites, accessibility of orbiters to microwave beams, transmission efficiencies, electronic and mechanical designs of the transmitter and rectenna, regenerative fuel cell energy storage, power conditioning and thermal management. The development of readily space-deployable rectennae, their supporting structures, and high specific power solid oxide monolithic fuels cells are the main pacing technologies leading to a wholly non-nuclear space power system capable of supporting all defensive satellite power requirements. © 1988 SPIE.

Modern retailing methods require packaging for self-service operation. Food manufacturers use more and more packaging to protect the product during distribution and storage — costs paid for by the consumer. After consuming the food the packaging is disposed of via the refuse collection and disposal system and again the consumer pays for this cost via a charge on the rates. As the awareness of conservation grows, are there opportunities to market food packaging as being recyclable and so causing less damage to the environment? Should those manufacturers and retailers who require additional packaging be forced to pay towards the disposal costs? Should we bother with recycling any material? What materials can be recycled? If we agree that it is desirable to recycle materials, who should be responsible for initiating and promoting recycling schemes? How can recycling be made to work? These are questions which this paper has addressed. By means of a literature search and personal contact, the implementation of the EEC Directive is investigated. The energy savings associated with recycling are highlighted and recycling schemes for glass, metals and plastics have been described. We have investigated the basic advantages and disadvantages of recycling for waste collection and disposal authorities, and for retail organisations.

In this paper, we discuss solar flares from an entirely different point of view, namely in terms of power supply by a dynamo process in the photosphere. By this process, electric currents flowing along the magnetic field lines are generated and the familiar 'force-free' fields or the 'sheared' magnetic fields are produced. Upward field-aligned currents thus generated are carried by downward streaming electrons; these electrons can excite hydrogen atoms in the chromosphere, causing the optical Hα flares or 'low temperature flares'. It is thus argued that as the 'force-free' fields are being built up for the magnetic energy storage, a flare must already be in progress. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250095064

However, two recent papers have presented procedures which make use of pinch technology - i.e. energy-based techniques in batch plant. One paper uses an analysis of energy flows as a tool for debottlenecking and reducing plant-wide operating costs. It develops energy performance targets, subject to scheduling which provide opportunities for general cost reduction. The second paper also sets energy performance targets but restricts use of the targets to heat recovery. An analytical procedure is used to quantify the minimum energy required by a batch plant using direct heat transfer and energy storage within a given overall schedule. Unfortunately the proposed energy storage 'targets' are not rigorous and can lead to missed design opportunities. This severely limits the practical usefulness of the procedure. The present paper discusses both previous publications in depth and attempts to clarify what there is by way of workable techniques. It concludes that future developments of energy based analysis for batch plant integration should not consider energy in isolation. Cost structure and the interaction between capital, energy, scheduling, yields, and other aspects, mean that it is necessary to address the wider problem in context.",,"Chemical Plants--Design; Energy Conservation; Batch Plant Design; Batch Plant Integration; Energy Based Analysis; Energy Performance; Overall Plant Bottleneck; Pinch Technology; Chemical Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024010297

Although growth took place in all crabs, tissue content varied inversely with exposure concentration while percentage tissue water varied directly with exposure concentration. Total protein, lipid and RNA content of crabs exposed to crude oil were significantly less than that of control crabs by Day 21. DNA content was not significantly different from that of control crabs, suggesting that the difference in tissue content was due to differences in cell volume and not cell number. There were no consistent differences in the concentration of the major biochemical components, indicating that the relative contribution of each of the components remained stable during the period of sublethal stress. Ratios of RNA:DNA and protein:DNA decreased in exposed crabs and were positively correlated with scope for growth and observed growth. The ratios may be useful as indirect indicators of physiological condition. Analysis of lipid classes indicated that structural lipids in stressed crabs were less affected than were lipids used for energy storage. The changes in biochemical composition suggest that the pattern of energy utilization was altered in crabs exposed to crude oil. Growth in size without comparable growth in tissue resulted in decreased tissue content.

Several conditions, e.g., myocardial infarction (MI), can disturb the dynamic equilibrium between the different vitamers resulting in transiently low plasma PLP levels. An important question is whether these low plasma PLP levels observed during MI represent a transient state of deficiency and what the possible clinical consequences of such a fall in plasma PLP could be. Since the main metabolic function of PLP is to act as an intracellular coenzyme, it was decided to monitor the changes not only of PLP but also of PL (transport form of vitamin B6) in both the plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) in patients with myocardial infarctions (MI): 16 patients with proven MI were investigated measuring the aforementioned parameters at regular intervals. It was found that the approximately 40% fall in plasma PLP levels was accompanied by an equivalent increase in RBC PLP levels. Subsequently plasma PLP concentrations returned to normal but RBC PLP values were maintained at the newly elevated steady state (without any vitamin supplementation). Since membranes are impermeable to PLP, the only way in which PLP could have been redistributed to the intracellular compartment was through hydrolysis to PL and rephosphorylation once inside the RBCs. This compartmentalization could be an important adaptive response since it has been shown that PLP reduces O2 affinity of deoxygenated hemoglobin, thereby facilitating O2 delivery to the tissues. In addition it would also enhance the proposed storage function of RBCs for PLP and PL which is said to be an important source for muscle vitamin B6 which again is essential for energy production by the muscle cells during ischemia. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","Adaptive response; Compartmentalization; Myocardial infarction; Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate; Vitamin B6","pyridoxal 5 phosphate; pyridoxine; adult; aged; clinical article; heart infarction; human; priority journal; Adult; Aged; Cell Compartmentation; Erythrocytes; Human; Middle Age; Myocardial Infarction; Pyridoxal; Pyridoxal Phosphate; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023880788

Specific alterations in the activity of the autonomic nervous system may mediate and perhaps cause obesity in animal models. We therefore looked for alterations in autonomic activity in human obesity. Fifty-six healthy men with various percentages of body fat underwent autonomic testing while at rest. Significant correlations were found between the percentage of body fat and the variation in the R–R interval after beta-adrenergic blockade (r = -0.30, P<0.03), the heart rate (r = 0.30, P<0.03), the plasma norepinephrine concentration (r = -0.30, P<0.05), the plasma epinephrine concentration (r = -0.49, P<0.001), and the pupillary latency period (r = 0.39, P<0.01). Each of these variables reflects the activity of the sympathetic nervous system or parasympathetic nervous system or both. Depressions in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity were significantly but weakly associated with increasing percentages of body fat. These associations indicate that in obese persons, autonomic changes, though not necessarily causal, involve several organ systems. We suggest that autonomic alterations are important in human obesity, as they are in animal obesity. A disordered homeostatic mechanism may promote excessive storage of energy by decreasing sympathetic activity, while defending against weight gain by decreasing parasympathetic activity. The use of autonomic profiles holds promise for classifying human obesity and identifying obese patients at increased risk for various disorders.

We present comprehensive measurements of the quantum detec-tion efficiency for a number of materials, CsI, KBr, KC1, and MgF2, over a wide wavelength range (44Å to ˜1800Å). These results show that high (>40%) quantum detection efficiency may be achieved for many materials, at certain wavelength regions in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). We also observe structure in the wavelength dependence of the quantum detection efficiency that is directly related to the valence band to conduction band gap energy, and the onset of atomic-like resonant transitions. We show that a simple photocathode model allows interpretation of these features, and the variation of the quantum detection efficiency as a function of illumination angle. The structure of photocathode layers has been examined with an electron microscope, and shows that typical cathodes are granular.

Infrared radiation is pumped into the temperature sensor, thereby raising its equilibrium temperature. When the heated sensor is placed in thermal contact with a flowing fluid, heat is carried away by the fluid, lowering the sensor temperature. This energy loss is correlated to local flow rate or velocity. This approach to flow measurement is the optical analogy of the hot wire/hot film anemometer. The velocity probe consists of a single multimode optical fiber with temperature sensitive phosphor and heat absorber material attached to the tip. A short pulse of blue excitation light pumped into the fiber causes the phosphor to fluoresce. After the exitation has terminated, the exponential decay time of the fluorescent radiation intensity is measured and correlated with temperature. The optical heating energy is provided by a continuous wave (CW) infrared laser diode. The infrared light pumped into the fiber impinges on the absorber material, heating the phosphor sensor. The temperature measurement is utilized in a feedback control loop to modulate the CW laser diode. The sensor temperature is maintained constant utilizing pulse width modulation of laser diode drive current. The resulting duty cycle (laser input energy) is correlated to fluid flow velocity. Data are presented for volumetric flow rates in the range of 0 to 10 liters/minute in a 1.9 cm diameter tube showing very promising results. © 1988 SPIE.",,"Catheters; Continuous wave lasers; Digital storage; Diodes; Energy dissipation; Fibers; Flow velocity; Imaging techniques; Infrared radiation; Light emission; Microsensors; Multimode fibers; Optical pumping; Phosphors; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Velocity; Voltage control; Absorber material; Equilibrium temperatures; Exponential decays; Feedback control loops; Fluorescent radiation; Multimode optical fibers; Temperature sensitive; Volumetric flow rate; Flow of fluids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957515644

The values of circuit components can he chosen and arranged to provide varying risetimes and pulsewidths of the output transient voltage. Depending on the circuit components, an output voltage pulse with risetime from 50 ns to 35 us and pulsewidth from 40 us to 200 us can be obtained. These parameters, which cover a wide range of voltage surges, allow actual high voltage simulation of insulating materials, used in high voltage energy storage and transport devices, being stressed under impulse voltages in a laboratory environment.

SPEAR I was launched December 13, 1987, to investigate the electrical current drain to highly charged objects in the ionosphere. SPEAR I results, augmented with laboratory and theoretical studies, will be used to determine the ambient conditions that would cause discharging and arcing of high power systems in space. These results will then be used for the design, test and flight of high power systems. SPEAR II, scheduled for launch in early 1989, will involve the innovative operations of high voltage and high current systems in the ionosphere. These flight programs utilize theoretical research efforts of several groups, as well as vacuum and plasma chamber testing of high power systems. Innovative aspects will include the exposure of uninsulated transmission and pulse forming systems to the ambient plasma, the charging and use of high energy storage systems during flight, and the use of high voltage and high current loads not previously used in space.

The heat storage efficiency was improved by increasing the superficial water velocity and by decreasing the cooling rate. Heating rate had little effect. Fluidization provided enhanced heat transfer to or from the storage medium and resulted in a steady-state heat storage efficiency of about 60% after repeated heating and cooling cycles.

Transplantation must be finished within this period to assure complete functional recovery upon reperfusion. From the clinical setting it is well known that hypothermia results in a better myocardial preservation during ischemia. During ischemia, rapid catabolism of high-energy phosphates (e.g., ATP and creatine phosphate) occurs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of temperature during a 24-h preservation period on the rate of catabolism of ATP and on the rate of accumulation of breakdown products (ADP, AMP, adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine). For this purpose, hearts were excised and stored for 24 h at 0.5°, 12°, or 18 °C. In addition, the effect of initial cardioplegic arrest was compared with simple normothermic excision of the heart followed by 24 h in cold storage. It was found that the higher the storage temperature, the higher the rate of catabolism of high-energy phosphates and, hence, after 24 h, the lower the final ATP level and the higher the level of breakdown products, mainly nucleosides. It was also found that the initial cardioplegic arrest strongly benefits the preservation of high-energy phosphates as a result of the ATP-sparing effect. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","Cardioplegia; Donor hearts; High-energy phosphates; Hypothermia; Preservation","adenosine triphosphate; cardioplegic agent; animal; article; cold; dog; heart; heart arrest; heart muscle; heart transplantation; metabolism; methodology; organ preservation; time; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cold; Dogs; Evaluation Studies; Heart; Heart Arrest, Induced; Heart Transplantation; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023998637

Full capsule rotation around a horizontal axis improved the storage efficiency over the efficiencies achieved in part 1. Impacts resulting from motion in the drum gave small additional improvements in the efficiencies over those realized in the rotating tube, with a maximum storage efficiency of 83% for a stoichiometric Glauber's salt mixture with 4% borax. At high rotation speeds, centrifugal forces had a negative effect. Heat storage efficiencies increased with addition of excess Na2SO4 and also with excess H2O compared to eutectic salt mixtures.

Compared with films, the Kodak storage phosphor technology described in the accompanying paper [1] offers the prospect of greatly improved signal-to-noise, increased sensitivity particularly at shorter wavelengths, and wide dynamic range, though with more modest spatial resolution. To assess the suitability of this technology for protein crystallographic data collection, we have collected both monochromatic oscillation and wide bandpass Laue data at CHESS on crystals ranging in unit cell size from ∼ 50 Å (lysozyme) to ∼ 300 Å (viruses). A direct comparison of the Kodak storage phosphor with conventional Kodak Direct Exposure Film (DEF-5) was obtained by making immediately sequential exposures on the same crystal with the two detector systems. Even with an exposure time one order of magnitude less than with the corresponding film, the storage phosphor yielded data with improved signal-to-noise. Thus, storage phosphors enable more data to be acquired per crystal, with less radiation damage, and with better precision. Such detectors appear extremely well suited to protein crystallographic applications, both static and time-resolved, with both monochromatic and polychromatic X-ray sources. © 1988.",,"CRYSTALS; DATA PROCESSING - Data Acquisition; PHOSPHORS; PROTEINS; X-RAYS - Diffraction; CORNELL HIGH ENERGY SYNCHROTRON SOURCE; KODAK STORAGE PHOSPHOR PLATES; ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023326030

The water in the ground has a great influence on the surroundings, especially on the surface temperature. It is needed to predict the moisture content profile in the ground soil and its surface, for exact consideration of the heat transfer in and on ground soil. The moisture content in the ground soil is strongly influenced by precipitation and the depth of the water table in the ground. The heat and moisture (vapor and liquid water) transfer considerably affect each other. For prediction of the temperature and the moisture content profile in the ground, simultaneous transport of heat and moisture can be considered. This paper presents the results of transient analysis of the heat and moisture fields in the earth/ground under precipitation with non-linear simultaneous heat and moisture transfer equations using the water chemical potential as the potential of the surroundings. Using the weather data of Osaka, Japan, variations of moisture content and temperature in and on the earth/ground are numerically analyzed. An evaporation/condensation process is analyzed quantitatively. The transient process of surface moisture content and water chemical potential are shown. These values vary strongly but never reach saturation in the case of the sandy soil. Average moisture content in the earth/ground is strongly affected by the annual average precipitation but little by the depth of the water table. Using these results, thermal behavior of the thermal well and method of analysis are discussed. For analysis, approximation of the side boundary condition by uniform moisture content is applicable in two-dimensional analysis within the medium moisture content. And for practical calculation, approximation by a linear simple heat diffusion equation is applicable. © 1988.",,"ENERGY STORAGE - Analysis; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; METEOROLOGY - Climatology; MOISTURE - Analysis; MOISTURE VARIATIONS; OSAKA, JAPAN; THERMAL WELL; TRANSIENT ANALYSIS; SOILS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022681984

And the effects of moisture on heat transfer are calculated according to the various moisture contents and mean temperatures of the storage media. The results show that moisture contents and mean has considerable effects on heat transfer. The effects depend mainly on the direct effect on thermal conductivity. The contribution of moisture flow to heat diffusion is not so large. It is shown that governing equations can be solved with the linearized approximation except for the case of a high heating temperature or a very low moisture content.

Box 241, Berkeley, 94701, CA, United States","The two major candidates for proton acceleration in impulsive γ-ray producing flares, shock and stochastic acceleration, are considered in light of recent observations of mass motions and turbulence in flares. Starting with the basic problem of energies required, energy storage and the currents which must be involved, it is concluded that the primary energy release must occur close to the temperature minimum region. It is shown that energy can propagate upwards in the form of fast magnetosonic waves which become evanescent in the transition region, converting a large fraction of their energy to mass motions and turbulence. Present observations are mostly of rather coarse (7000 km) spatial resolution and it is quite possible that significantly higher velocities than those observed were present. Using the results of recent simulations of parallel shocks and the well tested theory of Lee (1983) for parallel shock acceleration in the interplanetary medium, it is shown that shock acceleration is a viable candidate at velocities slightly higher than present observations. It is also shown that shocks must be driven by a mass of material which would be visible in coronal lines such as Ca xix for them to be energetically important in proton acceleration. Stochastic acceleration is examined using the hypothesis that there is an equipartition of energy between observed turbulence and magnetic field fluctuations. It is shown that this is a viable acceleration mechanism within a large range of presently observed turbulence provided that the above equipartition hypothesis is valid and the turbulent elements are of small scale (1-200 km). Since turbulence is observed in many flares without any evidence of γ-rays, one of the above conditions must not be satisfied in general. It is concluded that although present observations favor stochastic acceleration, no definitive conclusion can be made without higher spatial resolution observations and additional theoretical work. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250093576

During a period of more than ten days the flight activity of male bumble bees Bombus terrestris follows a constant daily rhythm and they exhibit a constant pattern of large daily food (sugar) intake. The fate of the sugar consumed was studied with especial regard to the following questions: Is it converted into other storage products and, if so, in which organs are they stored? 2. Individual bumble bees were examined at three different times during the daily activity pattern (just before the onset of flight, at the beginning of foraging and at the end of the light period) and the total contents of glucose, fructose, trehalose, sucrose, glycogen and lipid in the thorax, digestive tract and the abdomen (minus digestive tract) measured. 3. No storage of glycogen or lipids was found in the male bumble bees. They store the chemical energy in the form of non-polymeric carbohydrates in the digestive tract. 4. The rates of fuel utilization during the different phases of the daily activity pattern were calculated. For the first time, the sugar consumption rate in male bumble bees during flight was determined directly (7.6 μmoles hexose units/min·g body mass). 5.

It is shown that energy policy has been focused on the reasons for the most recent oil crisis, rather than on the probable causes of the next. Recent reestimates of capacity in OPEC nations suggest that, at any given time, the amount of capacity outside of Saudi Arabia is only 18 Mbbl/d (2,860 ML/d), leaving current surplus capacity at 4 Mbbl/d (636 ML/d). Since the worldwide inventory build from the end of the first quarter of 1979 to the end of the third quarter in 1980 was put at 2. 4 Mbbl/d (382 ML/d), with a quarterly peak of 4. 7 Mbbl/d (747 ML/d) in the third quarter of 1979, current levels of surplus capacity can be seen to be insufficient to prevent another series of price increases in the case of a loss of Saudi supplies due to war, sabotage, or insurrection. Reliance on capacity which is not being produced is also risky. General energy policies are discussed along with methods for coping with disruptions. Current policy is analyzed briefly.",,"ENERGY CONSERVATION; ENERGY POLICY; PETROLEUM INDUSTRY; NATIONAL PETROLEUM COUNCIL; OIL DEMAND REDUCTION; OIL PRICE INCREASES; OIL SUPPLY DISRUPTION; ONSHORE STORAGE CAPACITY; OPEC; ENERGY RESOURCES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023984036

The measurements were performed at different frequencies in the temperature range from -160 °C to the melting point of the sample. The dry gel films were uniaxially drawn at 150 °C to various draw ratios (λ) between 6.5 and 48. The morphology and orientation of the samples were characterized by density, differential scanning calorimetry, infrared dichroism, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, small-angle light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic storage modulus. WAXS studies showed that very high degrees of orientation were achieved at the higher draw ratios. SEM of highly drawn specimens revealed that the initially random texture of crystallites transforms into fibrous form with the fiber axis parallel to the draw direction. DSC and density measurements show that the melting point and crystallinity increase with λ, reaching a maximum at » = 30. The complex elastic modulus (E*) increased with increasing λ and leveled off beyond λ = 40. In the dynamic mechanical measurements the γ peak was either weak or absent in both the loss tangent (tan δ) and loss modulus curves. At a given frequency, the β-relaxation intensity decreased and shifted to lower temperatures with increasing λ. Activation energies (ΔH) of the β dispersion process were obtained from an Arrhenius-type plot of log frequency versus the reciprocal temperature of the β-dispersion maximum. The values of ΔH ranged from 59 to 119 kcal/mol. In the crystalline α-relaxation region a sharp rise in tan δ was observed and the α-peak position shifts to higher temperature with increasing λ. The activation energy for this process is about 53 kcal/mol. On the basis of the dynamic mechanical measurements the origins of the various relaxation processes are discussed. © 1988, American Chemical Society.

However, HpD is a complex mixture whose composition varies in different preparations and with time of storage. The future promise of PDT for cancer treatment depends on the development of new chemically defined sensitizers which absorb more strongly than HpD in the 600-800 nm region. A shift to higher wavelengths is desirable since it allows increased light penetration in human tissues. In vivo, these sensitizers should be non-toxic, localize selectively in tumors and generate cytotoxic species upon illumination with a high quantum yield. These damaging species may be singlet oxygen (1O2) produced by the transfer of energy from the triplet state of the sensitizer to oxygen (Type II) or superoxide anion radicals formed by electron transfer to oxygen or substrate radicals generated by electron or hydrogen transfer directly from the sensitizer (Type I). The recent work of several groups indicating that phthalocyanines and their water soluble derivatives are promising candidates for PDT is reviewed. The photophysics, photochemistry, photosensitized killing of cultured mammalian cells and the use for in vivo photodynamic therapy of phthalocyanines is outlined. Our studies of the post-illumination photohemolysis of human red blood cells as a model system for membrane photomodification sensitized by phthalocyanine sulfonates are consistent with the predominant role of 1O2 as the damaging species. © 1988, SPIE.",,"Blood; Energy transfer; Free radical reactions; Mammals; Oxygen; Photophysics; Photosensitizers; Tumors; Cytotoxic species; Hematoporphyrin derivatives; Human red blood cell; Hydrogen transfer; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Sulfonated derivatives; Superoxide anion radicals; Water-soluble derivatives; Photodynamic therapy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957468414

It has a self-controlled buoyancy changer which is used to control the direction of profiling. The buoyancy changer has two states, full positive or full negative buoyancy. With correct ballasting the instrument has roughly equal up and down profiling speeds. A passive compressible volume appended to the pressure case is used to keep the buoyancy constant during an up or down run despite changes of density of the surrounding seawater, thus keeping the profiling speed and sampling intervals constant throughout a profile. A microcomputer system controls the buoyancy changer, data collection, and internal recording. Battery energy storage for the buoyancy changer is sufficient for 200 consecutive dives to 500 meters, thus 400 profiles. Horizontal components of velocity fluctuations with vertical wavelengths greater than 10 m are sensed using the method of geomagnetic induction. Since the instrument cannot accelerate relative to the fluid surrounding it, changes of its vertical velocity can be measured with a pressure gauge and interpreted as oceanic vertical velocity.

In this system, pyridine nucleotide oxidation, which was enhanced in the presence of ferricyanide, occurred. In the presence or absence of ferricyanide, the oxidation of NADH was several-fold greater than the oxidation of NADPH, indicating that it was the preferred substrate for oxidation in this system. Ferricyanide reduction coupled to NADH oxidation did not require the transmembrane movement of reducing equivalents since ferricyanide incorporated inside the vesicles could not be reduced by NADH added externally to the vesicles, unless the vesicles were made leaky by the addition of 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. Using fluorescent probes for the measurement of transmembrane pH gradients and membrane potentials, it was determined that NADH oxidation did not result in the production of a proton electrochemical gradient or have any effect upon the proton electrochemical gradient produced by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The oxidation of NADH in the presence of ferricyanide did result in the acidification of the reaction medium. This acidification was unaffected by the addition of Gramicidin D and stimulated by the addition of 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, suggesting a scalar (nonvectorial) production of protons in the oxidation/reduction reaction. The results of this study suggest that the oxidation of pyridine nucleotides by plasma membrane vesicles is not related to energization of transport at the plasma membrane or modulation of the activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. © 1988.",,"adenosine triphosphate; ferricyanide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Proton Translocating ATPases; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; article; cell membrane; cell membrane potential; density gradient centrifugation; electrochemistry; energy metabolism; metabolism; microsome; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; plant; transport at the cellular level; Adenosine Triphosphate; Biological Transport; Cell Membrane; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; Electrochemistry; Energy Metabolism; Ferricyanides; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Membrane Potentials; Microsomes; NAD; NADP; Oxidation-Reduction; Plants; Proton-Translocating ATPases; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023956531

The enzymes studied were succinate:cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and oligomycin-sensitive, Mg2+-activated ATPase. For freshly isolated mitochondria the Tf*, for succinate:cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase, occurred at approximately 23 °C and was coincident with a transition in structure, Ts*, determined as the change in temperature coefficient of motion for a spin label intercalated with the membrane lipids. This suggests that the change in thermal response of the membraneassociated enzymes is related to a change in molecular ordering of the membrane lipids. When mitochondria were stored at -12 °C, the specific activities of succinate:cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase decreased. Concomitant with these changes the Ea, above Tf*, increased. After 100 days storage at -12 °C, Ea above Tf* approached the value for Ea below Tf* such that the transition in thermal response could no longer be detected. In contrast, for mitochondria stored at -196 °C, although the specific activity declined over the 100 days storage, no changes in either Ea or Tf* were evident. The results indicate a need for caution in evaluating comparative studies of Tf and Ea, for membrane-associated enzymes, using mitochondria which have been frozen and Stored. © 1988.",,"adenosine triphosphatase (calcium magnesium); Ca(2+) Mg(2+) ATPase; cytochrome c oxidase; hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; oligomycin; oxidoreductase; succinate dehydrogenase; animal; article; enzyme activation; enzymology; freezing; intracellular membrane; kinetics; liver mitochondrion; metabolism; rat; rat strain; thermodynamics; Animal; Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase; Cytochrome-c Oxidase; Enzyme Activation; Freezing; Hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase; Intracellular Membranes; Kinetics; Mitochondria, Liver; Oligomycins; Oxidoreductases; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Succinate Cytochrome c Oxidoreductase; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023953484

Examples from the aircraft industry include hypersonic airplanes in which the fuel serves as a coolant to heat sensitive frame components, and the frame serves as part of the engine. Thus, design changes to any single part have cascading effects on the entire Bystem. This leads to extreme complexity in the design process and requires extensive computational resources and sophisticated computer techniques to proceed in a rational manner. For example, large scale systems theory and multi-level optimization are some of the approaches applicable to this class of design problems. Similarly, in advanced automotive systems, new ideas, which appear at the outset to be and/or affect only subsystems, (e.g., energy storage devices, active suspension systems, etc.) cannot even be considered using other than a vehicle system design, and they also may dramatically alter the system operation. This is particularly important since automobile users are a relatively heterogeneous, unskilled group. A systems approach, which integrates all aspects of product definition, design, manufacturing and use, is required to solve the dilemma. The systems approach requires the development of top-down design tools and techniques for mission definition, functional analysis, concept development and design.

As a result, the protonated Schiff base (PSB) deprotonates, and protons are pumped from inside to the outside of the cell membrane, creating proton gradients that are energetically responsible for making ATP. Using time‐resolved Raman and optical spectroscopic experiments, the following results and possible conclusions are obtained. (1) Unlike chlorophyll, bR does not use an antenna system, i.e., each absorbing molecule is a reaction center. (2) Isomerization of its retinal chromophore, which leads to the first step in energy storage by charge separation, occurs on the subpicosecond time scale. (3) The deprotonation of the PSB and a tyrosine, which occur on the 40 μs time scale, is found to have activation energies comparable to H‐bond energies. This, together with the fact that the temporal quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence follows the time profile of the deprotonation strongly suggests that the latter process is controlled by protein conformation changes. (4) Cations are found to be required for the deprotonation process and are believed to control the protein conformation required for this process. Possible mechanisms responsible for the decrease in the pKa of the PSB from 13.3 to &lt;2.6 during the photocycle, and are thus responsible for the deprotonation process, are discussed.

We carry out the ab‐initio SCF for the entire system, then transform the canonical delocalized molecular orbitals to localized orbitals and include explicitly in the MRD‐CI only the localized occupied and virtual orbitals in the region of interest, folding the remainder of the occupied localized orbitals into an “effective” CI Hamiltonian. The advantage is that the transformations from integrals over atomic orbitals to integrals over molecular orbitals (the computer time‐, computer core‐, and external storage‐ consuming part of the CI calculations) only have to be carried out for the localized orbitals included explicitly in the MRD‐CI calculations. The challenge arose to extend our MRD‐CI technique based on localized/local orbitals and “effective” CI Hamiltonian to the breaking of a chemical bond in a molecule in a crystal (or other solid environment). This past year we have derived, implemented, and used successfully a procedure for doing this. Our technique involves solving a quantum chemical ab‐initio SCF explicitly for a system of a reference molecule surrounded by a number of other molecules in the multipole environment of yet more further out surrounding molecules. The resulting canonical molecular orbitals are then localized and the localized occupied and virtual orbitals in the region of interest are included explicitly in the MRD‐CI with the remainder of the occupied localized orbitals being folded into an “effective” CI Hamiltonian. The MRD‐CI calculations are then carried out for breaking a bond in the reference molecule. This method is completely general. The space treated explicitly quantum chemically and the surrounding space can have defects, deformations, dislocations, impurities, dopants, edges, and surfaces, boundaries, etc. We have applied this procedure successfully to the H3C—NO2 bond dissociation of nitromethane with extensive testing of the number of molecules that have to be included explicitly in the SCF and how many further out molecules have to be represented by multipoles. To check the goodness of the model cluster approximation for crystalline nitromethane, we carried out ab‐initio crystal orbital (XTLORB) calculations using our POLY‐CRYST program. The difference in the XTLORB total energies between the 4 nitromethane molecules/unit cell and the 3 nitromethane molecules/unit cell (Table VIII), ER = E4 – E3 = −48.0609079 a.u., corresponds very closely to the reduced energy per nitromethane molecule, ER = (−;48.0605)9 a.u., calculated from explicit SCF calculations on the model nitromethane cluster in the multipole field of farther out nitromethane molecules for the model cluster. Thus, the multipole approximation for describing the effect of further out molecules on the SCF cluster energies is quite good.

Fatty acids enter a number of metabolic pathways not directly related to energy storage and production; the unifying theme is that the fatty acids are not only structurally altered in these pathways, but that the alterations carry them from one area of biological significance into another. This theme is developed by offering a perspective on fatty acids in insects and then reviewing three major areas: 1) fatty acid composition, 2) biosynthesis of fatty acids (including polyunsaturated fatty acids and characteristics of certain biosynthetic enzymes), and 3) the biological significance of fatty acids. This last section includes discussions of the biochemistry of waxes, pheromones, and prostaglandins and the roles of fatty acids as components of defensive secretions. Little is known at the biochemical level about the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, and it is suggested that work in this area represents another frontier in insect biochemistry.

The presence of the fiber increases the storage modulus at any deformation amplitude. Depending on the nature of the fiber, the linear response zone of the modulus versus deformation either diminishes or disappears. The loss factor tan δ is higher in fiber composites. Although the peaks do not vary in magnitude, they occur at different deformation amplitudes. Temperature increase causes the moduli to decrease, the gradient, however, being less pronounced for fiber composites. The relaxation spectra show a damping peak which correlates to the principal relaxation process in the elastomeric matrix. The temperature at which this peak appears is displaced towards higher values with increasing excitation frequency. This allows the determination of the apparent relaxation activation energy, which is higher in fiber plus adhesive composites (225 – 275 kJ/mol), as compared to the fiber‐free composite (194 kJ/mol), as a consequence of stronger fiber‐matrix interaction. © 1988 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag, Basel",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985566374

The oxidation stability of the corresponding high‐fat dietary regimens (50 energy‐ %) was also investigated. The experimental groups L, LS, B and H were compared to the control group (C) fed low‐fat laboratory pellet‐food. The coefficients of oxidizability were calculated from the fattyacid composition of the used pure fats. The oxidation stability was performed in condition of accelerated oxidation under kinetic regimen, assaying the peroxide concentration in appropriate time intervals. The coefficients of oxidizability of dietary fats and storage lipids were very similar. This is explained by the fact that the fatty‐acid composition of storage lipids reflected that of the corresponding high‐fat diets. The oxidation stabilities in storage lipids were markedly lower than these in the respective dietary regimens. The highest oxidation stability in lipids from adipose tissue was found in group B, and the lowest in group LS. Contrarywise. the oxidation stability in liver lipid showed the following declining sequence: C > H > L > LS > B. The discrepancies in oxidation stability of the various specimens (pure fats, dietary fats, storage and structural lipids) may be explicated by an intervention of factors with pro‐ and anti‐oxidative action. The large deviations in fatty acid composition in the examined tissues in comparison to the composition of the respective high‐fat diets may also play an important role in this respect. These parallel studies on oxidation stability at different levels could improve our possibilities for evaluation of the stability and biological value of fats.

Storage can, therefore, occur in N‐deficient plants; accumulation can not. The consequence of accumulation and storage of N is considered, particularly in relation to the reproductive growth of annual plants, which can often use a great deal of stored N. Nitrate and proteins are the forms of N most often stored in vegetative tissues and, quantitatively, ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is often the most important protein store. While storing nitrate will be less costly to the plant in terms of energy, protein stores offer several possible advantages. These advantages are (i) maximizing the potential for carbon assimilation, (ii) avoiding problems with the regulation of leaf turgor and (iii) allowing the reduction on nitrate to occur in the young, fully illuminated leaf.

Several different damage morphologies were observed: slip-line formation, ripple patterns, flat melting, and boiling. Damage probability versus fluence curves and accumulation curves are plotted to investigate damage behavior as it correlates with morphology. Flat-melting damage was observed near the 50% damage fluence on chemically polished copper surfaces, and slip lines were found near the 50% damage fluence on electropolished aluminum surfaces. Surface defects produced during sample preparation greatly influenced the damage threshold of copper because of its high melting threshold. Accumulation curves showed different damage behavior for crystals of different orientation. Accumulation was the largest on (111) Cu and Al surfaces, and the single-shot damage threshold of these surfaces was less than the other crystal orientations for both Cu and Al. The threshold reduction in accumulation follows the equation FN = F1NS_1, where FN is the N-pulse damage threshold, N is the pulse number, and S is the slope of the accumulation curve. Accumulation appears to be the result of the storage cycle of thermal stress-strain energy induced by a laser pulse. The total strain energy induced by N laser pulses is proportional to N1/3 for the measured values of S, which is 0.92. © 1988, Optical Society of America.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975576956

The energy system for the SAGA submarine consists of two V4–275R Stirling engines of maximum 100 kW power each. The oxygen storage, manufactured by AGA Cryo in Gothenburg, consists of two liquid oxygen tanks providing a total capacity of 10000 kWh, allowing the submarine to perform missions of up to 14 days submerged. © 1988, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

We find that the Ar15+1s22sion can undergo dielectronic recombination through a set of doubly excited states 1s22p10lin Ar14+that lies just above the ionization limit. Recombination occurs when the DR resonance profile overlaps the electron velocity profile as viewed from the reference frame of an ion. The recombination rate coefficient is found for the case of a flattened electron distribution interacting with a one-dimensional ion beam. Losses generally depend upon the electron density and temperature, the initial and final ion temperatures, the cooling rate, and very sensitively on the energies of the participating auto-ionizing states. We find, however, for the model adopted, that the losses depend only weakly on the ion temperature. Using typical values for electron and ion temperatures and the present theoretical atomic data, we find that DR losses of a continuously cooled Ar15+ion beam are negligible, giving a beam storage half-life which is much longer than those due to electron capture from the rest gas and radiative recombination from the electron beam. In a worst case, where the energy of the maximum DR cross section was chosen to coincide with the maximum of the electron energy distribution, the conclusion based on the original data is still valid. © 1988 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956108828

The wind energy converters, equipped with asynchronous generators, and a fast pitch control, work parallel with a synchronous generator. The generator is driven by a diesel engine by means of an overrunning clutch, or started by a small DC-motor. If the diesel is off, or the starting process by the DC-motor is finished, the synchronous generator works as a rotating phase-shifter and takes over voltage control and supply of reactive power. The speed versus power control of the wind energy converters does not only make possible an optimized parallel operation with the diesel-generator unit, but also directly takes over frequency control when operated singly without diesel engine. The location of the wind energy plants does not depend on the site of the diesel engine, because control cables are not necessary. To avoid too frequent starting of the diesel, a storage battery is installed.

The aspect ratio of the surface electrode configuration has been varied over three decades and the magnitude of the impedance, instead of being linear in this ratio as in the classical surface conduction with a uniform surface conductance, is found to follow a power law at small values of this ratio and an exponential law at larger values, suggesting the presence of surface dispersion. The conductance is also exponentially dependent on the relative humidity of the ambient air, suggesting the importance of percolation phenomena. The charging and discharging currents vary very slowly in time and their magnitudes are strongly nonlinear in the amplitude of the step voltage, pointing clearly to the importance of electrochemical storage of charge and of energy, as distinct from the classical electrostatic processes. Phenomena of negative capacitance are seen in certain circumstances. Probing of the space between the electrodes shows the surface potential to be distributed and not to be predominantly concentrated at the electrodes. The behavior of glass, mica, and silicon nitride was found to be very similar.

The most important factor for the actual operation of chemical heat pump is reaction rate. In the present work, liquid ammoniate NH4NO3·nNH3 was selected as a low temperature material, because the dissociation rate of liquid ammoniate is relatively fast even at low temperatures. NiCl2·6NH3 has been adopted as a high temperature material. The present chemical heat pump system consists of the following reactions; High temperature reaction: Low temperature reaction: On the basis of preliminary experiments, a bench scale system was constructed. NH4NQ3 (677 g), charged in a low-temperature vessel made of Pyrex glass, was ammoniated at 0°C until NH4NO3·2.4 NH3 was formed. The low temperature vessel was connected to high temperature vessels (280 mm in length and 50 mm diameter, made of SUS 304) containing NiCl2·6NH3 (480 g in total weight in 5 vessels). At the heat storage stage, NH3 gas generated from the high-temperature vessels by heating at 195°C in a silicone oil bath was successfully absorbed by the liquid ammoniate within 8 h. At the heat-releasipg stage, the reaction of NiCl2·2 NH3 with NH3 proceeded in the high-temperature-vessels, which were immersed in a water bath, whereas the NH3 gas was generated from NH4NO3·nNH3 at 0°C. The flow rate of NH3 gas was well suited for NH3 absorption with Ni salt, and the reaction was completed in 2 h. The amount of released heat was calculated from the temperature increase of the water bath. The recovered thermal energy was 388 kj amounting to 75% of the ideal value 520 kj. Similar results were obtained even after 20 cycles of operation. © 1988, The Chemical Society of Japan. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905227064

Reactions at oxide electrodes have attracted the attention of electrochemists for both fundamental and technological reasons. The semiconducting properties of many oxides, for example, can be advantageously used to test current theories on electron transfer at electrochemical interfaces. Unlike a metal, where the number density of carriers is fairly constant and the energy can be varied over a wide range by means of the electrode potential, in the case of semiconducting oxides, the number of electrical carriers on the surface may be varied over a narrow energy range, although the span of available energies is more limited. Metallic oxides are employed, often as coatings or thin films, as electrode materials for a range of electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen evolution and reduction, chlorine evolution, and organic electrosynthesis. The ideal oxide electrode for a fundamental kinetic study is an oxide single crystal, where the surface exposed to the electrolyte is well defined geometrically, chemically, and morphologically. Oxide materials that are attractive because of their catalytic activity are often employed in the form of finely divided powders of considerable surface area. An oxide electrode in equilibrium with the aqueous solution is a multicomponent system with metal, oxygen, and hydrogen ions in both places. Metal oxides that undergo proton-insertion reactions find extensive application in batteries and are currently being investigated as potential electrochromic materials. The oxygen electrode is of major importance to energy conversion, storage, and conservation. © 1987, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956804235

But in practice, one discovers that like the mechanical dispersion phenomena in mass transfer problems, heat mechanical dispersion cannot be neglected. The simulated temperatures agree very well with the field data. The parameters obtained from the multiwell experiment can be extended to simulate the data obtained from the double well experiment at the same location.

A particle-tracking algorithm is developed to extract accurate Lagrangian statistics from numerically calculated velocity fields. Lagrangian time-series are obtained from the method of direct numerical simulation, which supplies the Eulerian' velocity field on a three-dimensional grid network. The accuracy of the Lagrangian time series depends; primarily; on the accuracy of the interpolation scheme used to calculate fluid-particle velocities. Interpolation schemes based on Taylor series and on cubic splines have been implemented and tested. Errors in computed particle displacements are quantified for simple, frozen velocity fields. The algorithm is applied to stationary homogeneous isotropic turbulence with the energy maintained by artificial forcing. It is demonstrated that with adequate spatial resolution, accurate estimates of Lagrangian statistics such as velocity autocorrelations, structure functions, and frequency spectra can be obtained either with a third-order Taylor series interpolation scheme or with a cubic spline scheme. Cubic splines give higher interpolation accuracy, but they are more difficult to implement in codes that rely on secondary storage. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5544293744

Widely separated measurements have quite clearly delineated many large scale features such as, (1) plasma sheet thinning associated with the onset of substorms, (2) energy storage and release in the magnetotail associated with the growth and expansion phase of substorms, (3) the earthward and tailward field aligned currents associated with the dawn and dusk portions of the substorm current wedge and (4) the deep tail response that follows substorms detected near synchronous orbit. Smaller scale phenomena that must be observed on finer time scales and detected in more limited spatial regions have been studied by ISEE 1 and 2 and a number of spacecraft near geosynchronous orbit. Injection fronts that are sometimes thought to propagate earthward toward synchronous orbit are difficult to detect and observed time delays may be due at least partially to longitudinal expansions of the substorm current wedge. Measurements near the equatorial current sheet where substorm onsets are often thought to originate, frequently reveal rapid time variations yet nearby spacecraft are seldom available to help determine whether these variations are due to local turbulence or more coherent behavior on a somewhat larger scale. High time resolution measurements from the Cluster and ISTP programs should help rectify these ambiguities. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249032774

In this paper, a procedure has been developed to maximize the area of the surface irrigated. The analysis considers the interaction of four subsystems: local climate, irrigated crops, soil and photovoltaic pumping equipment. At first the mechanical energy available in the shaft of the moto-pump is calculated by the utilizability method. Then an analytical relation between mechanical energy, volume of pumped water and manometric height is obtained and correlated with experimental results. This correlation is used to obtain the volume of pumped water as a function of mechanical energy. Finally, a water balance is done, considering the irrigated surface as a variable. The maximum surface which can be irrigated has to satisfy the following conditions: (a) the water supply has to satisfy the water demand at any time of the year, (b) the water stored in the soil has, for safety reasons, to be no less than 20% of its field capacity. The procedure is illustrated with an example developed for a crop of grapes in the area of Petrolina PE, Brasil. The maximum surface which can be irrigated with a 450 W photovoltaic equipment results, in this example, to be equal to 1.57 ha. When the storage capacity is not considered, the maximum area becomes equal to 1.44 ha. The procedure can also be used to determine the optimum inclination angle of the photovoltaic panels. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249032321

The components of the PHF system are: food processing, transportation, storage and cooking. The study is rather ambitious in its coverage of 70 processed commodities in 90 countries of Africa, Latin America, the Far East and Near East. This was possible because of the considerable variety of computer data available at FAO for such an analysis. Of course, extensive checking was required for each country but much of the approximations remain, leading only to broad implications. Despite the difficulties with precise data, it seems reasonable to draw the following conclusions from the available information: the post-harvest-food system requires 2 to 4 times more energy than at farm level: the share of commercial energy which is often used for food processing, such as milling, crushing, and food transport, and to some extent for cooking, ranges between 22% in Africa and 80% in the Near East; the levels of energy consumption in the PHF system depends on income levels and extent of urbanization, and whether a country has locally available fossil fuels or forests. In addition, different components of the PHF system are sensitive to different parameters. For example, energy in food processing depends on cropping, dietary patterns, and whether food is exported or imported, whereas food transport depends on the size of the countries and location of urban areas with respect to farms. These parameters are discussed here for the four worl regions as well as for the 90 developing countries as a whole. Country-specific insights are given graphically due to impracticability of reporting all data in detail. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249030859

With collectors placed on roofs and storage tanks on the ground, the usual gravity-assisted heat pipes cannot be used for the required heat transfer process. A passive pumping heat pipe system has been designed and tested for an elevation of 3 m. The main system consists of: (i) a boiler which uses hot collector fluid to evaporate acetone; (ii) a condenser which uses the storage tank's fluid to condense acetone vapor coming from the boiler; (iii) an accumulator which collects acetone coming from the condenser. The accumulator temperature is kept near the prevailing surrounding temperature. Condensed acetone is pumped to the accumulator by virtue of a pressure difference between condenser and accumulator. The accumulator charge is transferred to the boiler by gravity as the boiler accumulator pressure is equalized. Governing equations that model the transient behavior of various system components are developed and solved.

Montreal, Que. H3G 1M8, Canada","Seasonal storage of chilled water in a large underground reservoir was studied by considering a two-dimensional heat flow in water and the soil surrounding the cistern, and by employing a finite-difference technique for the numerical solution of the energy equations. The cistern considered in the analysis was similar to those which have been employed in the hot, arid region of Iran for centuries for the storage of cold potable winter water for summer use. These cisterns were filled with cold water in winter and water removal did not start until mid-spring. During the water storage and usage, there was always a wind-induced airflow over the water surface to maintain an evaporation rate from the water surface. In these cisterns the water removal was from the bottom at such small flow rates that the thermal stratification in the cistern was not disturbed. It was found that while the temperature of water at the surface was high and followed the ambient air temperature closely, the temperature of the water removed from the bottom was very low, although it increased gradually toward the end of the storage season. During the summer months the temperature of water removed from the bottom of the cistern was below 10°C. This temperature was found to be a function of the size of the cistern, the weather conditions, the initial temperature of water in the cistern, the soil properties, and the year of operation of the cistern. The system analyzed here finds applications in the hot, arid regions of the developing countries for the storage of cold winter water for drinking, for food preservation, or for other agricultural and industrial applications. It can also be used for air conditioning of buildings. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249030433

The response of the alga was found to differ in these lichens. In P. sulcata the dark treatment caused a decrease in starch grains, lipid-rich pyrenoglobuli and peripheral cytoplasmic storage bodies and an increase in pyrenoid and chloroplast protein bodies. The algae in P. laevigata contained little starch and no chloroplast protein bodies. However, after dark treatment, starch, cytoplasmic storage bodies and pyrenoid dimensions sometimes declined, while pyrenoglobuli numbers increased. Some of these apparent changes depended upon the units used for calculating the cross-sectional areas of structures, e.g. absolute units, percentage of cell wall, protoplast or chloroplast cross-sectional area. Chloroplast area increased in the dark (as a % of cell wall area) in both species while mitochondria were larger in the dark in P. sulcata but not in P. laevigata. Ultrastructural changes were not clearly correlated with changes in photosynthetic and respiratory rates. These results directly support the suggestion that some intra-cellular structures are energy-generating reserves the dimensions of which can rapidly change. © 1988 Annals of Botany Company.","Lichen algae; Light and dark storage; Organdie dimensions; Parmelia laevigata; Parmelia sulcata; Reserve substances; Starvation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249029338

Light affects stomata directly and indirectly. Light can act directly as an energy source resulting in ATP formation within guard cells via photophosphorylation, or as a stimulus as in the case of the blue light effects which cause guard cell H+ extrusion. Light also acts indirectly on stomata by affecting photosynthesis which influences the intercellular leaf CO2 concentration (Ci). Carbon dioxide concentrations in contact with the plasma membrane of the guard cell or within the guard cell acts directly on cell processes responsible for stomatal movements. The mechanism by which CO2 exerts its effect is not fully understood but, at least in part, it is concerned with changing the properties of guard cell plasma membranes which influence ion transport processes. The Ci may remain fairly constant for much of the day for many species which is the result of parallel responses of stomata and photosynthesis to light. Leaf water potential also influences stomatal behaviour. Since leaf water potential is a resultant of water uptake and storage by the plant and transpirational water loss, any factor which affects these processes, such as soil water availability, temperature, atmospheric humidity and air movement, may indirectly affect stomata. Some of these factors, such as temperature and possibly humidity, may affect stomata directly. These direct and indirect effects of environmental factors interact to give a net opening response upon which is superimposed a direct effect of stomatal circadian rhythmic activity.

Such a limitation may result from the small size of reproductive organs in the initial stages of development, which precludes absorbing all the surplus energy that the maternal individual can assimilate. When temporary storage of energy is impossible or too costly, a gradual switch from vegetative to reproductive growth will be optimal. An algorithm is provided to determine the age at which energy allocation to reproduction should start, and the age at which vegetative growth should cease altogether. In the case of a gradual switch, the seed yield is only slightly lower then it would have been if an instantaneous switch-over had been possible. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249028426

These were evaluated in situ on individual frozen-thawed bull spermatozoa collected at different times during in vitro capacitation. The results showed that in bull spermatozoa both the initiation of motility and capacity to fertilize eggs were associated with the anaerobic rather than aerobic glycolysis. The freezing-thawing processes and storage in liquid nitrogen induced a general enhancement of both the enzymatic activities examined. The high ionic strength treatment gave rise to a significant but reversible decrease in both the cytochrome oxidase and LDH activities in the fresh as well as in the frozen-stored sperm. The findings, based on cytochemical observations of energy metabolism of spermatozoa and evaluated during in vitro capacitation, suggest that the respiration and the anaerobic glycolysis of spermatozoa seem to be slightly impaired by the freezing-thawing and storage processes. © 1988.","bull; energy metabolism; freezing; in vitro capacitation; spermatozoa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249027940

The latter channel leads to long term storage of optical energy. Charged pair storage densities of 1017 cm-3 are routinely realized, and retention times as long as 35 h have been directly verified. The trapped ion-hole pair may recombine either through tunneling or thermal activation of the self-trapped hole.

Temporally and spectrally resolved phosphorescence and thermoiuminescence are used for the characterization of the trapped state energetics and their recombination dynamics.

The amount of glycogen appeared to increase progressively during pregnancy and then decreased gradually after parturition. In contrast, little glycogen was found in cycling cows. There was no direct relationship between glycogen deposition and frequency of parturition.

The measured energy distribution curve (EDC) furnishes information on the electronic density of states distribution in the valence band, nearest to the core levels and surface states. The measured angle resolved EDC's provide the possibility to determine the energy-momentum E(k) dependence of electrons in the bulk of the crystal and on the surface. Application of the synchrotron-storage ring system as a source of ultraviolet radiation in the energy range from 10 to 300 eV opens new avenues to investigate structure of electronic states. It features the following possibilities: (1) To distinguish the contribution of the surface and bulk states to the obtained EDC by measuring the change of the EDC when varying the exciting energy hv around the minimum of the escape depth (E = 80 eV) and outside of this region. (2) To discriminate in the valence band the contribution of the d-electrons from that of the s-p electrons due to a different change of the photoemission cross section of the d and s-p electrons with a change of hv. (3) To recognize the localized and delocalized contribution to the density of states in the valence band and to determine E(k) for these electrons by measurements of the angle resolved EDC. (4) To obtain information on the initial and final state distribution using the constant initial states (CIS) and/or constant final states (CFS) techniques. The potential of the photoemission technique will be illustrated by the results of the electronic structure investigation of some metals and semiconductors. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25944475132

The temperature distributions during the test periods through the absorbing plate, the glass covers, the cooking pot, the cooking fluid, the storage medium and the ambient were determined. The diurnal variations of incident global solar insolation were presented. The utilization of sensible heat storage medium such as sand was investigated thoroughly. A jacket of sand ( 1 2-cm thick) around the cooking pot has improved the cooker performance tremendously. The temperature differences between the heat source and the heat sink during the test time were determined and the results were discussed. Six hour per day of cooking time has been recorded. Approximately three hours per day of indoor cooking has been achieved. An overall energy conversion efficiency up to 28.4% has been obtained which is considered the best among other solar cookers in the literature. The possibility of using a phase change material as a storage medium to obtain longer cooking periods was studied. A thin layer of the salt hydrate Ba(OH)2·8H2O as a jacket around the cooking pot was suggested. The cost of the whole cooker is not more than $15 including the pot and the labour expenses. A step for commercial production of two-pots-solar-cooker has been taken.

The demand is relatively small. Somewhere between 500 and 1000 tonnes of niobium are expected to be used in superconducting devices to be produced over the next ten years; the large range in demand being due to the uncertainty about whether or not the latest proposals to build new particle physics colliders will be approved. The impact of possible space programs has not been considered. The quantity of niobium contained in the primary ore needed for alloy and compound production will be about double this amount, to compensate for losses incurred during the various stages of production to final product. By comparison, world-wide steel industry demands for niobium are around 15 000 tonnes per year. Thus the world superconductor industry is very small. Fears that there may be a shortage of niobium for superconducting applications are unfounded. A major world supplier of ferro-niobium and niobium oxide is Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao (CBMM) of Brazil and most of the raw material used in the practical superconducting alloys comes from this source. Reserves in the CBMM mine alone are adequate to supply projected world needs for all purposes for at least 500 years. Other world sources of niobium exist and some are being worked, but they contain lower concentrations of niobium in the ore than those in the CBMM mine and therefore they cost more to extract. In spite of the importance of niobium in technology it is not a strategic mineral because of its world-wide abundance and the availability of substitutes for its major applications. A new development in superconductivity has been the discovery of the ceramic oxide superconductors in the last two years with critical temperatures close to 100 K, offering the possibility of cheaper and simpler liquid nitrogen cooling, as opposed to liquid helium cooling, for some future superconducting applications. Near-term applications in simple electronic devices are expected but for present day and projected applications, niobium-based alloys and compounds are likely to be the workhorses of superconductivity for the remainder of this century. The major commercial superconductor application, to date, is that for whole-body magnetic imaging as a tool in medical diagnostics. These units began to reach the market-place in 1982 and over one thousand are now in use world-wide. A further recent development is the use of superconducting r.f. cavities using high purity niobium sheet. Machines using these devices will need over 30% of the total niobium demand for applied superconductivity over the next five or six years. A potential demand is that for new colliding beam accelerators proposed for particle physics and nuclear physics research. If they are built, about 600 tonnes of niobium will be needed for these machines. Requirements for energy industry technologies and transportation, so high about 15 years ago, are likely to be dismally low for the next 20 years or so. Other commercial uses for superconducting magnets at present are those for gyrotrons, magnetic separators and research and development activities. In addition to machines for physics research, smaller accelerators with superconducting magnets are under development for use in medical and industrial applications and for the production of high intensity X-ray light sources. The energy related applications are not yet commercial but the required superconducting magnet technology has been developed over the last 25 years. Applications include magnetic fusion, superconducting generators, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, superconducting power transmission and energy storage, current limiters and superconducting transformers. Successful high-speed land transportation systems based on superconducting magnet levitation have been demonstrated, as have superconducting ship drives. A wide range of superconducting instrumentation is in everyday use and the possibilities for superconducting computers continue to be studied. The status of these various technologies is discussed in the following paragraphs. © 1988.",,"Superconducting magnets; Superconducting materials; Superconductivity; NIOBIUM DEMAND; NIOBIUM SUPERCONDUCTOR APPLICATIONS; NIOBIUM SUPPLY; NIOBIUM AND ALLOYS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442266954

Their model was that of a rigid rotor with spherical repulsion, but anisotropic polarizability. In this paper, we contend that models employing a rigid diatom are quite unrealistic to discuss complex lifetime, since the latter is predominantly determined by intermediate energy storage into vibration. We use, instead, a model system with three pair potentials of the Morse type and vary the equilibrium distances to generate different anisotropics of the potential. Trajectory calculations show a definite influence of this parameter both on the complex formation cross section and on lifetime. These lifetimes are one order of magnitude longer than those computed with the rigid diatom model, after the calculations have been scaled to the same masses and potential parameters. The lifetimes turn out to be roughly proportional to the period of the fastest normal mode of the intermediate molecule, and their behavior is generally in accord with RRKM theory. © 1987 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11744264749

Buffers containing the non-ionic detergent Lubrol-PX were more efficient for solubilizing the enzyme and exhibited little inactivation effect when compared with Triton X-100-containing buffers. The acetylthiocholine-splitting activity was shown to be that of true AChE on the basis of inhibitor sensitivity and substrate inhibition. The enzyme from Lubrol-containing and detergent-free extracts had an optimum pH for activity of 9 and 8.7, respectively. The optimum temperature for activity was 45°C. The Arrhenius plot showed that the enzyme has an activation energy of 26 ± 0.8 kJ mol-1. Bee head AChE was susceptible to the presence of divalent cations but monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+ did not induce any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 1 M. By contrast, they exhibited an activation effect with a maximum at 0.2 M. Histochemical localization for AChE on frozen sections of honeybees confirmed its specificity as true AChE by the use of specific inhibitors such as iso-OMPA, BW284C51 and eserine. The main AChE activity was located in the neuropil appearing as diffused or clumped dots. An AChE activity coating nuclei of neurones and glial cells in the vicinity of the neuropile was detected with Koelle's reaction. Such a distribution suggests different sites for synthesis, storage, transit and secretion for AChE in the brain. © 1988.","acetylcholinesterase; bee; insect; solubilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344694443

The goal of this work was to better understand how hydrogen transfer occurs in heterogeneous catalysis. Three reactions were studied: cyclohexene disproportionation, cyclohexene hydrogenation, and benzene hydrogenation. A gas-phase, microcatalytic reactor was used to obtain the data. The results were analyzed in terms of their activities, apparent activation energies, and selectivities. It was found that all the catalysts (except 0.001% Pt Al2O3) were active catalysts for benzene hydrogenation. The apparent Ea's were between 42 and 50 kJ/mole. The activities decreased in the following manner, Pt &gt; Ni &gt; Pd. In contrast, during cyclohexene disproportionation, the apparent Ea's varied among catalysts (Pt ≈ 84, Pd ≈ 50, and Ni ≈ 25 kJ/mole), but their activities at 100 °C were similar (except 0.01 and 0.001% Pt Al2O3). During cyclohexene disproportionation, it was also found that the selectivity was a function of temperature. There existed a transition temperature below which the correct stoichiometry for cyclohexene disproportionation was observed, and above which the selectivity (measured as moles cyclohexane produced/moles benzene produced) decreased with temperature. This transition temperature varied with type of metal (T was ≈60 °C for Ni, ≈90 °C for Pd, and ≈110 °C for Pt). The results can be explained as a competition between two reactions, intermolecular hydrogen transfer among cyclohexene molecules and cyclohexene dehydrogenation. The idea of reaction occurring over a carbonaceous overlayer was used to explain the observed similar activities at 100 °C, and also the varying apparent Ea's among catalysts. Furthermore, the catalysts' capacity for hydrogen storage seems to be a fundamental part of the mechanism. If the capacity for hydrogen storage is impaired, then activity and selectivity are greatly altered. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343254857

The species examined were selected to include the three types of the system previously identified: Type 1 with complete systems, Type 2 with attenuated systems, and Type 3 with ordinary bundle sheaths. In Type 3 the dye selectively entered the bundle sheath cells. The hypothesis that the entry of the dye to a cell is caused by local low external pH, which suppresses its ionization, is confirmed by tests of the response of sulphorhodamine uptake to changing external pH, and of the inhibition of uptake by the ionophore dinitrophenol. An extension of this hypothesis identifies the local pH gradient as an energy source driving influx pumps to scavenge solutes from the transpiration stream and store them in special cells. It is proposed that this may be broadened to include many legumes. The activity of the proton extrusion pumps in this storage network is shown to be correlated with the flowering and fruiting of soybean, showing high activity before flowering, and disappearing during pod formation when nitrogenous materials are exported from the network.

This formulation is consistent with the displacement method of analysis in the sense that it uses displacement as input. The developed brace model also involves a limited number of degrees of freedom and can be efficiently incorporated into the conventional computer programs for nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures. The developed model requires limited input data and little computer storage capacity, Comparisons are also made between the analytical predictions of the model and cyclic test results on steel struts. The results indicate a reasonable degree of accuracy in theoretical predictions. The developed brace model can be useful in nonlinear analysis and design of brace frame systems. It can also provide researchers with an efficient tool for investigating the details of nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of braced structural systems. © ASCE.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043047804

The choice is not easy to make notably when the building falls in a temperate climatic zone. This paper tackles the selection of materials for usage in buildings from different angles to ensure the ease of selection. First, the optimal economic thickness of an insulation material is determined very accurately using the minimum life-cycle cost method and the annual heating degree days (AHDDs) for different sites. From this, the optimal thermal transmittance (U-value) for the building structure in a given climatic zone is determined. Second, a graphic relationship between U-value vs AHDDs is established. Third, annual energy savings in kWh ton-1 of insulation material is calculated. From this, the pay-back period of energy consumed in manufacturing the installed thermal insulation material is calculated. The higher the pay-back period the less desirable is the use of thermal insulation materials and more favourable is the use of high mass materials. This approach is well reasoned to allow its extensibility to all buildings in all climatic zones. It should certainly give insight to the possible contribution of solar energy in meeting demand for active and passive heating/cooling of buildings.

Studies on neutrophil storage show generalized defects involving energy metabolism, phagocytosis, microbial killing, chemotaxis, membrane receptors, microtubules, microfilaments, and stimulus-response coupling. Some storage conditions are more detrimental to certain functions than others, e.g. cold induces a severe chemotactic defect. Thus, room temperature storage is preferable to refrigerated storage. For optimal storage, it is necessary to have sufficient glucose in the medium and to maintain an adequate pH. During storage, a dismantling of the functional integrity of the cell occurs with the most highly integrated functions being lost initially, while primitive functions are retained the longest. With minor exceptions, the generalized metabolic, structural, and functional defects noted in stored neutrophils are not peculiar to storage but most likely mirror the inexorable in vivo programmed senescence of the neutrophil. © 1988.",,"blood storage; cell culture; cytology; human; human cell; microorganism; neutrophil; phagocytosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024274366

Energy is needed for all human biologic functions. Under normal circumstances, energy sources require gastrointestinal digestion and absorption prior to utilization. Certain enteral substrates bypass digestion, and all parenteral nutritional substrates bypass both digestion and absorption. Catabolism and anabolism are dynamic processes that interact to keep the body in equilibrium and supplied with necessary energy. Packaging of carbohydrates as glycogen and storage of fatty acids and glycerol as neutral fat are the normal processes that supply storage of energy for short-term and long-term needs, respectively. Glycogen and fat are catabolized for energy when intake is inadequate for expenditure. Glucose is the preferred energy substrate for catabolism in the nonstress state. Because protein cannot be synthesized from other energy substrates, its ongoing catabolism must be offset by daily intake for maintenance of equilibrium and prevention of protein-lack malnutrition. Different organs have varying energy needs and abilities to metabolize certain energy substrates. Regulation of the metabolism involving carbohydrate, lipids, and proteins is a complex interaction between energy needs and energy availability plus the influences of catabolic and anabolic hormones.

Data produced by a general circulation model are used to obtain plausible estimates of the energy flux across 70oS, where direct estimates tend to be poor. We find that the heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean-cryosphere system plays a much larger role in the Arctic than in the Antarctic polar cap.

Energy is used to melt the snow, evaporate the water, and through thawing of the active layer, provide storage capacity of the groundwater. Water and ice distributed within and on the tailings affect the surface albedo, the thermal properties of the soil which in turn alters the rates of heat conduction, frost penetration and thawing front propagation.

The purpose of this simulation is to identify the conditions for which the effects of hydrodynamic instabilities are minimized. The equations used to model the system are discretized using Q1 finite elements in space and an Euler's semi-implicit scheme in time.

The rAAT injection solution (1.0 mg/ml, pH 7.5, triple buffer of phosphate, Tris, and glycine, 0.075 M each) was filtered through a 0.2-µm filter and packaged in individual vials with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals. The vials were stored at 90, 80, 60, 45, 35, and 25°C, and samples taken at predetermined time intervals for each storage condition. Each sample was then filtered through a 0.2-µm filter to remove particulates. The filtrate was then assayed for total protein by the biuret–phenol method. A typical first-order loss of rAAT was observed. Data were fitted to a first-order kinetics, and the shelf life (defined as t90, the time for the product to reach 90% remaining) was calculated from the resultant rate constant. The shelf lives were plotted against reciprocals of storage temperatures (a modified Arrhenius plot). A linear regression line (r = 0.9831) was drawn through the data points and extrapolated to 4°C. At 4°C, the predicted shelf life of the rAAT solution is 5.1 months. In real life, a batch of the rAAT solution showed that 61% of the rAAT remained in the filtrate after 18 months of storage at 4°C. The observed stability compares fairly well with the predicted value of 69% for the same duration of storage at 4°C. From the slope of the linear regression line, the activation energy for the particulate formation of the rAAT was calculated to be 19 kcal.

As a result the metabolic pathways followed by these fats in an organism are different and simpler, or identical but more rapid, than those followed by long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Consequently the MCTs have found numerous applications in oral or enteral nutrition and, more recently, in parenteral nutrition. The infusion of conventional fat emulsions in stress and sepsis is still controversial. A main question is whether an MCT supply can be beneficial for these patients. In this review, we will discuss different aspects of modified lipid and protein metabolism: exchanges between exogenous fat particles and lipoproteins; exogenous fat clearance, storage, and oxidation; reticuloendothelial system function; nitrogen balance; and hepatic function. For each of these perturbations, the MCT/LCT and structured lipid emulsions are theoretically capable to provide an appropriate solution. The efficiency of these emulsions has been demonstrated experimentally on animal models of stress and sepsis.

In the ISV process, electrodes are inserted around a volume of contaminated soil, power is applied to the electrodes, and the entire mass is melted from the surface of the soil down through the contaminated zone, thus making a glassy-to-microcrystalline waste form that incorporates the contaminants. Gases produced during the melting are collected, treated, monitored, and released through an off-gas process trailer. In the ORNL demonstration, a 25,000-kg mass of melted rock approximately 1.2 m thick × 2.1 m wide × 4.9 m long was formed during 110 h of operation that consumed approximately 29 MWh of power. Data obtained on the operational performance of the test and waste-form durability will be used to assess the feasibility of applying the ISV technology to an actual waste trench. © 1988.",,"methodology; radioactive waste disposal; underground storage; vitrification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024240016

Exercise performance was studied during incremental cycle ergometry in six typical patients with non-specific muscle pains and in six patients with McArdle’s disease. The patients in general had a lower content of mitochondria in their muscles than the controls. The patients with nonspecific pain studied during cycle ergometry could not exercise at high intensities and showed decreased endurance, tachycardia, a high degree of exercise stress and an increased dependence on glycolysis at low exercise intensities. Many of the biochemical changes during exercise and many of the symptoms of these patients could be a consequence of their reduced habitual activities. The patients with McArdle’s disease also could not exercise at high intensities because of their metabolic defect. The most ‘active’ patients had a normal content of mitochondria in their muscles and performed better during cycle ergometry. Furthermore, in contrast to the others they managed to remain successful in their profession.

Comparisons were made across the United States, which showed that when there are higher values of potential energy storage per unit area for overshooting cloud tops penetrating the tropopause, the probability of producing an outbreak of tornadoes causing greater damage increases, based on the analysis of infrared imagery obtained from satellite remote sensing.

Several species appear to be very successful to overcome a high defoliation pressure because of their regrowth capacity. The hypothesis is formulated that defence mechanisms and regrowth capacity are alternatives. Given a limited amount of energy and nutrients available in the struggle against herbivores, there should be a trade off between these 3 mechanisms. Observations on the intensity of herbivory, experiments on regrowth capacity and on storage of reserves in roots agree with the predictions based on this hypothesis. A short population longevity and/or a short life cycle may be one of the ways to reduce the effect of herbivory.

For most of that time period the use of the vegetable oils, soybean and safflower, was the exclusive lipid source for these emulsions. Recently intravenous medium-chain triglycerides have been commercially available. This review will discuss several important new research developments coming from the laboratory which should prove to enhance the nutritional effectiveness as well as minimize the adverse effects of lipid emulsions. The use of medium-chain triglycerides either enterally or parenterally has shown them to be superior energy sources when compared to long-chain triglycerides. Under experimental conditions of burn injury, their support of certain aspects of protein metabolism is superior to that of the current emulsions. This may be due to their rapid and preferential oxidation and poor storage into adipose tissue, and increased thermogenesis which has been observed from either enteral or parenteral administration in humans. This increased metabolic rate is not accompanied by an increase in temperature. Lipid emulsions have been described as having many different effects on variable aspects of the immunologic system. Some of these could be considered to be beneficial or without harm, and others are considered potentially deleterious. We have focused on the effects of parenteral lipid emulsions, in animals as well as in humans, on the function or the reticuloendothelial system. Compared to long-chain triglyceride emulsions, those made from medium-chain triglycerides, either as physical mixes with a small amount of long-chain triglyceride or as chemically structured triglycerides, have been shown not to impact adversely on reticuloendothelial system function. In a series of clinical studies, we have shown impairment of the reticuloendothelial system after 3 days of an intravenous soybean oil emulsion when it is given for 10 hr whereas no impairment was seen if the emulsion is given either for one day, 3 days continuously (24 hr/day), or when the emulsion predominantly consisted of medium-chain triglycerides. Besides being a superior energy substrate which does not interfere with the reticuloendothelial system, new types of triglycerides have been shown to actually change the metabolic response to injury or infection. Besides the above mentioned increase in metabolic rate when one feeds medium-chain triglycerides, we have shown a blunting of a recombinant interleukin-1-induced fever in animals previously fed fish oil. Additionally, improved survival following endotoxin administration in guinea pigs fed either orally or parenterally diets containing fish oil, has been shown. A possible mechanism for this is a less severe metabolic acidosis produced after endotoxin administration in those animals fed fish oil. The continual exploration of these different lipid sources to be given as potential parenteral emulsions to hospitalized patients will provide significant improvements in our current nutritional delivery and clinical care.",,"triacylglycerol; enteric feeding; human; nonhuman; parenteral nutrition; priority journal; review; Animalia; Carthamus tinctorius; Cavia; Glycine max",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024209958

The phosphorylated sugars significantly increased and the glycerophosphodiesters significantly decreased in the moist-chamber-stored corneas, whereas both metabolites remained unchanged in the M-K-medium-stored corneas. There was no significant change in the dinucleotides and nucleoside diphospho-sugars during the time course fot both storage methods. A threefold greater rate of decline was noted in the tissue energy modulus for ihe moist-chamber-stored corneas than for the M-K-medium-stored corneas (-0.0465 vs. -0.0121 modulus values/h). M-K medium was significantly more effective in the maintenance of high-energy phosphatic metabolites.

Squirrels forage differentially among the trees in their respective territories because the cones of different trees differ significantly in size, shape, and number of seeds per cone. Cone choice was investigated as a function of distance from the central cache and as a function of whether cones were harvested for immediate or later use. The positive relationship between prey size (ie prey quality) and distance predicted by both the Schoener (1974) and Orians-Pearson (1979) models is strongly supported. Two measures of prey quality (percentage of total cone weight attributable to seeds and number of seeds per cone) correlated positively with distance from the central place, not only for the cones harvested by squirrels but also for the cones remaining on trees. The Orians-Pearson prediction that prey selectivity should be minimal at intermediate distances receives qualified support. Variation in prey taken declines as the distance from the central place increases. The Orians-Pearson prediction that prey superiority hinges on relative handling time rather than on energy content when travelling time is small appears to be supported. Cone width, a variable positively correlated with prey handling time, is positively correlated with distance from the central place. Squirrels minimize handling time for cones taken near the central place. Pine squirrels forage nonrandomly in distinguishing between cones harvested for immediate consumption and those harvested for caching relative to numbers of seeds per cone, distance from the cache, and serotiny of cones. -from Author",,"central place foraging; lodgepole pine; pine squirrels; squirrels; Pinus contorta; Pinus contorta; Sciuridae; Tamiasciurus hudsonicus; Tamiasciurus hudsonicus fremonti",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024193516

The different versions incorporate: a variable nutrient cell quota, multiple forms of the nutrient (e.g. nitrate and ammonia), chemical storage of light energy, and photoadaptation. In each case the mixed layer is assumed to be nutrient limited while the thermocline is light-limited. The solutions demonstrate that a wide range of models may be examined in this way, and reveal common properties which illustrate the interaction of these processes in a stratified environment. In such models, daily mean values may approach steady conditions within days, even when a diurnal cycle is present. Analysis shows that, as a result of the phytoplankton balance within the thermocline, all the models have four characteristic properties. These featurses, which can also be derived when there are several species each limited by a different nutrient, are shown to be part of the dynamics of a complex ecosystem model (MULES) even though this system does not achieve steady conditions. This suggests that the phytoplankton and nutrients in this model are often close to being in equilibrium with the grazers that are present at any time. General expressions are also derived when self-shading is considered and these give an improved representation of the MULES results. Steady-state analysis using layers provides a theoretical understanding of the dynamical behavior of such models. The relationships presented, e.g. the response to changing light and the treatment of self-shading, appear sufficiently universal to be sought observationally. © 1988.",,"model; phytoplankton; stratification; vertical distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024191648

The consequences would be catastrophic should the dam fail as a result of warfare, earthquakes, or other causes. Resettlement of population displaced by the reservoir, especially farmers, presents a formidable obstacle in the land around the reservoir site. Resettlement could affect minority groups if population is moved to border areas. The reservoir would sacrifice cultural landmarks. Erosion and reservoir siltation may impede navigation within a few years, and in the longer term will reduce storage volume. Impacts on natural habitats and human structures downstream of the dam include a variety of changes caused by greater streamflow at the low-water period and by reduced sediment load. The major justification for building the dam is flood control; alternatives include reforestation in the watershed, smaller dams on upper tributaries, and reversing the movement of population to dangerously exposed areas along the middle and lower Yangzi. Electricity could be produced more cheaply and quickly from smaller dams elsewhere. Energy conservation and population control are more cost effective ways of increasing per capita power supply. Installation of infrastracture for construction at the damsite before impact assessment is complete raises doubts about the place of environmental evaluation in China's decision process. © 1988.",,"alternatives; cost; environment; flood control; hydroelectric project; resettlement; Three Gorges Dam; China, Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024189927

As part of the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations Project of the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey has been conducting hydrologic, geologic and geophysical investigations at Yucca Mountain and the surrounding region to provide data for evaluation of the potential suitability of the site. Hydrologic investigations of the unsaturated zone at this site began in 1982. A 17.5‐inch‐ (44.5‐centimeter) diameter borehole (USW UZ‐1) was drilled by the reverse‐air vacuum‐drilling technique to a depth of 1269 feet (387 meters). This borehole was instrumented at 33 depth levels. At 15 of the levels, three well screens were embedded in coarse‐sand columns. The sand columns were isolated from each other by thin layers of bentonite, columns of silica flour, and isolation plugs consisting of expansive cement. Thermocouple psychrometers and pressure transducers were installed within the screens and connected to the data‐acquisition system at the land surface through thermocouple and logging cables. Two of the screens at each level were equipped with access tubes to allow collection of pore‐gas samples. In addition to these instruments, 18 heat‐dissipation probes were installed within the columns of silica flour, some of which also had thermocouple psychrometers. After more than two years of monitoring, the majority of the instruments were still functioning and producing reasonable data. A slow recovery from the disturbed state to natural conditions was detected during the first 90 days of monitoring; this recovery was probably a result of the large diameter of the borehole. Preliminary results indicated that suction pressures for the welded units ranged from −2 to −15 bars (−0.2 to −1.5 mega pascals). Some agreement existed between data from psychrometers and from heat‐dissipation probes, except where silica flour was not in equilibrium with the formation. Water fluxes estimated in the matrix of the repository host‐rock unit range from 4 × 10−3 to 2 × 10−2 inches per year (0.1 to 0.5 millimeter per year) using matric‐potential distribution, and from −1 × 10−3 to −2 × 10−3 inches per year (−0.025 to −0.05 millimeter per year) using geothermal gradient. Responses to short‐term barometric fluctuations were detected to a maximum depth of about 300 feet (91 meters) in the borehole. Below this depth, only long‐term barometric fluctuations were detectable. Equivalent effective hydraulic conductivity, estimated from air permeability, ranged from 0.6 to 2 feet per day (0.2 to 0.6 meters per day). Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

Box 363, Birmingham, B15 2TT, United Kingdom","Genotypic variation in the temperature optimum for resource‐saturated growth of microalgae has been used to provide envelopes of μm (maximum specific growth rate) as a function of temperature. The Q10 value for μm for batch‐cultured algae with optimal growth temperatures in the range 5–40°C is 1.88; rather higher values (Q10= 2.08–2.19) are found, albeit with lower μ values at a given temperature, for continuous cultures. The envelope approach selects μ values for the smallest cells from the taxa (members of the Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta) with the highest μ values at a given temperature. Larger cell size, or membership of the Dinophyta, gives a decreased μ at a given temperature. Phenotypic change in μ, within a given genotype grown at sub‐optimal temperatures, has a Q10 in excess of 1.88. Analysis of constraints on the resource‐saturated value of μ in the fastest‐growing micro‐algae suggest that, at their temperature optima, the cells are close (within a factor of 2) to their maximum potential growth rate, based on the known kinetic properties of their catalysts, the need for kinetic heterogenity in catalyses in metabolic pathways, and the need to allocate some cell resources to structural and storage components. Phenotypic and genotypic responses to lower temperatures for growth, in terms of reallocation of resources to increase the quantity per unit biomass of catalyst? as a means of offsetting lower catalytic capacity at lower temperatures, are limited. An exception is the light‐harvesting and reaction centre apparatus which catalyses the temperature‐insensitive processes of light absorption, excitation energy transfer and primary photochemistry, and which is present (as assayed by photosynthetic pigment per unit biomass) in smaller relative amounts during resource‐saturated growth at lower temperatures. The involvement of other low‐temperature ‘adaptations’ (e.g. homeoviscous behaviour of thylakoid membranes) in offsetting low temperature effects on catalytic rates is not clear. The scope for increasing the quantity of temperature‐sensitive catalysts in the biomass as a means of offsetting the effects of low temperature on resource‐saturated μ is potentially higher in the Dinophyta with their relatively low μ at their temperature optimum; however, this option does not appear to be taken up by the Dinophyta which have unexceptional Q10 values for μ. For resource‐limited growth, the phenotypic effect of suboptimal temperatures on growth, when light is the limiting resource, is often less marked than when growth is light saturated. When a chemical nutrient is limiting, the temperature effect on growth of a given genotype is often, but not invariably, decreased. Cases in which the effect of temperature on growth rate is decreased under light‐limiting conditions can be interpreted in terms of the intrinsically low Q10 of growth when temperature‐insensitive reactions (light absorption, excitation energy transfer, primary photochemistry) are limiting and the acclimatory effects of changed temperature and light regimes for growth on resource allocation between pigment‐protein complexes and downstream catalysts of temperature‐sensitive reactions. Cases in which light‐limited growth rate is quite temperature sensitive may be accounted for by a decrease in absorptance as a result of a lower pigment content per cell at low growth temperatures. For growth limited by chemical nutrients, the variable responses make analysis difficult. It is tempting to assign a low Q10 for μ under these conditions to a limitation by some transport process (diffusion through unstirred layers, or, less plausibly, the cell membrane) with a low Q10, although the evidence favouring this interpretation is not abundant.

The data from these tests together with previously published data from a single‐well test and a two‐well test allow one to begin to develop a three‐dimensional picture of the hydraulic properties of the study aquifer. A consistent feature of all the tests is a high hydraulic conductivity zone which appears in the bottom third of the aquifer. This result is in agreement with hydraulic conductivity distributions inferred from previous aquifer thermal energy storage experiments at the same site. In some locations the new tests indicated high hydraulic conductivity zones in the upper third of the aquifer which were not detected in the previous two‐well test and single‐well tests performed at the same site but at different locations. Despite the three‐dimensional spatial variations of hydraulic conductivity indicated by these tests, it was possible to predict the major features of the tracer concentration as a function of time at the withdrawal well in the two‐well test by means of an available numerical model assuming perfect stratification at the test site and using a hydraulic conductivity distribution inferred from a single‐well test. The apparent success of the model prediction presented here, as well as the success of a similar numerical simulation of the previous two‐well test reported earlier, seem to support the conclusion that the study aquifer has an approximately stratified flow field at the test site. These field test results provide further evidence that reliable predictions of solute transport in a real aquifer will depend on a sufficiently detailed knowledged of the major features of the three‐dimensional advection pattern in the aquifer. Based on this study and previous studies, it appears that a healthy mixture of viewpoints and techniques (geologic, hydrologic, geophysical, etc.) will be necessary to characterize the transport properties of natural ground‐water systems.

When such an unanchored tank is subjected to lateral loads due to earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressures in the liquid, the tank wall tends to uplift locally, pulling the base plate up with it. The contact problem of the partially uplifted base plate and its interaction with the the cylindrical shell is solved in this paper using the finite difference energy method, and a Fourier decomposition of the displacements in the circumferential direction. Non‐linearities due to contact, finite displacements and yield of the steel are included in the analysis. However, the equations for the shell are linearized. This uncouples the equations for the Fourier displacement coefficients in the cylindrical shell, and enables the degrees of freedom for the shell to be eliminated by static condensation at very little computational cost. Comparing the analytical results to (for the most part existing) experimental results, produces good agreement in some cases and not so good in others. A number of effects that could give rise to such differences are discussed. In most cases they represent experimental conditions that are not known or modelled in the analysis.

The derived rates for time scales between 0.1 and 1.0mm h−1 were generally similar throughout storm events to losses determined from throughfall and stemflow observations. During post‐rainfall periods of canopy drying, enhanced rates of lysimeter evaporation were consistent with micrometeorological determinations of the partitioning of available radiant energy, based on atmospheric gradients of humidity and temperature. Interception losses from the eucalypt forest, deduced from the lysimeter response, varied between 10 and 15 per cent of gross rainfall in three consecutive 12 month periods whereas the corresponding rainfall ranged between 590 and 1530 mm yr−1. Daytime losses accounted for about two‐thirds of total interception loss with a similar fraction occurring during rain periods. Storage capacity of the evergreen forest canopy was inferred to be 0.35 mm. Hourly loss rates during rainfall ranged up to 0.8 mm h−1 but with decreasing mean values and variability with increasing time scale resulting in a monthly mean value computed for the total number of hours of rain of approximately 0.1 mm h−1. A preliminary analysis of loss rate in terms of storm windspeed and rainfall intensity explained about half of its variation in statistically derived relationships. Improved time resolution of the order of seconds was considered a prerequisite to the physical understanding of turbulent transport from saturated canopies. The small value of interception storage capacity was considered in relation to that for pine forest as a basis for explaining observed differences in interception behaviour between eucalypt forest and coniferous plantations in the same area. Large differences in interception losses between the Kioloa site and evergreen forest in the South Island of New Zealand and also eucalypt forest in Western Australia were attributed to dissimilar meteorological conditions at the various sites.

Emphasis in this review is on principles of wide biological applicability, with specific examples being chosen from research on agaves and cacti. Plant temperatures can be predicted using energy budgets incorporating shortwave and longwave radiation, heat conduction and convection, latent heat, and heat storage. Energy budgets are used here to show the effect of plant size and shortwave absorptance on tissue temperature. The importance of air temperature or transcription rate for tissue temperature is calculated quantitatively. The influences of surface appendages, such as apical pubescence and spines, on minimal temperatures near the apical meristem of cacti are predicted, such minimal temperatures influencing the geographical distribution of various species. The Boltzmann energy distribution and Arrhenius plots are presented and used to analyse thermal responses in terms of energy barriers and activation energies. The many ways that temperature can influence CO2 diffusion into a leaf are also considered. Tolerances to low and high temperatures, such as the ability of agaves and cacti to tolerate extremely high tissue temperatures of 70 degrees C, are discussed from both cellular and ecological perspectives. Although the influences of temperature on plants are multitudinous, many can be predicted, or at least analysed, based on well-established physical principles.",,"adaptation; energy metabolism; geography; plant physiology; radiation; review; temperature; Adaptation, Physiological; Energy Metabolism; Geography; Plant Physiology; Radiation; Temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024147340

The scaling laws for the heat transfer rate and the effectiveness (energy storage fraction) are determined based on scale analysis. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments conducted in the domain Ra = 103-106, Pr = 7, A = 1, where Ra is the Rayleigh number based on height and initial temperature difference, Pr is the Prandtl number, and A is the height/length ratio of the enclosure.

The attainable energy efficiency and power density of a secondary battery is directly related to polarization losses in the cell under load. One of the contributing factors to polarization of an organosulfur electrode is the rate of ionic transport in the melt. Among the sodium/organosulfur batteries under investigation in this laboratory is the sodium/beta”-alumina/(tetraethylthiuram disulfide) cell, in which the product of cell discharge is the thiolate salt, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (NaDEDC). Accordingly, the ionic conductivity of NaDEDC and related electrolytes in molten tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD) has been studied as a function of composition and temperature. The ionic conductivity of a NaDEDC/TETD melt of composition corresponding to 2% discharge of a Na/TETD battery was determined to be 2 x 10-5 Ω cm-1at 130°C which increases to 1 x 10-3Ω cm-1for a melt corresponding to 28% discharge. The discharge data for Na/TETD batteries indicates that ionic conductivity of the positive electrode melt contributes negligible polarization after a few percent of cell discharge, indicating that ionic conductivity in the above range is acceptable for energy-efficient operation of these cells over nearly the entire compositional domain. The relationship between the equivalent conductivity of these melts and concentration is also discussed, as well as the implications of the measured viscosity of the pure TETD melt. © 1988, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The stockpile may be viewed as a chemical reactor, and chemical engineering methods may be used to analyse and understand this problem. The analysis is complicated by the fact that coal stockpiles in general possess little or no symmetry. In addition, it has been shown that the flow in coal stockpiles is mainly due to natural convection, which makes the problem rather different to those traditionally analysed in the chemical reaction engineering literature. In order that a realistic model of this phenomenon be formulated, it is necessary to derive mass, momentum and energy balance equations. The various models that have been used to describe this phenomenon are discussed, starting with simple steady-state one-dimensional models, and culminating in a three-dimensional formulation. The simple one-dimensional model gives valuable insights into the behaviour of stockpiled coal. The solution of the more realistic model, using finite element techniques, is described. The models are compared in the light of the assumptions made in their derivation. Finally the practical implications of the work are discussed. © 1985.","coal storage; mathematical model; natural convection; Spontaneous combustion","Chemical Reactions; Mathematical Models; Coal Stockpiles; Coal Storage; Natural Convection; Coal Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024124554

Stresses were determined from both high-speed ciné films (light and X-ray) and force plate recordings, as well as from in vivo tendon force recordings. Stresses in each hindlimb support element during hopping (1.6-3.1 m s-1) were generally only 33% of those acting during jumping (greater than or equal to 40 cm height): ankle extensor muscles, 80 +/- 12 (S.D.) versus 297 +/- 42 kPa; ankle extensor tendons, 7.9 +/- 1.5 versus 32.7 +/- 4.8 MPa; tibia, -29 +/- 5 versus -110 +/- 25 MPa (all values are for hopping versus jumping). The magnitude of stress in each structure during these locomotor activities was similarly matched to the strength of each element, so that a consistent safety factor to failure is achieved for the hindlimb as a whole (1.5-2.0). The large stresses during jumping were correlated with a three-fold increase in ground reaction forces exerted on the ground compared with the fastest steady hopping speeds. We conclude that, for its size, the kangaroo rat has disproportionately large hindlimb muscles, tendons and bones to withstand the large forces associated with rapid acceleration to avoid predation, which limits their ability to store and recover elastic strain energy. Middle ear morphology and behavioural observations of kangaroo rats jumping vertically to avoid predation by owls and rattlesnakes support this view.",,"acceleration; analog digital converter; animal; animal behavior; article; audiovisual equipment; bone; deceleration; Dipodomys; energy metabolism; hindlimb; histology; locomotion; mechanical stress; metabolism; muscle; physiology; rodent; safety; tendon; Acceleration; Analog-Digital Conversion; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Bone and Bones; Deceleration; Dipodomys; Energy Metabolism; Hindlimb; Locomotion; Motion Pictures; Muscles; Rodentia; Safety; Stress, Mechanical; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024114031

Therefore, ‘We have been studying a double layer gamet, the first layer having its magnetization parallel to the plane of the film while the outer layer is perpendicular. The contribution of the first layer allows Q better guiding of the field lines of the magnetic tape.

The proposed thermal storage system can be used to shift electric demand from periods of high demand to periods of low demand. The system is considered for both the summer cooling and winter heating season. The system’s evaporator and absorberare similar to that of a conventional heat-operated absorption refrigeration system; however, the generator heat is supplied by a self-contained electrically-driven vapor compression heat pump. The heat pump is operated during the off-peak period to recover the thermal storage by reprocessing the stored solution to a higher lithium bromide concentration.The water vapor liberated from solution in the generator is compressed and then condensed in the generator. The storage volumetric efficiency is determined and compared to storage systems based on water ice for the cooling season only and on a liquid water storage system for both cooling and heating. The storage volumetric efficiency of the proposed system is greater than or comparable to that of a thermal storage system based upon water ice and far exceeds the value for a thermal storage system based upon liquid water.

A detailed examination of the well and near-well reservoir emphasizes the cumulative importance of the Joule-Thomson effect over many years. It is shown that three fctors contribute to the rise and fall of gas temperature in a well and nearby storage region during injection and withdrawal: the geothermal gradient, heat convection in the reservoir, and the Joule-Thomson effect. Although a minor factor, the rock temperature surrounding the well does affect the gas temperature, especially during shut-in periods, thereby affecting the subsequent initial withdrawal or injection temperatures. Heat convection plays a larger role, especially during long-term withdrawal periods when the warmer gas of the outer regions of the reservoir migrates to the wellbore. The Joule-Thomson effect, however, is very often the dominant factor in determining the change in gas temperature. It is most notable in the reservoir near the wellbore, where the more sudden changes take place, and is therefore a greatly contributing factor to hydrate formation.",,"Natural gas wells; Energy Balance; Gas Hydrates; Joule-Thomson Effect; Rock Formation; Storage Reservoirs; Gas Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024107891

The two power plants were built side by side in order to compare two thermal-electric techniques, one being a distributed collector system (DCS) with arrays of parabolic troughs and the other a central receiver system (CRS) with heliostats concentrating the sunlight onto the top of a tower. Each plant was constructed with a nominal capacity of 500 kWel and was expected to have a net yearly output on the order of 1 GWh.—Only the DCS plant was in operation sufficiently to enable an assessment of possible annual production of electricity. Through extrapolation one finds that the gross output of the built plant was maximal 0.25 GWh with an overall efficiency of 2.3 percent for a plant with 100 percent availability and no malfunctions. Internal electricity consumption correspondingly calculated amounts to 0.11 GWh resulting in only 0.14 GWh yearly net output. Using the experimental values from the CRS plant, it appears that its yearly gross output could have been similar to that of the DCS plant but at higher internal electricity consumption, particularly due to the trace heating of the heat transfer medium (sodium).—The technical reasons for the poor efficiency of the SSPS installation were largely that the solar climate was less favorable then assumed, dirt accumulated on the mirrors at a more rapid rate than foreseen, the nonsolar specific components were badly matched and yielded low efficiencies, and thermal inertia was crucial and almost overlooked in the planning stage.—A detailed loss analysis is presented in the article. © 1988 by ASME.",,"Meteorology--Climatology; Solar Energy--Energy Storage; Internal Electricity Consumption; International Energy Agency; Thermal Inertia; Solar Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024105095

It charts the development of the use of superconductors in energy research from the mid-1960s on, reviewing the projects developed over that period, and considers why the impetus behind such projects dissipated in the 1980s. The events of the last 18 months - since the discovery of high temperature superconducting materials - and the subsequent explosion of interest in the new materials are then examined. Of particular interest here is the contrast between the emergence of a powerful coalition of government, industry and science in a number of countries anxious to obtain maximum advantage from the technology and the reaction of the energy research community. The paper concludes by identifying the problems of the new materials and of superconductivity itself for the ESI, suggesting how they might interact in the future, and considers how these developments illustrate the relationship between the innovation process and technology choice in the energy sector. © 1988.","Electricity supply industry, R&D; Superconductivity","ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS; SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS; ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNIQUES; ELECTIRCITY SUPPLY INDUSTRY (ESI); HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS; SUPERCONDUCTING ENERGY STORAGE; SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024103710

A thermostatically controlled electric heater is assumed to be the source of auxiliary energy, in the present calculations. In order to evaluate the performance of the system using the developed model numerical calculations have been made corresponding to the climate of Delhi, India. The calculations have been extended to obtain the optimized values of collector area and storage mass which correspond to the minimum value of useful energy.

A careful study of the dependence of the switching on the thickness of the films demonstrates that films of thicknesses between 700 and 1500 Å exhibit switching behaviour. A threshold field of 2.12 × 106 V cm-1 is required for switching. The activation energy is found to be 1.55 eV.

Based on the resulting principals the concept of the 1.5 GeV FEL storage ring DELTA, a project of the University of Dortmund, is presented. The main advantage of DELTA are the two 20 m long insertions between two identical half-circular arcs. The flexibility of such a system makes different FEL experiments possible including a pulsed X-ray laser integrated in a bypass. By use of a special insertion in one straight section one can reduce the momentum compaction factor α of the machine to very low values without changing the beam optics in the arcs.

(i) the change in the P-C-T curves as a function of the number of cycles, 2. (ii) X-ray diffraction, and 3. (iii) the thermal desorption of hydrogen after cycling. The results of the thermal desorption of hydrogen provide information about the hydrogen occupation at various interstitial sites, which are distinguished by different binding energies. It was found that the formation of stable hydrides is the source of degradation caused by thermally induced hydrogen absorption-desorption cycling. Thermal cycling of FeTi produces an intrinsic degradation that reduces the hydrogen storage capacity and suppresses the formation of the γ phase in its hydride. Surprisingly, as a result of degradation, the overall rate of the hydrogenation reaction is also decreased. The mechanism of the degradation is probably related to the formation of stable hydrides, which causes a change in the environments of the sites occupied by hydrogen in the neighbour matrix. Most of the properties can be recovered by a simple annealing treatment in vacuum. © 1988.",,"Hydrogen--Storage; Iron and Alloys--Degradation; Thermal Effects; Thermodynamic Properties; Hydrogen Absorption-Desorption Cycling; Thermal Cycling; Iron Titanium Alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024071558

This relatively recent development has left a number of fundamental problems unanswered, especially related to the machining, storage and testing of trabecular bone specimens. Nevertheless, these studies have contributed to the understanding of the mechanical function of trabecular bone. Regarding the role of trabecular bone at the knee joint, the following conclusions may be emphasized (conclusions drawn from the author's previous studies (I-X) are shown in italics): (1) Trabecular bone is almost exclusively responsible for the transmission of load at the proximal tibial epiphysis from the knee joint to the metaphysis. The peripheral shell surrounding the epiphysis is not composed of cortical bone and plays a negligible role in load transmission. (2) The compressive strength and stiffness of trabecular bone is primarily dependent upon the apparent density, trabecular architecture and the strength of the bone material. Direct and indirect sources suggest that the true material strength of trabecular bone is less than that of cortical bone. The epiphyseal trabecular architecture, featuring a marked polarity with alignment of primary trabeculae at right angles to the joint surface, is responsible for functional anisotropy which points to the axial compressive properties as the more important mechanical parameters. (3) Tensile and shear properties are of special relevance to mechanical loosening of implants. These properties may be derived from the apparent density, and a close empirical relation to the axial compressive strength and stiffness is suggested. (4) The foam-like structure of trabecular bone is the basis for the large energy absorptive capacity. (5) The pattern of axial compressive stiffness and strength at the normal proximal tibia differs little among individuals. Supporting the medial tibial plateau is a large high strength area with maximal strength centrally and slightly anteriorly, while laterally there is a restricted area of relatively high strength posteriorly with a lower maximal value than medially. Bone strength is significantly reduced within ten millimeters of the subchondral bone plate, and this reduction continues distally at the lateral condyle. At both condyles strength is reduced towards the periphery with very low values being obtained at the margins of the condyles and at the intercondylar region. Absolute bone strength values are influenced by the level of physical activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"arthropathy; biomechanics; biophysics; bone; epiphysis; histology; human; knee; knee prosthesis; mechanical stress; osteoarthritis; pathophysiology; physiology; prosthesis failure; review; rheumatoid arthritis; tensile strength; tibia fracture; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Bone and Bones; Epiphyses; Humans; Joint Diseases; Knee Joint; Knee Prosthesis; Osteoarthritis; Prosthesis Failure; Stress, Mechanical; Tensile Strength; Tibial Fractures",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024061324

The purpose of the study is to examine the processes of energy storage in this material following irradiation, and the subsequent release of this energy in the form of luminescence. In the Ce‐doped samples Ce2+ centers and photochromic centers are known to be the major defects induced by radiation. Ionic thermocurrent data presented in this work indicate that Ce3+‐F int−(C4v) centers are not the precursers to these defects in the dose range used, as previously suggested. The major defects induced by radiation in the Mn‐doped samples are not identified. However, the data lead us to propose that the primary mechanism of thermoluminescence emission from the material involves the re‐absorption of e−–Vk recombination luminescence by Ce and Mn‐related defects induced by radiation. Strong competition between the Ce‐related and the Mn‐related defects is evident such that Mn absorption, and therefore Mn luminescence, is significantly reduced in the presence of Ce impurities. A similar, but lesser, effect on the Ce absorption and luminescence is observed as the Mn content is increased. There is no evidence of significant energy transfer from Ce to Mn in the thermoluminescence or X‐ray‐induced luminescence processes, in contrast to earlier beliefs.

Typical utility load shapes both in the eastern and in the western parts of the U.S are examined for this purpose. While photovoltaic power generation seems to present a bigger impact on the load of the western utility, both utilities will experience considerable savings on the size of the battery system required to shave the peak loads and also in the night-time base capacity required to charge the battery.

The focus on the industry's heating demands is due to the aims of a research project on industrial load management and differential electricity rates at Linköping Institute of Technology. The heating problem is one part of the project. Initially, a weighted heating load curve and load duration curve, representing the monthly heating energy distribution for industries, is derived to be used in the following discussions. Differential electricity rates and their impact on industrial heating strategies, including dual‐fuel systems, energy storage systems, etc., are discussed and also how various kinds of energy saving measures would be affected by differential rates. The energy use for Swedish industrial heating purposes is presented, both regarding electricity and fuels. The major part of the heating loads still are oil‐based although conversion to electric heating proceeds continuously. The present use of oil for these heating purposes is forming the future potential for dual‐fuel systems. Finally, the impact on the total load of the Swedish power system by these dual‐fuel systems, controlled by means of alternating energy charges, is presented.

Many of the problems faced in experimental high energy physics are also of this nature. Track reconstruction in wire chambers and cluster finding in cellular calorimeters, for instance, involve pattern recognition and high combinatorial complexity since many combinations of hits or cells must be considered in order to arrive at the final tracks or clusters. Here we examine in what way connective network methods can be applied to some of the problems of experimental high energy physics. It is found that such problems as track and cluster finding adapt naturally to these approaches. When large scale hard-wired connective networks become available, it will be possible to realize solutions to such problems in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. For certain types of problems, faster solutions are already possible using model networks implemented on vector or other massively parallel machines. It should also be possible, using existing technology, to build simplified networks that will allow detailed reconstructed event information to be used in fast trigger decisions. © 1988.",,"AUTOMATA THEORY; PHYSICS - High Energy; CELLULAR AUTOMATA; TRACK RECONSTRUCTION; DATA STORAGE, DIGITAL",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024029403

Tests were performed at the two ASHRAE Standard 93-1986 recommended flowrates and at a variety of inlet gage pressures to cover the three possible cases of collector leakage (inward, outward, inward-outward). These tests show that the thermal performance of air collectors depends on flowrate and inlet gage pressure (or the associated leakage rate). If the collector is used at an inlet gage pressure near atmospheric pressure as is often the case in the no-storage type of systems, then it is recommended to test the collector at an inlet gage pressure of zero. For collectors operating at various inlet gage pressures it is suggested to test them at three inlet gage pressures. As for the test flowrate, the present work confirmed the results of other studies and emphasizes the need to test the collectors at the design flowrate. Three methods of thermal performance representation were used and compared: One method bases the efficiency on the inlet flowrate, another on the outlet flowrate, and the third involves an overall enthalpy balance. When plotted in the classic way, that is, i vs. (Ti- Ta)/G the three methods exhibit significant differences, especially for the inward leakage case. An uncertainty analysis on the data obtained for this study indicates that for the inward leakage case, unacceptable uncertainties occur at high values of (Ti- Ta)/G. © 1988 by ASME.",,"ENERGY UTILIZATION - Thermodynamics; STANDARDS; ASHRAE STANDARD 93-1986; LEAKAGE RATE; PLATE-TYPE AIR COLLECTOR; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024015855

The classical Darcy model is extended by the Forchheimer (inertial) term and the effective thermal conductivity of the medium is represented by the sum of a stagnant and a (hydrodynamic) dispersive component, the latter being proportional to the local filtration velocity amplitude. Bifurcation analysis of the porous Bénard problem with dispersive and inertial terms proves that the results of the classical Darcy model still hold at the onset of convection for weak dispersion. Both terms are important for steady convection in shallow packed beds. The effect of dispersion on Nusselt number is stronger than that of inertia unless the Prandtl number of the porous medium is of order 0.01 or less. The ratio of layer thickness to bead diameter is shown to be a significant parameter of the problem that can help explain some contradictory experimental results. © 1988.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; FLOW OF FLUIDS - Porous Materials; BIFURCATION; BUOYANCY; SPHERICAL BEADS; HEAT TRANSFER",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024014749

The temperature dependence of the complex dynamic modulus was measured in the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 Hz, using undrawn and drawn gel films with various draw ratios up to 400. Superposition is realized by a combination of horizontal and vertical shifts resulting in apparent master curves of the storage and loss modulus functions. The Arrhenius plots of log shift factor versus the reciprocal of the absolute temperature indicates that there exist two mechanical dispersions corresponding to the α1 and α2 mechanisms, for drawn specimens whose draw ratios are lower than 100. The value of the activation energies associated with the α1 and α2 mechanisms for the undrawn gel and melt films are in the range of literature values which have been reported generally for semicrystalline spherulitic samples of high-density polyethylene with low molecular weights. The value associated with the α1 mechanism decreases as a draw ratio increases but the value levels off when the draw ratio is beyond 100. The component of the α2 mechanism decreases with increasing the draw ratio and becomes zero at a draw ratio of 400. Accordingly, it turns out that the α2 mechanism cannot be observed when the external excitation is parallel to the crystal c-axis. © 1988, American Chemical Society.

For the amorphous alloys, the concentration-hydrogen pressure isotherms do not exhibit a pressure plateau and Sieverts' law is not obeyed, in contrast to the behavior in the crystallized alloys. Hydrogen solubility increases with increasing Ti content in amorphous NiTi alloys. Lower solubility at 1 atm hydrogen pressure was observed for the amorphous Ni56Ti44 and Ni68Ti32 alloys as compared to the crystallized alloys. As the hydrogen concentration increases, the diffusivity of hydrogen increases markedly and the corresponding activation energy decreases in the amorphous alloys, whereas there is a negligible concentration dependence in the crystallized alloys. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in amorphous alloys with the same composition are 2 orders of magnitude higher at 1 atm hydrogen pressure than in crystallized alloys. The density of sites for hydrogen incorporation was deduced from an analysis of the solubility-pressure isotherms based on a model for the lattice statistics of the hydrogen incorporation and a bimodal distribution is obtained. The peak energies for the lower energy hydrogen sites correspond to the sites with four Ti nearest neighbors and the higher energy sites are related to the next favorable sites which are similar to sites in crystalline NiTi2. Further confirmation of this proposal is provided by the crystallization behavior of the amorphous alloys. © 1988.",,"GASES - Solubility; HYDROGEN - Diffusion; AMORPHOUS ALLOYS; HYDROGEN PERMEATION; HYDROGEN SITES; HYDROGEN STORAGE; NICKEL TITANIUM ALLOYS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024011142

This improvement is accomplished by subdividing the converter into two or more series-resonant power modules. The power modules are operated with a constant relative phase shift (phase-staggering control). The method of eliminating the harmonic components in the input and output currents of the conversion system, without increasing the internal pulse frequency, is justified by Fourier analysis of the current waveforms. The frequency spectra of the source and output waveforms for the continuous and discontinuous resonant current mode are shifted to higher frequency ranges as computations show for both one single module and paralleled modules. Inadequacies in the phase-staggering control method applied to series-resonant converters are indicated in relation to the dominant harmonic component, in particular for two modules. The presentation is supported by experimentally acquired waveforms. The control method decreases the root mean square (rms) current through the input and output capacitors of the converter and the losses in the indicated components, which is especially advantageous for low-voltage, high-current applications. High-frequency current components to the source and to the load are reduced, resulting in smaller input and output filters. The resolution of the control of the flow of energy from the source to the load is improved, resulting in a faster system response. © 1988 IEEE",,"CONTROL, ELECTRIC VARIABLES - Phase; WAVEFORM ANALYSIS; DOMINANT HARMONIC COMPONENT; PARALLELED POWER MODULES; PHASE-STAGGERING CONTROL; SERIES-RESONANT DC-DC CONVERTER; ELECTRIC CONVERTERS, POWER TYPE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023999902

The generalization consists of the capability to handle nonlinear energy generation rates in the objective function (maximization of system annual energy generation). A quadratic model for the elevation-storage (average storage) curve is used. The optimization problem is described and formulated as the optimal control of a multivariable state-space model in which the state and control vectors are constrained by sets of equality and inequality relations. Lagrange and Kuhn-Tucker multipliers are used to adjoin these equality and inequality constraints to the objective functions. The resulting cost functional is maximized by using the minimum norm formulation of the functional analysis. Numerical results are reported for a real system in operation consisting of three rivers; each river has two series reservoirs. © 1988.","functional analysis and minimum norm formulation; Hydropower generation; pseudo-state variables; quadratic model","ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION - Optimization; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING, DYNAMIC; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING, LINEAR; RESERVOIRS; FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS; HYDROPOWER SYSTEMS OPTIMIZATION; MINIMUM NORM FORMULATION; PSEUDO-STATE VARIABLES; RESERVOIR OPTIMIZATION MODEL; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023983266

This energy storage capability has numerous applications, many of which are sensitive to frictional and thermal losses that occur during the charge/discharge cycle. Under some conditions, the magnitude of these losses can be quite high. The thermal loss is caused by variations in the gas temperature during compression and expansion and is highly dependent upon the cycling rate. Experimental data show that the thermal loss can be minimized by inserting elastomeric foam in the gas side of the accumulator. This study reports experimental data taken with an 8.185-liter (2.162-gal) piston-type hydraulic accumulator. Measured accumulator efficiencies are presented, and the effect of holding time, precharge pressure, rate of charging and discharging, and foam mass on the thermal loss and accumulator efficiency are discussed. Frictional and thermal losses are quantified for this accumulator, and their relative magnitudes are determined.

The open raceway pond is the primary type of reactor considered; however small diameter (1–5 cm) horizontal glass tubular reactors are compared to ponds in several respects. These are representative of the diversity in photobioreactor design: low capital cost, open systems and high capital cost, closed systems. Two 100‐m2 raceways were operated to provide input data and to validate analytical results. With a planktonic Chlorella sp., no significant difference in productivity was noted between one pond mixed at 30 cm/s and another mixed from 1 to 30 cm/s. Thus, power consumption or CO2 outgassing limits maximal mixing velocities. Mixing power inputs measured in 100‐m2 ponds agreed fairly well with those calculated by the use of Manning's equation. A typically configured tubular reactor flowing full (1 cm diameter, 30 cm/s) consumes 10 times as much energy as a typical pond (20 cm deep flowing at 20 cm/s). Tubular reactors that flow only partially full would be limited by large hydraulic head losses to very short sections (as little as 2 m length at 30 cm/s flow) or very low flow velocities. Open ponds have greater CO2 storage capacity than tubular reactors because of their greater culture volume per square meter (100–300 L/m2 vs. 8–40 L/m2 for 1–5‐cm tubes). However, after recarbonation, open ponds tend to desorb CO2 to the atmosphere. Thus ponds must be operated at higher pH and lower alkalinity than would be possible with tubular reactors if cost of carbon is a constraint. The mass transfer coefficient, KL, for CO2 release through the surface of a 100‐m2 pond was determined to be 0.10 m/h. Oxygen buildup would be a serious problem with any enclosed reactor, especially small‐diameter tubes. At maximal rates of photosynthesis, a 1‐cm tubular reactor would accumulate 8–10 mg O2/L/min. This may result in concentrations of oxygen reaching 100 mg/L, even with very frequent gas exchange. In an open pond, dissolved oxygen rises much more slowly as a consequence of the much greater volume per unit surface area and the outgassing of oxygen to the atmosphere. The maximum concentration of dissolved oxygen is typically 25–40 mg/L. The major advantage of enclosed reactors lies in the potential for aseptic operation, a product value which justifies the expense. For most products of algal mass cultivation, open ponds are the only feasible photobioreactor design capable of meeting the economic and operating requirements of such systems, provided desirable species can be maintained.

Applying a parametric study in which optimal designs for a sequence of rotational speeds are observed, a general configuration of the exact optimal prof He is presented. The parametric study reveals the existence of three speed intervals, each characterized by a common type of optimal design. The optimal SKE corresponding to the ultimate rotational speed reaches a value very close to the theoretical upper bound, namely twice that of a thin ring.

For various thyristors, the extracted parameters fit both sets of the above-mentioned curves within an error of 8% over a 1 : 100 ratio of di/dt at zero current and over a 1 : 4 ratio If. © 1988, The Institution of Electrical Engineers.

Allografts are often freeze dried to increase shelf storage time and sterilized with ethylene oxide. This study was conducted to determine the effect of a specific ethylene oxide sterilization procedure and freeze drying process on the initial mechanical properties of femur-ACL-tibia preparations. Twelve knees (stifle joints) from six mature goats were divided into two groups (one knee of pair to each group). Knees were cleaned of all soft tissue except for the anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, and collateral ligaments. Group 1 was sterilized with ethylene oxide (simulating clean procurement) then freeze dried. Group 2 was freeze dried only (simulating sterile procurement). The knees were rehydrated and then tested in tension to failure to determine their structural mechanical properties. The ethylene oxide-freeze dried specimens (Group 1) had a mean maximum load before failure of 2059 +/- 273 newtons (N) (+/- SE) which was not statistically different than the maximum load of the freeze dried specimens (Group 2) of 2023 +/- 214 N. The average strength of Group 1 and 2 combined was not significantly different than a third group of 12 normal femur-ACL-tibia controls which had an average maximum force of 2403 +/- 133 N. No significant differences between the groups were observed for stiffness, energy to maximum strength, or elongation to maximum force. It appears the freeze dry processing, with or without ethylene oxide sterilization, using the procedure we used, has, at most, a small effect on the initial mechanical properties of the preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"ethylene oxide; animal; article; biomechanics; comparative study; fibula; freeze drying; goat; instrument sterilization; knee; ligament; methodology; physiology; tensile strength; tibia; tissue preservation; transplantation; Animals; Biomechanics; Ethylene Oxide; Fibula; Freeze Drying; Goats; Knee Joint; Ligaments, Articular; Sterilization; Tensile Strength; Tibia; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023975446

High densities are especially important in applications requiring mobility or transportability, e.g., for terrestrial vehicles or for systems in space. Unfortunately, it is in these applications that magnetic forces make high energy densities difficult to achieve. The energy that can be stored per kg in a magnetic field is largely determined by the strength-to-density ratio of the materials used to support the current-carrying layers against the magnetic forces exerted on them; this is the same ratio that determines the performance of flywheels. For the energy per unit volume, the strength alone is the critical parameter. In both cases, the mechanical strength determines a value of the magnetic field strength beyond which the energy density begins to decrease. For Kevlar, a new, high-strength polymer, the energy densities at best somewhat exceed those for a car battery, and magnetic field strengths should be held below 80 T.

Chloride was replaced by a larger molecular weight anion, lactobionate (Mol Wt 358), which suppresses hypothermic induced cell swelling. To further suppress cellular swelling glucose was eliminated and the trisaccharide, raffinose (Mol Wt, 594), was used. Flushing an organ with an electrolyte solution allows rapid expansion of the extracellular space resulting in capillary compression and poor distribution of the storage solution throughout the entire organ. A stable colloid, hydroxyethylstarch (HES) was added to provide oncotic pressure to the flushout solution. Additional substances of theoretical advantage to preserving the integrity of the organ were also added. These include: the xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, to suppress oxygen free radical generation; gluthathione as a reducing agent; and adenosine and phosphate to stimulate high energy bond formation in the form of adenine nucleotides.

Following the high-carbohydrate diet triglyceride rose in all groups but the increase in cirrhotics was lower than in normals. In normals and in cirrhotics with good liver function most of the triglyceride increment was carried in VLDL; in cirrhotics with poor liver function only 31% of the increment was found in VLDL, and 56% in triglyceride-rich LDL. In an earlier study on fat feeding, our cirrhotic patients with poor liver function had an impaired chylomicron and VLDL response; they also carried most of the triglyceride increment in triglyceride-rich LDL. The markedly impaired response of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to both carbohydrate and fat feeding suggests that sick cirrhotics may have a problem with storage of dietary energy and that this contributes to loss of their adipose tissue. © 1988 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Dog kidneys were presented either by simple cold storage in EuroCollins' solution for 24 or 48 hours or by continuous perfusion at 5° C in Belzer's gluconate-hydroxyethyl starch solution for as long as 5 days. After preservation, renal functions were measured with the isolated perfused kidney model. Kidneys were reperfused at normothermia either with or without the addition of a combination of rescue agents to the reperfusion medium. The rescue agents studied were allpurinol (1 mmol/L); superoxide dismutase (32,000 U/L); catalase (137,500 U/L); dimethylthiourea (3 mmol/L); glutathione (3 mmol/L); desferrioxamine (0.2 gm/L), for protection against O2 free radical injury and lipid peroxidation injury; verapamil (25 mg/L), as a Ca channel blocker; and ATP-MgCl2 (0.3 mmol/L), to stimulate energy metabolism. The renal functions we measured were glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (creatinine clearance), urine production, perfusate flow, urinary protein concentration, Na reabsorptive capacity, and tissue concentrations of ATP, K, and total tissue water. GFR was reduced by 75% to 90% after all periods of preservation, and the rescue agents had no effect on GFR. Sodium reabsorption was reduced from 98% to a range of 40% to 50% after 48 hours of cold storage or 5 days of machine perfusion and was not increased by rescue agents. There was a time-dependent increase in the amount of urine protein that was not affected by rescue agents. The addition of rescue agents did not affect total tissue water or concentrations of ATP or K in kidneys after normothermic reperfusion. These results demonstrate that pharmacologic agents previously suggested to suppress reperfusion damage in kidneys are not effective in this model. Therefore it is likely that kidneys damage occurs primarily during preservation, which suggest that optimal function on reperfusion calls for the development of better methods of preservation. © 1988.",,"adenosine triphosphate magnesium; allopurinol; catalase; deferoxamine; dimethylthiourea; glutathione; superoxide dismutase; verapamil; animal cell; cryopreservation; dog; kidney blood flow; kidney function; nonhuman; tissue preservation; Allopurinol; Animal; Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase; Ca(2+)-Transporting ATPase; Catalase; Cold; Deferoxamine; Dogs; Free Radicals; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glutathione; In Vitro; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Organ Preservation; Oxygen; Perfusion; Proteinuria; Sodium; Superoxide Dismutase; Time Factors; Urine; Verapamil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023932534

The best characterized actions of neurotransmitters are the alterations in excitability that they elicit in other neurons. These changes in neuronal firing rate are due to the opening or closing of transmembrane channels selectively permeable to given ionic species. We have however recently demonstrated that certain transmitters can regulate energy metabolism within discrete regions of the central nervous system. In particular we have observed that Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide stimulates glycogenolysis in the cerebral cortex. This action is also exerted by the monoamines noradrenaline, serotonin and histamine. Studies in primary cultures indicate that the glycogenolysis elicited by neurotransmitters may take place in astrocytes, which are glial cells and where glycogen is predominantly stored in the nervous system. These observations suggest that the primary function of certain neuronal circuits may be to regulate the availability of energy substrates within discrete neuronal ensembles.",,"histamine; neuropeptide; neurotransmitter; noradrenalin; serotonin; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; astrocyte; brain cortex; energy transfer; glycogen storage; glycogenolysis; human; membrane permeability; nerve cell; review; Animal; Brain; Glycogen; Homeostasis; Neurotransmitters; Norepinephrine; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023917761

The ξ form, obtained by grinding, was transformed to the δ form under 0% relative humidity at various storage temperatures after an induction time of a few hours. The mechanism of solid-state transformation of the ξ form to the δ form was found to be random nucleation with two-dimensional growth of nuclei (Avrami-Erofeev model) by means of the Hancock and Sharp method, and the activation energy of this transformation was calculated to be 44.5 kcal/mol.

The various diets were chosen freely by the parents and the newborns were exclusively fed either human milk (n=56), Multival 1 (n=31), Humana 1 (n=33), or Pre Aptamil (n=34). No significant differences in body, weight, body length or head circumference were observed between any of the different dietary groups. Fat storage, as assessed by measurements of skinfold thickness, was significantly less in breast-fed children compared to those on the formula diets. Breast-fed and Pre Aptamil-fed infants had the highest levels of total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and LDL. No differences were observed in the levels of total serum triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)- and high density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol, VLDL and HDL. There were no strong correlations between the physical and the biochemical parameters.

In these early studies, respiratory gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange was first used to demonstrate that during intense exercise CHO serves as the primary fuel for the muscles. It was also observed that when subjects were fed diets rich in CHO they tended to have greater endurance and to derive more of their energy from CHO during steady-state exercise. The mechanisms underlying this shift toward CHO oxidation and enhanced performance have only recently been examined using the invasive measurements of muscle and liver glycogen and the employment of isotopes. The following review will attempt to show the important role played by endogenous and ingested CHO during muscle performance. Specific attention will be given to the influence of dietary sugar on muscle and liver glycogen storage.",,"carbohydrate; glycogen; human; nutrition; performance; review; training",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023869773

The choice of the aforesaid combination as a link wall has been made because of relatively high heat transfer coefficient of water and greater thermal energy storage potential of the combination. The relatively greater thermal storage potential of the proposed combination reduces the temperature swings in the living space and provides, thereby a comfortable living environment. Analytical expression for living space temperature as a function of climatic and system parameters as well as various heat transfer coefficients have been derived. Numerical calculations have been carried out for a typical day of North America (Boulder) for zero ventilation rate. It is concluded that the proposed combination as a link wall gives best thermal load levelling. © 1988.",,"HEAT TRANSFER - Mathematical Models; SOLAR ENERGY; LOAD LEVELLING; PHASE CHANGE COMPONENT MATERIAL; SOLARIUM; THERMAL ANALYSIS; BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023868217

The two predominant drivers for this necessity are air quality and the finite supply of petroleum. It is obvious then, that something must be done in transportation to reverse the trend. The electric vehicle (EV) has been proposed as a means to accomplish this. But it can only succeed if we have a major replacement of the internal combustion engine (ICE) powered vehicle with the EV. To accomplish this the EV must be on a par with the ICE vehicle in terms of user acceptance. The key factor in market acceptance that has prevented the EV from competing with the ICE is its inability to provide unlimited range by rapid replenishment of the energy source.

Acetonitrile extraction is compared with perchloric acid extraction of citric acid cycle intermediates from plasma. Low recovery of some organic acids from blood seems not to be due to enzymatic degradation. Storage of acetonitrile extracts in liquid nitrogen led to a small but significant decrease in pyruvate levels in human blood. However, significant changes in other organic acids were not seen.

Bidirectionality, forward and backward information flow, is introduced in neural nets to produce two-way associative search for stored associations (Ai, Bi). Passing information through M gives one direction; passing it through its transpose MT gives the other. A bidirectional associative memory (BAM) behaves as a heteroassociative content addressable memory (CAM), storing and recalling the vector pairs (A1, B1),-• Bm), where A ∊ {0,1}” and B ∊ {0,1}P, We prove that every n -by- p matrix M is a bidirectionally stable heteroassociative CAM for both binary/bipolar and continuous neurons ai and bj. When the BAM neurons are activated, the network quickly evolves to a stable state of two-pattern reverberation, or resonance. The stable reverberation corresponds to a system energy local minimum. Heteroassociative information is encoded in a BAM by summing correlation matrices. The BAM storage capacity for reliable recall is roughly m min (n, p). No more heteroassociative pairs can be reliably stored and recalled than the lesser of the dimensions of the pattern spaces {0,1}” and {0,1}P. The Appendix shows that it is better on average to use bipolar { -1,1} coding than binary {0,1} coding of heteroassociative pairs (Ai, Bi). BAM encoding and decoding are combined in the adaptive BAM, which extends global bidirectional stability to realtime unsupervised learning. Temporal patterns (A1,., Am) are represented as ordered lists of binary/bipolar vectors and stored in a temporal associative memory (TAM) n -by- n matrix M as a limit cycle of the dynamical system. Forward recall proceeds through M, backward recall through MT. Temporal patterns are stored by summing contiguous bipolar correlation matrices, XT1X2 +…+ XTm-1Xm, generalizing the BAM storage procedure. This temporal encoding scheme is seen to be equivalent to a form of Grossberg outstar avalanche coding for spatiotemporal patterns. The storage capacity is m = m1+…+ mk n, where mjis the length of the j th temporal pattern and n is the dimension of the spatial pattern space. Limit cycles (A1,…, Am, Al) are shown to be stored in local energy minima of the binary state space {0,1}n. © 1988 IEEE",,"CONTROL SYSTEMS, NONLINEAR; DATA STORAGE, DIGITAL - Associative; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Matrix Algebra; BIDIRECTIONAL ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES; HETEROASSOCIATIVE INFORMATION; NONLINEAR FEEDBACK NEURAL NETWORKS; REAL-TIME UNSUPERVISED LEARNING; TEMPORAL ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES; SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND CYBERNETICS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023861743

This results in a very large, rectangular, unsnubbed, reverse-biased safe operating area (RBSOA) that extends to the Vdrxm on the voltage axis and beyond the Itcsm on the current axis. Storage time is reduced to a few tenths of a microsecond and the inductance required for paralleling is reduced by an order of magnitude. Elimination of the turn-off snubber capacitors allows protective circuit trip levels to be set closer to the device ratings and reduces the energy loss in the turn-on snubber. The size of the turn-on snubber inductor can be significantly reduced. High-frequency operation of GTOs becomes practical with this technique due to the short storage times and low external snubber losses. © 1988 IEEE",,"CAPACITORS; ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS - Protection; GATE DRIVE CIRCUIT; GATE TURN-OFF (GTO) THYRISTOR; TURN-OFF SNUBBER CAPACITORS ELIMINATION; TURN-ON SNUBBER INDUCTOR; THYRISTORS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023861733

The rotational kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy by making use of the homopolar generator principle. The conversion efficiency is calculated to be 47% in generating electrical energy of 20 kJ/pulse (1.7 MW peak power) at a repetition rate of 7 Hz.

The Beizer perfusate was used primarily (n=140) and secondarily (n=14) in combination with pulsatile machine perfusion. These two groups were compared with a previous group of kidneys machine-perfused with silica gel (cryoprecipitated human plasma). The incidence of immediate function of the group primarily perfused with Beizer perfusate was statistically significantly improved over that of the silica gel. The secondarily perfused Beizer group, “imported” kidneys previously preserved with simple cold storage, had notably longer periods of preservation and higher resistances on the machine. However, 100% of this group functioned immediately. Other findings in this study show that the Beizer perfusate allows for improved parenchymal function posttransplant, as noted by a more rapid clearance of serum creatinine posttransplant. When comparing the immediate function group with those suffering early dysfunction, there is a statistically significant increased resistance on the machine in the latter group. This allows for prediction of immediate function based on perfusion characteristics of the kidney. The Beizer perfusate, composed of metabolic substrates for high-energy phosphate production, improves the incidence of immediate function in machine-perfused kidneys, as well as improved qualitative function posttransplant.

The principal goal is a better understanding of how the protein binding site influences the energetic, photochemical, and spectroscopic properties of the bound chromophore. Absolute quantum yields for the isorhodopsin (I) to bathorhodopsin (B) phototransformation are assigned at 77 K by using the rhodopsin (R) to bathorhodopsin phototransformation as an internal standard (phi R----B = 0.67). In contrast to rhodopsin photochemistry, isorhodopsin displays a wavelength dependent quantum yield for photochemical generation of bathorhodopsin at 77 K. Measurements at seven wavelengths yielded values ranging from a low of 0.089 +/- 0.021 at 565 nm to a high of 0.168 +/- 0.012 at 440 nm. An analysis of these data based on a variety of kinetic models suggests that the I----B phototransformation encounters a small activation barrier (approximately 0.2 kcal mol-1) associated with the 9-cis----9-trans excited-state torsional-potential surface. The 9-cis retinal chromophore in solution (EPA, 77 K) has the smallest oscillator strength relative to the other isomers: 1.17 (all-trans), 0.98 (9-cis), 1.04 (11-cis), and 1.06 (13-cis). The effect of conformation is quite different for the opsin-bound chromophores. The oscillator strength of the lambda max absorption band of I is observed to be anomalously large (1.11) relative to the lambda max absorption bands of R (0.98) and B (1.07). The wavelength-dependent photoisomerization quantum yields and the anomalous oscillator strength associated with isorhodopsin provide important information on the nature of the opsin binding site. Various models of the binding site were tested by using INDO-PSDCI molecular orbital theory to predict the oscillator strengths of R, B, and I and to calculate the barriers and energy storage associated with the photochemistry of R and I for each model. Our experimental and theoretical investigation leads to the following conclusions: (a) The counterion (abbreviated as CTN) is not intimately associated with the imine proton in R, B, or I. The counterion lies underneath the plane of the chromophore in R and I, and the primary chromophore-counterion electrostatic interactions involve C15-CTN and C13-CTN. These interactions are responsible for the anomalous oscillator strength of I relative to R and B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1988, The Biophysical Society.

For the definition of the Electrical Power System (EPS) challenging requirements as the provision of high power levels under hard LEO conditions, maintainability, commonality etc. are to be taken into account. These requirements are to be seen in conjunction with the Columbus IOC (initial operational capability) scenario stipulating that EPS hardware shall be used on the Polar Platform, the Pressurized Module attached to the U.S. Space Station and the Man-Tended Free Flier. According to the availability of European technologies, the baseline in the power generation area is a photovoltaic system which provides three regulated main buses (150 V d.c.) to the users. In order to maintain power supply during eclipse phases, nickel hydrogen batteries will be used for energy storage purposes with nickel cadmium as back-up solution. The power distribution system needs special attention. Due to the elevated voltage levels mechanical switch gear cannot be used any longer. It is to be replaced by solid state power controllers (SSPC). Because these devices show a totally different behaviour with regard to conventional relay contacts, new approaches in the area of switching and protection are necessary. In view of the crucial role of this new technology for the realization of medium voltage d.c. systems, it is of great importance for Columbus and, hence will receive adequate consideration in the paper. In order to cater for effective management and control of the power supply and distribution hardware, a so called power system internal data processing assembly (PINDAP) has been introduced in the EPS. PINDAP is the key to reduced dependence on ground stations (alleviated ground support requirements); it keeps crew involvement in the EPS control process to as minimum and provides comprehensive means for EPS check-out and verification which facilitates in-orbit maintenance. © 1988.",,"ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Space Applications; COLUMBUS PROGRAM; LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES; SATELLITES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023842580

Despite important energy losses from the underground storage, the storage efficiency reaches 0.7.

Such flow behavior must be fully understood for the sophisticated design of the LMFBR. Furthermore, the thermal-hydraulic feature of the pool-type LMFBR is one of the most important key issues from the viewpoint of reactor safety. The present study is devoted to the numerical analyses of the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of the pool-type LMFBR. The finite element method (FEM) is chosen for the spatial approximation, taking an advantage of the FEM's flexibility for the approximation of the complicated geometry. Considering the fact that the efficient computation is essential for the FE analysis of complicated three-dimensional flow, an efficient FE scheme for the incompressible viscous flow is proposed in the present paper.

Apheresis platelets were stored with 100 ml plasma in 1-liter bags made of EV or standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic at 22 °C with constant agitation. The oxygen permeability of the 1-liter EV bag averaged 1447 nmol/min/atm, which was about 1.5 times higher than that of PVC bags. The partial oxygen tension (PO2) of platelet concentrates (PC) has linearly decreased to 16 mm Hg with increasing platelet counts. The level of the partial carbon dioxide was always higher in EV bags than in PVC bags. Oxygen consumption rates of platelets stored in EV and PVC bags with a sufficient oxygen supply averaged 1.25 and 1.20 nmol/min/109 platelets, respectively. The rates of glucose consumption and lactate production were not changed in two bags. Ninety percent of the total ATP production of about 8 nmol/min/109 platelets were generated through the aerobic metabolism. The platelet counts in the 1-liter EV and PVC bags, at which PO2 is 16 mm Hg, were 2.2 and 1.5 × 1011 platelets, respectively.

The release of endogenous noradrenaline and dihydroxyphenylglycol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The release of dihydroxyphenylglycol, the main neuronal noradrenaline metabolite, was used as an indicator of the free axoplasmic amine concentration. When storage function of neuronal vesicles was disturbed by Ro 4-1284 or trimethyltin, high dihydroxyphenylglycol release was observed without concomitant overflow of noradrenaline. If, however, these agents were combined with inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase or with veratridine-induced entry of sodium into the neuron, both dihydroxyphenylglycol and noradrenaline were released. Noradrenaline release was independent of extracellular calcium and was suppressed by blockade of neuronal catecholamine uptake (uptake1), indicating nonexocytotic noradrenaline liberation from the sympathetic nerve ending. This release critically depended on two conditions: 1) increased cytoplasmic concentrations of noradrenaline within the sympathetic neuron and 2) intraneuronal sodium accumulation. Both conditions together were required to induce noradrenaline efflux across the plasma membrane using the uptake1 carrier in reverse of its normal transport direction. A disturbed energy status of the sympathetic neuron, induced by cyanide intoxication or ischemia, likewise caused calcium-independent noradrenaline release by interfering with both vesicular storage function and neuronal sodium homoeostasis. Again, release was sensitive to uptake1 blockade. Since neuronal sodium accumulation was the rate-limiting step, release was further accelerated when residual Na+,K+-ATPase activity was inhibited. Na+-H+ exchange was identified as the predominant pathway of sodium entry into the sympathetic nerve ending in ischemia, and its inhibition by amiloride and ethylisopropylamiloride markedly suppressed ischemia-induced noradrenaline release.",,"2 ethyl 1,2,3,4,6,7 hexahydro 2 hydroxy 3 isobutyl 9,10 dimethoxy 11bh benzo[a]quinolizine; 5 (n ethyl n isopropyl)amiloride; adenosine triphosphate; amiloride; calcium; desipramine; monensin; noradrenalin; ouabain; sodium cyanide; tetrodotoxin; trimethyltin; veratridine; calcium; noradrenalin; sodium; animal experiment; axoplasm; heart muscle ischemia; intravenous drug administration; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; animal; article; coronary artery disease; homeostasis; male; metabolism; nerve cell; physiology; rat strain; transport at the cellular level; Animal; Biological Transport; Calcium; Coronary Disease; Homeostasis; Male; Neurons; Norepinephrine; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Sodium; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023821172

Because of conflicting reports on the stability of HI 6 in aqueous solutions, we studied the factors influencing its stability. HI 6 has been shown to be most stable in acidic solution between pH 2 and 3. At that pH, HI 6 decomposes probably by attack of nucleophiles on the methylene carbon atom of the aminal-acetal bond of the ""ether bridge"". HI 6 decomposition follows first order kinetics. From Arrhenius plots of the decay of HI 6 at various concentrations it became obvious that the rate of decomposition increased with increasing HI 6 concentration with simultaneous decrease in the energy of activation. To decide whether the pyridinium compound itself or its anions are responsible for the enhanced decomposition, we studied the influence of chloride, phosphate and iodide. These anions stimulated the decay of HI 6 at increasing strength; their effect, however, was small as compared to that brought about by the pyridinium oxime itself. Since 1-methylisonicotinamide chloride had virtually no effect in contrast to 1-methylpyridinium-2-aldoxime chloride, we conclude that the oximate anion is responsible for the intermolecular attack on HI 6. At present, we recommend storage of HI 6 at concentrations not exceeding 0.1 M in aqueous solution at pH 2.5 and low temperatures. Under these conditions an apparent shelf-life of 20 years is calculated when HI 6 is stored at 8° C. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","HI 6; Oximes; Stability","1 (4 carbamoylpyridinio) 1' (2 hydroxyiminomethylpyridinio)dimethyl ether; antidote; chloride; iodide; phosphate; aqueous solution; drug stability; drug storage; nonhuman; ph; priority journal; temperature; Cholinesterase Reactivators; Drug Stability; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Pyridinium Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023814432

The bubble-damage detector has a very high neutron sensitivity (up to 1.0 ± 0.2 bubbles. μSv-1), zero background and negligible sensitivity to gamma rays. However, the detectors suffered a substantial loss in neutron sensitivity with storage time before irradiation, a large variation in sensitivity with temperature during irradiation, and poor stability of the bubbles after irradiation.

However, blood urea nitrogen and plasma amino acid concentrations also were higher in groups 2 and 3; both were higher in group 2 than in group 3, refiecting the positive effect of the higher energy intake on protein utilization. This observation, combined with data from an earlier study, indicates that protein intakes in excess of 3 gm/100 kcal will not be utilized completely. Energy expenditure in group 3 was greater than in group 1 but not group 2, raising the possibility that protein intakes not utilized completely contribute to diet-induced thermogenesis. The higher energy intake in group 3 vs group 2 did not affect rate of weight gain significantly, but energy storage in group 3, and hence fat accretion, was greater than that of other groups.

A possible role of tissue adenine nucleotides (AN) in the inability of the kidney to recover after transplantation following cold storage has not yet been established. In a previous study we have demonstrated that the extent of AN depletion in kidneys during storage at 4°C is dependent on the AN level at the beginning of the hypothermic period. After 90 minutes of normothermic ischemia that reduced the AN level to about 35%, no further depletion of AN occurred during subsequent cold storage for three days, whereas after 30 minutes of ischemia with AN levels reduced to 66% of control, as well as in nonischemic kidneys with normal AN levels, a depletion was found to 41% of control after three days of cold storage. These findings suggest that AN levels during prolonged cold storage will not drop below 35% to 40% of control, irrespective of the duration of the preceding period of normothermic ischemia. The time interval of normothermic ischemia has been found to influence substantially the outcome of kidney function transplanted after long-term cold storage. Hence, the level of AN at the end of the cold storage seems not to be a decisive factor for posttransplant renal viability. The question was then raised whether the recovery of the AN stores in posttransplant kidneys is influenced by cold storage following normothermic ischemia of variable duration. The present study was conducted to address this question. Tissue specimens were taken from the cortex of canine kidneys subjected to 30 and 90 minutes of normothermic ischemia after 48 hours of cold storage, and at the end of 60 minutes of reperfusion following transplantation. In control experiments, the period of cold storage was omitted and the kidneys were reperfused in situ. With a sophisticated HPLC technique, the content of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP) and degradation products such as IMP, adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, was determined.",,"adenine nucleotide; dog; ischemia; kidney transplantation; methodology; nonhuman; organ perfusion; priority journal; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Dogs; Energy Metabolism; Female; Hypothermia, Induced; Hypoxanthine; Hypoxanthines; Ischemia; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Organ Preservation; Reperfusion Injury; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023779505

Biol Chem. 263, 16942-16953) revealed a homogeneous population (≥95%) of distinctly sized square-shaped, octameric particles with a side length of 10 nm that frequently exhibited a pronounced 4-fold axis of symmetry. The cube-like molecules consist of four dimers that are arranged around a stain-accumulating central cavity of 2.5-3 nm in diameter. This interpretation is supported by single particle averaging including correlation analysis by computer. Upon prolonged storage or high dilution, the cube-like octamers tended to dissociate into 'banana-shaped' dimers. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments yielded an s value of 12.8-13.5 S and an M(r) of 328,000 ± 25,000 for the octameric cubes. An s value of 5.0 S and a M(r) of 83,000 ± 8,000 was found under conditions which revealed banana-shaped dimers. These dimers proved to be very stable, as their dissociation into monomers of 45 kDa (s value = 2.0 S) required 6 M guanidine HCl. Thus, the oligomeric structures observed in the electron microscope are identified as Mi-CK dimers (banana-shaped structures) and cubical Mi-CK octamers assembled from four Mi-CK dimers. The octameric nature of native Mi-CK and the formation of Mi-CK dimers were confirmed by direct mass measurements of individual molecules by scanning transmission electron microscopy yielding a molecular mass of 340 ± 55 kDa for the octamer and 89 ± 27 kDa for the dimer. A structural model of Mi-CK octamers and the possible interaction with ATP/ADP-translocator molecules as well as with the outer mitochondrial membrane is proposed.

No differences related to sex could be found with regard to the selenium level, and peroxidase activity assayed with hydrogen peroxide. However, the peroxidase activity assayed with t-butyl hydroperoxide was higher in females than in males (p<.05). The peroxidase activities are dependent on age. Thus, the peroxidase levels assayed with both substrates show a minimum value in the age group from 40 to 50 yr for both smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers did show more homogeneous values as a function of age than nonsmokers. Smokers had significantly lower selenium values than nonsmokers, but glutathione peroxidase values identical with those of nonsmokers. Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients suffer from a chronic relapsing/remitting demyelinating disease. A theory explaining the pathogenesis of MS concerns increased stickiness of cellular plasma membranes, hampering normal vascular function of the brain. In agreement with that theory, the present communication demonstrates significantly lowered selenium values and lowered glutathione peroxidase activities of major types of hematogenous cells. In close agreement with these findings, hematogenous cells in MS show increased peroxidation rates. A nonblinded biochemical dietary experiment on MS patients showed that all abnormalities could be normalized by daily intake of selenium, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Batten's disease is a recessive inherited neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by progressive loss of vision, epilepsy, and dementia. Neuropathologically, this disease is characterized by storage of lipofuscin in nervous tissue. We have in a few cases documented a low selenium status and low glutathione peroxidase activities of hematogenous cells. As in MS, we normalized the biochemical abnormalities by an antioxidative treatment. Like in similar Finnish studies, the biochemical parameters can be normalized.

To test the hypothesis that prior glucose loading of donor liver would optimize its adenosine triphosphate production and adenylate energy charge during ex vivo organ preservation, adult male rats were randomized to receive either intravenous dextrose or saline for 44 h. After this infusion, a liver lobe was exposed and freeze-clamped (time 0). The remaining liver was quickly flushed, excised, and stored in Collins' II solution at 2 °C for 8 h. Additional lobes were freeze-clamped at 1, 4, and 8 h. Liver adenosine triphosphate, total nucleoside triphosphates, and energy charge losses were significantly reduced in the dextrose-treated rats in comparison with saline-treated rats during the first 4 h of preservation. Although the livers from rats receiving intravenous dextrose were able to generate lactate, their glycogen stores were not utilized appreciably, suggesting that exogenous glucose served as a substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Unesterified choline levels of the fasted rat livers were significantly higher than those from the rats receiving intravenous dextrose by the first hour, indicative of increased membrane breakdown. These results indicate that prior infusion of glucose enhances the capacity of the ex vivo liver, presumably through the induction and stabilization of key glycolytic enzymes, to anaerobically generate adenosine triphosphate. Administration of glucose to liver donors before organ procurement may improve posttransplant graft function by reducing the loss of hepatocellular energy, retarding membrane damage, and fostering glycogen storage for use in the early postoperative period. © 1988.",,"adenosine triphosphate; glucose; animal cell; cell energy; glycogen storage; graft preservation; liver transplantation; membrane damage; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Choline; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Germ-Free Life; Glucose; Hypothermia, Induced; Lactates; Liver; Liver Glycogen; Male; Organ Preservation; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023748324

Additionally, we compared ouabain with another potential adjunct, the calcium channel blocker verapamil. The isolated rabbit heart was used as a model, and three experimental groups were studied after 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours of 4°C ischemia. Hearts in group I were stored in a standard high potassium solution; hearts in groups II and III were stored in the same solution supplemented with verapamil (2 mg/L) and ouabain (3 mg/L), respectively. After ischemia, all hearts were reperfused for 45 minutes on a modified Langendorff apparatus, and left ventricular function was measured before freeze-clamping the heart for metabolite determination. At 1 and 6 hours, hearts in all groups functioned well, but the group III hearts had higher levels of adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, total adenine nucleotides, and glycogen. After 12 hours of ischemia, function was significantly better in group III hearts (p < 0.01) compared with that of hearts in groups I and II. Group III hearts also exhibited higher levels of high energy phosphates and glycogen. After 24 hours of storage, all hearts functioned poorly, and there was a marked decline in measured metabolites. Although we could show no improvement with the addition of verapamil, ventricular function was improved after storage in a high potassium hypothermic solution containing ouabain.

It was found that besides the ester type phosphates of myosin there was a considerable amount of N-P type energy-rich phosphoryl groups bond to the basic amino acids of peptide chains. The endogenous P concentration of myosin depends on the source of the preparation. The concentration of P is much higher in myosin preparations of well-trained animals and human subjects compared to those found in the control muscles. As the P binding sites of fresh purified myosin are only partially saturated, the preparations can incorporate P up to a definite saturation only. The phosphorylating ability of myosins disappears after prolonged storage as a consequence of an alteration in structure of the myosin molecule. The P groups are moving inside the myosin molecule. It is supposed that the inorganic P release promoted by actin is connected with the thin filament movements towards the centre of the sarcomere, furthermore P replenishment, P linking and movement involve N3-trimethyl-lysine, 3-methylhistidine, P-Arg and two conformers of P-His.

It is found that agents preventing the light-induced ΔΨ formation (photosynthetic redox chain inhibitor dibromothymoquinone) or dissipating ΔΨ (uncoupler tetrachlorotrifluoromethylbenzimidazole) strongly decrease the fluorescence of the ethylrhodamine-stained trichomes. K+-H+ antiporter nigericin converting ΔpH to ΔΨ increases the fluorescence. These relationships are in agreement with the assumption that ethylrhodamine electrophoretically accumulates inside the cyanobacterial cells. Illumination of a single cell in the P. uncinatum trichome gives rise to quenching of the fluorescence in this cell and usually in one or two neighbor cells, whereas the rest of trichome remains fluorescing. A small light spot (5% of the trichome length) causes an increase in the ethylrhodamine fluorescence not only in the illuminated but also in the nonilluminated parts of the trichome up to the laser-treated cell or its neighbor(s). It is concluded ethylrhodamine can be used to monitor the power transmission which was previously demonstrated by microelectrode studies of the cyanobacterial trichomes. In certain trichomes, several 'dark' cells appear during the storage of the trichomes without energy sources. Illumination for several minutes results in dark cells becoming fluorescing. Thus some cells or cell clusters can be reversibly excluded from the lateral ΔΨ-transmitting system of the trichome, the rest being still electrically connected. This means that filamentous cyanobacteria possess mechanisms to transmit power along the trichome and to switch off this transmission.",,"animal cell; cell culture; cell membrane potential; Cyanobacterium; fluorescence; laser; nonhuman; phormidium inundatum; priority journal; ultrastructure; Animalia; Cyanobacteria; Phormidium inundatum; Phormidium uncinatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023719244

In this study, gas production dynamics were investigated using laboratory scale digesters fed daily with dairy manure and operated both at constant temperature and with programmed temperature fluctuations of ±3·3°C about a mean of 35·8°C.

Major cost savings are achieved by eliminating the duplication of components and subsystems between the spacecraft and upper stage. Eliminating components also reduces weight and increases reliability or, alternatively, allows for additional on-orbit propellant or equipment. Low-thrust transfer allows near-Earth deployment and checkout so that malfunctioning spacecraft can be retrieved or repaired. It provides a more benign transfer to the operational orbit from which retrieval is not normally possible. It also allows greater operational flexibility for storage in low Earth orbit following checkout or use of various orbits during different mission phases. Full autonomy during the critical sequence of perigee burns reduces both the cost and risk of ground operations.

Three techniques were used, namely steady-state shear stress-shear rate measurements, shear modulus and oscillatory measurements. From these the following rheological parameters were determined: the Bingham yield value τβ, the Casson yield value τc, the high frequency modulus G∞, the complex modulus G*, the storage modulus G′ and the loss modulus G″. All rheological parameters showed a sudden increase above a critical free polymer volume fraction, φp+, which decreased with increase of molecular weight of the free polymer. The flocculation was reversible. From the Bingham yield value, the energy of separation of flocs into single units, ESep, was calculated using reasonable values for the number of contact points in a floc and assuming that above the yield point all flocs are broken down into individual units. The values of ESep were compared with the depletion attraction energy, Gdep, which was calculated from Asakura and Oosawa's and Fleer, Scheutjens and Vincent's models, assuming the particles to behave as hard spheres. The results of the calculations showed that Gdep deviates from ESep indicating that the hard-sphere model is not valid for sterically stabilised dispersions with ""soft"" tails. © 1998.",,"LATEXES; RHEOLOGY - Measurements; SUSPENSIONS - Flocculation; BINGHAM YIELD VALUE; CASSON YIELD VALUE; DEPLETION FLOCCULATION; FLOCCULATION REVERSIBILITY; SHEAR MODULUS; POLYSTYRENES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023342365

Whereas very high voltages are produced during the energy transfer process using a conventional transformer, very low voltages are induced during an HPPT-type operation. In addition, unlike a homopolar generator or a com-pulsator, the HPPT system has no moving parts. The key feature of the HPPT device is its superconducting primary. The sequence of HPPT operation is to charge the primary to a level very close to the critical current of the superconductor, then drive it normal uniformly when an energy pulse is required. It is therefore a combination energy storage, power conditioning, and energy transfer device. The time constant for the energy transfer for a given geometry and design is determined mainly by the total normal resistance of the primary. Since the resistance and inductance are distributed along the windings, internal voltage elimination is locally achieved, resulting in a very low terminal voltage for the transformer. The theory of HPPT and its operation is briefly reviewed in this paper, having been described in an earlier paper.1 An experimental program has been initiated to verify the HPPT concept as well as determine its characteristics. Detailed test design, setup, results, and their comparison to theoretically derived engineering models are presented. Potential applications of such a device and the critical issues associated with the design of an HPPT system are also discussed. The HPPT system represents a breakthrough in pulsed power technology through application of superconducting magnet technology. © 1988 IEEE",,"CRITICAL CURRENT; HYBRID PULSED POWER TRANSFORMER; NO MOVING PARTS; POWER CONDITIONING; SUPERCONDUCTING PRIMARY COIL; ELECTRIC COILS; SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMERS, PULSE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023310033

For many of the multipoles, that multipole must be reduced (at a radius of 1 centimeter) to the order of 0.2 parts in 10,000. This field accuracy is dictated by the physics of storing very small high-current proton beams at energies ranging from 1 TeV to 20 TeV. Magnetization of the superconductor can cause sextupole field errors of up to 6 parts in 10,000 at an injection field of 0.33 T at a radius of 1 centimeter. Saturation of the magnet iron can induce sextupole field errors of 1 to 2 parts in 10,000 at the full field of 6.6 T. Manufacturing errors can induce other multipole components, both normal and skew. The SSC coil has three wedges separating the superconducting coil blocks on the inner layer of the coil. These wedges must be accurately located. If the wedges have superconductors attached, one can correct all of the magnetic field multipoles (both normal and skew) from N=l (dipole) to N=6 (12 pole). This paper describes this method of correction as it pertains to the SSC dipole magnet. © 1988 IEEE",,"MAGNET WEDGES; SSC DIPOLES; SSC LUMPED CORRECTION MAGNET SYSTEM; SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER COLLIDER (SSC); ACCELERATORS - Magnets; ELECTRIC COILS; MAGNETIC FIELDS; SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023308094

The structural difference between a storage ring and a Penning trap requires a complete revision of the starting points on which to base the theory. Not surprisingly, however, the final results exhibit many similarities. One of the main differences is that the noise effects are best treated, in a Penning trap, by introducing a limiting energy lim, proportional to the noise amplitude, that represents the minimum energy attainable with stochastic cooling. The theory shows that stochastic cooling in a Penning trap can be very useful when one wants rapidly to cool the energy of the trapped particles down to limiting energies greater than kT, T being the noise temperature associated with the detection circuits. © 1988 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012227288

G. Don var. Little Bright Eye was studied to determine the specificity of uptake and the role of ion trapping in the storage of alkaloids. Accumulation of the indole alkaloids vindoline, ajmalicine, tabersonine, and vinblastine was found to be biphasic, with an initial burst of uptake followed by a slow, prolonged phase of accumulation. The concentration and pH dependence of the initial burst of uptake for vindoline suggested that uptake occurred by simple diffusion. Uptake of nicotine was monophasic, with a half life of 5.2 minutes. The accumulation ratio (Ci/Ce) for nicotine at steady state and for the initial burst of uptake for vindoline and ajmalicine suggested that accumulation was driven by the pH gradient between the vacuole and the external assay medium. The second, sustained phase of uptake of vindoline was sensitive to inhibition by either 20 millimolar NaN3or 0.5 millimolar Cu2+. In azide-treated protoplasts, the uptake for vindoline conformed to the kinetics of simple diffusion, with a half life of 4 minutes. The second phase of uptake for ajmalicine, although sensitive to inhibition by Cu2+, was insensitive to inhibition by NaN3. The biphasic uptake of the indole alkaloids was not due to any significant metabolism. It is concluded that accumulation and storage of the indole alkaloids is due only partly to ion trapping of the alkaloids by the low pH of the vacuole lumen. In the case of vindoline, there appears to be a specific energy-requiring uptake that is not seen with nicotine (which is not endogenous to Catharanthus). Accumulation of ajmalicine appears to involve both ion trapping and an azide-insensitive component, which may be due to complexation with organic counterions and phenolics. © 1988 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is achieved over a broad range of temperatures and frequencies with a single set of molecular parameters. All molecular parameters are independent of temperature and frequency and can be determined separately. The master dynamic storage modulus and loss tangent are uniquely defined by a single parameter that characterizes the shape of the hole energy spectrum. The transition from a Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) (or Doolittle) dependence to an Arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation timescale (shift factor) in the vicinity of Tg is predicted and interpreted in molecular terms. The dynamic response of crosslinked polymers is quite similar to that of amorphous polymers. However, the timescale and the hole energy spectrum are orders of magnitude longer and broader, respectively. As a result, we have found higher activation energy, more frozen-in free volume and smaller effect of physical ageing on the dynamic properties of crosslinked systems. © 1988.","dynamic moduli; epoxy resin; free volume; glass transition; physical ageing; time-temperature superposition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010011863

The principles of energy-dispersive methods of differential spectroscopy are then described, covering both high- and low-resolution systems. By using digital electronics to control the modulation, errors associated with timing are reduced to well below those associated with the random nature of X-ray emission. By delaying demodulation until the final counting stage, thus using only one chain of electronic processors, errors associated with two chains of different characteristics are eliminated. Stability of the source is no longer an important criterion and the method is ideally suited for use with synchrotron radiation sources where beam intensity decays with a half-life of a few hours. It is also possible to derive the modulation cycles from the oscillator that controls the electron bunches in the storage ring, thereby making possible time-resolved and phase-sensitive studies. © 1988, Wiley-Blackwell.

The occurrence, metabolism and physiological significance of non-protein nitrogenous compounds in fish are discussed. 2. 2. Free histidine and imidazole dipeptides serve as biological buffers, besides functioning in transport mechanisms for copper and zinc. 3. 3. Trimethylamine oxide is a detoxification product of dietary trimethylamine. It participates in osmoregulation of marine species and it stabilizes elasmobranch protein structure in the presence of large amounts of urea. The latter two functions are shared with other methylamine compounds (sarcosine, betaine). 4. 4. When present in high concentrations, taurine participates as an osmolyte in cell volume regulation. Teleosts condensate bile acids with taurine for the synthesis of bile salts. The general function of taurine is still unclear. 5. 5. Besides their recognized role as precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, purines and pyrimidines, amides participate in a mechanism for the control of ammonia levels and ammonia excretion rates. Glutamine synthesis protects the brain against the consequences of an ammonia load. 6. 6. Branched-chain amino acids are important substrates for energy metabolism in the telecost myotome. The metabolic fate of their amino group requires further investigation. 7. 7. During environmental anoxia, Cyprinids use both carbohydrates and amino acids as substrates for anaerobic energy production. Possible biochemical mechanisms are discussed. A theoretical analysis shows that the carbon skeleton of certain amino acids may appear as ethanol, whereas that of others can be incorporated into storage lipids.

We perform monthly time series analyses of hourly global horizontal solar radiation for a wide range of climatic stations that span temperate and tropical conditions. The stationary statistics for individual hours are found to be very similar to the corresponding results for daily total global horizontal radiation, in keeping with a related fundamental observation of Liu & Jordan. Investigation of sequential properties shows that autocorrelation coefficients are, to a good approximation, independent of time of day and that persistence times are nearly as long as the entire daylight period, mainly due to the effect of very strong correlations at one-hour lag times. The isolated effect of two-hour and longer lag times, via the partial autocorrelation coefficients, is found to be negligible in most, but by no means all, instances. Finally, we find no universal correlation between hourly autocorrelation coefficients and monthly average radiation figures. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001648622

Results showed also that saving water by decreasing the season's total of percolation from 3000 to 120 mm could be achieved without any concurrent penalty of IR36 grain yield, and that percolation rate was much influenced by sub-surface hydrology and regional and local drainage. Soil strength decreased more when puddling was made under standing water rather than at field-capacity wetness; rototiller puddling weakened a deeper zone of soil (0-19 cm depth had cone penetrometer strength <0.4 MPa) than did wet plouging and harrowing (0-16 cm). Measurements of water-release characteristics showed that puddling increased storage porosity from 6 to 16% and residual porosity from 34 to 42% at the expense of transmission porosity, which declined from 26 to 4%.

Based on parts of the book by Rumelhart and colleagues, many authors equate backpropagation with the generalized delta rule applied to fully-connected feedforward networks. This paper will summarize a more general formulation of backpropagation, developed in 1974, which does more justice to the roots of the method in numerical analysis and statistics, and also does more justice to creative approaches expressed by neural modelers in the past year or two. It will discuss applications of backpropagation to forecasting over time (where errors have been halved by using methods other than least squares), to optimization, to sensitivity analysis, and to brain research. This paper will go on to derive a generalization of backpropagation to recurrent systems (which input their own output), such as hybrids of perceptron-style networks and Grossberg/Hopfield networks. Unlike the proposal of Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, this generalization does not require the storage of intermediate iterations to deal with continuous recurrence. This generalization was applied in 1981 to a model of natural gas markets, where it located sources of forecast uncertainty related to the use of least squares to estimate the model parameters in the first place. © 1988.","Backpropagation; Cerebral cortex; Continuous time; Energy models; Modelling; Prediction; Recurrent; Reinforcement learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000903748
