That electronic problem is treated in a higher order approximation which means considering the coupling between one-electron wavefunctions and three-particle amplitudes. A formalism is presented to eliminate all higher order correlations and to reduce the whole system to a one-particle Schrodinger equation with the help of a suitable Green's function. The resulting one-electron eigenvalue problem contains some logarithmic singularities due to the fact that there is no gap between occupied and unoccupied electron states in the band structure of a metal. In an electron gas model a convergent theory is reached by an improvement of the Green's function leading to a screening of the long-range Coulomb potentials. The result is a complicated nonlinear algebraic eigenvalue equation which is solved numerically for the special case of a single hydrogen perturbation in a magnesium crystal. The solution shows the influence of higher order electron correlations on the electronic energy eigenvalue of an interstitial hydrogen centre plot as a function of host lattice distortions. © 1986, Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung.

This approach has been proved successful by other workers in the field for delineating and quantifying the nature of aquifers. Recently, however, the proposals to store radioactive waste in deep-sea sediments, together with the increasing interest in hydrocarbon formation processes and basin development, have provided further impetus to the study of geophysical-permeability interactions. A series of laboratory experiments involving a wide range of natural and artificial sediments has enabled the relationships between the geophysical characteristics and the fluid flow to be investigated. The results show very clearly the interrelationship between permeability and the geophysical parameters, electrical resistivity and compressional wave velocity, and the capability of predicting the one by measuring the other. In particular, extensive measurements of electrical formation factor and permeability in clean sands show the dominance of particle shape, and hence pore shape, in defining the interaction of these energy transfer processes. In defining a dependence on pore shape the variation of the results effectively identifies differences in the structure of the sediments and hence different distributions of pore geometry. This may in turn be related to depositional environments, and, in extending the results to sedimentary rocks, to the diagenetic and lithification processes involved. Each of these fabrics, however, tends to be anisotropic, and this is borne out by the geophysical measurements. Since the geophysical characteristics are closely linked with permeability then it follows that permeability anisotropy may be reasonably expected also. While this directional dependence may be minimal in surficial marine sediments, it may be considerable at depth in the sediment column, particularly as consolidation progresses. The identification and measurement of anisotropy should help in defining geophysical-fluid flow relationships, especially for fluid flow predictions by remote measurements. Introduction The flow of fluids through the ground is currently of considerable interest to geoscientists and engineers involved in aquifer and hydrocarbon reservoir studies, civil engineering projects, radioactive waste storage, basin dewatering research and geothermal energy projects. In each of these programmes fluid flow concerns movement through large volumes of rock and depends on the solid structure and, moreover, the distribution of interconnecting voids, cracks and fissures. Geophysical techniques are currently employed to evaluate, quantitatively, many physical properties of the ground together with their lateral and vertical variations. Any extension of these geophysical methods to the evaluation of permeability would thus be most welcome. This paper is concerned with the empirical use of electrical resistivity and seismic propagation in evaluating the permeability of sediments. Such techniques have been used before and some examples are detailed below. However, electrical resistivitypermeability results for unconsolidated sediments in the laboratory.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051921857

With reasonable potentials, the stored energy and yields are large only over a narrow range of X reduction potentials, and elsewhere are small. This model can therefore be used as an aid in choosing species when synthesising molecules which will maximise both the yield of charge-separated molecules and the fraction of excitation energy stored.

The power pulse is produced by an explosive flux compression generator and a fast plasma compression opening switch. The goal is to obtain an intense source of soft x rays from the thermalization of the plasma kinetic energy when pinch occurs on axis. An important target diagnostic is a fast camera which measures the dynamics of foil run-in and implosion symmetry. These measurements are made in the visible, UV, and x-ray portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. UV/x-ray images are first converted to visible light, then transmitted by visible light optics to a framing camera, which is located at a safe distance. For UV/soft x-ray imaging, we mount a disposable pinhole camera with a p-terphenyl-coated converter screen on the target chamber. For soft/hard x-ray imaging, a microchannel plate is used in front of the p-terphenyl-coated screen to boost quantum detection efficiency and signal gain. For faster temporal response the p-terphenyl can be replaced by NE-111 or other fast fluors. Image transmission is accomplished by means of two large mirrors (150-250 mm diam) and a large catadioptric telescope. The framing camera consists of four gated microchannel plates with adjustable gate and interframe times. The framing camera is a versatile and rugged instrument, it has performed satisfactorily for each and every Pioneer shot. Experimental data indicate that this camera, which uses individual gated microchannel plates, is far superior to commercial streak/framing cameras, because it has a dynamic range which is orders of magnitude larger than commercial cameras, each channel can be attenuated separately, further increasing the dynamic range of the imaging system. This makes our framing camera especially suitable for recording sequences of events where the brightness changes by many orders of magnitude.

The project is funded out of the Division of Chemical Sciences, USDOE. Initial design and staff technical training was initiated during 1984-85 with laboratory personnel working at both Florida State University and Argonne National Laboratory. The linac under construction is based upon the Nb split-ring resonator technology developed at Argonne National Laboratory for ATLAS. The linac at Kansas State University will have 14 superconducting resonators with nine low-β (β=0.06) and five high-β (β=0.105) units operating at 97 MHz. Work has progressed on both of the single-resonator cryostats for time bunching and energy rebunching, respectively, with the major cryostat components presently under construction by C. E. Raymond Enterprise Manufacturing, a division of Combustion Engineering, with scheduled delivery of the single resonator cryostat vacuum housings, LN2-cooled heat shields, and LHe Dewars on January 17, 1986.

Relative humidity and dew point data are processed to obtain estimates of the absolute humidities of the ambient air during these times. These, in turn, may be used to calculate the heat content of ambient air which is crucial to the calculation of air conditioning requirements for the cooling or drying of grain. The power required to pump air through the grain and the periods required for cooling and drying are also calculated enabling a comprehensive analysis of energy requirements to be made. It is found, for example, that typical energy requirement to cool one ton of grain with a moisture content of 14 percent (wet basis) to 20 degree C is about 2-5 kwh, regardless of initial grain temperature. Cooling is thus a low energy-intensive process compared with ambient air-drying, for example, which requires an order of magnitude of more energy to make damp grain sufficiently dry for long-term storage.",,"AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS - Drying; AIR - Drying; AIR CONDITIONING - Energy Utilization; ATMOSPHERIC HUMIDITY; METEOROLOGY - Sri Lanka; AMBIENT DRY-BULB TEMPERATURE; GRAIN COOLING; IN-STORE GRAIN DRYING; PADDY STORAGE; GRAIN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023011432

During exercise two phases occurred During the first 15 min they experienced progressive fatigue and weakness of exercised muscles, with a rapid and complete recovery (adaptation phase). Following this, all 3 patients were able to continue exercise without difficulty ('second wind' phase). During the adaptation phase, patients have to cope with their inability to use muscle glycogen as a fuel Processes occurring during this phase are as follows. (1) An increase in cardiac output. This might be expected to increase muscle blood flow in order to supply exercising muscle with substrates that can substitute for muscle glycogen (free fatty acids (FFA), bloodborne glucose). (2) Changes in the metabolic pathways. These cause a sufficient amount of hexose phosphates to be present to overcome the first 2.5 min of exercise, and FFA and bloodborne glucose to play a major role in energy supply at an earlier stage in exercise than in control subjects. (3) An increase in EMG activity. This is most probably caused by the recruitment of more motor units to compensate for a failure of force generation in the muscle fibres.Central command seems to play an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular processes during the adaptation phase. Despite these compensatory mechanisms, metabolic stress occurs during the adaptation phase During the 'second wind' phase there are no important differences between the metabolism of exercising muscle of patients with McArdle's disease and that of control subjects. © 1986 Oxford University Press.",,"fatty acid; adaptation; diagnosis; etiology; exercise; glycogen muscle level; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; major clinical study; muscle; priority journal; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Ammonia; Blood Glucose; Cardiac Output; Electromyography; Exertion; Fatigue; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease; Glycogen Storage Disease Type V; Heart Rate; Humans; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Male; Muscles; Potassium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022973083

If a space-heating load is added to the water-heating load, the overall efficiency of the combination appliance can be increased substantially over the efficiency of the heater when used to heat domestic water only.",,"ENERGY UTILIZATION; HEATING; RESIDENTIAL STORAGE WATER HEATERS; SPACE HEATING EFFICIENCY; SPACE HEATING INSTALLATIONS; SUMMER EFFICIENCY; WATER-HEATING EFFICIENCY; WINTER EFFICIENCY; WATER HEATERS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022951505

The triboacoustic response of such a material interface is found to depend upon the contact pressure, rubbing velocity, and type of nonwoven fabric involved. Of importance is the structure and texture of the nonwoven fabric. Using microvideo observation techniques, it was learned that rubbing of a fabric against a solid surface is accompanied by vibration of a fraction of the fiber elements at the interface. In this work, this phenomenon is referred to as fretting. It is found that the percent active fretting area during the fibrous rubbing process is directly proportional to the acoustic energy emitted in the process. The spectral characteristics of the triboacoustic signal are also dependent upon the fibrous material under study and the corresponding percent fretting area. The fibrous wiping of magnetic media produces frictional heating which, in terms of temperature rise, is directly proportional to the product of the kinetic coefficient of friction and the thermal resistance of the fibrous component.",,"ACOUSTIC EMISSION TESTING; TRIBOLOGY - Acoustic Wave Effects; DYNAMIC CONTACT; FLOPPY DISK; FRICTIONAL HEATING; NONWOVEN FABRICS; RUBBING VELOCITY; TRIBOACOUSTICS; DATA STORAGE, MAGNETIC",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022944017

Also, they represent excellent choices for energy storage due to the possibility of very high efficiency excursions of input/output power. This feature becomes particularly attractive when coupled with attitude control systems for low earth orbit applications. The analysis reported in this paper, although general, was performed in support of the 'sandwich' configuration magnetically suspended flywheel system currently under development by researchers from the University of Maryland and the Goddard Space Flight Center. The flywheel has its radial dynamics controlled by the magnetic suspension which is biased by four symmetrically located samarium-cobalt permanent magnets and by control windings which compensate the displacement of the flywheel relative to its centered position. To each pair of radially aligned permanent magnets corresponds a closed loop feedback control system which provides active control in each orthogonal direction. In this paper, the magentic forces used for stabilizing the rotor are modeled and validated with exprimental data. The analytical approach in modeling of the magentic forces depends upon the evaluation of the path permeance and operating point of the magnet itself. Several methods, including the Schwartz-Christofell approach of mapping the magnetic field are used to evaluate the magnetic force.",,"AEROSPACE ENGINEERING; ELECTRIC TRACTION - Flywheel Propulsion; ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD EFFECTS; ELECTROMAGNETS; MAGNETS; CONFORMAL MAPPING; MAGNETIC BEARING FORCES SIMULATION; MAGNETICALLY SUSPENDED FLYWHEEL SYSTEM; PERMEANCE ANALYSIS; BEARINGS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022938183

Laboratory experiments that define the material and reaction characteristics of a sodium bromide/ammonia system have been performed. The reaction rates, storage density, and other operating parameters are described in functional form.

The output temperature from the heat pump system should be at least 50 degree C. Seasonal energy storage systems designed as bore-hole storage in clay, rock, etc. were to be considered.

A general analysis of the requirements to increase SPF, including an investigation of energetic and exergetic losses of heat pump components shows that the barriers to achieve SPFs of about 4 are high supply temperatures due to combined hot tap water production, increased losses of screw compressors at high pressure differences, the coincidence of minimum heat source temperature and highest demand when using a storage system with recharging. Using actual hourly values of the climate, the dynamic behaviour of systems consisting of a seasonal ground storage with discharging by the heat pump, with and without recharging by solar collectors, one or several water/water heat pumps and a heat distribution system with floating or constant temperatures was simulated by means of the computer program WPSYS3.

In fact, this distortion can be so severe that even a week's shut-in period may not allow a semilog analysis. A longer shut-in period becomes economically discouraging because of lost production. Low energy and low transmissivity in the reservoir, coupled with increased fluid compressibility, contribute to this long-duration storage phenomenon. One way of handling this problem clearly lies in the simultaneous treatment of downhole pressure and flow rate, estimated from rising annular liquid-level data by acoustic well sounding (AWS). Ascertaining the quality of the indirectly measured pressure and rate data constitutes one of the objectives of this study. Interpretation of several transient tests shows that automatic convolved-type-curve or history matching of field data is a powerful tool for reservoir parameter (total mobility, skin, fracture half-length, storage coefficient) estimation.",,"FLOW OF FLUIDS - Transients; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Curve Fitting; OIL WELL LOGGING - Acoustic; PRESSURE EFFECTS - Analysis; ACOUSTIC WELL SOUNDING (AWS); FLOW RATE; TRANSIENT ANALYSIS; TYPE-CURVE; OIL WELLS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022899913

This effect occurs when low primary electron energies are used and the electron yield of the passivation layer is greater than 1. Signal changes in the relevant interconnections are transferred to the passivation surface via capacitive coupling, but they vanish there within the storage time due to electron irradiation. A physical model explains the dependence of CCVC on three parameters: electron irradiation, the passivation material and the signals within the IC. Computer simulations based on this model describe the experimentally-obtained dependencies of the storage time with precision and allow predictions to be made for using CCVC in electron beam testing.

Understanding of the mechanism of both micro and macro stratification of the slurry is necessary to fully predict system performance as a function of gravity and system geometry. It can be shown that gravity stratification effects are secondary to a combination of: 1) adhesion (wetting) of liquid-metal film to the heat exchange surfaces and solidified salt particles, 2) solubility of alkali metal in the salt-rich phase, and 3) stirring produced by liquid-to-vapor conversion of the alkali metal, then system geometry limitations are greatly relaxed for space application. The performance testing was accomplished using a sodium heat pipe to transfer heat from the slurry canister to a gas-gap calorimeter. Testing was accomplished with the heat pipe installed only in the vapor space above the alkali metal/salt slurry.

As a result a small amount of magnetic energy is stored at zero circuit current in the parasitic inductances formed by the cathode support and the shield to ground connection. This energy can sustain cathode spot emission for several hundred ns after circuit current reaches zero. Such a postzero emission can postpone the onset of vacuum gap recovery, as shown by recovery experiments probing the gap with HV pulses and measuring the breakdown voltages at a number of times during the first microsecond following current zero. By varying HV pulse polarity and shield potential, recovery was studied during this period.

Historically, energy storage in the United States has been provided by a few pumped hydroelectric plants, but siting constraints and high cost severely limit the use of this option. Two other options which will soon be in use are batteries and compressed air energy storage.

For moderate discharge duration, SMES is projected to have substantially lower revenue requirements and better availability than other load leveling options.

A three-dimensional flow and thermal-energy transport model was constructed to incorporate the areal anisotropy of the aquifer. Analytical solutions of equations describing areally anisotropic groundwater flow around a doublet-well system were used to specify model boundary conditions for simulation of heat injection.

The maximum photosynthetic rate of Z. nuttallii measured in unburned prairie was 13.2 μmoles CO2 m-2 s-1 which occurred at 24-28° C and an incident quantum flux of 0.8-1.0 mmoles m-2 s-1. Maximum stomatal conductance measured was 5.4 mm s-1. Early in the season, belowground storage organs (bulbs) decreased in mass and supplied much of the energy for growth of leaves, even though CO2 uptake was possible. Buld mass did not increase until about 6 weeks after shoot emergence implying that, at this time, leaves had become a source rather than a sink for carbohydrates. The result of a single, severe defoliation event was a decrease in biomass of bulbs, leaves and reproductive structures in Z. nuttallii. Intrinsic compensatory mechanisms were not detected. In contrast, fire, which also defoliated plants, did not result in any biomass decrease at the end of the season. Improved post-fire microclimate and increased nutrient supply (extrinsic factors) may have contributed to higher photosynthetic rates and led to biomass compensation in burned prairie. These data support arguments that intrinsic compensatory mechanisms have evolved in response to chronic herbivory. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon storage; Fire; Herbivory; Photosynthesis; Zigadenus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022846487

'Horizontal' transitions between levels normally take place in the volume of the material and involve relatively small changes of energy. 'Vertical' transitions between deep levels and the free bands involve energy changes of the order of half the band gap and take place mainly in interfacial space-charge regions and at semiconductor-metal interfaces. DSS is uniquely able to resolve the spectra of these delayed transitions and measurements on semiinsulating (SI) GaAs in the frequency range 10-2-104 Hz and between 90 and 380K show that none of them conform to the expected exponential time dependence. The various transitions are found to have well recognisable spectral 'signatures' involving fractional power-law dependences on frequency and hence on time. The exponents are sensitive to the nature of the transitions and to the types of impurities, and may also depend on the crystalline order. The authors report for the first time in the context of single-crystal SI GaAs the phenomena of low-frequency dispersion both in the volume and in interfacial transitions, and also of negative capacitance, all of which involve some structural instabilities and the likelihood of electrochemical energy storage. They also show the existence of electronic phase transitions involving subtle reversible changes of electron-lattice interactions as well defined temperatures.

The method, Fourier transform mechanical spectroscopy (FTMS), consists of superposing and deconvoluting discrete Fourier transforms obtained from a single stress relaxation experiment using a novel sampling scheme. The theory of the sampling scheme and the superposition of the transforms is described elsewhere. In this paper the authors present the results of using the new method on Nylon over the frequency range 5*10-4 to 20 Hz and temperatures from 25 to 110 degrees C. There is good agreement between the values of storage and loss moduli, obtained by means of the transform method, and those obtained by conventional means. An activation energy of 143 kcal mol-1 is obtained for the relaxation in this temperature range. The new method has considerable potential for the rapid determination of the mechanical properties of novel polymers and composites.",,"MATERIALS - Mechanical Properties; MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATIONS - Fourier Transforms; SPECTROSCOPY - Applications; DYNAMIC MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR; FOURIER TRANSFORM MECHANICAL SPECTROSCOPY (FTMS); VISCOELASTIC MAATERIALS; VISCOELASTICITY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022739117

There is also considerable scope for reducing labour costs. The system works by diverting flow, and hence load, to a balance tank during times of high flow or strong flow to the works, and returning flow and load back from the balance tank when flows are low or weak. The goal is to reduce the variability in the feed to treatment, as measured by difference between consecutive mean flows and loads. Frequent measurement of flow and strength of sewage is required at several points in the treatment system. Alternatively, storage using the sewer system may be mobilised in suitable locations in place of storage in tanks.",,"COMPUTER SOFTWARE - Applications; ENERGY CONSERVATION; FLOW OF FLUIDS - Computer Applications; ACTIVATED SLUDGE; CALSEM; COMPUTER AIDED LOAD SMOOTHING WITH ENERGY MANAGEMENT; SEWAGE TREATMENT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022806686

From the rate of this dissipation and the electric capacitance of the mitochondrial membrane the energy stored in form of the membrane potential was calculated as about 7 μJ/mg protein. In the absence of oligomycin, dissipation of the membrane potential was slower, as it was partly compensated by proton ejection by mitochondrial ATPase hydrolyzing endogenous ATP. This allowed to calculate the total energy storage capacity of the proton-motive force. It amounted to the equivalence of 3.3 nmol ATP/mg protein or about 130 μJ/mg protein.

The apparent stress exponent and activation energy for cyclic creep at both frequencies studied are shown to be greater than values observed for static creep. The large values of the stress exponent and activation energy for cyclic creep are proposed to result from anelastic strain storage delaying nonrecoverable creep during the on-load portion of the cyclic creep loading, such that the ""effective stress"" driving nonrecoverable creep is only a small fraction of the applied stress. In addition, the temperature dependence of the anelastic relaxation that occurs during the off-load portion of the cyclic creep loading is determined. The activation energy found for the relaxation process is equal to about one-half that for self-diffusion in nickel. A mechanism of localized climb of dislocations over the oxide dispersoids present in INCONEL MA 6000 is postulated to account for the observed activation energy of the relaxation process. © 1986 The Metallurgical of Society of AIME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51649148010

A safe method to build self stabilizing very large caverns is to excavate them partially, i.e. to leave a considerable amount of the blasted rock in the cavern. The remaining rock in such a hot water store represents an undesired thermal inertia and it is of great practical interest to estimate how the remaining blocks influence the performance of the store. If the cavity is assumed to be spherical, the remaining blocks spherical as well, the heat diffusitivity of the solid matter constant and the water well stirred, the temperature of the water can rather easily be calculated. In the present paper it is shown that the coupled system of partial differential equations and one ordinary differential equation can be reduced to a Volterra integral equation. The calculations show how the porosity and the size of the remaining blocks influence the water temperature if an arbitrary power is added to or extracted from the cavern. © 1986 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Differential Equations; THERMAL DYNAMICS; UNDERGROUND HOT WATER STORE; VOLTERRA INTEGRAL EQUATION; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022914498

This same apparatus can also be utilized in a transient (pressure-decay) mode in order to measure permeabilities several orders of magnitude lower than the steady-state limit. Tests were conducted on samples of pumice, fractured welded tuff, and welded tuff, representing a permeability range of seven orders of magnitude Pumice was found to have a permeability of ∼3×10-12 m2, sufficiently high to allow the complete Darcy-to-Ergun regime to be investigated Welded (unfractured) tuff was tested in the transient mode, yielding a permeability of ∼5×10-19 m2. Two, long-time-scale, steady-flow experiments were conducted on a core of welded tuff containing a single, through-going fracture. For the first experiment, the core was an integral cylinder containing a naturally occurring fracture. For the second experiment, the core was separated into two pieces along the existing fracture plane, then rejoined. Effects of essentially constant, as well as rapidly varied, circumferential stress were studied in both tests. Results showed core permeability to decay to 2×10-18 m2 in both cases, independent of the initial fracture state (closed versus open). With a naturally occurring fracture, core permeability decreased by a factor of 2 over a 200-h test period. With an initially open fracture, core permeability decreased by a factor of 4 under the influence of a comparable 200-h load-time history, after 700 h of testing, core permeability was reduced by an order of magnitude from its initial level. Final effective hydraulic fracture aperture was calculated to be 10-6 m, corresponding to a calculated effective fracture permeability of 10-13 m2 Fracture flow was thus estimated to account for 80% of the total flow rate through this core under final test conditions. © 1986 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",,"FLOW OF FLUIDS - Porous Materials; PRESSURE-DECAY FLOW; PUMICE; STEADY-STATE FLOW; TUFF; SOILS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022865653

The study is a follow-up to that conducted in 1980. Many of the 1980 results were unexpected and the present study seeks to assess their representativeness. The net radiant, turbulent sensible, and rural soil heat flux densities were measured directly. The suburban heat storage was parameterized and the turbulent latent heat flux densities were resolved as residuals in the energy balances. The 1983 average diurnal energy partitioning for both sites was typical of those quoted in the literature, suggesting that the 1980 results represent an extreme case. Suburban-rural differences showed the suburban area to have a 4% increase in net radiation, a 51% increase in turbulent sensible heat, and a 46% decrease in turbulent latent heat flux density. The values of the average daytime Bowen ratio were 0.46 and 1.28 for the rural and suburban areas, respectively. The sensible heat flux density exhibited relatively large values in the late afternoon and remained directed upward on many summer evenings. Large day-to-day variability in the relative magnitude of the suburban turbulent fluxes may have been due to synoptic influences. In this environment, the turbulent surface and mixed layers are closely coupled because of the low aerodynamic resistance over the rough surface. © 1986 D.

The specific object of these studies has been desorption induced by electronic transitions in alkali halide crystals, with particular emphasis on the dynamics of changes in the surface and near-surface regions. In our experiments, the irradiating ultraviolet photons are provided by a synchrotron storage ring, and the dynamical information about desorption products is obtained from optical measurements of the quantum states, yields and velocity distributions of neutral ground-state and excited-state atoms ejected from the surface of the irradiating material. These studies have shown that the dominant exit channels in photon-induced particle emission are those producing ground-state and excited-state neutral atoms. Using dynamical information about these desorbing neutral species, obtained, for example, by laser-induced fluorescence and laser Doppler spectroscopy, we are generating an increasingly comprehensive picture of the dynamics of electronic energy flow into and out of pure crystalline surfaces in these prototypical dielectrics. We are also beginning to be able to relate desorption dynamics to specific materials properties, and to discriminate between pure surface and near-surface effects in these materials. Applications of these techniques to the problem of photon-induced surface damage and to analysis of surface dynamics in dielectric materials are discussed, and the relationships between these nearly ideal model materials and the non-crystalline, covalently bonded materials more typical of real optical elements are pointed out. © 1986 SPIE.",,"Alkali halides; Crystalline materials; Desorption; Dielectric materials; Dynamics; Excited states; Ground state; Optical data processing; Photons; X rays; ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON - Storage Rings; CRYSTALS; DESORPTION; ELECTRONS - Transitions; HALOGEN COMPOUNDS; Alkali-halide crystals; Crystalline surfaces; Desorption induced by electronic transitions; Electronic mechanisms; Laser induced fluorescence; Laser-Doppler spectroscopy; Surface interactions; Synchrotron storage ring; Materials properties; PHOTONS; ALKALI HALIDES; ELECTRONIC MECHANISMS; ELECTRONIC TRANSITIONS; PHOTON IRRADIATION; PHOTON-SURFACE INTERACTION DYNAMICS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022956464

This nine parameter model is based on detailed observations on the growth and reproduction at varying food densities, and has the state variables size and storage. The size-dependence of some variables works out to be different for animals of the same species as opposed to animals of different species. The reproductive rate, for instance, tends to increase with size for animals of the same species, but to decrease with size for animals of different species. This is because the parameter values are constants within a species, but vary in a size dependent manner for animals of different species. Although growth at constant food density is assumed to be of the von Bertalanffy type, and routine metabolism to be proportional to size, respiration turns out to be about proportional to size to the power 3/4, both within and between species.

These large grains are undesirable because of the greater difficulty incurred in obtaining the suitably uniform and fine primary grain size desired prior to the final high temperature anneal during which the (110) [001] texture is developed. It was found that the driving force for the growth is the subgrain structure which develops due to the strains of solidification and cooling during continuous casting; however, the temperature at which growth initiates is related to the austenite-ferrite phase relationship. The grain growth begins when the austenite which forms during slab reheating decomposes to form highly perfect ferrite which then grows by consuming the strained preexisting (as-cast) ferrite matrix. Data summarizing studies into the energy storage and recrystallization processes which occur with the use of slab breakdown (or prerolling) prior to reheating from 1230° to 1400 °C are also discussed. © 1986 The Metallurgical of Society of AIME.",,"IRON AND STEEL METALLOGRAPHY - Grain Growth; ROLLING MILL PRACTICE - Hot Rolling; ELECTRICAL STEEL; GOSS TEXTURE; RECRYSTALLIZATION; SLAB REHEATING; SOLIDIFICATION; Silicon steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249171446

The CA profiles have been used to quantify condition with regard to age and season. The major features determining the condition of fish depositing hyaline or opaque otolith zones are itemized using CA, and the data modelled by Multiple Regression (MR) using a cosine curve incorporating the chief mass variables with linear age-dependency. The highest proportion of fish having outer opaque zones are found from ca. June to October, whilst the highest proportion with exterior hyaline zones are found from ca. December to May. There is a clear annual cycle in the deposition of opaque and hyaline otolith zones in both sexes, but there is a significant difference in phase of ca. 12 days between the sexes. There is a significant trend for decreasing proportions of fish having outermost opaque otolith zones with increasing age; this trend is similar in both sexes. The mean level and amplitude of the cycles are similar in both sexes. On the other hand, CA shows a 12-month cycle of storage and utilization of body materials with obvious differences between sexes. In the female protein in the fillet plays a more dominant role than lipid in the fillet in accounting for anabolic and catabolic variations in mass, whereas in the male the opposite is true. Sexual maturation is negatively correlated with fillet (somatic) growth. Variations in stomach weight (with contents) and otolith zone deposition are not significantly correlated. Nevertheless, in both sexes there is a clear positive correlation between stomach weight and liver protein and lipid implying an association between stomach weight and feeding activity. In females, however, maximum liver condition is more positively correlated with exponential ovarian growth, probably through mobilization of lipoproteins for eggs. Qualitative (CA) and quantitative (MR) models have related changes in growth and condition to the type of otolith zone deposited. The fillet of capelin is the major somatic growth site. As CA indicates a negative correlation between fillet reserves and gonad maturation, and the best MR models describing the cycle of otolith zone deposition in males and females (accounting for 93% and 70% respectively of the variation) underlined and quantified the interplay between somatic and gonad growth, it is implicit that the energy balance of the fish will be an important determinant of otolith zone deposition in sexually maturing and mature capelin. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,"Balsfjorden; capelin; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022856307

Efficiency can be defined in these systems as the fraction of the power input appearing in the wanted form at the output. Engineers attempt to raise the efficiency by using switching methods in power supplies, instead of dissipative control in the linear versions. Whichever design techniques are employed, such as those used to increase the efficiency, or whether dissipation is deliberately tolerated, removing the thermal energy produced is important. If heat is not removed quickly, the associated temperature rise could soon destroy the devices.

The presence of giant electronic orbitals made these materials electroactive yet very stable. A new mode of electronic polarizability resulted, a giant nomadic polarization, making these organic polymers among the most polarizable materials ever encountered. In addition, yet other attributes could be found, such as remanent magnetization, or metallic conductivity, or unusual pressure sensitivity. The giant orbital concept opens up new vistas of materials properties. We note that one can tailor giant orbital polymers to produce pure and highly stable super-dielectrics with high dielectric constants, from 6 to 100,000. Such materials will be useful in the electric power control, as in large motor starting capacitors and in power factor correction. They will doubtless also be useful in low visibility coatings, in obscuration, in EMP shielding, in microcircuitry, in transducers, and in parametric circuits. It remains to be proven if this new molecular mode, nomadic polarization, proves superior in energy storage and loss to that of the conventional ""dipole orientation"" mode.

The reduction proceeds at room temperature and -0.7 to -0.8 V vs. SCE with faradaic efficiencies of ≥ 50% (efficiencies of near 100% have been measured in some cases). These potentials represent electrolysis at only 160 mV negative of the standard potential corrected for pH. Methanol can also be obtained with good efficiency in 0.05 M H2SO4 at -0.57 to -0.67 V vs. SCE. Electrolysis also produces small amounts of carbon monoxide and traces of methane. No more than a trace of methane was produced even at 52°C. Extended electrolysis of molybdenum electrodes indicates that even over several days the production of methanol does not cease but the faradaic efficiency does increase. Molybdenum will reduce carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide at open circuit. Cyclic voltammetry implicates corrosion of molybdenum metal to molybdenum dioxide as the source of electrons for open circuit reduction of carbon dioxide. Analysis of the solution after electrolysis shows no molybdenum and cyclic voltammetry indicates no detectable molybdenum dioxide on the surface indicating that the electrodes are cathodically protected during electrolysis. If the electrode are cycled between -1.2 and +0.2 V vs. SCE before electrolysis, greater than 100% faradaic efficiencies are observed. The extent of cyclic is critical with yields reaching a maximum with cycling time and extended cycling leading to total passivation of the electrode. These efficiencies involve, at least in part, corrosion of the molybdenum metal.

In addition the rate constant and the order of the reaction of the decomposition process were determined by DSC analysis. The kinetic parameters (activation energy E and Arrhenius pre-exponential term A) for the thermal decomposition were confirmed by half-life test. Thus they can be used as a screening technique to predict potential explosive hazards due to self-heating during storage at lower temperatures than those of the peak temperatures. An attempt has been made to compare the behaviour of the double-base propellant with those of the two components. It is suggested that the thermal combustion of nitroglycerin is the driving kinetic process of the overall thermal decomposition. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45949131426

Lipid levels were similar to levels in more temperate mesopelagic species. Total lipid concentration was depth related, with all lipid-rich species being collected at depths greater than 230 m. Wax ester content in copepods (60 to 70% of the total lipid) was generally higher than in subtropical species. Lipids indicated three predator-prey relationships (Parandania boecki-Atolla wyvillei, Thysanoessa macrura-Calanoides acutus and Eurythenes gryllus-Atolla wyvillei). These were confirmed by gut content analyses. The mesopelagic fish Bathylagus antarcticus, Pleuragramma antarcticum, and Protomyctophum bolini stored most lipid intramuscularly, whereas Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi contained extensive stores in subcutaneous lipid sacs. The intramuscular lipids in P. antarcticum and the subcutaneous lipid sacs of E. antarctica were primarily wax esters, possibly used for increased buoyancy or long-term energy storage. Unlike the odd-carbon preference of aliphatic hydrocarbons which typifies terrestrial plants and temperate marine organisms, even-carbon chain-length paraffins predominate in 80% of the Antarctic species analyzed. Although the source of these even-carbon n-alkanes cannot be determined from our data, their dominance in the species analyzed suggests that an unusual biochemical pathway may be responsible for their synthesis in this ecosystem. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10144244666

In fact, with very slow cycling machines or storage rings any erratic operation or timing pulse will cause the loss of precious particles and waste hours of time and effort of preparation. Thus, for the CERN linac and LEAR (Low Energy Antiproton Ring) timing system reliability becomes a crucial factor in the sense that all components must operate practically without fault for very long periods compared to the effective machine cycle. This has been achieved by careful selection of components and design well below thermal and electrical limits, using error detection and correction where possible, as well as developing ""safe"" decoding techniques for serial data trains. Further, consistent structuring had to be applied in order to obtain simple and flexible modular configurations with very few components on critical paths and to minimize the exchange of information to synchronize accelerators. In addition, this structuring allows the development of efficient strategies for on-line and off-line fault diagnostics. As a result, the timing system for Linac 2 has, so far, been operating without fault for three years, the one for LEAR more than one year since its final debugging. © 1986.",,"ACCELERATORS - Computer Applications; CERN; COMPUTER CONTROLLED TIMING SYSTEMS; LEAR; TIMING DEVICES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022078786

Pyloric caeca indices increased during fall, reached a maximum about April, and declined sharply to a minimum in mid-summer. Gonad indices increased during fall and winter and reached a maximum about May. Judging from gonad size analysis, spawning occurred in late June to early July, at bottom temperatures of 16° to 18°C. There was no long-term inverse relationship between pyloric caecum and gonad indices. Since nutrients and energy ingested during the important fall feeding period are utilized simultaneously for body growth and gonad development, it is unnecessary for the pyloric caeca to store nutrients over long periods as occurs in A. rubens and many other species. The specific caeca-gonad relationship is probably an adaptation to the extreme seasonal thermal fluctuations of the NW Atlantic, which constrain the feeding activity of A. forbesi and limit the possibility of long-term storage. In this population, most individuals grow rapidly in their first year (including first two summers) and spawn in their third summer. Few seastars survive to spawn again in their fourth summer. However, gametogenesis may take place in some individuals in their second summer. Year-to-year variability in mean size at spawning may reflect temporal variation in environmental conditions (weather, food availability) at this site. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012406451

The variations of the flow of CO evolved from the reactor vs. temperature and oxygen partial pressure are in good agreement with the theoretical variations that may be deduced from the general equations of electrochemical transport in stabilized zirconia.

For this reason, and the fact that when its concentration is decreased no new phosphorus resonances appear in the high resolution spectra, it is suggested that 2,3-cyclopyrophosphoglycerate has a function in carbohydrate metabolism. © 1986.","31P-NMR; cyclic Pyrophosphate; Cyclic pyrophosphate; Metabolic inhibitor; Methanogen","2,3 cyclopyrophosphoglyceric acid; methanobacterium; nonhuman; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022475925

The compositions of the alloys correspond to the formula Ti1-xZrxFe with x = 0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.07, 0.1 and 0.2. X-ray analysis showed that the lattice parameters of the alloys increased with an increase in zirconium content. Activation properties were largely enhanced with an increase in zirconium content. It was found that the absorption of hydrogen by the zirconium-containing compounds reached saturation earlier than in the case of pure TiFe as the absorption-desorption cycle for activation was continued. The pressure-composition isotherms revealed that the thermodynamic properties of the alloys were different. The hydrogen storage capacity was drastically reduced and the γ phase disappeared. The plateau was inclined and the plateau pressure of the zirconium-containing compounds was lower than that of pure TiFe. The ΔH, ΔS, ΔG values were obtained from the plot of In P versus 1 T by the van't Hoff relation. The hysteresis energy loss was nearly constant with varying zirconium content. © 1986.",,"HYDROGEN - Storage; TITANIUM IRON ALLOYS - Hydrogenation; TITANIUM IRON ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS - Applications; ZIRCONIUM AND ALLOYS; ABSORPTION CURVES; HYDRIDE FORMATION; PRESSURE-COMPOSITION ISOTHERMS; INTERMETALLICS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022722767

Because the two crystals no longer have the same lattice spacing, they diffract X-rays of the same wavelength at different angles. This causes shifts in energy calibration and beam movement at the sample with change in photon energy or as the current in the storage ring decays. A simple thermal model that predicts the change in wavelength and angle of the monochromatic beam is described. These shifts are proportional to I sin θ tan θ, where I is the SPEAR ring current and θ is the angle of the beam incident on the first crystal. Heating experiments were conducted with Ge(111), quartz(1010, and InSb(111) crystals. Bragg angle shifts of up to 0.25° were measured with high precision encoders mounted directly on the crystal goniometers. Photon energy calibration shifts of up to 3.5 eV (at 1700 eV) were measured.

Beamline performance degrades very rapidly following installation of a new set of mirrors. Analysis of the mirror surfaces by various non-destructive techniques indicates severe degradation of the coating and surface along the central strip where most of the X-ray power is absorbed from the beam. In one case where the mirror had three bilayer coatings, the outer coating layer has disappeared along the central strip. Rutherford backscatter measurements indicate compositional changes between layers and confirm the existence of a carbon deposit on the surface. Thermal modeling suggests that most of the damage is caused by direct photon interaction, since the temperature rise in the energy deposition region is small. © 1986.",,"ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON - Storage Rings; BEAMLINE; COPPER MIRRORS; SYNCHROTRON RADIATION; MIRRORS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022062843

The other cycle describes the relaxing activity exhibited by girase on supercoiled DNA in the absence of substrates. Supercoiling of DNA is described as a random walk on a topological index. The mechanical energy storage in DNA is manifested in the fact that in general, the kinetic constants for the cycles do not satisfy Wegscheider relations.

Morphological adaptations of the insect include a modified integument composed of a double layered epidermis with an inner layer (the dorsolateral space) specialized for cardenolide storage. Special weak areas of the cuticle are found on both the thorax and abdomen, which rupture when the insect is squeezed, resulting in the cardenolide-rich contents of the inner epidermal layer being released onto the body surface in the form of discrete spherical droplets. Physiological adaptations include selective sequestration of food plant cardenolides, concentration of cardenolides in the dorsolateral space, passive uptake of cardenolides at the gut and dorsolateral space requiring little energy output, reabsorption of secreted cardenolides by the Malpighian tubules, high in vivo tolerance to cardenolides, and the presence of cardenolide-resistant Na,K-ATPases. © 1986 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Asclepiadaceae; cardenolides; Hemiptera Heteroptera; Lygaeidae; morphological adaptations; Oncopeltus fasciatus; physiological adaptations; sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001350529

As a result, TL dating technique has found wide application in geochronology of pottery. The determination of T0 of loess is mainly based on the fact that fine particles of which loess is composed will lose their storage in the process of transportation by wind. In our experiment TL dating technique was adopted to determine the ages of fine quartz grains, and the results were corrected for those of shine-fading experiment. TL dating of Malan loess specimens from Mt. Gaolanshan, Liugouhe near Lanzhou, Mt.

Formation of the primary photoproduct (bathorhodopsin) involves energy uptake of about 130 kJ/mol, corresponding to storage of over 50% of the exciting photon energy, and is comparable to the energy storage previously observed in bovine rhodopsin. Subsequent intermediates involve the step-wise dissipation of this energy to give the physiological end-product (acid metarhodopsin) at a level only slightly above the parent rhodopsin. No significant differences in energetics are observed between rhodopsin in microvilli membrane suspensions or detergent dispersions. Use of different buffer systems in the calorimetric experiments shows that conversion of rhodopsin to acid metarhodopsin involves no light-induced protonation change, whereas alkali metarhodopsin photoproduction occurs with the release of one proton per molecule and an additional enthalpy increase of about 50 kJ/mol. Van't Hoff analysis of the effect of temperature on the reversible metarhodopsin equilibrium gives an enthalpy for the acid → alkali transition consistent with this calorimetric result, and the proton release is confirmed by direct observation of light-induced pH changes. Acid-base titration of metarhodopsin yields an apparent pK of 9.5 for this transition, though the pH profile deviates slightly from ideal titration behaviour. We suggest that a high energy primary photoproduct is an obligatory feature of efficient biological photodetectors, as opposed to photon energy transducers, and that the similarity at this stage between cephalopod and vertebrate rhodopsins represents either convergent evolution at the molecular level or strong conservation of a crucial functional characteristic. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.","calorimetry; energetics; rhodopsin; vision","rhodopsin; enthalpy; methodology; nonhuman; octopus; Animal; Calorimetry; Darkness; Light; Microvilli; Octopus; Retinal Pigments; Rhodopsin; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022569983

Technical data of the lidar system: 100 megawatt trasmitter energy, 20 n sec pulse length, 1/sec pulse repetition, 694 nm wavelength, single photon counting with use of a chopper for suppressing fluorescence of the laser crystal after the shot, fully-automated control of the measuring procedure and storage of data by computer. Shown as examples are first individual profiles of the stratospheric aerosol distribution after the most violent eruption of the recent past (El Chichon 1982). These profiles reveal the rapid variations of the profile structure caused by the different flow conditions as a function of season. The results make clear that the fastest possible sequence of lidar measurements is required to obtain significant and application-oriented data. The integrated backscattering is presented from the beginning of 1977 to the end of 1984. Its variations, resulting from a whole series of volcanic events during this period, are discussed in comparison with the back-ground conditions 1977/78. The residence time of stratospheric aerosols is derived for different layers of the stratosphere with an estimate of the mean residence time of particles&lt;0.5 μm diameter at the respective level. The dramatic variation of the stratospheric aerosol distribution in 47o northern latitude shortly before and immediately after the El Chichon eruption and continuously until summer 1984 is shown by means of three-dimensional diagrams. The different temporal trends in the behavior of the stratospheric aerosol in midlatitudes as a function of the latitude of volcanic eruptions are discussed by means of examples. Our results of measurements are compared with those of other groups. Calculations of the optical depth are shown from early 1982 to late 1984 and are compared with background conditions from 1978. The stratospheric aerosol mass in the column above the unit surface is grphically plotted as a function of time. In several passages it is pointed out that not only volcano El Chichon as the last - even though extreme volcanic event - has to be considered but also minor volcanic eruptions which took place in different countries in late summer and fall 1983. Special sections give an overview of the available literature concerning the question of an impact on climate, especially on the northern hemispheric temperature by stratospheric turbidity, and conclusions are drawn as to the practical application of our measurement results. Based on reliable data from the literature, a volcanically-induced cooling of the order of about 0.5 K is to be expected from the turn of the year 1984/85 on, followed by a gradual normalization (provided: no new major volcanic eruptions). © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022855045

Within the last decade, however, a new source of intense radiation has become available: high-energy storage rings. The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS), operated in conjunction with the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), is providing new impetus for time-resolved studies. This article investigates the intrinsic properties of synchrotron radiation and its applications. The most straightforward application is the use of the high flux available from storage rings to decrease data-collection time. In other techniques, both the high flux and the continuous spectrum of radiation are utilized. And in some experiments the pulsed nature of the emitted radiation provides ways of looking at processes with very short time scales.",,"ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON; MATERIALS - Radiation Effects; HIGH ENERGY RESEARCH; SYNCHROTRON RADIATION; TIME RESOLUTION; X-RAYS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022689376

The cross-section for producing two jets is measured in the dijet mass range 17-50 GeV/c2. A high-statistics sample of dijet events, where each jet has transverse energy above 10 GeV, is used to study the structure of jets and the associated event. We find the longitudinal fragmentation function to be similar to that of jets emerging from e+e- collisions but considerably harder than that observed at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) {Mathematical expression} Collider. A steepening of the fragmentation function is observed when increasing the jet energy. Studies of the charge distribution in jets show that these predominantly originate from fragmenting valence quarks.

Helmerhorst and G. B. Stokes (1980, Anal. Biochem. 104, 130-135). This differential gel adsorption procedure offered a quick semiquantitative method for examining insulin association under a wide range of different conditions using simple equipment. Nonspecific adsorption effects with the gel matrix at low insulin concentrations were minimized by the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. This procedure was based on the observation that the monomer species of insulin was separated from insulin aggregates due to its interaction with the devoided gel matrix of Sephadex G-25 and remained on the column following centrifugation. A residue with an apparent pK of 11.1 ± 0.1 was shown to be critically responsible for the adsorption of monomer insulin to the gel matrix, thus implicating the tyrosyl residue(s) of insulin in this interaction. The proportion of monomer was simply computed from the recovery of insulin off the gel using [125I]monoiodoinsulin to monitor recovery. Insulin association was studied over the range of insulin concentrations from physiologically circulating levels (nm) to storage concentrations (mm). Our data are in agreement with monomer being the predominant form of the hormone in vivo. Our estimates for the Gibbs free energy change, enthalpy, and entropy for the formation of dimers and the effects of pH, ionic strength, and temperature on the equilibrium constant for the formation of dimers were in good agreement with the literature. This differential gel adsorption procedure may have application to other protein-associating systems with suitable adsorption characteristics. © 1986.",,"albumin; insulin; insulin i 125; radioisotope; drug binding; nonhuman; priority journal; protein assembly; Centrifugation; Computers; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Insulin; Macromolecular Systems; Mathematics; Microchemistry; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022517697

These price escalation projections are applied to current domestic and commercial tariffs, and are then adjusted for the likely system efficiencies expected for oil, coal, gas and propane boilers, electric resistance and storage heating, and gas and electric heat pumps. Off-peak electricity becomes competitive with oil and solid fuel in both the commercial and domestic markets and begins to approach the running cost of a gas boiler by 2005. Attention is drawn to the advantages to be gained with electric heating by introducing sufficient thermal storage to allow about 30% of the operating time to be at night, when significant running cost savings are achieved. The average cost of electricity is shown as a function of the ratio of day to night operation. The report concludes that in future, more attention must be paid to systems carefully designed to make optimum use of stored energy and off-peak electric tariffs as the price of electricity becomes more competitive with the fossil fuels.",,"ELECTRIC POWER UTILIZATION - Economics; ENERGY STORAGE - Efficiency; TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING - Analysis; ELECTRICITY COST DECLINE; OIL PRICE TRENDS; FUELS",Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022670307

The wafers are characterized in terms of the oxidation behaviour in air (""native oxides""), their surface chemical composition and the chemical bonds involved. It is shown that the oxide on hydrophilic wafers mainly grows in the cleaning agent and consists of hydrated SiO2 through all stages of the growth. On a hydrophobic surface, however, the oxidation begins with the formation of a lower oxidation state which turns into SiO2 on storage in air. The thickness of the oxides on both surface types reaches 1.4-1.5 nm. Both the chemical shift in photoelectron spectroscopy and the frequency of the asymmetric Si-O-Si vibration in electron energy loss spectroscopy support the assumption of a reduced bonding angle of the oxygen bridge. Hydrophilicity is caused by singular and associated OH groups on the surface. Singular groups could be detected up to 700 K. There are hints that OH groups stabilize the oxide during heating. The hydrophobic state is mainly characterized by Si-H and Si-CHx groups on the surface, whereas Si-F exists only in minor quantities. Si-H groups were stable up to approximately 900 K in UHV.

Box 217, AE Delft, 2600, Netherlands","By a simple model involving the state variables size and storage, it is possible to describe a wide variety of observations on the feeding, growth, energy storage and reproduction of animals. The model is based on the assumption that reproduction, growth as well as maintenance depend on the stored energy only and not directly on feeding. If an egg is thought of as a non-feeding animal, the model predicts the respiration ontogeny and growth of the embryo inside the egg. These predictions seem to hold well for published data on the development of eggs of fish and ratite, precocial and altricial birds. The latter two are known to follow different respiration ontogenies, but both are described well, differing only in one (compound) parameter value. The model explains why the incubation times of eggs of different species tend to increase linearly with egg size to the power 1/4, and why kiwis and petrels, which lay relatively large eggs, have to brood them much longer than larger birds with eggs of the same size. Conversely, it explains why the small eggs of the (parasitic) European cuckoo, hatch earlier than the still smaller eggs of their tiny hosts. Furthermore, it has been shown how the maintenance rate constant, which frequently appears in the microbial literature, can be obtained from measurements on the respiration and weight ontogeny in embryos, so linking independent lines of research. Application of the model shows an increase of the maintenance rate constant from bacteria, crustaceans, up to fish and birds, and a decrease from bacteria to green algae, suggesting lines of evolutionary development. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.","Adult-egg relation; Egg respiration; Maintenance rate constant; Scaling relations","breathing; egg; embryo; energy transfer; metabolism; nonbiological model; nonhuman; Animal; Behavior, Animal; Birds; Chick Embryo; Chickens; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fishes; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Reproduction; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022333562

The case involved performance of two fields on structures adjacent to a common saddle and suspected migration of storage gas into the gas cap of a producing oil field. After some 3 years of extensive study, discovery proceedings and preparations, the case came to trial in U.S. District Court in Lincoln, Nebraska, 8 Duly 1985. After nearly a month in court, agreement was reached between the parties to settle the case on 6 August 1985. The purpose of this paper is not to redress and reargue the legal controversy. Rather, it is to share in the technical forum of gas technology, the lessons learned from the synergistic study leading to a forensic conclusion. The case history is unique and significant because it relates to extensive data from 2 fields and provides insight helpful to understanding major geological and operational factors affecting migration, exchange and mixing of mobile fluids underground. The paper, written from the perspectives of applied reservoir engineering, geology and geochemistry, includes methodologies applicable to other similar situations - often suspected but not sufficiently investigated.

Most of the curtains used consisted of single-layer thin plastic materials, and lack of storage space inside the greenhouse may prevent use of thicker sections. The difficulty with thermal screens operating on the outside of the structure is that they are exposed to the weather. This paper describes the construction and experimental evaluation of a greenhouse thermal screen system where heavily insulated and relatively thick screens operate in-between the glazings of a double-glazed greenhouse. The thermal screen system was evaluated on a commercial size, arch (semi-circular) greenhouse with inflated outer polythylene and inner fibreglass glazings. A computer program was developed to predict the thermal performance of the shutter system in reducing greenhouse energy consumption. The comparisons between the experimental and computer results showed a high degree of correlation, and these results indicated that under average climatic conditions the heating requirements of a double-glazed greenhouse using the thermal screens could be reduced by as much as 60 to 80% © 1986, The British Society for Research in Agricultural Engineering.

(formula omitted) The grain model was applied in order to determine the reaction kinetic parameters such as the reaction rate constants by considering a complex reaction scheme during the course of the hydration of CaSO4and the dehydration of CaSO4.1/2H2O. As a result, it was found that the reaction order with respect to the steam pressure was 1.0 for both the hydration and the dehydration, and that the reaction rate constant for the hydration of CaSO4took a maximum value at about 380 K. Further, it was observed that the reaction activity remained almost constant, independently of the repetition of the reaction cycle between hydration and dehydration within the experimental conditions employed. Consequently, it is considered that the CaSO4.1/2H2O/CaSO4thermochemical reaction cycle might be usable for thermal energy storage between 293.2 and 473.2 K, despite its relatively low value of reaction heat among several kinds of reaction candidates. © 1986, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

The system was constructed with an air-water heat exchanger and heat storage tanks that were combined with hydroponic water beds. The heat exchanger had been designed for a moderate heat source. To achieve a reasonable price and a compact heat exchanger, the heat transfer surface is made of a polyethylene film shaped into a bag; many poly-bags are installed into a casing in parallel and close to each other. The heat transfer is accomplished as follows: Water flows down inside the bags in a thin layer, and air flows outside the bags. The water tanks to store solar heat were separated into two parts with a polyethylene film. The upper parts were filled with hydroponic water used for the plant growth bed, and the lower parts were filled with fresh water. The fresh water was circulated into the heat exchanger to recover the solar heat inside the greenhouse and to release the heat for heating. The system was designed in 3.6m x 9.0m greenhouse equipped with an interior curtain. The total heat transfer surface in the heat exchanger was 28m2 and the heat transfer rate was 16 kcal/ m2h°C. The two water tanks (6m long, 0.6m wide and 0.5m deep) were installed and filled with 0.8m3 of hydroponic water and 2.8m3 of fresh water. The tanks were buried 0.35m deep under the ground to keep favorable working conditions. A 2.08 kW electric water heater was installed into the tank for auxiliary heating. Cucumbers were grown and the data were collected through seventy days from Jan. 5 in 1983. The averaged minimum air temperature inside the greenhouse was maintained at 11.4°C, the solar heat storage efficiency was 0.18 and solar heat provided 77% of the total heat for heating through seventy days. The solar heat storage efficiency depended on outside insolation. When outside insolation was less than 1000 kcal/m2day, the solar heat storage efficiency was zero, and was 0.32 when outside insolation was over 3000 kcal/m2day. The highest COP of the system (the heat released from the heat storage tank/the energy consumption to store and release the solar heat) was 6.6 and the averaged COP was 4.1. The COP was also in proportion to outside insolation. In the days when the COP was over 4.1, the heating was achieved with only the solar heat storage. The hydroponic water temperature was maintained at 24—15°C by the heat from the fresh water, high enough to grow cucumbers. Therefore, it was not necessary to apply another heat source to heat the hydroponic water. The cucumbers grew well and the system appeared to be able to supply 77% of heating energy from solar heat. It would be necessary for further research to optimize carbon dioxide and humidity levels without deteriorating the capability of solar heating for practical use. © 1986, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Energy storage systems are also required to provide power during ~30% of the orbit in eclipse. Solar dynamic (SD) power generation systems have been used for many years to provide electrical energy for terrestrial applications. Their use in a space application offers the potential for significantly higher efficiency with a threefold reduction in projected area as compared with a planar PV array and a substantial life cycle cost (LCC) reduction. Dynamic engines [closed Brayton cycle (CBC) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC)] in the size required for space have been operated for many years. Recently, extensive demonstrations have been conducted to verify the ability to convert the intermittent sunlight attendant to an LEO and convert it to the constant energy stream needed to operate the candidate dynamic engines. The approach utilizes a heat receiver that absorbs concentrated sunlight from a parabolic dish and stores the energy in a phase-change material (PCM) for use by the engine when in the earth eclipse. Technical issues such as containment material corrosion, PCM behavior, and heat transfer to the heat receiver have been addressed theoretically, in the laboratory, and in large-scale system tests. The behavior of PCM has been characterized for both ORC and CBC. LiOH [MP of 470°C (878°F)] has been found to be an appropriate PCM for the ORC. Its heat of fusion, 877 kJ/kg (377 Btu/lb), is high enough to minimize storage mass. LiOH may be contained with nickel and nickel-chromium alloys. Eutectic mixtures of MgF2-LiF or CaF2-LiF are both candidate salts for a moderate temperature, 704°C (1300°F) CBC. Both mixtures can be contained with nickel-chromium and cobalt base alloys. Large-scale system tests with PCM in cylindrical canisters within a heat exchanger were performed using a parabolic concentrator to characterize thermodynamic performance in an environment typical of LEO. The performance of the PCM indicated that the intermittent sunlight characteristic of LEO could be converted to the constant energy stream necessary for dynamic engine operation. © 1986, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The net radiative energy flux at the top of the atmosphere must be balanced by local heat storage in the earth‐atmosphere column or by horizontal transport in the atmosphere and ocean. Regional variations in the components of the radiation balance are significant and place important constraints on regional and global climate. If suitable time averaging is applied, regional net radiation can be used to infer horizontal transport of energy in the atmosphere and ocean. Estimates of equator‐to‐pole transport in the atmosphere and ocean based upon currently available top‐of‐atmosphere radiation budget measurements contain unacceptably large uncertainties associated with uncertainties in the radiation budget measurements themselves. Diurnal and interannual variations in regional radiation balances are large and important but have not yet been properly sampled with broadband instruments. Both have the potential for providing important insights into climate. The role of cloudiness in climate sensitivity remains one of the major uncertainties in quantitative estimates of climate changes associated with particular perturbing influences. Radiation budget data can be used to estimate the effects of actual cloudiness on the top‐of‐atmosphere heat balance and the dependence of these effects on location and season. The observational studies of the effect of cloudiness on the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere that have been completed to date all suffer from one or more of three fundamental problems. These are that the parameters of the cloudiness are not accurately known, the radiation budget data are not based on measurements whose frequency response is unbiased in relation to the emissions of the sun and the earth, and the diurnal sampling of the measurements is not complete. The uncertainties associated with each of these problems are expected to be reduced as a result of analyses based on data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. In order that quantitative estimates of climate change be as accurate as possible the general circulation models (GCMs) which produce these forecasts must be critically evaluated with observed data. Many of the most important mechanisms for perturbing climate (e.g., CO2, volcanic aerosols, surface albedo changes) and many of the most important feedback processes (e.g., relative humidity feedback, cloud feedback, ice‐albedo feedback) directly involve the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere and its relation to surface climate. Since the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere can, in principle, be measured very accurately from space, it is natural that the simulation of top‐of‐atmosphere energy fluxes by GCMs should be carefully validated against observations. Because of the complexities introduced by clouds, a complete validation of the radiation budget of a GCM is a long and difficult task. A strategy is suggested here in which the clear‐sky fluxes of the model are first compared with a clear‐sky radiation budget climatology derived from observations. The radiation budgets with clouds included can then also be compared. This procedure should isolate problems not associated with cloudiness and indicate whether, in the grossest sense, the model clouds are correctly influencing the radiation balance. Comparisons between instantaneous synoptic maps of the radiation budget components and numerical forecasts can also be used to diagnose the performance of models.

In order to determine the metabolic fate of dietary wax esters, we fed chicks [1‐14C]cetyl oleate in either a low wax (20%, w/w) or a high wax (80%, w/w) mixture of wax ester and triacylglycerols. Wax ester in the stomach remained unhydrolyzed for extended periods, with up to 38% of the label still unassimilated after 36 hr. Hydrolysis occured principally in the duodenum, where the fatty alcohol product was rapidly oxidized to fatty acid, apparently at the intestinal epithelia. Assimilated label was primarily metabolized and respired as carbon dioxide, with most of the remainder incorporated into triacylglycerols and deposited in storage fat depots. Hydrolysis of wax ester and assimilation of the fatty alcohol moiety were extremely efficient, with less than 0.2% of ingested label excreted. Assimilation efficiencies for label in low wax and high wax meals were statistically indistinguishable. Chicks fed 20% (w/w) [1‐14C]cetyl alcohol in triacylglycerols had similar assimilation efficiencies as those fed labeled wax ester, indicating that hydrolysis of the ester linkage does not limit wax ester assimilation. This study suggests that sea birds can possess an efficient means for metabolizing wax esters, an abundant energy source in the marine environment, which have previously been thought to be difficult to assimilate.

Up to 63% of the estimated digestible energy in chick meals consists of wax esters.

In simple terms, it seems that the quills of porcupines are proportioned to be as long as possible without bending too easily when loaded axially. By contrast, the spines of the hedgehog are as short as possible while still able to bend when loaded axially. In addition, the hedgehog spines have an internal morphology which delays the onset of local buckling under these loads, thus enabling the spines to absorb larger amounts of mechanical energy. By contrast, the quills of Hystrix are designed to break at the tip. Thus, whilst the quills of the porcupine seem to be well adapted for keeping an enemy as far away as possible, the spines of the hedgehog probably have this as an incidental function. Their main function is much more likely to be that of a shock absorber or storage of impact energy when the animal falls from a height, a behavioural attribute which is reportedly common. 1986 The Zoological Society of London",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985406626

Needs represent the status of various matter‐energy and information resources in accordance with the purposes of the system. Thus, the input, output, and storage subsystems are involved. Needs are also linked by theory to the decider subsystem Current popular theories of human needs suffer from many defects that threaten to undermine other need‐based theories. Need is not well defined in these theories, descriptions of specific needs and need categories are ambiguous, the origin of needs is disputed, and empirical evidence offers at best only partial support for need hierarchies. A need concept properly grounded in living systems theory would correct these and other defects. Such a concept is presented, and its implications for research, for the notion of a need hierarchy, and for other need‐based theories are examined.

To access the required random values of differential coherent and incoherent scattering angles, two‐variable cubic spline representations of the appropriate cumulative distribution functions are developed and their use is demonstrated. In this approach the scattering angle is taken to be the dependent variable while the two independent variables are the x‐ray energy and the normalized cross‐sections. Cubic spline coefficients for the elements from sodium to nickel have been obtained for x‐ray energies from 1 to 150 keV for all scattering angles for both coherent and incoherent scattering. Compared with the commonly used method of numerically integrating tabular values of coherent and incoherent cross‐sections to produce a table of values for subsequent interpolation, use of cubic spline representations gives a 90% reduction in storage space and a 25–80% reduction in the amount of computer time required for equal accuracy.

Macronutrient selection affects eating behavior. Diet composition and the dynamics of insulin that this triggers affects both eating behavior and the fat storage capability of the body. Eating behavior appears also to be influenced by satiety mechanisms. Whether fat cells influence eating behavior is not clear, but it appears that those people who are afflicted with hyperplastic obesity are likely to have more difficulty maintaining a reduced weight. The relevance of set point theory to weight and eating regulation has no scientific support at this time, and negative implications for therapy.

In this paper the production and consumption of tropical root crops by major world regions and individual countries are analyzed. Three of the world's leading producers and consumers of tropical root crops are China, Nigeria, and Brazil. The annual, global per capita consumption is about 70 kg. The nutritional content of tropical root crops is discussed, followed by a review of some nutritional studies done in India, Zambia, Brazil, and the South Pacific. In some countries tropical root crops supply up to 75% of the daily diet. Tropical root crops have high return to energy expenditure in their production. The various utilization methods of tropical root crops are then discussed. There is very little international trade in tropical root crops, the main products being cassava pellets and starch. Most of the trade is of a domestic nature, consisting of fresh tubers for urban markets. The contribution of tropical root crops in the agricultural economy of the main producing nations varies greatly. It ranges from about 25% in a highly subsistence oriented economy like Papua New Guinea to 10% in a semi-subsistence economy like Fiji to a mere 2% in a highly commercialized economy like Japan. The development potential of tropical root crops is very high because they can produce large amounts of food per unit of labor or time, they are well adapted to a wide range of environments, and they have a strong interdependence with man. It is argued that in this hungry world tropical root crops have a major role to play in meeting the food needs of rural and urban populations of less developed countries. Rural development programs in many less developed countries would have greater chances of success if they were strongly integrated with tropical root crops development programs. Finally, general conclusions and recommendations for research and development in tropical root crops are made in agronomy, production systems, germplasm, breeding, diseases and pests, storage, utilization, and marketing. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Water is chosen for its high dielectric constant and relatively high resistivity, which allows reasonably sized and efficient low-impedance high-voltage pulse lines where pulse durations are less than 100 ps. Water/ethylene glycol mixtures are being researched, so that rotating machinery, rather than the usual Marx generator, can be used as the primary energy store. The high resistivity and high dielectric constant of these mixtures at low temperature permit low-loss operation on millisecond time scales. Simple design criteria linking load parameters and charging circuit characteristics to the liquid dielectric are developed which show that the dielectric constant, breakdown strength, and relaxation time are the primary properties of interest to the pulse power engineer. On time scales greater than 100 p.s, injection of space charge, with density q and mobility µ, affects the charging and discharging circuit characteristics, introduces the time constant of the time of flight for injected charge to migrate between electrodes, and increases the effective ohmic conductivity σ to σ + qμ.A drift-dominated conduction model is used to describe measured space-charge effects. Kerr electrooptic field mapping measurements show strong space-charge effects with significant distortions in the electric field distribution a few hundred microseconds after high voltage is applied. The injected charge magnitude and sign depends on the electrode material. Thus by appropriate choice of electrode material combinations and voltage polarity, it is possible to have uncharged liquid, unipolar-charged negative or positive, or bipolar-charged liquid. An important case is that of bipolar injection, which has allowed up to a 40 percent higher applied voltage without breakdown than with no charge injection, and thus a doubling of stored energy due to the space-charge shielding which lowers the electric field strengths at both electrodes. Although injected space charge increases the stored electric energy over the capacitive space-charge-free energy, (1/2)CV2, more energy is required from a source during charging and the energy delivered to a resistive load is reduced because of internal dissipation in the capacitor as the charge is conducted to the electrodes. However, it appears that this extra dissipation due to injected charge can be made negligibly small and well worth the price if the space charge allows higher voltage operation for long charging time or repetitively operated machines. © 1986 IEEE",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939704574

Commercial minicomputer-based multichannel analyzers collect detected counts at various energies, create a histogram of the counts in memory, and display the resultant spectra. They acquire data and provide the user-to-display interface. The system discussed separates functions into the three modular components of data acquisition, storage, and display. This decoupling of functions allows the experimenter to use any number of detectors for data collection before forwarding up to 64 spectra to the display unit, thereby increasing data throughput over that available with commercial systems. An IBM PC was chosen for the low-cost, general purpose display unit. Up to four spectra may be displayed simultaneously in different colors. The histogram saves 1024 channels per detector, 640 of which may be distinctly displayed per spectra. The IEEE-488 standard provides the data path between the IBM PC and the data collection unit. Data is sent to the PC under interrupt control, using direct. memory access. Display manipulations available via keyboard are also discussed.

Achieving increased compactness in HPG’s is easily accomplished by spinning the inertial energy storage flywheel to higher tip speeds but generally involves brush operation at higher slip speeds. Sintered copper-graphite brushes presently limit slip velocity to 220 m/s and collector area current densities to 7-15 MA/m2, if a reasonable brush wear rate is expected. Development of copper finger brushes began in 1981 by Marshall who performed low speed (15 mm/s) testing at current densities above 450 MA/m2. Based oh encouraging results obtained by Marshall, the present investigation focused on characterization of copper finger brushes in an actual HPG operating environment. Experimental data were collected using the Compact HPG System Tester, a working 5-MJ HPG which can deliver current pulses in excess of 1 MA into resistive loads for the evaluation of brush performance. The copper finger brushes tested successfully transferred 1.15 MA at a slip speed of 100 m/s and currents of 600 kA at 180 m/s. Experimental evaluation of effective contact resistance as functions of slip speed, current transferred, and brush normal force was performed, and the results are discussed. Interfacial heat fluxes due to friction and contact voltage drop for the test conditions were also determined, and then extrapolated to operating levels of 300 m/s and 3 MA.

Biological production is taken here as the storage of primary (solar) energy by autotrophs and its transfer to or among heterotrophs. It is hypothesized that enhanced biological production occurs at ergoclines as the consequence of the matching or resonance of physical scales with biological scales. Physical scales act on biological production through the proximal agency of resources. High biological production most often exhausts the resources available at the lower trophic level; auxiliary energy on proper scales makes possible the replenishment of these limiting resources, and thus biological production at aquatic ergoclines. It is considered that transitions on various time scales (annual, meteorological, tidal and so on) and spatial structures such as the ice-water and bottom-sediment interfaces, the pycnocline, tidal fronts, and others, all belong to the general category of marine ergoclines. Hypotheses as to the mechanisms that govern biological production at ergoclines are developed, and the conditions to test these hypotheses at sea are discussed. © 1986, Elsevier B.V.

However, both types of plastic exhibited some loss of neutron sensitivity with age, although neither showed any fading of recorded tracks. Backgrounds showed a slow but steady increase with time at rates which were different for the two types of plastic. The loss of sensitivity with age was reduced by storage in a dry enriched nitrogen atmosphere, but this did not prevent the increase in backgrounds with time.

When neutrons interact with the detector, visible bubbles immediately appear which are immobilized by the medium to give a lasting image. Experiments showed that these detectors were insensitive to gamma radiation, but were very sensitive to Pu-Be neutrons - allowing for the measurement of less than 1 mrem of fast neutrons. In the intervening two-year period, many studies have been made into the qualitative and quantitative properties of these ""bubble detectors"". Much of the work has been done in connection with the development of a personal neutron dosimeter for radiation protection purposes. These studies include the effect medium elasticity and differnt types of detector liquids, the behaviour of detectors with storage, the effect of time (during use) on detection sensitivity and on bubbles formed by neutron irradiation, the influence of ambient temperature on detector response and the effect of the volume of dispersed detector liquid on absolute detection efficiency. Studies have also been made on the neutron energy response of such detectors having different types of detector liquids. It was found that the low energy threshold of bubble detectors is determined by a particular property of detector liquids, so that detectors of desired thresholds can be produced. One type of detector, which is attractive for personal neutron dosimetry, can detect fast neutrons to below 50 keV and can also detect thermal neutrons probably because of (n,p) reactions in the detector. When worn on the body, this detector provides an essentially flat dose equivalent response from thermal to 20 MeV. Although a theoretical model of the bubble detector is still under development, the experimental results indicate that the detector is extremely promising for neutron dosimetry and other applications. © 1986.","Bubble detector; energy dependence; neutron detector; neutron dosimetry; nucleation; polymer; superheated liquid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849151050

Since no element is independent of others in the chemical make-up of a cell, multielement analysis of all the available data confers upon an individual cell a unique identity. The statistical approach described in this paper allocates an identity to each cell which is then tested for conformity with others of the same sample. Human blood was stored for up to 29 days in acid citrate dextrose solution at +4°C. Monolayers of washed erythrocytes were prepared on carbon-coated, celloidin films on TEM specimen grids, quenched in liquid nitrogen and subsequently freeze-dried. Fifty erythrocytes were analysed at 0, 7, 14, 23 and 29 days and the X-ray emissions (per 100 s) of sodium, phosphorus, sulphur, potassium, iron and a specified background value measured. Chemical data processed by the statistical routine indicated the presence of 'outliers'-cells which possessed statistically significant differences in their chemical composition from others of the sample. These data were correlated with alterations in erythrocyte shape examined by scanning electron microscopy. Discocytes, prevalent in stored blood on day 0 were characterized by low Na and high P, S, K and Fe. With storage, discocytes were replaced by spheroechinocytes (stages I, II and III) and, later, spherocytes-these cells being present in greatest numbers on days 7, 7-14, 23 and 29, respectively. Individual erythrocytes gained Na and lost K, P, S and Fe during this period. Loss of erythrocyte mass was demonstrated by a reduction in the background radiation. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46149140823

It is shown that a commonly used procedure of averaging the exchange term over the hydrodynamic timescales of interest can be problematic in modelling the equipartition unless very small timesteps are used. A simple model, in which the electron and ion diffusion equations are solved simultaneously, is found to prevent the problems introduced by the average exchange model. The simultaneous solution method increases storage requirements as large scale matrix equations have to be solved. Various algorithms are considered in terms of the increase in storage and execution time required to implement the simultaneous solution method. In particular, a new simple point-iterative algorithm is introduced which is particularly efficient at solving the above problem and offers much scope when applied as a solution method for multi-species diffusion and equilibration problems. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46149132911

One of the used arguments concerned the estimation of the amount of stored elastic energy on the basis of knee extension and plantar flexion torques in combination with knee flexion and dorsiflexion angles during running. In their comment to this argument, Hof and van den Berg (1986) show convincingly that one should take into account the internal stretch distance of the elastic component rather than those flexion angles. In the present paper the further arguments of Hof and van den Berg concerning the compliance of human muscle and tendons are discussed.

The proposed method is based on the concept of peak shaving for the hydro and pumped storage units. Different values of the stored energy of the pumped storage units are employed to demonstrate their effect on the generation reliability of a power system. The proposed scheme has been applied successfully to the reliability analysis of Taiwan power system. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45949129704

When ruthenium tris(bipyridyl) ions (Ru(bpy)32+) are also present, they compete for OH and H radicals and produce the appropriate adducts. These adducts may disproportionate or react with the polymer radicals. The kinetic constants of these systems were measured by pulse radiolysis. The reaction products were also studied by dialysis of these systems following γ-irradiation. Under the conditions of these experiments the Ru(bpy)32+-OH adducit (and probably also the corresponding H adduct) reacts with the polymer radicals. The products of these reactions are the appropriate polymer molecules with covalently bound Ru(bpy)32+ residues. This method has a potential use in the synthesis of such compounds, which may be utilized for photochemical storage of light energy. © 1986 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444240056

The meteorites included the four known members of the shergottite class, Shergotty, Allan Hills A77005, Zagami and Elephant Moraine A79001, the type 3 ordinary chondrite Dhajala and the howardite Kapoeta. After irradiation and 15 days storage at room temperature, considerable fading of the TL of the Kapoeta meteorite and two of the shergottites (Shergotty and 77005) was observed, while the TL of the other shergottites and Dhajala remained constant. Mineral separation experiments and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses indicate that the phosphor responsible for the TL is located in the low-density feldspar rich fraction in the Dhajala meteorite and the shergottites and this is probably also true of Kapoeta. Despite the diverse history of the samples and major differences in composition, it is only the samples in which feldspar is thought to be present in the low-temperature form which display anomalous fading. It is argued that the present data are most consistent with the mechanism for anomalous fading involving overlap between the wavefunctions for the excited and ground state electrons. Fortunately, most meteorites contain feldspar in the high-temperature form and large scale studies of their natural TL should not be hampered by anomalous fading. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249043962

However, the focus has been put on the inner region of the neutral sheet where the ions are effectively unmagnetized and MHD concepts are violated. In this parameter regime driven reconnection is governed by the fast dynamics of electrons. In true neutral sheets (Bz {reversed tilde equals} 0) the current is carried by electrons. Thin current sheets (Δz ≳ c/ωpe) rapidly form multiple X and 0 points due to the onset of the collisionless electron tearing mode. Magnetic energy is transported along the separator at the speed of whistler waves rather than Alfvén waves. Due to space charge separation the reconnection electric field Ey is, in general, not constant along the separator but localized near boundaries, nonuniformities in density and magnetic fields which limit the current Iy. This leads to localized particle acceleration, formation of anisotropic velocity distributions and instabilities. Reconnection and energization can be spatially separated which shows the importance of investigating both the global current system as well as critical local plasma properties. Experiments of current sheet disruptions are performed which demonstrate the processes of magnetic energy storage, transport, conversion and dissipation. Double layers and shock waves can be produced by current disruptions. The laboratory experiments show new dynamic features of reconnection processes not considered in MHD models yet relevant to narrow current sheets or the center of thick sheets. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249043680

When given intravenously (i.v.), glucose (+ insulin) induces an increase of energy expenditure (EE) of 7% of energy infused, whereas lipid (Intralipid®) infusion stimulates EE by 3% of energy infused. The stimulation of EE due to amino acid infusion in depleted patients is 30-40% of the energy infused as amino acids. Glucose induced thermogenesis includes an 'obligatory thermogenesis' which accounts for the energy cost of storing the nutrient and a 'facultative thermogenesis' which is mainly due to a stimulation of sympathetic activity; the latter is suppressed by propranolol infusion. Comparison of nutrient induced thermogenesis during continuous administration of nutrients between the enteral and parenteral routes reveal similar responses. This shows that the energy costs of digestion and absorption of nutrients is low in comparison with the cost of nutrient storage. However, when given by the enteral route, the net efficiency of energy utilisation is also dependent on the co-efficient of nutrients absorption. Oral administration of nutrients (bolus) induces a larger thermogenic response than continuous enteral administration, due to a larger nutrient storage for the former. It is therefore advisable to allow for the thermic effect of nutrients when assessing the efficiency of energy utilisation in patients. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249040874

A solar house was built in Amman (latitude 32° 01′, longitude 35° 33′, elevation 980 m), where both passive and active design criteria were considered by the designer. The house has two sections, the living space (65 m2) and the mechanical room (45 m2). The overall loss coefficient (U × area) was estimated to be 258 W°C-1. Two heating systems are investigated in the framework of this project; the underfloor heating system, which was investigated through the winter 1982-1983 and the fan coil unit system, which is currently under investigation. The Solar Water-Space Heating System consists of 40 m2 of locally made flat plate collectors, 2.5 m3 storage tank, auxiliary oil-fired burner and the necessary piping and control equipments.

The results have been compared with the Xα calculations of Roche, Salahub, and Messmer and good agreement was found. Comparison was also made with a number of previous measurements, including those obtained by (e,2e) spectroscopy.

Because of free tunable excitation energy special elements or element groups of interest can be selectively excitated. The use of a graphite crystal for monochromatizing leads to a sufficient fluorescence intensity even for thin samples, because of a larger band width compared to other monochromator crystals. Nevertheless, a sufficient selectivity of the excitation will be achieved. Using a curved crystal focussing the beam in the horizontal plane of the storage ring, the intensity can be improved by a factor of about 20. The limits of detection for realistic samples (in this case aerosol samples are analysed) are in the range of 40 ng/ g. The results of the direct analysis of arsenic in aerosol samples are discussed and compared with an interlaboratory test. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250126423

The changes may be increases or decreases and they have duration of a few hours. In one such example following a solar flare, particles flow away from the Sun in a well-defined channel 2.5 × 106 km in width for twenty hours or longer. We believe that the interplanetary magnetic lines defined by this channel connect to an active region at 16° N solar latitude. At this time the Earth was located at a solar latitude of 2° S. Evidently the particle channel connects to a region of the solar atmosphere which supplies particles over these long times either via storage of the flare accelerated particles or else by continuous acceleration. Arguments are given against the latter possibility. We discuss a model for coronal storage which is consistent with the observations. © 1986 D.

From the analyses of foF2 and h′F data, these disturbance events are found to be characterized by a two‐stage process. During the first stage, which starts during the magnetospheric energy storage process before the onset of substorms, h′F begins to increase simultaneously at all observing stations due to eastward electric fields penetrating from the magnetosphere. At subequatorial stations, increases of foF2 follow as a signature of enhancements of the equatorial anomaly. During the second stage, values of h′F increase again, indicating a motion from north to south, with no increase of foF2. In this stage, dynamical effects including neutral winds become important, as well as electric fields. In addition, it is shown from the analysis of one year's data for 1978 that the occurrence of disturbance events as presented in this paper is a general feature in the evening section under the condition of ring current developments.

Storage of juices over a 12-week period at temperatures ranging from 10 to 50 °C resulted in increased levels of tin, iron, and aluminum in the product. The Sn, Fe, and A1 uptakes were essentially linear with time, increased with temperature, and were greater for Sn than for Fe or Al. Corrosion of cans was disproportionally higher at temperatures exceeding ca. 37 °C. An Arrhenius plot of log K (Sn uptake) vs. the reciprocal of absolute storage temperature showed two distinct reaction kinetics. For the region 10–37 °C, an energy of activation, Ea, of 10.1 kcal and a Q10 of 1.8 was noted, whereas the region 37–50 °C showed an Ea of 20.2 kcal and a Q10 of 2.6.

The data, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 185 pb-1, were obtained at the SLAC e+e- storage ring PEP. The techniques used to correct the observed prong numbers are discussed. The multiplicity distribution of the charged particles has a mean value n=12.87±0.03±0.30, a dispersion D2=3.67±0.02±0.18, and an f2 moment of 0.60±0.02±0. 18. Results are also presented for a two-jet sample selected with low sphericity and aplanarity. The charged-particle distributions are almost Poissonian and narrower than have been reported by other e+e- experiments in this energy range. The mean multiplicity increases with the event sphericity, and for the sample of threefold-symmetric three-jet events, a value of n=16.3±0.3±0.7 is found. No correlation is observed between the multiplicities in the two hemispheres when the events are divided into two jets by a plane perpendicular to the thrust axis. This result is in contrast with the situation in soft hadronic collisions, where a strong forward-backward correlation is measured. For the single jets, a mean multiplicity of 6.43±0.02±0.15 and a dispersion value of D2=2.55±0.02±0.13 are found. These values give further support to the idea of independent jet fragmentation. The multiplicity distributions are well fit by the negative-binomial distribution. The semi-inclusive rapidity distributions are presented. Comparisons are made to the measurements of charged-particle multiplicities in hadron-hadron and lepton-nucleon collisions. © 1986 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25344473585

Increasing energy prices stimulated research on solar drying in highly mechanized agricultural systems. However, in those countries solar drying has to compete with automated crop dryers using fossil fuels as the energy source. Studies have shown that neither the temperature required nor the quantity of heat necessary in high-temperature batch type or continuous-flow dryers can be reached with solar collectors. Therefore solar energy cannot be adapted economically to high-temperature drying systems. Solar energy is considered more applicable to low-temperature in-storage drying systems which has gained more importance in the last decade for drying grain and hay. Conditions in tropical and subtropical countries make the use of solar energy highly recommendable. The introduction of solar crop dryers seems to be a way to lower mass losses compared to traditional drying methods and improves the quality of the product considerably. Solar drying can be a way to increase the food supply and it also can be a possibility to increase the income of the rural population. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24444436561

In this approach, the flow domain is decomposed into a set of subdomains, each of which has two grid surfaces overlapped with each of the neighbouring subdomains. Grids are numerically generated in each subdomain using the boundary fitted coordinate transformation method. The generated grids are smooth across the subdomain interface because first derivatives of the grid lines are continuous across the overlapping surfaces. The Navier-Stokes and energy equations are transformed into the computational space using the boundary fitted coordinate transformation method and solved in each subdomain. This approach features a decrease in core storage to the minimum needed for the calculation of a subdomain, which can overcome difficulties related to dimensionality of three dimensional complicated flow problems. The calculation algorithm and some preliminary results are presented.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17744417710

We report on the analysis of the exclusive channel (2S)b, b(1S)e+e- or +-. We detect two b states by observing two monochromatic photon lines at energies (107.01.11.3) MeV and (131.70.91.3) MeV, respectively. The product branching ratios B[(2S)b]×B[b(1S)] are (1.60.30.2)% for the first state and (2.10.30.3)% for the second. For the product branching ratio of the third b state, which has been observed in inclusive measurements, we find an upper limit of 0.2% (90% C.L.). Combining our results with inclusive measurements, branching ratios for b(1S) are derived. Using theoretical estimates for the radiative widths of the b states, we determine their hadronic widths; the results are compared with QCD predictions. © 1986 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144315063

Comparisons made of the heat pump performance with electric resistance, oil and gas heating systems using an annualised life-cycle cost method of analysis showed that the heat pump offers economic advantages over the electric resistance heaters and the oil-fired boiler, but is not an economic alternative to the gas-fired central-heating system. To become competitive with gas-fired boilers, either the capital cost of the heat pump must be substantially reduced or its seasonal coefficient of performance increased by about 50%.

Tuna meat was stored at −20 ~ −80°C for 1 year and its quality changes were followed by using parameters such as the metmyoglobin to total myoglobin ratio, water-holding capacity, and pH. Ikura, a salted product of salmon eggs, was stored frozen. Quality changes were followed by using the following parameters: toughness of the egg membrane, carotenoid content, and TBA value. Surimi, meat paste from Alaska pollack, was kept frozen, and the quality changes were followed by analyzing protein composition, SDS-gel electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal patterns, and the gel strength of kamaboko processed therefrom. Finally, prawn was stored frozen. At selected time intervals, the meat was analyzed for changes in water-holding capacity, pH, tyrosine content, protein composition, and SDS-gel electrophoretic pattern. From the present experiments, it was concluded that −20°C is low enough for frozen storage to keep the quality unchanged for 2–3 months, irrespective of the types of seafood tested. In frozen storage for 1 year, however, lower temperatures are needed to maintain the quality. Temperatures between −30 and −40°C seemed to be more reasonable from the viewpoint of energy saving. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The quantum yield of viologen ion radicals, in the presence of triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor, remained high (0.80 ± 0.02) over a wide range of amphipathic viologen concentration (20 μM-5 mM). This value coincided with the quantum yield of initially generated viologen ion radicals as estimated from laser flash photolysis of the sensitizer-electron mediator binary system. The high quantum yield was attributed to the rapid and very efficient harvesting of the electron-carrying mediator and the successive electron transfer to the surface of the viologen bilayer membrane, which enables temporary storage of the captured electron. Relevance of the present system to chemical conversion and storage of solar energy is discussed. © 1986 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043270196

Other cells from which the basement membrane was removed by enzymatic and mechanical procedures were tested identically. Effectiveness of the basement membrane removal technique was evaluated by electron microscopy, by an electrophoretic and lectin-binding assay for depletion of cell surface glycoproteins, and by confirmation by means of electrophoretic and immunologic analyses that major intracellular, cytoskeletal proteins were not disrupted. Measurements of maximum stress, maximum strain, and phase lag between these maxima enabled the complex modulus (dynamic stiffness) and loss tangent (relative viscous losses to elastic energy storage) to be calculated for each mechanically tested preparation. We also calculated the amounts of energy stored and dissipated in each preparation. These calculations indicate that cells with intact basement membranes have complex moduli significantly greater than those of cells without basement membranes, and that cells with basement membrane store significantly more elastic energy than basement membrane depleted cells. However, when subjected to identical sinusoidal strains, energy dissipation in cells with intact basement membranes is over three times greater than dissipation in cells without basement membrane. The relative magnitudes of energy losses to energy storage, called the specific loss, is nearly three times greater for intact cells than for basement membrane depleted cells.

This leads to problems in current transfusion practice, and often wastes rare and costly products. To remedy this situation, we developed a synthetic medium containing 0.085 g per I adenine, 5 g per I glucose, 48.0 g per I sucrose, 0.75 g per I NaH2PO4.H2O, 4 g per I Na2HPO4.2H2O, and 2.5 g per I NaCI, with a pH of 7.40, and an osmolarity of 320 mOsm. After 15 days post‐thawing storage at 4°C in our medium, the viability and function of RBC were maintained. We propose the storage of thawed RBC at 4°C in our medium for up to 9 days: sterility was maintained, pH was 6.80, and 2,3‐diphosphate glycerate was 50 percent, and adenosine triphosphate 100 percent of the original values. Free hemoglobin was 122 mg per unit, adenylate energy charge was 0.90, and RBC labeled 7 days after thawing showed 89 percent survival 24 hours after transfusion and a one‐half disappearance of 22 days. 1986 AABB",,"adenine; blood and hemopoietic system; cell survival; drug efficacy; human; human cell; normal human; priority journal; Adenosine Triphosphate; Blood Preservation; Blood Substitutes; Drug Storage; Erythrocyte Aging; Freezing; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023030959

To define further the platelet abnormalities, we determined the changes in platelet content of several granule‐associated substances during and after ECC in patients subjected to aortocoronary bypass surgery. Platelet β‐thromboglobulin (β‐TG) decreased to 79.8% of the preoperative level at the end of ECC (p < 0.01) and, as expected, did not recover 1 hr after the end of surgery. Platelet fibrinogen and albumin decreased to 67.9% (p < 0.01) and to 29.8% (p < 0.01) of baseline, respectively. However, 1 hr after surgery, platelet fibrinogen rose to 92% and albumin to 55.5% of baseline, denoting that during the recovery from ECC, platelets incorporate some plasma proteins. During ECC, platelet 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) and total ATP and ADP decreased to 50.8% (p < 0.01), 63.2% (p < 0.01), and 69.9% (p < 0.01) of their respective preoperative values, indicating dense body release. One hour after surgery, ATP recovered to 83.8%, suggesting that previous depletion compromised also the metabolic pool of adenine nucleotides. In summary, 1) Our results confirm and extend previous observations demonstrating α‐granule release during ECC. 2) Platelets undergoing ECC can incorporate plasma proteins as evidenced by the rapid increase of platelet fibrinogen and albumin after bypass. Although the mechanisms of this increase and site of storage of the exogenous substances are unknown, this observation justifies further studies to determine if internalization of plasma proteins, especially fibrinogen, may take place in physiological conditions. 3) Dense body depletion with transient storage pool deficiency appears to be a component of the reduced platelet function during ECC. 4) Consumption of metabolic ATP with alteration of platelet energy metabolism may further impair platelet function, contributing to the bleeding episodes observed during surgery with ECC.

The purpose of this paper is to present a biochemical model that explains bio-P removal mechanisms occurring under anaerobic, aerobic and anoxic conditions of the process. A bio-P bacterium is referred to as one that can store both polyphosphate and carbon (as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate for example). In this communication, observations from the literature are first reviewed and mechanisms of bacterial bioenergetics and membrane transport are summarized. The model for bio-P metabolism under anaerobic, aerobic and anoxic conditions is then presented. The role of polyphosphate under anaerobic conditions is suggested to be as a source of energy both for the reestablishment of the proton motive force, which would be consumed by substrate transport and for substrate storage. The role of the anaerobic zone is to maximize the storage of organic substrates in bio-P bacteria. For this purpose the supply of readily available substrates should be maximized and the presence of electron acceptors (molecular oxygen or oxidized nitrogen) minimized. Under subsequent aerobic or anoxic conditions, bio-P bacteria will accumulate polyphosphates in response to the availability of electron acceptors (oxygen or oxidized nitrogen) for energy production. Carbon reserves in bio-P bacteria should provide energy for growth and for soluble phosphate accumulation as polyphosphate reserves. © 1986.","biochemical model; enhanced biological phosphorus removal; membrane transport; poly-β-hydroxybutyrate; polyphosphate; proton motive force; wastewater treatment","BIOCHEMISTRY - Applications; PHOSPHORUS - Removal; BIOCHEMICAL MODEL; ENHANCED BIOLOGICAL PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL; MEMBRANE TRANSPORT; WASTEWATER; phosphorus; biological model; membrane permeability; microorganism; model; nonhuman; sewage treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023028385

The variability of therapeutic efficiency can be attributed to interindividual sensibility, chronobiologic effect, but also to rates of dissolution which can differ when polymorphs are induced by technologic operations. Several crystalline forms of Carbamazepine have been characterized. As for us, we have studied three crystalline modifications which can be found in commercialized galenic forms: the most usual beta form, the alpha form and the dihydrate. The aim of this work was to investigate: - the behaviour of these three crystalline forms during compression - the possibility of crystalline structural changes under grinding and tabletting conditions. Indeed, polymorphous transformations may occur during technologic operations such as grinding or compression owing to the increase of internal energy. Grinding was performed in a ball mill for 15 and 60 minutes. Compression was carried out using an instrumented single punch machine. The different parameters of compression, and hardness of resulting tablets were investigated. X Ray diffraction and Differential scanning calorimetry were carried out on the different samples of ground powders and on carefully crushed samples of each batch of tablets. The results point out at the best compressibility of dihydrate, and the most effective stability of the alpha form. However, the usual beta form remains stable in normal conditions of fabrication and storage. © 1986 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,"carbamazepine; crystallography; differential scanning calorimetry; drug formulation; drug stability; drug structure; nonhuman; polymorphism; priority journal; tablet manufacture; theoretical study; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023025587

Advantages for both double and single-layer coils are: compatible thermal-mechanical mounting on bedrock trench walls to contain expanding forces; rippled structure and conductor to reduce cooldown and magnetic loading stresses; open mounting in 1. 8 K pool helium for good cooling; round conductor continuous assembly without joints; convenient design to short all turns in parallel for emergency discharge; and relatively low voltages for such large storage inductors.

Small cryogenic tanks will be required for use in future on-board vehicular and remote site hydrogen based systems. In order to facilitate design and safety analyses, the Institute for Hydrogen Systems has developed a numerical model which simulates the operations of a small size cryogenic tank. The simulation is based on a simplified physical model in which the mechanism of heat transfer is represented as a one dimensional process and the fluid mixture is approximated as a saturated homogeneous mixture. It is shown that the numerical results, when compared with experimental data, give rise to a prediction of pressure rise in a closed vessel which is 1. 3 times lower than the actual pressure rise in a nearly empty tank. The calculated pressure rise is 1. 6 times lower for a nearly full tank. This suggests that the difference between the predicted and experimental results is due mainly to the development of temperature gradients in the liquid.",,"HEAT TRANSFER - Mathematical Models; HYDROGEN FUELS - Storage; TANKS - Pressure Effects; CALCULATED PRESSURE RISE; CRYOGENIC TANKS; LIQUID HYDROGEN STORAGE; SELF PRESSURIZATION; Gases, Liquefied",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022990986

The controls of food intake and energy expenditure in human beings are not simple; they are interdependent and are subject to many influences. It is unlikely that change in any single component can explain the major disturbances of energy balance in human beings. There is a facultative component in the thermogenic responses to cold, excess caloric intake, and other stimuli of normal subjects, which originally had survival value. There is a direct relationship between degree of insulin sensitivity and facultative response to overfeeding. A likely sequence is increase in effective serum insulin → central stimulation and activation of the sympathetic nervous system → increased turnover of norepinephrine → increased activity of substrate cycles, electrolyte pumping, and protein turnover, and possibly uncoupling of mitochondrial phosphorylation in brown fat. The composition of the diet is important for energy balance and fat storage, independent of the total caloric content and palatability. Increase in the fraction of carbohydrate in the diet increases the dietary thermogenic response. Increase in the fraction of fat in isocaloric diets, at least in experimental animals, leads to a greater increase in body fat. © 1986, Academic Press Inc.",,"insulin; aging; body weight; caloric intake; eating; energy metabolism; environment; exercise; female; human; obesity; physiology; pregnancy; review; thermoregulation; Aging; Body Temperature Regulation; Body Weight; Eating; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Exertion; Female; Human; Insulin; Obesity; Pregnancy; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022987451

An important feature of a large commercial plant is a system that will reliably shut down the magnet by thermally dissipating the stored energy in the event of an imminent or actual loss of superconductivity. To prevent damage to the coil during such a protective energy dump, the entire coil must be driven 'normal', i. e. , resistive rather than superconducting, in a short period of time. This requires rapid removal of the liquid helium coolant surrounding the coil.

The test goal was to confirm the technical feasibility of operating an ohmic heating coil for a tokamak-type fusion reactor. A 3 MJ magnet was first charged to 4510 amperes in 1. 5 seconds. It was discharged to 0 ampere in 1. 5 seconds and at once was re-charged to minus 4510 amperes in 1. 5 seconds. It was again discharged in 1. 5 seconds. The maximum field and the stored energy were 5. 4 T and 2. 1 MJ, respectively. During this bipolar sweep test, the magnet was quite stable during charge. Instability phenomena were not observed when the direction of the current was reversed. We also found that there was no mechanical instability during operation from the results of dynamic strain measurement. Thus it can be concluded that there is no technical problem in the bipolar sweep of an MJ-class pulsed superconducting magnet.",,"CHOPPERS - Design; ELECTROMAGNETS - Energy Storage; TOKAMAK DEVICES - Design; ENERGY STOPPAGE MAGNETS; ENERGY TRANSFER SYSTEM; LOAD MAGNET; PLASMA IGNITION; PULSED SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET; Superconducting magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022953498

The high latent load ratios found in supermarkets provide an ideal application for hybrid desiccant cooling systems. Such systems can reduce air conditioning energy costs between 50% and 70%. Solar collectors with no storage capacity can reduce the auxiliary heat requirements of hybrid desiccant cycles by another 50%, and further reductions occur with the use of storage. The value of the savings do not offset the additional cost of the solar system. The required installed capacity of the vapor compression unit is decreased 80% with the use of hybrid systems.

The choice of sensor locations is extremely important for proper evaluation of the system performance. An evaluation technique is being developed to detect weak spots in the system design based on measurement output. The study focussed on the solar energy installation and the operation of the auxiliary heating. An ideal interaction between the installation and the auxiliary heating was assumed. A detailed monitoring programme was carried out to study the behaviour of the solar system components. It was concluded that characterization of system components should be carried out with special test facilities and according to standard test procedures, in particular for the main components in a solar heating system: the solar collector, the heat storage system and the auxiliary heater.",,"Energy storage; HOT WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS - Testing; SOLAR ENERGY - Measurements; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; AUXILIARY HEATING; DYNAMIC HEATING PROCESS; HEATING LOAD PROFILE; SOLAR HEATING SYSTEMS; SOLAR PILOT TEST FACILITY; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022946797

Three of these systems are standard flat plate exchangerless systems, one is a flat plate with tank in tank heat exchanger and the last one has a heat pipe evacuated tube collector. Measured system efficiencies and solar fraction vary considerably from one to another but all of them show measured performances consistently lower than the one obtained from the SYPHON simulation model. In most instances these discrepancies are attributed to system malfunctions (uneven collector flow distribution, cold water withdrawal through the collectors) or from uncorrect specification of component characteristics. A parametric study using the SYPHON model shows that the physical characteristics (pipe diameter, collector to tank distance) of the collector storage and loop pipe arrangement has in a usual range of variation very little effect on thermal performances. However, pipe and preheat tank insulation may have an important impact on the economy of the overall system.",,"ENERGY STORAGE - Monitoring; HOT WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS - Computer Simulation; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Algorithms; SOLAR ENERGY - Energy Storage; FLAT PLATE EXCHANGERLESS SYSTEMS; SEASONAL THERMOSIPHON SYSTEMS; SIMULATION PROGRAMS; SYPHON MODEL; THERMAL PERFORMANCES; THERMOSIPHONS; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022938198

SLR predictions of auxiliary heating requirements, as performed on an Apple II Computer, are compared with actual performances of five passive solar residences in the Roaring Fork Valley of Colorado. The residences were monitored for Class C (non-instrumented) data which is of similar accuracy to the information available to a designer using SLR. Thermal performance of designs including direct gain, thermal storage wall, sunspace and mixed systems are evaluated. It is concluded that a designer using SLR cannot expect accuracy within the 10-15% range because sufficiently accurate input data is not available during the design process.",,"BUILDINGS - Heating; ENERGY UTILIZATION - Monitoring; SOLAR ENERGY - Energy Utilization; CLASS-C MONITORING; PASSIVE SOLAR BUILDINGS; SOLAR LOAD RATIO; THERMAL PERFORMANCE; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022935550

The dessicants are regenerated by hot air supplied by inexpensive air-heating solar collectors. Dry adsorbents provide storable cooling capacity for periods of low irradiance. Equilibrium isosteres of water vapor with various adsorbents have been measured. Based on these data the coefficient of performance (COP), mass flows and output temperatures have been calculated for equilibrium and steady state conditions. Output temperatures have been verified in a laboratory scale pilot plant. At present a thermal COP of about 0. 4 seems attainable.

Since there is no sure way of observing the pattern of cations in short-range ordered domains, an alternative is to make models of the structure in order to reproduce what may exist in real crystals. One way to do this is to construct a mathematical model of the crystal structure, calculate its energy and then try to minimize the energy by rearranging the substituting cations. Patterns of cations that are found in energetically favourable model structures are likely to occur in nature. Only two studies have tried to examine the short-range ordering patterns in layer silicates (trioctahedral and dioctahedral micas). Each looks at a different aspect of the problem with quite different methods. Both agree that short-range ordering patterns are likely in disordered layer silicates and that the energies of many of these patterns should be similar. -J.M.H.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022912878

From studies reported in the literature, the type characterized by the fluid pairs steam and steam, or steam and a high pressure fluid, are identified as requiring further development. To overcome the high costs of pressure containment or heat exchange presently encountered with stores exchanging heat with high pressure fluids, a store geometry is proposed comprising a packed bed with steam or high pressure fluid tubes exchanging heat with it. The packing may be a sensible heat, or encapsulated phase change or thermochemical material. The primary problem is the low effective conductivity of the packing leading to either very large numbers of steam tubes or very long charge and discharge times. A method of achieving high conductivities in packed beds is proposed using a gas vapour mixture in the voids. This mixture is maintained at 1 atmosphere pressure so that the container cost is kept low. Data from an experimental system shows that predicted high conductivities can be achieved in steady state, and that under transient conditions, the approximate theories so far developed are adequate for engineering design purposes. © 1986.",,"HEAT TRANSFER - Packed Beds; DISCHARGE RATES; HIGH HEAT TRANSFER RATES; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE COSTS; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022909957

The presence of bottom heating produces a well-defined horizontal boundary layer on the floor of the cavity. Due to the presence of bottom heating, the floor boundary layer entrains fluid from the core in addition to entraining fluid from the boundary layer on the cold wall, and has a distinct thermal boundary layer structure that is not present in the flow across the floor of a cavity with differentially heated sides. In spite of the potential destablizing effect of the bottom heating arrangement, experimental observations in a water-filled test cell indicate that the horizontal boundary layer structure persists for flux modified Rayleigh numbers as large as 5 multiplied by 10**1**3 and is not disturbed by the formation of Benard type instabilities or thermal plumes. The results of the numerical calculation have been compared with scaling relationships and heat transfer correlations for horizontal and vertical surfaces in an infinite medium. The vertical cooled surface in the cavity is shown to behave much like a vertical surface in an infinite medium, indicating that the flow past the vertical surface is relatively unaffected by the presence of the heated bottom wall.

The acid is ammoniated in an “enlarged” pipe reactor; the molten APP is dissolved in water and the fluid is cooled to room temperature by evaporative cooling. Attapulgite clay is in the APP fluid to prevent solids from settling during shipment, storage, and use. The process is energy efficient in that hot APP fluid provides all the heat required to preheat the phosphoric acid and vaporize the ammonia. Suspension grade of up to 12-36-0 can be made with 20 to 25% of the P2O5 present as polyphosphate. Lower shipping costs due to the high nutrient content of the suspensions makes it a desirable product.

The energy-balance equations are solved in the outer loop to obtain total flow rates. The K-factor is separated into three parts, each representing separately the effect of temperature, composition and apparent volatility. This makes the analytical calculation of the partial derivatives of the K-factors in the Jacobian matrix a simple task.

Herein we examine both a method to dope Os by reactive sputtering and the causes contributing to the induced magnetic anisotropy. Its performance as a perpendicular magnetic disk has yielded the following results. When Os is solidified during the formation of Fe3O4 film by reactive sputtering, reproducible doping is possible. When γ‐Fe2O3 is formed in atmospheric oxidation, the coercive force increases in proportion to the Os doping (Hc ∝ 500x, x = Os at. %). Magnetic anneal is effective for the γ‐Fe2O3 state, and a large anisotropy can be added when the oxygen partial pressure in the atmosphere is increased. Furthermore, the activation energy for the induced anisotropy was approximately 1.0 eV. The induced anisotropy seems to be related to the vacancies. In the recording reproduction using a thin‐film ring head, the reproduced isolated waveform is dipulse, thereby confirming the recording with a large perpendicular component (dipulse ratio 0.7).

Two solidification models are proposed for a theoretical analysis. In the first model, the solidification increases in the direction of the heat flow. In the other, it is assumed that the segregation grows perpendicularly to the heat flow, which corresponds to a dendritic solidification. The former model can be well applied in the low mixing ratio of p-C//6H//4Cl//2 and the latter can be used in the high mixing ratio. The temperature profile also changes in accordance with the initial mixing ratio of the two materials, however, the variation of the transfered heat from outside with time is quite similar to that of pure material having the same melting temperature.

The left side of a two-dimensional container is suddenly subjected to an isothermal heating. Instantaneously, an infinitesimal melt region forms. As a result, several types of singularities appear in the governing equations at time zero. They are removed by the choice of scales used in the nondimensionalization. Subcooling acts to reduce the melting rate, since some of the available thermal energy must be used as sensible heat to raise the solid's temperature to the melting point. Density change induces a blowing effect at the solid-liquid boundary if the solid is more dense than the liquid phase. Since liquid leaving the vicinity of the interface brings sensible heat along with it, the melting rate is reduced. A suction effect at the interface and enhanced melting are produced if the liquid is the denser phase.",,"Heat transfer; MATERIALS - Phase Transitions; LATENT HEAT THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS; SUBCOOLING EFFECT; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022876458

Based on this, two research activities were started between the DFVLR and two major German automobile manufacturers. In a cooperation between the Bayerische Motorenwerke AG (BMW) and the DFVLR, a BMW 745i limousine was converted to hydrogen operation. A unique property of this vehicle is represented by the digital electronic system (MOTRONIC) using microprocessors in mixture control, spark advance and engine monitoring. This system was adapted for hydrogen and enables convenient dual fuel operation, i.e. either gasoline or hydrogen.

Metamorphosis from larvae to juveniles, as indicated by the body depth to length ratio, was completed by 30 mm S.L. Analysis of the length/weight relationship indicated separate equations for larvae/postlarvae (< 30 mm S.L.) and juvenile/subadults (30–100 mm S.L.). Major body composition changes from larvae to subadult included an increase in lipid content, a corresponding increase in energy content, and a decrease in nitrogen content. Young‐of‐the‐year gulf menhaden did not exhibit the seasonal pattern of condition factors typical of adult clupeids. There may be a shift in energy allocation away from protein growth to lipid storage associated with attainment of a larger size. Initiation of emigration may be related to lipid storage and temperature change, with higher lipid content fish migrating first. End‐of‐year variations in fish size and lipid storage may be related to environmental conditions, such as water temperature and salinity. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

In the present work, measurements were made of the transient and steady-state thermal fields throughout an annular region bounded by vertical, coaxial cylinders. The inner cylinder was comprised of a finite-length heat source, supported above and below by insulating sections; the outer cylinder was maintained at a constant temperature. An overlying liquid layer was used to impose a permeable upper-surface boundary condition; this layer was maintained at a constant temperature equal to that of the outer cylinder. All properties of the porous medium, including porosity, permeability, and effective thermal conductivity were measured. Experimental results obtained in this effort showed steady-state heater surface temperatures (at constant heater power) to increase with increasing vertical distance due to the buoyancy-driven upflow. The measured steady-state radial temperature drop across the annulus was found to systematically depart from the finite-length-cylinder conduction solution as heater power was increased, consistent with the presence of increased convective-energy transport.

Coal dust was applied on 5 April 1985 at a rate of 18.1 Mg ha-1 to the bare soil surface of a 1.4-ha peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) planting. An adjoining 1.4-ha planting served as a control to which nocturnal net radiation (RN), soil heat flux (G), orchard canopy energy storage (St), sensible heat flux (H) and orchard temperature measurements were compared both before and after the coal application. Both plantings consisted of alternating 3-m wide soil-3-m wide grass strips with trees planted in the soil strip. Under typical radiative frost conditions (RN of -60 W m-2), the coal dust enhanced the radiative loss by 5 W m-2. This loss, assumed to result from a uniform temperature change of the orchard, was equivalent to a 1°C increase in orchard temperature. The increased radiative loss was due to higher air, canopy and soil temperatures. No effect was found in G or St due to the coal dust treatment. However, a greater downward transfer of sensible heat (5-8 W m-2 depending on method used to estimate H) to the orchard was found by using the coal dust. This increased flux was in response to larger air temperature gradients established near the canopy top following the coal application. The direct effect of using coal dust was measured in an increase in bud temperature. Under radiative frost conditions, an increase of 0.5°C in bud temperature was found. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022844411

How to meet the challenge of the 'third wave' is a difficult question in the forefront of agricultural production in developing countries. In the light of our study, one of the essential principles seems to be that people must pay great attention to the application of 'soft science', such as information theory and agricultural systems, while introducing or improving certain advanced and appropriate 'hard technology'. Starting from this viewpoint, a simulation model has been developed to study the NH3 direct application system in XAIC, China. The model uses experimental data from fourteen different districts in Xinjiang, plus the USA and Canada, and consists of a mixed integer program with goal programming variables. Its objective is to achieve maximum economic efficiency with minimum costs covering synthesis, transportation, storage and application, as well as lower energy consumption. Since a model only achieves real significance by being put into practice, an application of the model is described to show the effect of altering the composition of XAIC's N application from solid state only to 40% anhydrous ammonia and 60% solid N components. The sub-systems, running simultaneously at different levels, are controlled by computer feedback. The results have been satisfactory. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022841589

Water was injected into the aquifer for five hours before a salt solution was added as a tracer. This tracer was injected into the aquifer over a period of four hours at a rate of 22.7 1/s. Injection of the water into the aquifer continued for an additional 1 5 hours following injection of the salt solution. Samples were collected from a monitoring well located 6.54 meters from the injection well. A sampling device was installed prior to the injection experiment to permit the collection of water samples at different elevations within the screened portion of the monitoring well. The samples which were collected at five different elevations at various times, both during and following the salt injection, were analyzed for specific conductance and chloride concentration. The data suggest that the aquifer is inhomogeneous and that the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity to porosity increases from the lowest sampling port to the highest sampling port near the top of the aquifer. A linear relationship was obtained between the time of arrival of the tracer and the apparent resistivity of the formation. This linear relationship was used to calibrate the apparent resistivity log of the injection well to provide a continuous characterization of the vertical variation in the hydraulic conductivity/porosity ratio across the full thickness of the aquifer. Data analysis also suggests that the dispcrsivity parameter varies linearly with the time of arrival of the tracer. The combination of geophysical logs with tracer experiments may permit detailed characterization of the hydraulic properties of aquifers. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

According to this extension, the Markovian model corresponding to the conventional compartmental model is naturally generalized into the Markovian model with self-loops. By means of this generalized Markovian model, it is proved that the self-loop flow at each compartment in the extended compartmental model represents the storage at the compartment, which, together with the throughflow at the same compartment, constitutes the inclusive throughflow at that compartment. It is shown, on the basis of the maximum entropy principle, that the amount of storage (and thus, of inclusive throughflow) can be explicitly determined in terms of the turnover rate (thus, existing energy and throughflow) at each compartment. This makes it possible to generalize the flow analysis into the one which can analyze the cause-effect (causation) relationship among compartments in terms of not only throughflows but inclusive throughflows. Since the inclusive throughflow represents not only the throughflow but storage, and, in effect, the total energy existing at each compartment, the generalized flow analysis should reveal a more substantial aspect of the total interaction among subsystems (compartments). This account is applied to two significant issues in ecology: the issue of energy (or matter) cycling in ecosystems and the issue on direct influences versus indirect ones. A general measure of cycling efficiency of ecosystems with respect to both throughflow and inclusive throughflow is derived based on the generalized Markovian model, and studied in terms of natural ecosystem examples. The explicit expressions for the direct and indirect influences from one subsystem (compartment) to another are derived on the basis of the classification of paths into direct influence paths and indirect influence ones. It is shown that the relationship between direct and indirect influences is invariant for the throughflow and inclusive throughflow cases, and it is suggested that indirect influences tend to dominate over direct ones as the system connectance increases. Finally, a general method for evaluating the effects of storages on the cycling efficiency of ecosystems and the relationship between direct and indirect influences is developed, and these effects are studied analytically as well as in terms of natural ecosystem examples. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022835760

The generators are typically low voltage and large capacitance, disallowing loads requiring fast rise times. to be driven directly by the HPG. An opening switch must be provided to first in the closed state, transfer energy from the high current source to an inductive energy store and then open to commutate the current to the load. To charge an inductive energy store with large currents for long times (hundreds of milliseconds) indicates a massive switch with many low resistance contacts. At the same time the switch must commutate current to the load in a short time interval (tens of microseconds) indicating a light, fast-acting device. A two-stage opening switch addresses these two conflicting requirements. The first stage is a massive mechanical switch of coaxial geometry with many low resistance galvanic contacts, which commutates through a low inductance to an explosive element second stage. The second-stage switch is then interrupted explosively to provide the microsecond commutation. The design, manufacture, and testing of the two-stage opening switch were performed at the Center for Electromechanics at The University of Texas at Austin (CEM-UT) Taylor Hall facility in Austin, TX, using a compact homopolar generator (CHPG) and a five-turn coaxial, cryogenic inductor as the pulsed power supply. Initial testing included mechanical actuations and electrical measurements to verify fundamental operation and proper assembly. Testing continued with the CHPG charging the inductor through the switch statically (no commutation) to characterize the current carrying capability of the primary galvanic contacts. Next, tests to check the ability of the first stage to commutate to the second stage by sliding the primary contacts onto the armature insulator were conducted. The fourth phase of testing was a series of two-stage (double) commutations to a fixed load to characterize performance and timing of triggers, voltage hold-off capability, and fixed load commutation times. The fifth and last phase of testing involved the two-stage switch commutating current to a variable impedance (railgun) load. © 1986, IEEE",,"ELECTRIC COMMUTATION; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; ELECTRIC INDUCTORS, POWER TYPE - Energy Storage; HOMOPOLAR GENERATORS; INDUCTIVE ENERGY STORAGE; ELECTRIC SWITCHES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022810058

The historical development of ideas in this field is examined, the applications in the field of electric traction for rail vehicles are summarised and possible future developments are outlined. A systematic approach to power electronics, based upon the control of energy flow in switching convertors, is presented. This approach takes into consideration the different possible switching functions, the modulation functions, the realisation of these switching and modulation functions, the realisation of these switching and modulation functions by practical power semiconductor switches and the different classes of forced turn-off and commutation in power electronic circuits. Subsequently the concepts of topology and structure are defined, leading to different generic topologies for singular convertors. The structure of the five different families of composite convertors are examined, and practical examples are given. The systematic approach to machine electronics presented in the paper is based on a power flow model, using the unifying concept of rotating field theory. In combination with previously defined systematics for power electronics, this enables a systematic approach to the different classes of variable speed drives, based on power flow considerations. The historical developments of some power electronic and machine electronic ideas are traced, starting at the beginning of this century. Since the introduction of power semiconductor switches, applications of the older ideas have increased exponentially in all fields, making it impossible to cover all of them. As a consequence the development of power electronics and control of machines by electronic convertors in the field of electric traction is discussed in some detail, because this represents a record of important engineering achievements in this field. In conclusion, the present state and future trends of power and machine electronics are examined. This evaluation covers the development in the field of switching devices regarding the improvement of interfacing between signal and power electronics, the decrease of switching transition times, the reduction of device losses during conduction, and device developments for decreasing energy storage devices in convertors. The development of power electronic convertors for the reduction of the number of components in the topology and the development of convertors with a high frequency link are then covered, related to the expected development of switching devices. New directions of development regarding the electronic conditioning of the electromechanical energy conversion process concerning the elimination of undesirable effects and losses are important. The implementation of these trends by utilising the improved switching characteristics of power electronic switches and the information processing capability of microprocessors is discussed. This is then extended toward control aspects, where both these characteristics enable solutions not possible hitherto. Field control of AC machines imparts control characteristics equal to, or better than, those obtainable with DC machines to the systems, while the processing capability of microprocessors allows the configuration of adaptive machine electronic systems. Finally attention is given to the interfacing of power electronic and machine electronic systems to the power supply network. If the exponential growth of the installed capacity of equipment in the future is to be handled, active compensation of the distorted currents drawn from the supply by this equipment will have to be considered seriously. © 1986, The Institution of Electrical Engineers.

Melting experiments for uniform heating conditions were also carried out to provide baseline information. For a vertically oriented tube with heating confined to half the circumference, the amount of melting, relative to that for uniform heating, was reduced by 45% in the early stages of melting and by 35% in the later stages. When the containment tube was inclined to the vertical, the decreased melting associated with the nonuniform heating was recouped at inclinations large enough to cause the solid to be pressed by gravity against the heated portion of the tube wall. This direct contact mode of melting was achieved consistently at an inclination of 30° and intermittently at an inclination of 15°.

A failure maximum at low holding times (tH ≲ 40 ms for the 64 K DRAM) is followed by a minimum and then by a second, much more pronounced maximum. Failures up to the leading edge of the second maximum are determined by generation-dependent leakage currents (activation energy EA ≈ 0.55 eV). The position of the second maximum is characteristic of the substrate material and the temperature profile of the overall process. The failure mechanism is determined by diffusion and the temperature dependence of the leakage current is characterized by an activation energy of EA ≈ 1.1 eV. In the 64 K DRAM produced on float-zone silicon, the diffusion current maximum lies between 800–1000 ms at 85° C in a suitably designed device (e.g. potential sinks at the cell field edge). For DRAM devices produced on crucible-drawn silicon, the diffusion-dependent leakage rate increases super-proportionally with the oxygen content. The diffusion current maximum can therefore drop to about 50 ms when the initial oxygen content is high. © 1986 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"DATA STORAGE, SEMICONDUCTOR - Storage Devices; SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES, MOS; DRAM; DYNAMIC MOS RAM; FAILURE MAXIMUM; HOLDING TIME; WRITE AND READ CYCLES; DATA STORAGE, DIGITAL",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022807577

The system used a helium gas-driven injector and railgun launcher to accelerate 1- and 4-g polycarbonate projectiles intact up to 6.6 and 3.0 km/s, respectively. A 625 k] capacitor bank powered the railgun, and an adjustable inductor provided pulse shaping and peak current control. Operation in hard and soft vacuum was reliably achieved. Projectiles were accelerated without blowby of injector gas or plasma. The diagnostic system measured the projectile position and launch velocity, verified that the projectile was launched intact in the desired direction, and identified system components where improvements could enhance performance. Flash x-ray radiography measured velocity and verified that projectiles were intact. Post-launch projectile travel along the axis of the launcher without tilt was recorded with flash radiographs and impact impressions or holes in witness plates. The system performed as expected up to 4–5 km/s but below expectations at higher velocities. Our diagnostics suggest that the decreased performance was probably caused by the restriking of a second arc in the breech of the railgun, which shunted the current from the propulsive arc. Estimates of ablated launcher mass, drag forces, methods of eliminating restrike, and suggestions for improving the performance of railguns are discussed. ©1986 IEEE",,"CAPACITORS - Energy Storage; RADIOGRAPHY - X-ray; ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPULSION; RAILGUNS; ROCKETS AND MISSILES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022807454

Inc., San, Diego, CA, 92123, United States","CHECMATE, a high-energy rail gun user test facility, is currently operational at Maxwell Laboratories, Inc. in San Diego, California. Sponsored by the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO) and the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA), it utilizes Maxwell's newly-developed high energy density capacitor technology. It thus represents the first rail gun facility where the high reliability, fast turnaround, and versatility of capacitor banks are combined with the multimegajoule energy previously available only with explosive flux compressors or large homopolar generators. With this system, users may study rail gun component development (such as bore wall ablation and armature design), smart projectile survivability in a high “g” and high B environment, and issues of interior, exterior, and terminal ballistics at testing rates exceeding 1 shot/day. The capacitor-based approach allows the rail gun issues to be decoupled from problems of power source development. The rail gun's basic configuration is a 5 meter long, 5.1 cm square bore. Projectiles are injected at 500 to 700 m/s, using a high pressure helium gas gun. The rails and insulators are fabricated from copper alloy (MCZ), and epoxy/fiberglass composite (G-10), respectively. Current is fed to the rails at the breech from six independently-controlled 1 MJ capacitor modules, each employing a ~15 μH series inductor. The modules are triggered using Maxwell low-inductance rail gap-switches, which have an individual firing jitter of less than ±5 ns. Simultaneous firing of the six modules produces a peak gun current of up to 2 MA with a rise time of 220 μs. Sequential firing is also possible, if a broader current pulse of more nearly constant acceleration is required. Explosively-driven, metal-to-metal crowbar switches, adapted from NRL designs, [1] are used across the module output terminals to minimize voltage reversal on the capacitors, and to force the inductively-stored energy to couple efficiently to the rail gun load. Users may avail themselves of a full complement of rail gun and projectile diagnostics. Rail gun measurements include breech and muzzle voltage, breech current, and rail and arc B measurements. Projectile diagnostic tools include flash X-ray units, high speed framing cameras (10 frames/s and 106 frames/s), break wire and laser gate velocimeters, a ballistic pendulum, and a VISAR laser interferometry velocity measurement system. Data are collected on an integrated IBM XT computer/LeCroy digitizer-based system, augmented by a Nicolet 4-channel digital oscilloscope. Forty channels are available with sampling rates of up to 1 MHz. In initial tests (up to December 1985) more than 20 electrical shots were fired, with projectile masses ranging from 75 to 156 grams. Good agreement was obtained between predicted performance and experimental velocity data. A peak velocity of over 3.1 km/s was achieved for a 106 gram Lexan polycarbonate projectile, enabling a 2.5 cm steel witness plate to be penetrated. This represented a peak acceleration of 3.7 × 106 m/s2. Unlike systems where the projectile is electrically accelerated from rest, the high injection velocity resulted in minimal rail and insulator damage. A test series extending for many tens of shots is possible before rail refurbishment becomes necessary. © 1986, IEEE",,"CAPACITORS - Energy Storage; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; ROCKETS AND MISSILES - Launching; DEFENSE NUCLEAR AGENCY; ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPULSION; RAILGUNS; MILITARY EQUIPMENT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022806279

In aiming for maximum energy density in an HPG and inductor power supply for electromagnetic (EM) accelerators, the improved energy density (IED) machine uses its se1f-excited field coils as energy storage inductors and a lightweight graphite reinforced flywheel for inertial energy storage. Weighing approximately 5,000 kg, the design represents a twenty-fold increase in mass energy density over the state of the art and addresses the problem of trapping flux in the rotor during discharge by separating the voltage generating and energy storage functions.

Inertial energy is stored in a graphite-reinforced epoxy flywheel which will operate at a maximum tip speed of 1,100 m/s.

Venting modes include homogeneous‐vessel venting, all‐vacor venting, and all‐liquid venting; energy sources due to runaway chemical reactions and external heating are treated separately. The resulting equations have been shown via numerical examples to yield good agreement with detailed computer simulations, both in terms of temperature and pressure histories during venting and in vent size predictions. These equations are generally applicable over a wide range of overpressure situations and reduce to the correct limit at no overpressure. The relative merit of allowing for overpressure in various venting modes can be demonstrated using these equations. Because of their simple forms, requiring only pertinent physical property and thermal data, these equations readily lend themselves to quick but accurate vent sizing predictions.

In particular, the method was applied to rare-earth/transition-metal alloyed films for magneto-optic recording. The effects of film parameters (thermal conductivity, specific heat, absorption coefficient, and film thickness) and laser parameters (output power and pulse duration) on healing and cooling behavior were investigated extensively. The temperature profile of a film was sensitively dependent on these parameters. The results might be used to predict the recorded bit size and to optimize the laser parameters. For a given energy density of the laser beam, a large output power with a short pulse width was desirable for effective heating of a film. Heating by radial thermal diffusion became important with increasing thermal conductivity of a film. Therefore, to achieve high storage density, a film must have low thermal conductivity. © 1986.",,"LASER BEAMS - Effects; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Finite Difference Method; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; THERMAL ANALYSIS; MAGNETOOPTICAL DEVICES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022795343

We perform analyses of a water heater utilizing sand (sand mixed with iron filings) as heat-storage medium. The water heater is discussed in several possible modes of operation: continuous flow, intermittent flow, intermittent constant heat withdrawal, etc. A method is developed to study the system performance when some of the system parameters, such as water flow rate and heat-transfer coefficients, are functions of time. It is shown that, if no heat is withdrawn from the system during daytime, then the system can provide hot water during off-sunshine hours for household needs. The use of a night cover considerably increases the efficiency of the system in those modes of operations where no heat is withdrawn during daytime. When water is drawn only during evening hours, the efficiency increases by almost a factor of three. © 1986.",,"SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; SOLAR SAND WATER HEATER; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022790689

In this paper, data from a bed of glass spheres, bounded by horizontal, isothermal plates and with several gas and vapour mixtures, is reported. The enhancement in heat transfer rates forecast by the theory for large increases in gas to vapour molecular weight differences is shown by comparing water/air and water/Freon 12. The decrease in heat transfer rates forecast by the theory when the gas molecular weight is less than that of the vapour, is shown by comparing ethanol/air and ethanol/Freon 12. The validity of the similarity relationship is established by comparing these data plus a set from a different apparatus, with data for a water saturated bed of glass spheres.

The materials exist in the quaternary system CaOAl2O3SO3H2O and related chemicalsystems. The two classes of salt are typified by ettringite, a trisubstituted salt, and Friedel's salt, a monosubstituted salt, both of which are typically found in Portland cement concrete. The trisubstituted salts were studied to assess their potential for latent heat storage, utilizing a low-temperature dehydration reaction, and both classes were studied to assess their potential for sensible heat storage. The temperature at which dehydration begins, depending on composition of the phase, has been shown to range from 6 to 33°C, and the enthalpy change on dehydration has been shown to range from 0.3 to 0.8 kJ per g sample. Heat capacity values for all trisubstituted phases are approximately 1.3 J/(gK), and for the monosubstituted phases range from 1.0 to 1.2 J/(gK). Preliminary experiments indicate the dehydration of the trisubstituted salts is reversible, though additional tests are required. The thermal data demostrate that the trisubstituted salts have potential as latent heat storage materials and both classes of salts have potential as sensible heat storage materials; furthermore, it is noted that the materials may be contained in conventional Portland cement concrete, making them particularly attractive for thermal energy storage. © 1986.",,"CONCRETE; SALTS - Energy Storage; ETTRINGITE; FRIEDAL'S SALT; HEAT OF DEHYDRATION/SPECIFIC HEAT; LATENT HEAT STORAGE; SENSIBLE HEAT STORAGE; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022766294

The model consists of three differential equations describing the temperature, oxygen concentration and pressure variations in a coal bed. The model differs from previous treatments in that natural convection is taken into account as a mechanism for oxygen transport; this mechanism successfully explains the occurrence of spontaneous heating, without the need to assume the existence of a pressure gradient over the bed. The model is solved for the steady-state; these solutions give valuable insight into the nature of self heating. Coal dumps are classified as either safe, unsafe or conditionally safe. Safe coal dumps are either oxygen limited or heat transfer limited. The former are safe since all the oxygen transported into a dump of fine, reactive coal is consumed close to the surface where energy is easily dissipated. The latter are safe due to the low reaction rates of coarser, less reactive coals. The influence of coal particle size, voidage, coal reactivity and bed length is discussed, with the conclusion that particle size and voidage play a crucial role in determining the safety or otherwise of a coal dump. © 1986.","coal storage; combustion of coal; model compounds","CHEMICAL REACTIONS; COAL STORAGE; COMBUSTION - Mathematical Models; HEAT TRANSFER; COAL SELF HEATING; COAL STOCKPILES; SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION; COAL",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022766278

The strategies examined are: (1) natural ventilation, (2) balanced ventilation with an air-to-air heat exchanger, (3) exhaust ventilation without heat recovery, (4) exhaust ventilation connected to a heat pump to provide space heating, and (5) exhaust ventilation connected to a heat pump to heat domestic water. A modified Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) residential load model incorporating the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) infiltration model, and a modified TRNSYS domestic hot water model, are used to simulate the energy consumption associated with each strategy. The domestic hot water model is used to determine the amount of useful heat supplied by an exhaust ventilation heat pump as a function of hot water demand schedule and storage tank size. The simulations are made for cities with: (1) a moderate coastal climate, (2) a windy cold climate, and (3) a calm cold climate. They show that total energy consumption (space heat + domestic hot water) can be reduced by 9 to 21% by using mechanical ventilation systems with heat recovery. These savings, compared with energy savings of 18 to 21% achieved by superinsulating the same houses, indicate that the choice of ventilation strategy can have a significant effect on energy consumption. The comparisons also show that for the same effective ventilation rate, houses with mechanical ventilation systems (especially those with exhaust fans) have uniform ventilation and therefore better indoor air quality. © 1986.","air-to-air heat exchanger; computer simulation; domestic water heating; exhaust air heat pump; heat recovery; mechanical ventilation; space heating","AIR POLLUTION - Indoor; BUILDINGS - Energy Utilization; VENTILATION STRATEGIES; HOUSES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022764832

Detailed analytical and numerical analyses have been conducted to study the fundamental aspects of the problem for simple geometries. The detailed analyses suggest that the study of thermal performance of massive structural materials in buildings can be divided into two distinct classes. These two classes correspond to internal partition walls, characterized by similar air temperature profiles on the two sides, and external envelope walls, characterized by dissimilar air temperature profiles at the two surfaces. For massive interior walls, a thermal energy storage effectiveness parameter has been defined in terms of the changes in the diurnal heat storage capacity of the wall with respect to variations in convection coefficients. The interior wall effectiveness has been calculated for a wide range of convection coefficients and for both simple sinusoidal and more complex and realistic inside air temperature profiles; in all cases upper and lower bounds have been obtained. Results indicate that the effectiveness of interior massive walls is quite sensitive to the variations in convection coefficients commonly occuring in buildings. Since the convection coefficients at interior building surfaces vary quite widely within this range, this work suggests that for some climates and building constructions, improved characterization of convection coefficients is needed to permit reliable calculation of the energy requirements of buildings incorporating large amounts of thermal mass. © 1986.",,"BUILDING MATERIALS - Thermal Properties; HEAT TRANSFER - Convection; CONVECTION COEFFICIENTS; INTERIOR PARTITION WALLS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022764191

Nevertheless, the gain in generated electricity by minor actinide transmutation in a fast breeder reactor can compensate for the costs of their recovery and make-up into fuel elements. Different recycling options of minor actinides are discussed: transmutation in liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBRs) is possible as long as plutonium is not recycled in light water reactors (LWRs). In this case a minor actinide burner with fuel of different composition has to be introduced. The development of appropriate minor actinide fuels and their properties are described. The irradiation experiments underway or planned are summarized. A review of minor actinide partitioning from the PUREX waste stream is given. From the present constraints of LMFBR technology a reduction of the long-term α-radiological risk by a factor of 200 is deduced relative to that from the direct storage of spent LWR fuel.

We report on experiments with this type of switch in a 4-kV dc circuit. A wire-ion-plasma (WIP) electron-beam (e-beam) gun is used to irradiate and sustain a switch discharge with a 100-cm2 cross-sectional area in 1 atm of N2 or CH4. Interruption of 8-10-μs pulses of up to 1.9 kA, and of 100-μs pulses of 150 A has been demonstrated in methane, and interruption against higher recovery voltages (11 kV) has been performed at 1.2 kA by adding series inductance to the circuit. These values represent power supply limitations rather than limitations of the switch itself. A comparison of the measured discharge characteristics with theoretical predictions shows that the measured switch conductivities are higher than the predicted values for given e-beam current values. A qualitative explanation for this observation is offered by considering the effects of electron reflection from the discharge anode and of nonlinear paths for the beam electrons across the discharge gap. We conclude that the switching performance of the e-beam controlled discharge switch corresponds to its design parameters, and that for a given switch size a lower voltage drop during the on time can be expected compared with the voltage drop predicted by previously published theory.

If taken incorrectly or in excess, these vitamins may be a potential health hazard. Vitamins are essential nutrients which, in combination with other nutrients (e.g., fats, carbohydrates and proteins), foster normal metabolism. Vitamins also interact with each other. For example, vitamin C participates in the metabolism of folic acid, and vitamin E facilitates the absorption and storage of vitamin A. Because the biological functions of vitamins are interrelated, a diet poor in vitamins, carbohydrates, fats and proteins is not necessarily enhanced by vitamin supplementation. When vitamins are taken in excess of the Recommended Dietary Allowances or the individual’s needs, the vitamins no longer function as vitamins but instead act as drugs, with such pharmacological effects as clinical toxicities and the abnormal utilization of vitamins. There are six categories that require vitamin supplements and, in some cases, megadoses. These will be discussed in detail. In addition, a brief table showing the Recommended Dietary Allowances will be given which the nurse practitioner can use in assessing nutritional needs of the client so that necessary adjustments can be made.

Diets fed in Exp. 1 were: 1, NC-soybean meal formulated at .78% lysine (dry matter basis); 2, HLC-soybean meal containing the same amount of corn as diet 1 (.87% lysine); 3, HLC-soybean meal with the same lysine level as diet 1. In Exp. 1, dry matter, energy and N digestibilities were not different between corn types or lysine levels (P greater than .16).

Also, replacing NC with HLC on an equal-weight basis did not affect energy and N digestibility. In Exp. 2 six diets balanced on an isonitrogenous and dry-matter basis were tested. Normal corn and HLC diets, which had been stored by three different methods (D, HM and RC) were arranged in a 2 X 3 factorial plan. There were no differences between corn types in dry matter, energy and N digestibilities. The HM and RC treatments had larger particle sizes than the dry corn diets.

In solidification of a binary mixture, the melting temperature changes due to the variation of the mixing ratio are caused by the segregation. Two solidification models are proposed for a theoretical analysis. In the first model, the solidification increases in the direction of the heat flow. In the other, it is assumed that the segregation grows perpendicularly to the heat flow, which corresponds to a dendritic solidification. The former model can be well applied in the low mixing ratio of p-C6H4Cl2 and the latter can be used in the high mixing ratio. The temperature profile also changes in accordance with the initial mixing ratio of the two materials; however, the variation of the transfered heat from outside with time is quite similar to that of pure material.

First, the lower order linear model formulated by the author is evaluated using a simulator which was developed considering conservations of mass, momentum and energy. Secondly, considering small perturbations of state variables, the optimal regulator problem is formulated. Finally, a “suboptimal” feedback control law is proposed so as to make possible treatment of cases of large changes of state variables, in which it is necessary to consider some constraints. Then improvements in stability and response during any transient state due to this control law are confirmed by simulations.

Where channel morphology is modified or structural features are added, stream dynamics and energy dissipation need to be considered. Unit stream power, defined here as the time‐rate loss of potential energy per unit mass of water, can be reduced by adding stream obstructions, increasing channel sinuosity, or increasing flow resistance with large roughness elements such as woody root systems, logs, boulders, or bedrock. Notable morphological features of small streams are pools, riffles, bed material, and channel banks. Pools, which vary in size, shape, and causative factors, are important rearing habitat for fish. Riffles represent storage locations for bed material and are generally utilized for spawning. The particle sizes and distributions of bed material influence channel characteristics, bedload transport, food supplies for fish, spawning conditions, cover, and rearing habitat. Riparian vegetation helps stabilize channel banks and contributes in various ways to fish productivity. Understanding each stream feature individually and in relation to all others is essential for proper stream management. Although engineered structures for modifying habitat may alter stream characteristics, channel morphology must ultimately be matched to the hydraulic, geologic, and (especially) vegetative constraints of a particular location.

To solve these problems, a system has been designed that is conservative, requires little energy, and can be applied to a wide variety of fluid management challenges. Three specific model problems have directed design efforts: liquid-gas degassification, solid-liquid-gas separation, and algae growth, separation and harvesting. The design incorporates a centrifical approach using a divergent, truncated-cone-shaped spinning separation chamber coupled with density-dependent valving. Degassification of fluids and separation of multiphased media is achieved while creating the pumping pressures needed to move the separated media to desired storage areas. The testing of the design will be two-phased: preflight and flight. Preflight testing will be conducted in a 1-g environment to trouble shoot problems and assure orbital success. Actual flight testing, accomplished in CU's Getaway Special canister on board the shuttle in January 1986, will focus on operations of those portions of the system which cannot be tested in a 1-g environment. Also, the overall system operation will be evaluated. Data acquisition in both phases will be via photography and pressure measurements. Upon experimental completion, data should document the overall viability of fluids management by centrifugation in a microgravity environment. © 1986.",,"GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS; LIQUIDS - Degassing; SPACE FLIGHT - Weightlessness; ALGAE GROWTH; LIQUID-GAS DEGASIFICATION; SOLID-LIQUID-GAS SEPARATION; FLUIDS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022731387

Overall system performance may be significantly affected by the storage temperature distribution. Most current stratification models utilize a finite difference scheme for solution to the general equations. An analytic method to determine the temperature distribution has been derived for liquid storage within a solar system. In liquid storage, it is assumed incoming fluid enters at the location with the temperature closest to its own. Hence, the solution requires the possibility of a region within storage where there is no forced flow. In addition, ther may be collector loop flow, load loop flow, or both concurrently. Each of these cases has different boundary conditions, and each must be solved separately. Comparisons of the resulting calculations with system data for the Colorado State University Solar House I show good agreement.

This effort demonstrates the feasibility of using molten salt as the primary medium for energy transfer from a central tower solar receiver through thermal storage to a steam generator. A conventional steam turbine converts the energy by means of the electric generator for delivery of electrical power to the utility grid. The Molten Salt Electric Experiment (MSEE) uses a 5 megawatt thermal (5 MWt) solar receiver, which was successfully tested in 1980, to produce 566° C (1,050° F) liquid sodium nitrate-potassium nitrate (60/40) from a 310° C (590° F) feed supply at the rate of 43,900 kg/h (97,000 lbs/hr). (MWt, = electrical equivalent of Btu/hr of thermal energy absorbed by a soiar receiver.) The hot molten salt then flows into a storage subsystem which was tested successfully in 1981. Checkout of the integrated molten salt system has been underway since the later part of 1983.

The magnetic properties of these two types of films showed different patterns of dependence with respect to the film thickness. The Co-Ni-Re-P alloy film gave a higher He(⊥) (perpendicular coercivity) in regions where it was very thin; on the other hand, the Co-Ni-Re-Mn-P alloy film displayed a lower He(⊥) at the initial film thickness. The composition was observed with AES measurements to be nearly independent of film thickness. The clear columnar structure of both types of films was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and especially by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. Only the reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) patterns for both types of film clearly showed different dependence patterns with respect to the film thickness. The Co-Ni-Re-P film displayed a very highly c-axis oriented structure even at the initial thin film stage. On the other hand, the Co-Ni-Re-Mn-P film showed a dependence of the degree of c-axis orientation on the film thickness, which increased with film thickness. The differences in magnetic properties as a function of thickness were assumed to be due to the degrees of c-axis orientation and change in magnetic domain structure. © 1986, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Hence, battery mass may be decreased by increasing the energy efficiency of the drive system, even though this may only be done at the expense of increasing the mass of the drive system. The combined mass of the battery and drive system may thus be minimised for a given operating duty and range. The theory which is presented allows the calculation of an optimum drive system design sensitivity of allowable mass increase per 1 % efficiency increase. This sensitivity depends on the battery mass and operating duty of the vehicle and for a typical lead-acid battery-powered urban delivery van its value may be as much as 25 kg/1%, whereas for batteries with a lower mass the figure decreases in proportion to the battery mass.

This effect was found to differ greatly for the two alloy systems. In the case of Co-Ni-Re-Mn-P alloy films, the perpendicular anisotropy magnetic field (Hk) and the perpendicular coercivity Hc(⊥)decreased with decreasing film thickness, and suitable magnetic properties could not be maintained for films thinner than 0, 2 μm. However, in the case of Co-Ni-Re-P alloy films, the values of HkHc(⊥), and perpendicular anisotropy energy (Ku) increased with decreasing film thickness, and magnetic properties suitable for perpendicular recording were obtained in the thinner films. The limiting recording density of D50 increased with decreasing film thickness, and D50 = 60 kFRPI was observed for a disk with a 0.05 pm thick Co-Ni-Re-P alloy film in combination with a ring head. The relationship between recording current and reproduced voltage for perpendicular recording was also measured in the thin medium thickness range for Co-Ni-Re-P alloy films, and the typical behavior for perpendicular magnetic recording was confirmed in the thinner 0.05 μm film thickness. It is suggested that electroless Co-Ni-Re-Mn-P alloys are suitable for single-layer media and that Co-Ni-Re-P alloys are suitable for composite anisotropy media. © 1986, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The total incident energy from a conventional Al target x-ray source was established to simulate lithography exposures using the relatively insensitive x-ray resists presently considered for storage ring x-ray lithography. A radiation threshold damage level to the particular MOSFET devices was estimated by controlling the incident x-ray flux with radiation blocking layers of various thicknesses. From the data, the minimum x-ray resist sensitivity required to expose the MOSFET devices without detrimental effects was estimated. For applications that require resists with lower sensitivity than the estimated minimum value, a multilayer resist structure is proposed to reduce the radiation damage below the threshold value. © 1986, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The major advantage of the surface‐modified plasma treated powders over the bulk‐modified powders used previously is the retention of essentially all of the pristine polymer heat of fusion in the surface‐modified materials.

By analyzing various aspects of water temperature, i.e. the processes of its transfer, transformation and storage within the snow layer, mathematical models of the water-temperature flow and the temperature change have been set up. From these models, we found that the percolation depth of melt-water on the snow surface in the percolation zone of Glacier No. 1, Urumqi River, is 7.4 m over the entire annual ablation period. In addition, from the laws of thermodynamics, the paper calculates the amount of melt-water which re-freezes within the snow layer, and estimates the total ablation on the surface of the percolation zone of Glacier No.1, located in the source region of the Urumqi River, Tian Shan, China.

Such enzymes have been identified in sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle tissues and in non-muscle cells in both surface membranes and endoplasmic-reticulum-like intracellular membrane complexes. In a previous study using membrane fractionation by density-gradient and free-flow electrophoresis, we reported that the intracellular membranes of human blood platelets were a major storage site for Ca2+ and involved in maintaining low cytosol [Ca2+] in the unactivated cell. In the present report we demonstrated that the intracellular membranes also exhibit a high-affinity Ca2+-ATPase which appears to be kinetically associated with the Ca2+-sequestering process. We found that both the surface membrane and the intracellular membrane exhibited a basal Mg2+-ATPase activity, but Ca2+ activation of this enzyme was confined only to the intracellular membrane. Use of Ca2+-EGTA buffers to control the extravesicle [Ca2+] allowed a direct comparison of the Ca2+-ATPase and the Ca2+-uptake process over a Ca2+ range of 0.01 μM to 1.0 mM, and it was found that both properties were maximally expressed in the range of external [Ca2+] 1-50 μM, with concentrations &gt; 100 μM showing substantial inhibition. Double-reciprocal plots for the Ca2+-ATPase activity and Ca2+ uptake gave apparent K(m) values for Ca2+ of 0.15 and 0.13 μM respectively. However, similar plots for ATP with the enzyme revealed a discontinuity (two affinity sites, with K(m) 20 and 145 μM), whereas plots for the Ca2+ uptake gave a single K(m) value for Ca2+, 1.1 μM. Phosphorylation studies during Ca2+ uptake using [γ-32P]ATP revealed two components of 90 and 95 kDa phosphorylated at extravesicle [Ca2+] of 3 μM. The Ca2+-ATPase activity, Ca2+ uptake and phosphorylation were all almost completely inhibited in the presence of 500 μM-Ca2+. Similar studies using mixed membranes revealed four other phosphoproteins (50, 40, 20 and 18 kDa) formed in addition to the 90 and 95 kDa components. The findings are discussed in the context of platelet Ca2+ mobilization for function and the mechanisms whereby Ca2+ homoeostasis is controlled in the unactivated cell.",,"adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); blood and hemopoietic system; cytochemistry; cytology; human; human cell; membrane; priority journal; thrombocyte membrane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022651902

Concomitantly, they show different dissolution patterns and decreased chemical stability. The following observations suggest that this phenomenon takes place via the gaseous phase, induced by the vapor pressure of the medicinals themselves. (1) Subliming crystals such as naphthalene become amorphous immediately in mixtures with adsorbents. (2) The rate of change of medicinals to the amorphous state is accelerated under reduced pressure in these systems.

Fiffeen infants were studied in a randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial in which each infant was fed each of two formulas, which were of equal gross energy and protein content but differed in fat composition. The high medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) formula contained medium- and long-chain triglycerides in a weight/weight ratio of 46:54; In the low MCT formula the ratio was 4:96. The hypothesis tested was that under conditions of equal gross energy intake the two diets would differ in their digestible and metabolizable energy contents and would produce differences in the infants' rates of energy expenditure and energy storage. Gross energy intakes averaged 562 and 555 kJ/kg/day (134 and 133 kcal/kg/day) with the high and low MCT formulas, respectively. With each diet, coefficients of energy digestibility (0.93) and metabolizability (0.91) were identical; the rates of energy expenditure were 262 (high MCT) and 265 (low MCT) kJ/kg/day (63 kcal/kg/day for both diets), and of energy storage were 246 (high MCT) and 239 (low MCT) kJ/kg/day (59 and 57 kcal/day). These differences were not significant. There were also no significant differences between the two diets in coefficients of nitrogen retention (mean 0.70) or in rate of weight gain (mean 21.5 gm/kg/day). The use of high MCT content in infant formula neither provided a nutritional advantage in energy digestibility or metabolizability nor resulted in an increased rate of energy expenditure or of energy storage. © 1986 The C.

Livers were preserved by either (i) cold storage (CS) in Collins' solution or (ii) continuous perfusion (P) with a perfusate, containing hydroxyethyl starch, sodium gluconate. adenosine, and potassium phosphate, recently developed in our laboratory. Livers were cold stored for 6 to 8, 24. or 48 hr, and perfused for 24 or 72 hr. Tissue slices of preserved livers were incubated at 30 °C and analyzed for volume control, electrolyte-pump activity (K and Na). and adenine nucleotide concentration. Also, mitochondria were isolated after preservation to quantify respiratory activity. Slice functions of livers preserved for short periods (6 to 8 hr by CS and 24 hr by P) were similar to those for control livers. After normothermic incubation, the mean (±SD) water content of tissue (expressed per unit dry mass of tissue) was 2.3 ± 0.3 kg/kg for control, 2.6 ± 0.4 kg/kg for 6- to 8-hr CS, and 2.5 ± 0.5 kg/kg for 24-hr P. Longer periods of preservation resulted in cell swelling, and water content was 3.3 ± 0.4 kg/kg for 24- to 48-hr CS and 2.8 ± 0.3 kg/kg for 72-hr P. The mean (± SD) K Na ratio was nearly normal for livers preserved for short periods: 3.7 ± 0.5 for control, 4.1 ± 0.2 for 6- to 8-hr CS, and 3.3 ± 0.4 for 24-hr P. Longer periods of preservation resulted in the loss of ion-pump activity and K Na ratios of 2.7 ± 0.2 for 24- to 48-hr CS and 1.7 ± 0.2 for 72-hr P. Energy metablism (ATP synthesis and mitochondrial activity) was well-maintained under most preservation conditons and did not appear to explain the loss of ion-pump activity. The metabolic function of tissue slices is better maintained in livers perfused for 24 hr than in livers cold stored for 24 hr. Perfusion, rather than cold storage, may therefore be necessary to maintain optimal function when livers are hypothermically preserved for 24 hr or more. © 1986.",,"animal cell; cryopreservation; dog; hypothermia; liver; liver function; liver mitochondrion; liver perfusion; liver preservation; liver transplantation; nonhuman; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Cold; Dogs; In Vitro; Kinetics; Liver; Mitochondria, Liver; Na(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase; Perfusion; Preservation, Biological; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022617172

Further advantages of composite springs accrue from the ability to design and fabricate a spring leaf having continuously variable width and/or thickness along its length. Such design features will lead to new suspension arrangements in which the composite leaf spring will serve multiple functions thereby providing part consolidation and simplification of the suspension system.

This paper presents a detailed theoretical comparison between three different analytical models proposed to simulate the thermal behavior of solar ponds. These models are slightly modified to represent the gel pond configuration. For experimental comparison, a gel pond constructed at the University of New Mexico, which has been in operation for several years, has been used as the reference pond. The gel pond differs from conventional salt-gradient ponds in that the nonconvective insulating layer is replaced by a transparent polymer gel. Numerical computations have been made to optimize the geometric and operational parameters of the pond using the three different models. The optimum thickness of the nonconvective layer (gel) and the thin upper convective layer (fresh water) and their effects on pond performance at a given ambient temperature, isolation and storage temperature have been calculated using all the models. The three models have also been used to calculate the absorptivity- transmissivity product (ατ), a parameter which represents the transparency of the nonconvective and the upper convective layers combined together. These calculated values have been compared with experimental values as measured through an actual gel layer to test the accuracy of the different models as applied to the gel pond. The results show that, under the same temperature difference between the storage zone and the ambient (20°C) and a yearly average insolation of 250 W/m2, the model proposed by Wang and Akbarzadeh predicts an efficiency of approx. 32% as compared to the high values of 37.2 and 39% predicted by the Kooi model and Kaushik and Bansal model, respectively. Under the same conditions, the optimum gel thicknesses predicted by the three models are 62, 55, and 75 cm, respectively. © 1986.","Gel pond; Heat extraction; Optimum flow rate; Optimum gel thickness; Pond performance; Solar pond; Thermal efficiency","HEAT TRANSFER; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; ANALYTICAL MODELS; GEL THICKNESS; HEAT EXTRACTION; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022582948

Several models have been proposed to simulate the absorption of radiation in solar ponds, however, it is shown in this work that experimental data published by many authors militate in favour of representing this absorption simply by a single exponential. Pond performance is strongly influenced by the absorption characteristics. The mean pond temperature of the storage zone and the pond efficiency drop considerably as the turbidity of the water increases. The high values of the extinction coefficient result also in damping the pond temperature fluctuations and increase its time lag with respect to the insolation. The importance of using accurate in-site measured absorption data for pond design and performance prediction is emphasized. © 1986.","Extinction coefficient; Radiation absorption; Solar ponds","HEAT TRANSFER; SOLAR ENERGY; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION; RADIATION ABSORPTION EFFECT; SALT-GRADIENT; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022581160

The model covers through-flow conditions for charging or discharging the thermal storage tank and conduction and turbulent mixing within the water. It was demonstrated that careful design of the algorithm and choice of the time-step are necessary to avoid computational errors, which create apparent mixing in the through-flow calculation. In order to handle variable flow rates, a 'conceptual buffer-tank' algorithm was developed which makes the procedure flexible and useful. Turbulent mixing across the thermocline is simulated through thermal eddy conductivity factors which have been determined from published experimental data. The complete computational model is simple and efficient enough to interface with a larger program simulating an entire air-conditioning system, which includes chillers, building loads, weather, etc. At the same time, the model reproduces hydraulic model test data better than a recent one-dimensional model found in the literature. © 1986.",,"AIR CONDITIONING - Solar Energy Systems; HEAT TRANSFER; HEATING - Solar; TANKS - Heating; HEAT STORAGE; TEMPERATURE PROFILE; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022576205

The control diet was a liquid diet with the following caloric composition: 14% protein, 28% fat, and 58% carbohydrate. The experimental diet was the same as the control diet except for the partial substitution of carbohydrate content with pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone. Rats receiving the experimental diet gained less weight than rats receiving the control diet. This reduction in body weight appeared to be largely the result of inhibition of lipid accumulation. The experimental diet reduced body fat content by 32% without any significant effect on either protein or water content. Rats receiving the experimental diet did not have increased loss of calories in the stool, but had greater rates of heat production and energy expenditure, which was accompanied by an elevated plasma level of thyroxine. Furthermore, rats receiving the experimental diet had a smaller rate of lipid synthesis in their adipose tissue, and a reduced plasma insulin level. The data suggest that inhibition of gain in weight with the addition of pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone to the diet is the result of an increased loss of calories as heat at the expense of storage as lipid. © 1986.",,"dihydroxyacetone; lipid; pyruvic acid; animal experiment; diet; digestive system; drug efficacy; energy expenditure; feces; nonhuman; obesity; oral drug administration; priority journal; rat; Administration, Oral; Animal; Blood Chemical Analysis; Body Composition; Body Weight; Dihydroxyacetone; Energy Metabolism; Feces; Lipids; Male; Mathematics; Pyruvates; Pyruvic Acid; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Trioses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022575657

These facilities incorporate features which allow the user to increase his operational flexibility with respect to the local utility. These facilities can be: local generation, local dependent generation, local energy storage facility, and shiftable load schedule. The only true control the utility has over the actual operation of such facilities is through the judicious selection of the energy prices proposed to such users both for the sale and purchase of energy. It is likely that most utilities will react to this novel user-utility relationship by implementing time-varying energy prices to better reflect their own production costs. These prices are often referred to as spot prices and are commonly used in Europe. A key issue is then the simulation of the various SPPF loads under various spot pricing policies and as they would be seen from the utility's point of view.

The system's capacity makes it possible for large volumes to go into and out of the storage system. The size of the flows has become larger since 1978 as a result of the increased uncertainty about the security of supply (1979-81), the decline in demand (1982-1985), and changes in the relations between exporting country governments and oil companies.

The anomalous cathodic photocurrent, as observed by Sprünken et al. (Faraday Disc. Chem. Soc. 70, 55-60) with hydrogenated n-TiO2 is not a direct photoresponse; rather the enhancement of the cathodic current under illumination is due to electrochemical reduction of the species produced in the anodic half under illumination. Chopped light is used for illuminating the SC and the oscillating photocurrent is measured in a storage oscilloscope at varying potentials. More reliable values of Vfb can be obtained by illuminating the SC with high frequency chopped light during the potential scan, with a rate much slower than the chopping frequency, and recording the current after amplification in an oscilloscope in AC mode, so as to block the slowly changing electrochemical dark current and to increase the photocurrent to dark current ratio (e.g. chopping frequency 100 Hz, scan rate 65 m V s-1). Cathodic photoresponse is observed with TiO2 prepared by thermal oxidation of Ti without further thermal hydrogenation or doping. Vfb of this is different from that of the former one.

N-acetyl-L-methionine, was given (60 mg/kg) as a Vitamin B6 challenge on day 28 of each period, and 24-h urinary 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) and methionine metabolites were determined before and after the challenge. Basal 4-PA excretion was significantly lower (p ≤ 0.05) in T than in S. In T, postmethionine 4-PA was greater than basal, while in S, postmethionine 4-PA was lower. Compared with prechallenge, postchallenge metabolites decreased in T and increased in S.

If either of these aspects becomes dominant the results may be detrimental to the acceptance and usefulness of the model. When the gap between theory and practice is effectively bridged, the chances for success of the model are greatly enhanced. Often the client (end user) is treated as a resource outside the scope of the problem solution. This isolation of the client from the solution technique makes it difficult for him to understand, defend, and implement the answers produced by the model. Making the client an integral part of linking the physical problem to the model solution, raises his or her understanding and participation level to where the modeler and client interact more productively. This gap is being bridged at Armco, specifically in the forecasting of energy supply and demand. The method developed borrows an important concept from the area of Artificial Intelligence, in that the storage and manipulation of the energy system ""knowledge"" has been separated from the actual model program code. Using a VAX 11/780 and an ""off the shelf"" query language the energy engineer can manipulate the variables which define the energy systems. Software has been developed to retrieve information from the knowledge base. Using this information, this software creates source code and manual data input programs for a complete model package.

Twenty-four healthy black Kenyan children, mean age 29 (sd 19) months, were studied over a 24 h period. Energy expenditure (EE) was determined using a ventilated-hood indirect calorimeter; measuring oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Metabolizable energy intake was measured in twenty children. Anthropometric measurements were used to estimate surface area and lean body-weight. 2. The mean daily intake of metabolizable energy was 338•4 (se 28•4) k J/kg; 70% of gross dietary energy being provided by carbohydrate. The level of postprandial EE was significantly (P < 0•05) higher than the resting level (12•6 (se 0•47)and 11•38 (se 0•37)k J/kg per h respectively) while the level of the postprandial respiratory quotient (RQ) was similar to the resting level (0•94 (se 0•02) and 0•98 (se 0•03respectively). In 33% of total observations of the resting RQ the value was more than 1•0. These findings suggest that short-term fat storage may be a normal feature of metabolism in children, and also that the energy cost of (postprandial) fat synthesis is increased by a high-carbohydrate diet. 3. Values for the resting metabolic rate and various estimators of body size were compared using regression analysis. It was evident that, in these young children with considerable variation in body composition, body-weight remained a satisfactory metabolic-size estimator. © 1986, The Nutrition Society.

Aortic bulb volume distensibility was found to be much greater than that of the descending thoracic aorta or of an equivalent aortic segment of terrestrial mammals. The consequences were that the total potential energy and volume that may be stored within the aortic bulb is very large, with a capacity for storage of the stroke work of more than two normal heart beats and a volume of more than three times normal stroke volume. The aortic bulb has an average radius and wall thickness twice that of the descending aorta, but at any level of distension the wall stress (g/cm2) is the same throughout. The static mechanical properties of aortic strips from the bulb and descending thoracic aortas were not markedly different, so that the differences in the pressure-volume relationships are explained by differences in geometry of the two sections.

A constant air volume system is chosen for its operational simplicity. Representative winter hourly weather data are used to calculate the heating load. The building behavior is modeled in detail with dynamic wall and room temperatures which are linked to the heat input. The heat losses are found to be primarily (70-75%) due to storage in the walls for two different values of wall heat capacity and for two design temperatures (19° and 20°C). The paper deals with the operational details, seasonal performance and economics of the system. Multivariate optimization is carried out using the Simplex method. Optimum collector area, store volume and air flow rate of 30 m2, 2-3 m3 and 0.5 kg s-1, respectively, are not affected by economic predictions. A comparison of this system with one which omits the rock bed store and uses only the building material as storage is also made. Results show that for the higher design temperaturre of 20°C, the rock bed store improves system performance, but the same solar fraction can be achieved by increasing the collector area from 30 to 50 m2 in the system without active storage. For the lower design temperature of 19°C the improvement in performance made by the addition of the rock bed store is small, and can be obtained by increasing the collector area from 30 to 40 m2, obviating the need for the store system. In buildings with a high heat capacity, operated during daytime only, the no-active-store system is recommended for its ease of operation and suitability for retrofitting. © 1986.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; OFFICE BUILDINGS - Air Conditioning; CONSTANT AIR VOLUME (CAV); ROCK BED STORE; SOLAR AIR HEATING; THERMAL CAPACITY; WALL HEAT CAPACITY; AIR CONDITIONING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022538948

For gel time determinations a new method was developed, the gel time being then difined as the cure time when the relaxation time τ = 3 s at a frequency of 0.1 Hz was achieved. The dynamic storage modulus G′, the dynamic viscosity η´ and the relaxation time τ have been determined as functions of curing time. The effects of cure temperature and of curing agent concentration on G′, η′, and τ were studied. The influence of cure temperature on the gel time and on the visco‐elastic properties determined at 18ks (5 h) of curing was discussed. Based on the experimental results, it was concluded that curing at higher temperature led to the more crosslinked polymer. Activation energy values for the gel time were also determined and compared with the values for polyurethanes and polyurethaneureas reported elsewhere. A relationship between the relaxation time and the effect of frequency on modulus G′ was presented, and it appeared to be independent of cure temperature, curing agent concentration, and curing time, being then presumably a useful method for comparative studies of viscoelastic behavior of different materials in curing process.

We conducted dynamic loading tests on single rigored muscle cells over the physiological range of sarcomere lengths. These tests enabled us to calculate the energy stored in reversible deformations or dissipated in the cell during each cycle of oscillation. Our findings show that these cells are capable of storing ~0.5 J.kg-1 of elastic energy during the last 50 ms of passive extension in vivo by agonists and before their own active contraction. Possible sites of this energy storage are HMM subunit 2, the proximal portion of HMM subunit 1, and parallel structures. However, energy storage increases monotonically as myofilament overlap decreases in the physiological range. This negative correlation suggests that HMM subunits are not the primary sites of elastic energy storage. Our electron-microscopic observations show that collagen fibrils at the cell's surface become oriented parallel to the cell's long axis over the range of sarcomere lengths where energy storage increases.

By virtue of this control ability, SMES will be applicable for a power system stabilyzer. A GTO converter which mainly consists of six GTO's was developed and tested. In this GTO converter, the energy stored in leakage inductances of the transformer is handled by voltage clipper circuit. Then, by using two sets of these GTO converters, we carried out some experiments of simultaneous active and reactive power control of SMES.

The analysis is performed for several values of the non-fundamental losses. By using transport properties approximately matching those of the best materials presently available, we derive ""upper limit"" estimates of efficiencies achievable with one- and two-photon PECs. A one-photon PEC is found to have an ""upper limit"" efficiency of approx. 7% (AM 1.2 solar energy to chemical potential energy stored as H2). For two-photon configurations the ""upper limit"" for a p-n PEC is 10%, while for a tandem PEC it is approx. 18%. The tandem cell configuration is the least sensitive to the choice of materials parameters and transport losses and yields the highest efficiencies. The one-photon PEC is most sensitive to these choices and yields the lowest efficiencies. The relative merits of three- and four-photon arrangements are discussed in the light of these results, and compared with photovoltaics impedance matched to electrolysis cells. The relatively poor performance of unbiased PECs compared to the photovoltaic-electrolysis cell combination is largely a consequence of lack of proper impedance matching in the former, a problem shared to some degree by all photochemical energy storage systems. © 1986.",,"MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES; WATER - Electrolysis; FREE ENERGY; ONE-PHOTON PEC; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELL (PEC); TANDEM PEC; TWO-PHOTON PEC; SOLAR CELLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022506567

Comparison was made between aerobic storage (normal air exposure) and anaerobic storage (exposure to nitrogen gas). The air‐exposed units showed a strong increase in pO2 and oxygen saturation as a result of oxygen penetration into the bags from outside. This resulted in a decrease in ATP and adenylate energy charge, a slower metabolization of adenine and hypoxanthine to AMP and IMP, respectively, and a faster decrease in red cell fluidity. To explain the findings it is concluded that aerobic storage causes an increased need of high‐energy phosphate groups, possibly used for replacement of the phospholipid membrane bilayer or in repair of phosphate bonds in the cytoskeleton. It is further proposed that a slight formation of hydrogen peroxide from free oxygen radicals moderately increases the oxidation of reduced (GSH) to oxidized (GSSG) glutathione and slightly enhances the need for reduced nicotinamide‐adenine dinucleotides mainly provided by increased flux through the pentose phosphate shunt. © 1986 S.

These had important effects upon the mineralised nitrogen components of the excreta. This nitrogen could be conserved as ammoniacal nitrogen, lost via ammonia stripping, oxidised to nitrate and conserved, or lost via denitrification.

The energy requirement for aerobic treatment was minimal when the dissolved oxygen level was as low as possible and still consistent with adequate treatment. Conservation of the mineralised nitrogen as nitrate may prevent odour regeneration subsequent to treatment, but a dissolved oxygen level &gt; 15% of saturation was required. In addition, the oxygen requirement for nitrification was equivalent to about 30-80% of the heterotrophic oxygen demand. Thus, with minimal aeration the efficiency was maximised, the extra oxygen demand for nitrification prevented and the nitrogen conserved as ammonia, but odour regeneration could be fairly rapid during storage. © 1986.",,"NITROGEN; OXYGEN; WASTE UTILIZATION - Processing; AERATION; ANIMAL WASTES; SLURRY; AGRICULTURAL WASTES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022496258

Although cachexia is an expected occurrence in the terminal stages of nearly all malignancies, it may be a presenting sign when the tumor burden is quite small. Lipid depletion occurs out of proportion to the protein loss and accounts for most of the weight loss in cancer. Lipids, more specifically fatty acids, are the major source of fuel in mammals and may also be used in the synthesis of new cell products. Lipolysis and lipogenesis are under the influence of several important enzymes and peptide hormones that may be modulated by a variety of exogenous factors. There is evidence that cancer patients have lost the normal homeostatic responses to decreased energy intake or starvation that allow a decrease in oxygen consumption and protein sparing. An increased in Cori cycle activity or futile recycling of metabolic products occurs with a new energy expenditure rather than energy production. Clinical studies have shown that the body lipid depletion accompanying tumor progression is not solely secondary to decreased food intake and may be reproduced by the transplantation of certain noninvasive tumors to normal hosts. Elevated basal lipolysis has occasionally been seen early in tumor growth. Such findings suggest the presence of a tumor-associated factor responsible for this increase in lipid mobilization. Some of the potential mechanisms for the altered lipid metabolism seen in cancer have been discussed. Metabolic substrates may be remodeled and directed away from fuel-efficient into energy-requiring pathways. An increased energy expenditure may occur as a result of the energy costs of tumor synthesis, an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, or energy-requiring futile cycling. An overall depletion of lipid may be the final outcome of the inhibition of lipid deposition. TNF/cachectin has recently been found to suppress the activity and synthesis of several key lipogenic enzymes, including lipoprotein lipase. Abnormalities in insulin secretion or sensitivity may be involved in the decrease of fat storage in malignancy. Insulin also exerts a significant antilipolytic effect by its antagonism of hormone-sensitive lipase. Mediators of lipolysis and abnormal lipid metabolism may occur in a number of clinical conditions and include ectopic hormone production, growth factors, and tumor-associated lipolytic factors (lipid mobilizing factor, toxohormone).",,"cancer; human; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; lipolysis; priority journal; short survey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022491643

At weaning, milk is replaced progressively by the adult diet which contains less fat and more carbohydrate. In the hours and days following birth, the newborn adapts itself to the new nutritional environment by increasing its capacity to produce glucose de novo (gluconeogenesis) in order to satisfy its high glucose needs. Oxidation of fatty acids is enhanced in the liver and at the peripheral level. Ketone bodies synthetized from fatty acids in the liver in large amounts are utilized by other tissues and specially the brain where they can met energetic and synthetic needs. In the rat, during the suckling period, lipogenesis is decreased in the liver and in white adipose tissue and triglyceride accretion is minimized. At weaning, these adaptations are reversed: decreased gluconeogenic and oxidative capacity of the liver, decrease of the role of ketone bodies, increase of the lipogenic rate in the liver and the adipose tissue, storage of triglycerides.

In experiment A one group was fed cafetaria diet ad libitum (the intake was 29% larger than the control), two other groups were fed the same diet but in restricted quantities (18 and 9% above control), and a fourth group, fed a stock diet, served as control. In experiment B, caloric intake was restricted by 12 and 31% in two groups fed cafetaria diet, and by 21 and 34% in two other groups fed stock diet. The experiments lasted 41 days and during that period the protein gain was comparable between the control and the cafetaria-29% group (643.4 ± 33.3 vs. 578.1 ± 25.0) but the fat gain was significantly different between the two groups (863.2 ± 81.6 vs. 1663.2 ± 99.8 kJ). When energy expenditure (EE) (metabolizable energy less storage added to the cost of storage) is expressed as a percentage of metabolizable energy (ME) intake no significant diference was found among the groups. The average value was ≃75%. This finding would not support the presence of dietary-induced thermogenesis in animals overfed on the cafetaria diet. However, since the obligatory cost associated with storing energy would not explain the higher EE of the overfed groups, it is suggested that the level of ME intake exerts continuous proportional regulatory action on EE and, as a result, energy is spared by underfeeding and it is wasted by overfeeding. Rats fed the cafetaria diet, independent of whether they are overfed or restricted were shown to increase both brown adipose tissue (BAT) protein and thermogenic capacity in response to norepinephrine. For that reason it is suggested that it is not the caloric content of the diet which affects BAT but instead other factors such as fat content or palatability of the food. The results also suggest that BAT is not directly implicated in the regulatory responses associated with various intakes of food. Indeed in the underfed experiment, although the capacity of the BAT was enhanced in the cafetaria groups, the EE was not different from that of the animals fed the stock diet.",,"animal experiment; brown adipose tissue; diet; endocrine system; energy transfer; food intake; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022456584

These scenarios are representative of possible practical situations. They involve storage above ground as a cryogenic liquid as well as high-pressure storage both above and below ground. The latter includes natural and specially created cavities. No comparison is made between these various methods since in practice one would rarely be free to make a choice among various alternatives. Each scenario is defined and then costed in detail. The incremental cost of storage is calculated and the sensitivity determined for variations of throughput, capital cost and electricity cost. Also included in the data are the costs of electrolytic hydrogen and of hydrogen liquefaction. The cost of storage can add between 30 and 300% to the cost of hydrogen so that large offsetting benefits have to exist in order to give economic viability. There is a considerable interplay between the magnitude of the capital charges and the system throughput or utilization. In the case of the electrolyser alone, non-continuous operation results in a considerable increase in the unit hydrogen costs. For storage systems where the unit capital charges are high then the operating costs are very sensitive to changes in both throughput and capital costs. A hidden capital charge occurs in some cases of underground storage where a large inventory of cushion gas is inaccessible to the user, but is necessary to define the minimum size of the reservoir. The results clearly show the need to consider many factors in order to optimize a storage system. In practice, this has to be done for each specific situation and general consideration can be very misleading. © 1986.",,"ENERGY RESOURCES; HYDROGEN FUELS - Storage; ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT; ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN; HYDROGEN COSTS; HYDROGEN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022451189

Disadvantages are possible high establishment costs, a long growth period until production commences, and difficulties in harvesting or storage; however, these provide opportunities for potential research impact.

Surface‐active materials which were added to the storage materials produce optimum conditions for the heat transfer and material transport during the heat transfer processes. Under the conditions of the GLS storage unit on application of Glauber salt, constant storable amounts of energy were found which are in good agreement with the theoretical values.

An attractive design utilizes molten salt as the transport/storage fluid, which is pumped to the receiver and allowed to flow over a high-temperature absorber surface. As the salt runs down the absorber surface in a thin film, concentrated solar flux heats the salt to 900°C, either directly (blackened fluid) or by convective heat transfer with the irradiated absorber (clear fluid). The feasibility of such a design depends on the optical efficiency of the absorber/fluid combination. The optical properties of candidate absorber materials and transport fluids are therefore required at appropriate elevated temperatures. Because such salts can be extremely reactive at high temperatures, it is important to measure optical properties as a function of exposure history of the salt/absorber. Optical characterization of a clear molten carbonate salt (Li2CO3Na2CO3K2CO3 ternary eutectic) and a high-temperature metal alloy (Inconel 600) has been carried out at elevated temperatures using a recently developed integrating sphere solar spectrometer. Reflectance measurements of oxidized Inconel 600 alone and covered with several thicknesses of molten salt have been made. Measurements were also made of the reflectance of Inconel 600 samples that had been exposed to molten salt under high cyclic temperatures. © 1986.",,"HEAT TRANSFER - Convection; LIGHT - Absorption; OPTICAL MATERIALS - Light Sensitive Materials; SOLAR ENERGY; DIRECT ABSORPTION RECEIVERS; MOLTEN SALTS AS TRANSPORT FLUID; SOLAR MATERIALS; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022151501

The self-diffusion coefiicient is approximaately one order of magnitude larger for lithium ions than for chloride ions. The system is a simple eutectic with the eutectic point at 484°C and 44 mo1% Li2Cl2. The solubility of LiCl in Li2SO4 is very small, but a plastic paste is formed in the two-phase regions. This makes mixtures with a low content of LiCl of interest both as electrolytes in power sources and for the storage of thermal energy in the vicinity of the solid-solid phase transition at 575°C.

One of the major problems with this system is the excessive heat losses from the wall through the glazing by convection and infrared radiation. Among the possible improvements, use of a non-convective Trombe wall with additional suppressions of convection and i.r. radiation can be mentioned. This can be achieved by eliminating the convective flow channel between the glazing and the wall and using honeycomb structure as an integral part of the wall at the glazing side. The heat transfer from outside surface to the inside of the dwelling is achieved by conduction through the wall. The objective of this study is to investigate this possibility. The simplifying assumptions were: heat transfer is unidimensional; honeycomb structure is one dimensional with negligible mass; thermal exchange by convection between the honeycomb cells is negligible; materials used are gray with difuse emission and reflection. The solution of the governing equations (system of non-linear equations) is carried out by using an iterative numerical method. The theoretical results indicate that the system consistion of a non-convective Trombe wall with honeycomb structure will perform quite satisfactorily in Canadian climatic conditions and that the optimized system will have about 0·25 m wall thickness, 0·004m honeycomb fin thickness and 3 aspect ratio. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009966775

This fact is closely related to the chiral symmetry of the standard model. It is not necessarily true if there are new interactions beyond the standard model. Polarization effects in composite and supersymmetric models are studied in detail. New particles such as scalar bosons and excited electrons in composite models can give nonzero polarization effects. In supersymmetric theories, the transverse polarization is useful to probe the mixing of the scalar-electron states.

In 1967 the Japan Atomic Energy Commission decided to promote the research and development of food irradiation, based on research activities since 1954. The national project on food irradiation investigated the following: 1) the inhibition of sprout growth of potatoes and onions, 2) the prevention of infestation of rice and wheat, 3) the extension of shelf life of sausage and fish-paste products, and 4) the growth inhibition of molds on the surfaces of oranges by using electron beams. As a result of this national project, a commercial potato irradiation plant was constructed and has been operating for 12 years. Market price fluctuations during the off-season were also successfully reduced. However, a boycott movement by some consumer unions against irradiated potatoes has seriously affected food processors. The technical problems of irradiated potatoes, such as rotting and accumulation of sugar during storage, were solved by conditioning before and after irradiation. After the termination of the national project, studies were carried out on farm animal feeds for the purpose of eliminating pathogens such as salmonellae and extending shelf life by delaying mold growth. The accumulation of sugar in irradiated sweet potatoes, identification methodology of irradiated foods, and radiation-decontamination of microorganisms in spices have also been studied. The greatest problem now is to overcome the public's resistance to irradiated food. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005516309

The rates of the primary electron transfer reactions are deduced by taking the electronic structure of the chromophores and their geometrical arrangement explicitly into account, while the protein portion is considered as a dielectric continuum which is rigid to an extent that the free-energy loss by solvent reorganization can be neglected. The values of the different rate constants thus obtained are in good agreement with experimental data. Each chromophore component in the reaction center appears to be positioned optimally for the purpose of energy storage in electron transfer. This can be shown by repeating the calculations for various arrangements that differ somewhat from the arrangement obtained by Deisenhofer et al. The device can only operate as an energy-storing system if each functional component molecule is exactly adjusted to each other sterically and energetically. It is shown by proposing a reasonable evolutionary pathway that the emergence of the specific arrangement of chromophores and proteins in the reaction center can be made plausible. © 1986 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002101176

All neutron sources are based on nuclear reactions that free neutrons bound in nuclei. These are categorized according to the mechanisms by which this is done: fission chain reactions, fusion reactions, e--bremsstrahlung-induced photoneutron and photofission reactions, charged-particle nuclear reactions, and spallation. The last three together termed as accelerator-based reactions. Muon-catalyzed fusion and the neutron focus represent other categories of neutron-producing reactions. Electron-bremsstrahlung sources produce evaporation neutrons with an average energy of a few mega-electron-volts, whether due to photofission or photonuclear reaction. Since the neutron production mechanisms involve first producing bremsstrahlung photons, which then interact to produce neutrons, these sources produce very large gamma-ray fluxes as well, which sometimes represent a troublesome background. Neutron shielding is like that for a reactor. Spallation sources also produce predominantly evaporation neutrons, which boil off in the process of “cooling off” of highly excited nuclei. The types of accelerators that provide the highest intensities are resonant accelerators, which all have inherent pulse structure. In cyclotrons, synchrotrons, and storage rings, bunches of particles circulate at frequencies of a few megahertz. © 1986 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001832850

Relaxation studies of wheat starch gels with water contents in the range 25-60% show a reduction in the T2, within the first 48 h after formation, indicating an overall decrease in mobility of the water molecules. Freezing experiments show that this decrease in the relaxation time is accompanied by an increase in the fraction of 'bound' water in the gel. The rate and extent of this change exhibits a positive temperature dependence, whereas general retrogradation phenomena (such as increase in crystallinity and firming) show a negative temperature coefficient. The activation energy calculated for this process is consistent with hydrogen bond formation. Examination of the two major fractions of starch (amylopectin and amylose) shows that the amylopectin gels closely follow the behaviour of starch gels, whereas amylose gels show no change in the state of the water on storage. The accessibility of the bound water in the retrograded gels has been tested by mixing with deuterium oxide. These experiments show that all the water in the gel is available for exchange and can be replaced with heavy water. Samples of heated gluten and water show a greater 'binding' of water in the protein than in starch and that once bound the state of the water does not change. Studies on bread, stored in sealed glass tubes, show no significant change in the relaxation times or levels of bound water over a period of 7 days, even though staling has occurred and the bread has apparently dried out. The bread examined was stored, without crusts, in sealed moisture-proof bags in an oxygen free atmosphere in order to minimise the effects of water migration and microbial attack. Any changes in the relaxation times and fractions of bound water observed in these samples can be accounted for by loss of 'free' water only.

The PEUU formed a two-phase structure, consisting of the PPO and poly(urethane urea) phases, and LiC104 was selectively dissolved in the PPO phase. The frequency-temperature superposition for the storage elastic modulus was carried out in the temperature range for the backbone relaxation of the PPO segment, using the glass transition temperature (Tg) as a reference temperature. The ratios of the ionic conductivity at various temperatures (7) to that at Tg plotted againt T - Tg were compared with the shift factors for the mechanical relaxation. The direct relationship between the ionic mobility and the local segmental motion of the PPO segment and the Arrhenius activation process for carrier generation were deduced from this comparison. A higher activation energy for the carrier generation was implied in the polymer complex containing LiC104 at a higher concentration. © 1986, American Chemical Society.

Minimum flows of 1, 020 m3/s (license minimum set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) and 1, 416 m3/s were maintained in six alternating years, but flows each day fluctuated widely above the minima because of power production; part of the spawning area was exposed for several hours on most days. We detected no effect of minimum flow regime on redd size. Chinook salmon spawned at depths as great as 7 m below the water surface as measured at a discharge of 1, 020 m3/s. The highest redds occurred near the water’s edge at the 1, 982-m3/s flow elevation. Vertical range of spawning use was 8.5 m. Water velocities at 23 cm above the substrate (facing velocity) on the area used for spawning varied greatly with river discharge, but usually exceeded 0.67 m/s. Chinook salmon females completed redds in areas that were not covered by water for up to 8 h/d, and on other areas that had velocities near 2 m/s for part of each day. Chinook salmon spawned at Vernita Bar in areas with high fractions of cobble and low percentages of fines. They began spawning in early October below the 1, 020-m3/s flow elevation and increasingly used the area between the 1, 020- and 1, 982-m3/s flow elevations until spawning ended about the third week of November. The percentage of redds above the 1, 020-m3/s flow elevation correlated strongly with mean daily discharge during late October and early November over 7 years. We found no evidence that the minimum daily flow affected redd distribution in any way. Egg retention in ovaries of postspawning females, one measure of spawning success, was minimal in all years, as was the proportion of excavated redds that contained no embryos. Daily flow fluctuations from minima to 3, 400-4, 250 m3/s did not prevent females from completing redds. We concluded that minimum flows of 1, 020 m3/s for up to 8 h/d do not determine availability of spawning habitat, and that use of spawning areas above the 1, 020-m3/s flow elevation could be reduced by managing the river discharge with storage manipulation upstream to provide lower mean daily flows, thus easing minimum flow restrictions during posthatch incubation and emergence. © by the American Fisheries Society 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001396299

Depending on energy intake, this may involve mobilization of body stores to provide substrate for glucose synthesis and to spare glucose, or it may involve storage of excess nutrients. Insulin is the primary hormonal regulator of metabolism in the resting animal. When energy intake is high, insulin concentrations are high and growth and/or body gain is promoted. Low concentrations of insulin have a catabolic effect. In contrast, glucagon, epinephrine and glucocorticoids are emergency hormones. They provide for mobilization of energy for fight or flight. In addition, glucocorticoids may facilitate repletion of glycogen stores. Growth hormone does not seem to be involved in the minute-to-minute regulation of metabolism, but it can alter the sensitivity of tissues to insulin with respect to glucose metabolism. It also appears to be antagonistic to the lipid synthetic effects of insulin. However, both insulin and growth hormone promote net protein synthesis. Whereas insulin promotes body gain by stimulating fat and protein synthesis, growth hormone promotes lean growth. © 1986.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001057683
