We recently showed that α-lipoic acid (ALA), a potent antioxidant and cofactor of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, reduces body weight of rodents by suppressing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. We sought to determine if ALA can prevent the development of diabetes mellitus in obese Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. Most (78%) untreated OLETF rats showed glycosuria at 40 weeks of age, but this was completely prevented by ALA. Compared with untreated OLETF rats, ALA reduced body weight and protected pancreatic β-cells from destruction. ALA also reduced triglyceride accumulation in skeletal muscle and pancreatic islets. These results indicate that ALA prevents diabetes mellitus in obese diabetes-prone rats by reducing lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissue as well as in adipose tissue. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We report a new fundamental characteristic of semiconducting SWNTs: the persistent photoconductivity of chemically modified carbon nanotube films. Illumination of carboxylated semiconducting SWNTs with ultraviolet or visible light causes a persistent decrease in the conductivity of semiconducting films. The photoinduced conductivity persists in the dark with a characteristic half-life of 35 s to 1.2 × 10 3 s at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.35 eV. Infrared illumination restores the conductivity of SWNT films. Ultraviolet and visible light illumination partially refills empty valence band states of chemically modified SWNTs by electron injection from the dopant sites. Photoinduced injection of electrons is accompanied by a decrease of the conductivity of the p-doped SWNT film, because of neutralization of holes by injected electrons. Covalent attachment of ruthenium(II)-tris(2,2′- bipyridine) (Ru(bpy) 3 2+) to SWNTs makes carbon nanotubes sensitive to light that has been absorbed by the ruthenium complex and makes the carbon nanotubes persistently photoconductive. The photoconductivity of Ru(bpy) 3 2+-SWNT films is presumably due to the injection of holes from *Ru(bpy) 3 2+ to SWNT with a quantum yield of 0.55. Persistently photoconductive SWNTs have potential uses as nanosized optical switches, photodetectors, electrooptical information storage devices, and chemical sensors.",,"Declocalization; Electron transfer; Potential barriers; Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT); Activation energy; Carboxylation; Chemical modification; Complexation; Doping (additives); Electron energy levels; Lighting; Molecular dynamics; Optical switches; Photoconductivity; Photodiodes; Purification; Quenching; Ruthenium compounds; Thermodynamics; Ultraviolet radiation; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11344276566

A new isospin dependence of the pairing energy was observed due to the improved mass accuracy of typically 1.5×10-7 (30 keV).

The instrument array presented opportunities to address issues of the representativeness of local-scale fluxes in urban settings. Separate EC systems operated at two levels, and a telescoping tower allowed the pair to be exposed at two different sets of heights. The flux and turbulence observations taken at the four heights, stratified by wind conditions (mistral wind and sea breeze), are used to address the partitioning of the surface energy balance in an area with large roughness elements. The turbulent sensible heat flux dominates in the daytime, although the storage heat flux is a significant term that peaks before solar noon. The turbulent latent heat flux is small but not negligible. Carbon dioxide fluxes show that this central city district is almost always a source, but the vegetation reduces the magnitude of the fluxes in the afternoon. The atmosphere in such a heavily developed area is rarely stable. The turbulence characteristics support the empirical functions proposed by M. Roth.

Density functional theory calculations were used to calculate the atomic positions, lattice constant, and effective atomic charges from the electrostatic potential for the MOF-5 crystal structure. Second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory was used to calculate the binding energy of H 2 to benzene and H 2-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate-H 2. To achieve the necessary accuracy, the large Dunning basis sets aug-cc-pVTZ, and aug-cc-pVQZ were used, and the results were extrapolated to the basis set limit. The binding energy results were 4.77 kJ/mol for benzene, 5.27 kJ/mol for H 2-1,4- benzenedicarboxylate-H 2. We also estimate binding of 5.38 kJ/mol for Li-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate-Li and 6.86 kJ/mol at the zinc oxide corners using second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory. In order to compare our theoretical calculations to the experimental hydrogen storage results, grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations were performed.

Jackson School, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712-0254, United States","This paper addresses the effects of canopy physical processes on snow mass and energy balances in boreal ecosystems. We incorporate new parameterizations of radiation transfer through the vegetation canopy, interception of snow by the vegetation canopy, and under-canopy sensible heat transfer processes into the Versatile Integrator of Surface and Atmosphere (VISA) and test the model results against the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) data observed at South Study Area, Old Jack Pine. A modified two-stream radiation transfer scheme that accounts for the three-dimensional geometry of vegetation accurately simulates the transferring of solar radiation through the vegetation canopy when the leaf and stem area index is reduced to match the observed. VISA produces higher-than-observed surface albedo in wintertime. Implementation of a snow interception model that explicitly describes the loading and unloading of snow and the melting and refreezing of snow on the canopy into VISA reduces the fractional snow cover on the canopy and the surface albedo. VISA overestimates the downward sensible heat fluxes from the canopy to the snow surface, which leads to earlier snow ablation and a shallower snowpack than the observed. Explicitly including a canopy heat storage term in the canopy energy balance equation decreases the spuriously large amplitude of the diurnal canopy temperature variation and reduces the excessive daytime sensible heat flux from the canopy downward to the snow surface. Sensitivity tests reveal that the turbulent sensible heat flux below the vegetation canopy strongly depends on the canopy absorption coefficient of momentum. During spring the daytime temperature difference between the snow surface and the vegetation canopy forms a strongly stable atmospheric condition, which results in a larger absorption coefficient of momentum and a weak turbulent sensible heat flux. The modeled excessive downward sensible heat flux from the vegetation canopy to the snow surface is considerably reduced through the stability correction to the canopy absorption coefficient of momentum.

We extend the versatility of these conductive nanostructures by modifying them with ultrathin, electroactive polymer coatings based on the self-limiting electropolymerization of o-methoxyaniline. The pore-solid architecture is largely retained in the polymer-carbon-aerogel hybrid due to the conformal, self-limiting nature of the electrodeposited polymer coating. Although grown under insulating conditions, these polymers coatings become electroactive when exposed to aqueous-acid electrolytes, and contribute a pseudocapacitance component to the energy-storage mechanism in the hybrid nanoarchitecture.

Scanning electron microscopy images confirm that the polymer film coats the porous surface without completely covering over or occluding the large-scale porosity of the oxide nanoarchitecture. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements show C1s and O1s photoelectron peaks consistent with the reported PPO structure. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrates that the encapsulated MnO2 undergoes reversible Li-ion insertion/ de-insertion reactions where the Li+ ions are supplied through the polymer coating from an acetonitrile electrolyte; the polymer coating does not affect the nature of insertion into the oxide. These hybrid systems assemble inorganic and organic components on the nanoscale and offer routes to new architectures with expanded functionality and enhanced electrochemical performance for energy-storage applications.

Accessing these states by applying, and varying the direction of, an external electric field is a key principle for the operation of devices such as non-volatile ferroelectric random access memories (NFERAMs). Compared with bulk ferroelectrics, low-dimensional finite ferroelectric structures promise to increase the storage density of NFERAMs 10,000-fold. But this anticipated benefit hinges on whether phase transitions and multi-stable states still exist in low-dimensional structures. Previous studies have suggested that phase transitions are impossible in one-dimensional systems, and become increasingly less likely as dimensionality further decreases. Here we perform ab initio studies of ferroelectric nanoscale disks and rods of technologically important Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 solid solutions, and demonstrate the existence of previously unknown phase transitions in zero-dimensional ferroelectric nanoparticles.

A. Mazziotti, Phys. Rev. Lett. (in press)]. With semidefinite programming, the electronic ground-state energy of a molecule is minimized with respect to the 2-RDM subject to N-representability constraints known as positivity conditions. Here we present a detailed account of the first-order algorithm for semidefinite programming and its comparison with the primal-dual interior-point algorithms employed in earlier variational 2-RDM calculations. The first-order semidefinite-programming algorithm, computations show, offers an orders-of-magnitude reduction in floating-point operations and storage in comparison with previous implementations. We also examine the ability of the positivity conditions to treat strong correlation and multireference effects through an analysis of the Hamiltonians for which the conditions are exact.

Noise spikes caused by the stochastic collision of energetic single particles with charge-sensitive regions at the semiconductor surface can destroy stored information, leading to logic errors. Error-producing single particles for highly advanced microcircuits are omnipresent, emanating from a variety of sources, from an alpha particle emitted from the metal layers forming the interconnect grid on the circuit to galactic high energy heavy ions encountered by the microelectronics within satellite systems. No matter the source of the ions, the resulting excess charge collection dynamics that may lead to logic errors are in all cases essentially the same. That is, if the interaction of an ion with the semiconductor substrate occurs in close proximity to the data node of a latch circuit, the resultant excess ionization charge collected at the data node may cause the latch to erroneously change state, a single-event upset (SEU). The information now contaminated by this invalid data state is in some cases unrecoverable. Consequently, a considerable amount of effort is spent during the circuit library design and development phases to minimize the probability of occurrence of SEUs. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies are predominantly used to build the most advanced high-performance, low-power digital systems and quite a number of SEU hardening design techniques have been developed to mitigate the threat of logic upset due to energetic particles. This paper will describe in much greater detail the threat posed to the information stored in CMOS data latches by energetic ion strikes. Some of the most commonly used design-hardening approaches will be examined and the relative merits of each approach will be explored. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We further evaluated the interaction of aging and habitual physical activity on respiratory mechanics. Static lung volumes and elastic properties of the lung and chest wall (pressure-volume relaxation maneuvers) in 29 chronically sedentary and 29 habitually active subjects, grouped by age, were investigated: young (Y, 20-30 years), middle-aged (M, 40-50 years), and older (O, &gt;60 years). Using static pressure-volume data, we computed the elastic work of breathing (joules per liter, J·l-1), including inspiratory muscle work, over resting and exercising tidal volume excursions. Elastic work of the lung (Y = 0.79 ± 0.05; M = 0.47 ± 0.05; O = 0.43 ± 0.05 J·l-1) and chest wall (Y = -0.49 ± 0.06; M = -0.12 ± 0.07; O = 0.04 ± 0.05 J·l-1) changed significantly with age (P &lt; 0.05). With aging, a parallel displacement of the chest wall pressure-volume curve resulted in a shift from energy being stored primarily during expiration to energy storage during inspiration, and driving expiration, both at rest and during exercise. Although deviating significantly from young adults, this did not significantly elevate static inspiratory muscle work but resulted in a redistribution of the tissues on which this work was performed and the phase of the respiratory cycle in which it occurred. Nevertheless, static inspiratory muscle work remained similar across age groups, at rest and during exercise, and habitual physical activity failed to influence these changes.","Chest wall; Compliance; Respiratory mechanics; Work of breathing","adult; aged; aging; article; breathing; breathing pattern; elastic tissue; exercise; female; human; human experiment; inspiratory capacity; lung parenchyma; lung volume; male; muscle function; muscle relaxation; physical activity; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; rest; static exercise; thorax wall; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Humans; Life Style; Lung; Middle Aged; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory Physiology; Rest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8644234308

However, a growing expense in the operation of computer networks is electricity usage. Estimates place devices connected to the Internet as consuming about 2%, and growing, of the total electricity produced in the USA - much of this power consumption is unnecessary. Power management is needed to reduce this large and growing energy consumption of the Internet. We see power management as the 'next frontier' in research in computer networks. In this paper, we propose methods for reducing energy consumption of networked desktop computers. Using traffic characterization of university dormitory computers, we show that there is significant idle time that can be exploited for power management. However, current Ethernet adapters in desktop computers lack the capabilities needed to allow existing system power management features to be enabled. We address this problem with a proxying Ethernet adapter that handles routine network tasks for a desktop computer when it is in a low-power sleep mode. This proxying adapter can allow existing power management features in desktop computers to remain enabled and have the computer be 'on the network' at all times. The energy that we expect can be saved is in the range of 0.8-2.7 billion US dollars/year. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Propylene may cause problems through engine and injector deposits when propane is used as a motor fuel. Also, propylene is capable of polymerizing in storage, fuel lines, or vaporizers, and thus may cause plugging by gum deposits. As the use of propane expands into the motor fuel and other new markets, the removal of propylene will become increasingly more important. This manuscript reviews the most promising technologies for removal of propylene from refinery-derived propane. The only current commercially-practiced approaches are distillation and catalytic hydrogenation. Distillation is a viable technology for removal of propylene from propane, but both capital and energy costs are high, due to the very low relative volatility between the two species. Catalytic hydrogenation is straightforward, but also has a high capital cost, and the cost/availability of the continuous hydrogen production required may also be problematic. Two other approaches are very near commercialization: (1) absorption/stripping based on aqueous silver nitrate solution, and (2) pressure-swing adsorption based on zeolite molecular sieves. Membranes also show promise to provide in a single stage separation equivalent to many stages of distillation, with simple, compact, and robust equipment. Chemically selective sorbents offer even higher degrees of separation in a single stage, albeit in more complex equipment.

Any effort to address climate change needs to include adaptation to climate change, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and sequestration or storage of carbon that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (the most prevalent greenhouse gas). For each of these objectives, a great many legal and policy instruments are available. Of equal importance, however, some of these instruments are also capable of producing additional or ancillary benefits. These include, but are not limited to, creation of goods and services (e.g., energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy) for which there are significant and growing domestic and international markets, technological innovation, job creation, financial savings to customers and businesses, and reduction in air pollutants other than greenhouse gases. Climate change is not simply a matter of reducing and adapting to risks; it can also be used to maximize opportunities and benefits.

It is becoming clear that the adipocyte is not merely an inert organ for storage of energy but that it also secretes a host of factors that interact with each other and may result in elevated blood pressure. Of particular importance is the putative role of leptin in the causation of hypertension via an activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a direct effect on the kidneys, resulting in increased sodium reabsorption leading to hypertension. Obesity per se may have structural effects on the kidneys that may perpetuate hypertension, leading to an increased incidence of end-stage renal disease that results in further hypertension. Adipose tissue may elaborate angiotensin from its own local renin-angiotensin system. The distribution of body fat is considered important in the genesis of the obesity-hypertension syndrome, with a predominantly central distribution being particularly ominous. Weight loss is the cornerstone in the management of the obesity-hypertension syndrome. It may be achieved with diet, exercise, medications, and a combination of these measures. Anti-obesity medications that are currently undergoing clinical trials may play a promising role in the management of obesity and may also result in lowering of blood pressure. Antihypertensives are considered important components in the holistic approach to the management of this complex problem.

Commercial SRAMs from six different vendors were irradiated at proton energies from 8 to 500 MeV and at total doses from 0 to 100 krad(Si) using multiple radiation sources. For some SRAMs, the single-event upset cross section increased with total dose. The amount of increase in SEU cross section strongly depended on the bias configuration during total dose irradiation and single-event upset characterization. For most of the SRAMs that showed an increase in single-event upset cross section with total dose, the static power supply leakage current also increased. Light emission microscopy photographs identified the source of the increase in power supply leakage current for these SRAMs as originating in peripheral transistors outside the memory array. This suggests a new single-event upset mechanism for present-day devices, which may be due to a reduction in the internally supplied memory array bias level with total dose, increasing memory cell sensitivity to single-event upset. The proton energy at which the single-event latchup cross section saturated varied considerably between devices. For one technology, the single-event latchup cross section did not saturate until the proton energy was increased to 200 MeV. These data indicate that single-event latchup hardness assurance testing should be performed at high proton energies (&gt; 100 MeV). For fluence levels less than 1011 protons/cm2 at a proton energy of 105 MeV, proton-induced displacement damage had no observable affect on single-event latchup cross section. The implications of these effects on single-event upset and latchup hardness assurance testing are discussed.","Integrated circuit reliability; Integrated circuit testing; Proton testing; Radiation effects; Radiation hardening (electronics); Radiation response; Single event effects; Single event latchup; Single event upset","Dosimetry; Hardness; Integrated circuit testing; Integrated circuits; Leakage currents; Radiation effects; Static random access storage; Integrated circuit reliability; Proton testing; Radiation hardening (electronics); Radiation response; Single event effects (SEE); Single event latchup (SEL); Single event upset (SEU); Proton irradiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944374431

The depth-resolved analysis of the Ni-P layer plated on the Al-Mg alloy substrate reflects the microscopic non-uniformity of the surface of the Al alloy base material. Diamond stylus profilometry is employed to extract crater profiles and sputtering rates obtained over a range of discharge conditions of rf power and argon discharge gas pressure. SEM, TEM and EDX images of specimen cross sections are used to examine the physical structure of the layer interfaces on a microscopic scale. For each of the aluminium hard disks investigated in this study, the interface breadths (Δz) obtained at the Ni-P/Al-Mg interface is ultimately limited by the roughness of the aluminium disk substrate to which the overlayer is applied. Optimized discharge conditions are employed to profile hard disks extracted from two commercial drives of different technological generations. Distinct compositional differences are observed that correlate with improvements in the base technology over the years 1992-1998. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2004.",,"Aluminum alloys; Emission spectroscopy; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Glow discharges; Interfaces (materials); Light emission; Nickel compounds; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Surface roughness; Transmission electron microscopy; Depth resolved analysis; Nickel phosphide; Radiofrequency glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy; Hard disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842588293

With less than 50% coding capacity of a 3.3-Mb genome and 1,116 pseudogenes, the remaining genes help define the minimal gene set necessary for in vivo survival of this mycobacterial pathogen as well as genes potentially required for infection and pathogenesis seen in leprosy. To identify genes transcribed during infection, we surveyed gene transcripts from M. leprae growing in athymic nude mice using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cross-species DNA microarray technologies. Transcripts were detected for 221 open reading frames, which included genes involved in DNA replication, cell division, SecA-dependent protein secretion, energy production, intermediary metabolism, iron transport and storage and genes associated with virulence. These results suggest that M. leprae actively catabolizes fatty acids for energy, produces a large number of secretory proteins, utilizes the full array of sigma factors available, produces several proteins involved in iron transport, storage and regulation in the absence of recognizable genes encoding iron scavengers and transcribes several genes associated with virulence in M. tuberculosis. When transcript levels of 9 of these genes were compared from M. leprae derived from lesions of multibacillary leprosy patients and infected nude mouse foot pad tissue using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, gene transcript levels were comparable for all but one of these genes, supporting the continued use of the foot pad infection model for M. leprae gene expression profiling. Identifying genes associated with growth and survival during infection should lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the ability of M. leprae to cause disease. Copyright © 2004 S.

It has been known for some time that both PPARα and PPARγ play a role in lipid metabolism. Antidiabetic drugs of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class are potent and selective activators of PPARγ known to promote adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage. Lipid-lowering agents of the fibrate class activate PPARα. Until recently, the function of PPARδ remained elusive, but recent progress has shown that PPARδ plays a key role in lipid metabolism, as it regulates serum lipid profiles and fatty acid β oxidation in muscle and adipose tissue. This suggests that PPARδ agonists may play a beneficial role in the treatment of lipid disorders, in particular obesity. This review will highlight key new findings in PPARδ biology and discuss the recent evidence linking PPARα and PPARγ to adipose tissue biology and the development of obesity. © 2004 Prous Science.

Health monitoring is a method of assessing the reliability of a product in its actual application conditions. A case study in health and usage monitoring of electronic products is presented for a commercial notebook computer. Internal temperatures were dynamically monitored in situ and statistically analyzed during all phases of the life cycle, including usage, storage, and transportation. The effects of power cycles, usage history, CPU computing resources usage, and external thermal environment on peak transient thermal loads were characterized. Such monitored life cycle temperature data could be applied in a life consumption monitoring methodology, to provide damage estimation and remaining life prediction due to specific failure mechanisms influenced by temperature. These findings could contribute to the design of more sustainable, least-energy consumption thermal management solutions.","Electronics cooling; Health monitoring; In situ monitoring; Notebook computer; Reliability prediction; Temperature measurement; Thermal characterization","Atmospheric humidity; Cooling; Heat sinks; Life cycle; Reliability; Temperature measurement; Electronics cooling; Health monitoring; In situ monitoring; Reliability prediction; Thermal characterization; Laptop computers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444256234

Research Center, 6400 Perkins Road, Baton Rouge, LA 70808-4124, United States","BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that increasing adiposity is associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of type II diabetes. The predominant paradigm used to explain this link is the portal/visceral hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that increased adiposity, particularly in the visceral depots, leads to increased free-fatty acid flux and inhibition of insulin-action via Randle's effect in insulin-sensitive tissues. OBJECTIVES: In this review, limitations of this paradigm will be discussed and two other paradigms that may explain established links between adiposity and insulin resistance/diabetes will be presented. (a) Ectopic fat storage syndrome. Three lines of evidence support this concept. Firstly, failure to develop adequate adipose tissue mass (also known as 'lipodystrophy') results in severe insulin resistance and diabetes. This is thought to be the result of ectopic storage of lipid into liver, skeletal muscle and the pancreatic insulin-secreting beta cell. Secondly, most obese patients also shunt lipid into the skeletal muscle, the liver and probably the beta cell. The importance of this finding is exemplified by several studies demonstrating that the degree of lipid infiltration into skeletal muscle and liver highly correlates with insulin resistance. Thirdly, increased fat cell size is highly associated with insulin resistance and the development of diabetes. Increased fat cell size may represent the failure of the adipose tissue mass to expand and therefore to accommodate an increased energy influx. Taken together, these observations support the 'acquired lipodystrophy' hypothesis as a link between adiposity and insulin resistance. Ectopic fat deposition is therefore the result of additive or synergistic effects including increased dietary intake, decreased fat oxidation and impaired adipogenesis. (b) Endocrine paradigm. This concept was developed in parallel with the 'ectopic fat storage syndrome' hypothesis. Adipose tissue secretes a variety of endocrine hormones such as leptin, interleukin-6, angiotensin II, adiponectin and resistin. From this viewpoint, adipose tissue plays a critical role as an endocrine gland, secreting numerous factors with potent effects on the metabolism of distant tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The novel paradigms of ectopic fat and fat cell as an endocrine organ probably will constitute a new framework for the study of the links between our obesigenic environment and the risk of developing diabetes.","Adipogenesis; Insulin resistance; Intrahepatic fat; Intramyocellular fat; Lipodystrophy; Visceral fat","fatty acid; insulin; adipocyte; adipose tissue; cell proliferation; cell size; conference paper; cytokine production; diabetogenesis; disease association; ectopic fat storage syndrome; ectopic tissue; endocrine disease; environmental factor; human; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; lipodystrophy; lipogenesis; liver; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; risk assessment; skeletal muscle; tissue metabolism; Adipocytes; Cell Division; Choristoma; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fats; Fatty Acids; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Mitochondria; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidation-Reduction; Weight Gain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444296524

In this paper, we examine the indexing issue for querying location-dependent data in wireless LBSs; in particular, we focus on an important class of queries, planar point queries. To address the issues of responsiveness, energy consumption, and bandwidth contention in wireless communications, an index has to minimize the search time and maintain a small storage overhead. It is shown that the traditional point-location algorithms and spatial index structures fail to achieve either objective or both. This paper proposes a new index structure, called D-tree, which indexes spatial regions based on the divisions that form the boundaries of the regions. We describe how to construct a binary D-tree index, how to process queries based on the D-tree, and how to page the binary D-tree. Moreover, two parameterized methods for partitioning the original space, called fixed grid assignment (FGA) and adaptive grid assignment (AGA), are proposed to enhance the D-tree. The performance of the D-tree is evaluated using both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed D-tree outperforms the well-known indexes such as the R*-tree, and that both the FGA and AGA approaches can achieve different performance trade-offs between the index search time and storage overhead by fine-tuning their algorithmic parameters.","Data broadcast; Energy conservation; Index structure; Location-dependent data; Mobile computing; Spatial database","Algorithms; Bandwidth; Data processing; Energy conservation; Query languages; Wireless telecommunication systems; Data broadcast; Index structure; Location-dependent data; Spatial database; Mobile computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10944265082

Good sub-threshold swing, good drain-induced barrier lowering (∼120 mV/decade), and ∼2.4 V of memory window down to the smallest dimensions demonstrate the improvements that result from a thin tunneling oxide and a large trapping center density. The use of distributed defects and thin tunneling oxide is reflected in a memory window that is stable up to at least 106 cycles for the smallest devices. The smallest structures tested employ ∼75 electrons for memory storage, which allows for device to device reproducibility. The capture and emission processes asymmetries point to the differences in the energy parameters of the two processes. The smallest structures, however, do show loss of retention time compared to the larger structures, for the same oxide-nitride-oxide stack thickness, and this is believed to arise from higher leakage due to higher defects distribution in the gate insulators from process-induced damage. All tested devices, down to ∼30-nm effective gate length, show very good endurance characteristics.","CMOS device scaling; Nonvolatile memory; Scaling limits; Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology; Silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) memory","Defects; Electric charge; Electron beams; Lithography; Nanostructured materials; Nitrides; Parameter estimation; Silicon on insulator technology; CMOS device scaling; Nonvolatile memory; Scaling limits; Silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) memory; CMOS integrated circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10944247953

First, we explore the decomposition mechanism of monoclinic LiAlH 4 into monoclinic Li3AlH 6 plus face-centered cubic (fee) Al and hydrogen. We find that this reaction proceeds through a five-step mechanism with an overall activation barrier of 36.9 kcal/mol. The simulated x ray and neutron diffraction patterns from LiAlH 4 and Li3AlH 6 agree well with experimental data. On the other hand, the alternative decomposition of LiAlH 4 into LiAlH 2 plus H 2 is predicted to be unstable with respect to that through Li3AlH 6. Next, we investigate thermal decomposition of Li3AlH 6 into fee LiH plus Al and hydrogen, occurring through a four-step mechanism with an activation barrier of 17.4 kcal/mol for the rate-limiting step. In the first and second steps, two Li atoms accept two H atoms from AlH 6 to form the stable Li-H-Li-H complex. Then, two sequential H 2 desorption steps are followed, which eventually result in fee LiH plus fee Al and hydrogen: Li3AlH 6(monoclinic) → 3 LiH(fcc) + Al(fcc) + 3/2 H 2 is endothermic by 15.8 kcal/mol. The dissociation energy of 15.8 kcal/mol per formula unit compares to experimental enthalpies in the range of 9.8-23.9 kcal/mol. Finally, we explore thermal decomposition of LiH, LiH(s) + Al(s) → LiAl(s) + 1/2H 2(g) is endothermic by 4.6 kcal/mol. The B32 phase, which we predict as the lowest energy structure for LiAl, shows covalent bond characters in the Al-Al direction. Additionally, we determine that transformation of LiH plus Al into LiAlH is unstable with respect to transformation of LiH through LiAl. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,"Activation barriers; Covalent bonds; Hydrogen storage methods; Thermal decompostion; Atoms; Computational methods; Crystal structure; Decomposition; Dissociation; Hydrogen fuels; Lithium compounds; Neutron diffraction; Probability density function; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; X ray diffraction; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844243794

(Ca2+) in many excitable cells. The SR is a tabular network, which in smooth muscle (SM) cells distributes close to cellular periphery (superficial SR) and in deeper aspects of the cell (deep SR). Recent attention has focused on the regulation of cell function by the superficial SR, which can act as a buffer and also as a regulator of membrane channels and transporters. Ca2+ is released from the SR via two types of ionic channels [ryanodine- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated], whereas accumulation from the cytoplasm occurs exclusively by an energy-dependent sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump (SERCA). Within the SR, Ca2+ is bound to various storage proteins. Emerging evidence also suggests that the perinuclear portion of the SR may play an important role in nuclear transcription. In this review, we detail the pharmacology of agents that alter the functions of Ca2+ release channels and of SERCA. We describe their use and selectivity and indicate the concentrations used in investigating various SM preparations. Important aspects of cell regulation and excitation-contractile activity coupling in SM have been uncovered through the use of such activators and inhibitors of processes that determine SR function. Likewise, they were instrumental in the recent finding of an interaction of the SR with other cellular organelles such as mitochondria. Thus, an appreciation of the pharmacology and selectivity of agents that interfere with SR function in SM has greatly assisted in unveiling the multifaceted nature of the SR.",,"2 aminoethoxydiphenylborane; 2,5 di tert butylhydroquinone; 9 methyl 7 bromoeudistomin d; adenophostin A; adenophostin B; adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); beta escin; caffeine; calcium channel; calcium ion; cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose; cyclopiazonic acid; heparin; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor antibody; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody 18A10; plant extract; procaine; receptor antibody; ruthenium red; ryanodine; ryanodine receptor; sodium calcium exchange protein; thapsigargin; unclassified drug; xestospongin C; amino acid sequence; calcium cell level; calcium transport; cell interaction; cell membrane; drug mechanism; drug receptor binding; drug selectivity; drug structure; enzyme inhibition; human; mitochondrion; muscle contractility; nonhuman; organ distribution; priority journal; review; sarcoplasmic reticulum; smooth muscle; sodium calcium exchange; structure activity relation; Animals; Humans; Muscle, Smooth; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10644264370

The construction of the proposed force field, referred to as motion gradient vector flow (MGVF), is accomplished by minimizing an energy functional involving the motion direction, and the image gradient magnitude.

The sub-components of ΔQ S showed strong diurnal variability, although ground heat flux dominated the seasonal change of storage heat flux. The annual storage heat balance for the three complete years showed a small but consistent deficit averaging 16.18 MJ m -2 a -1. On a per-hour basis this is small compared with potential error highlighted in sensitivity testing of a range of methodological issues. Under-sampling of biomass temperature yielded the greatest uncertainty. Energy balance closure, determined by linear regression, found turbulent fluxes to underestimate available energy by 28% (r 2 = 0.92), with no statistically significant difference in closure found between years or between months. On a diurnal basis, weaker closure was associated with low friction velocity and low turbulent heat flux magnitude. Increasing turbulent flux block averaging time from 15 to 60 min resulted in a small improvement in closure at 60 min averages (2.5%). In addition, co-spectral corrections to the latent heat flux to account for long-tube damping effects generated a much larger improvement in closure (16%). The mean annual Bowen ratio was 0.59, ranged from 0.57 to 0.61 and inter-annual variability of all energy balance components over the period was very small (less than 6% departure from mean). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Despite intense interest in these TAG lipases, their molecular identities thus far are largely unknown. Sequence data base searches for proteins containing calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) dual signature nucleotide ((G/A)XGXXG) and lipase (GX-SXG) consensus sequence motifs identified a novel subfamily of three putative iPLA2/lipase family members designated iPLA2ε, iPLA2ζ, and iPLA2η (previously named adiponutrin, TTS-2.2, and GS2, respectively) of previously unknown catalytic function. Herein we describe the cloning, heterologous expression, and affinity purification of the three human isoforms of this iPLA2 subfamily in Sf9 cells, and we demonstrate that each possesses abundant TAG lipase activity. Moreover, iPLA2ε, iPLA2ζ, and iPLA 2η also possess acylglycerol transacylase activity utilizing mono-olein as an acyl donor which, in the presence of mono-olein or diolein acceptors, results in the synthesis of diolein and triolein, respectively. (E)-6-(Bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one, a mechanism-based suicide substrate inhibitor of all known iPLA2s, inhibits the triglyceride lipase activity of each of the three isoforms similarly (IC50 = 0.1-0.5 μM). Quantitative PCR revealed dramaticaly increased expression of iPLA2ε and iPLA 2ζ transcripts during the hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes and identified the presence of all three iPLA 2 isoforms in human SW872 liposarcoma cells. Collectively, these results identify three novel TAG lipases/acylglycerol transacylases that likely participate in TAG hydrolysis and the acyl-CoA independent transacylation of acylglycerols, thereby facilitating energy mobilization and storage in adipocytes.",,"Catalysis; Cells; Cloning; Data reduction; Glycerol; Hormones; Hydrolysis; Purification; Adipocytes; Affinity purification; Lipase; Triacylglycerol (TAG); Calcium; 6 (bromomethylene) 3 (1 naphthalenyl) 2h tetrahydropyran 2 one; acylglycerol; acylglycerol transacylase; acyltransferase; calcium; calcium independent phospholipase a2 epsilon; calcium independent phospholipase a2 eta; calcium independent phospholipase a2 zeta; enzyme inhibitor; glycerol dioleate; hormone; isoenzyme; phospholipase A2; tetrahydropyran derivative; triacylglycerol lipase; triolein; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell strain; controlled study; energy; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme purification; enzyme substrate; human; human cell; hydrolysis; IC 50; inhibition kinetics; liposarcoma; molecular cloning; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; protein family; protein processing; quantitative analysis; sarcoma cell; storage; synthesis; 3T3-L1 Cells; Acyltransferases; Adipocytes; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Blotting, Western; Calcium; Catalysis; Cell Line; Chromatography; Cloning, Molecular; Cytosol; Databases; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Diglycerides; DNA, Complementary; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Humans; Hydrolysis; Insects; Lipase; Lipid Metabolism; Liposarcoma; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Naphthalenes; Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors; Phospholipases A; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Pyrones; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Subcellular Fractions; Time Factors; Triolein; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10344262633

The studied cells should deliver about 184Wh/kg according to the military specification MIL-PRF-320521 while it delivers about 201 Wh/kg according to the general commercial standard. The difference in the cell specific energy is mainly caused by the difference in the charging voltage. It is 4.1 V in the military specification compared to 4.2 V in the general commercial standard. Clearly, to take full advantage of the commercial lithium-ion cell, either the military increases the voltage limit to 4.2 V from 4.1 V or the cell manufacturers redesign their cells according to the 4.1 V charging voltage limit. The studied cell exceeds all major military requirements including high rate discharging, high current pulse discharging, low temperature discharging, cycle life, high temperature storage, and abuse tolerances such as the overcharging, forced discharging, and external short. Specifically, the capacity of the cell exceeds the requirement by 51% at a high discharging rate (3.3 A) and by 39% with a high current (6 A) pulse. The cell can discharge not only ∼62% of the expected capacity at -30°C but also ∼47% at -40°C and at 0.67 A, which means that the military can extend their specification to -40°C. The cell still retained 1.97 Ah (or 92%) after 224 cycles, which exceeds the requirement by ∼9%. The cell retained 1.95 Ah (or 95%) after one-week storage at 50°C and at 4.1 V, which exceeds the requirement by 8%. The abuse tolerance is also very high. The maximum cell temperature ranged only from 62 to 70°C during overcharging, external short, and forced discharging. Directions for the improvement are also discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

With climate change increasingly likely, strategies to reduce carbon emissions and stabilize climate are needed, including greater energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, geoengineering, decarbonization, and geological and biological sequestration. Two of the most commonly proposed biological strategies are restoring organic carbon in agricultural soils and using plantations to sequester carbon in soils and wood. Here, we compare scenarios of land-based sequestration to emissions reductions arising from increased fuel efficiency in transportation, targeting ways to reduce net U.S. emissions by 10% (≈0.16 Pg of carbon per year). Based on mean sequestration rates, converting all U.S. croplands to no-till agriculture or retiring them completely could sequester ≈0.059 Pg of carbon per year for several decades. Summary data across a range of plantations reveal an average rate of carbon storage an order of magnitude larger than in agricultural soils; in consequence, one-third of U.S. croplands or 44 million hectares would be needed for plantations to reach the target of ≈0.16 Pg of carbon per year. For fossil fuel reductions, cars and light trucks generated ≈0.31 Pg of carbon in U.S. emissions in 2001. To reduce net emissions by 0.16 Pg of carbon per year, a doubling of fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks is needed, a change feasible with current technology. Issues of permanence, leakage, and economic potentials are discussed briefly, as is the recognition that such scenarios are only a first step in addressing total U.S. emissions.","Agriculture and plantations; Carbon sequestration; Fossil fuel emissions; Leakage and permanence; Soil organic carbon","carbon; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; carbon storage; climate; energy; energy resource; engineering; geology; priority journal; review; soil; United States; wood; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Motor Vehicles; Soil; Trees; United States; Wood",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8644247463

In the turkey, much of the force generated by the gastrocnemius muscle during locomotion is stored as elastic energy through deformation of the tendon. During growth and development, the leg tendons in some avians, including turkeys, mineralize and result in an increase in tensile strength and modulus. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effects of mineralization on elastic energy storage and transmission in turkey tendons. Elastic and viscous stress-strain curves and elastic energy storage behavior were used to compare the behavior of mineralized turkey gastrocnemius tendons and mineralized self-assembled type I collagen fibers. Based on analysis of these two systems, we concluded that a simple mineralized fibrillar collagenous substrate can mimic the behavior of a more complex fibrillar collagenous substrate such as mineralized turkey tendon; however, the exact mechanism of mineralization may be different between the two substrates. Changes in mechanical properties of turkey tendon were consistent with a model in which mineralization appears to increase the effective collagen fibril length by efficiently transferring stress between neighboring collagen fibrils. Mineralization in self-assembled collagen fibers increased elastic energy storage less efficiently as compared with turkey tendon suggesting that the non-collagenous components of mineralizing tissue may act to promote collagen fibril to collagen fibril interactions.

The trait, male reproductive success under competitive conditions (MCRS), is of central importance to both life-history and sexual-selection theory. We identified 27 candidate genes whose expression levels were associated with within-population variation in MCRS. 'High' MCRS was associated with low expression of a cytochrome P450 that causes pesticide resistance, suggesting a fitness cost to resistance. Two groups of metabolic proteins (glutathione transferases and phosphatases) were significantly over-represented, and a large portion of the candidates are genes involved in oxidative stress resistance, energy acquisition or energy storage. Genes expressed in accessory glands and testes were not over-represented among differentially expressed genes, but testis-expressed genes were significantly more likely to be upregulated in high MCRS genotypes. Finally, nine candidate genes that we identified had no previous functional annotation, and this experiment suggests that they play a role in male reproductive success. © 2004 The Royal Society.","Antioxidants; Cyp6g1; Gene expression; Male mating success; Microarrays; Quantitative genetics","cytochrome P450; glutathione transferase; phosphatase; Drosophila protein; gene expression; male; reproductive success; sexual selection; accessory sex gland; article; Cyp6g1 gene; DNA microarray; Drosophila melanogaster; gene; gene expression; gene identification; genetic variability; genomics; genotype; male; male genital system; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pesticide resistance; priority journal; quantitative genetics; reproductive success; sexual selection; animal; comparative study; Drosophila melanogaster; fertility; genetic variability; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; physiology; statistical model; Drosophila melanogaster; Animals; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Evolution, Molecular; Fertility; Gene Expression; Genotype; Linear Models; Male; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16644402888

Perilipins, the most abundant proteins on these lipid droplets, play a critical role in facilitating both triacylglycerol storage and hydrolysis. The stimulation of lipolysis by β-adrenergic agonists triggers rapid phosphorylation of perilipin and translocation of hormone-sensitive lipase to the surfaces of lipid droplets and more gradual fragmentation and dispersion of micro-lipid droplets. Because few lipid droplet-associated proteins have been identified in adipocytes, we isolated lipid droplets from basal and lipolytically stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and identified the component proteins by mass spectrometry. Structural proteins identified in both preparations include perilipin, S3-12, vimentin, and TIP47; in contrast, adipophilin, caveolin-1, and tubulin selectively localized to droplets in lipolytically stimulated cells. Lipid metabolic enzymes identified in both preparations include hormone-sensitive lipase, lanosterol synthase, NAD(P)-dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like protein, acyl-CoA synthetase, long chain family member (ACSL) 1, and CGI-58. 17-β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, type 7, was identified only in basal preparations, whereas ACSL3 and 4 and two short-chain reductase/dehydrogenases were identified on droplets from lipolytically stimulated cells. Additionally, both preparations contained FSP27, ribophorin I, EHD2, diaphorase I, and ancient ubiquitous protein. Basal preparations contained CGI-49, whereas lipid droplets from lipolytically stimulated cells contained several Rab GTPases and tumor protein D54. A close association of mitochondria with lipid droplets was suggested by the identification of pyruvate carboxylase, prohibitin, and a subunit of ATP synthase in the preparations. Thus, adipocyte lipid droplets contain specific structural proteins as well as lipid metabolic enzymes; the structural reorganization of lipid droplets in response to the hormonal stimulation of lipolysis is accompanied by increases in the relative mass of several proteins and the recruitment of additional proteins.",,"Alcohols; Cells; Hormones; Hydrolysis; Lipids; Mass spectrometry; Fragmentation; Lipid droplets; Lipid metabolic enzymes; Liposysis; Enzymes; caveolin 1; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; fat droplet; hormone sensitive lipase; lanosterol synthase; long chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligase; protein adipophilin; protein cgi 49; protein CGI 58; protein FSP27; protein perilipin; protein S3 12; protein tip47; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; pyruvate carboxylase; Rab protein; ribophorin I; steroid reductase; structural protein; testosterone 17beta dehydrogenase; tubulin; tumor protein; unclassified drug; vimentin; adipocyte; animal cell; article; basal cell; cell stimulation; cell strain 3T3; hormonal regulation; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence microscopy; lipolysis; mass spectrometry; mitochondrion; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein analysis; protein localization; proteomics; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Databases; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Immunoblotting; Lipids; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Proteome; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; Time Factors; Trypsin; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744267532

Med., Microbiol. and Immunol., Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States","Background: Therapy with some HIV protease inhibitors (PI) contributes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, by inhibition of insulin-sensitive glucose transporters. Atazanavir (ATV) is a new PI with substantially less in vitro effect on glucose transport than observed with other PI, including lopinavir (LPV) or ritonavir (RTV). Methods: Randomized, double-blind, crossover study of the effect of 5 days of administering ATV, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or placebo on insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in 30 healthy HIV-negative subjects. Each subject was studied on two of three possible treatments with a wash-out period between treatments. Results: The mean insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (mg/min per kg body weight) per unit insulin (μU/ml) (M/I) was 9.88, 9.80 and 7.52 for placebo, ATV and LPV/r, respectively (SEM, 0.84 for all). There was no significant difference between ATV and placebo. The M/I for LPV/r was 23% lower than that for ATV (P = 0.010) and 24% lower than that for placebo (P = 0.008). The mean glycogen storage rates were 3.85, 4.00 and 2.54 mg/min per kg for placebo, ATV and LPV/r, respectively (SEM, 0.39 for all). There was no significant difference between ATV and placebo. The glycogen storage rate for LPV/r was 36% lower than ATV (P = 0.003) and 34% lower than placebo (P = 0.006). Conclusions: ATV given to healthy subjects for 5 days did not affect insulin sensitivity, while LPV/r induced insulin resistance. This observation is consistent with differential in vitro effects of these PI on glucose transport.

An analytical description for the induced noise control is developed.

This paper reviews mechanisms by which the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may contribute to the metabolic syndrome, and explores the paradigm of a critical VAT threshold (CVATT). Exceeding the CVATT may result in a number of metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance to glucose uptake by cells. Metabolic profiles of patients with visceral obesity may substantially improve after only modest weight loss. This could reflect a significant reduction in the amount of VAT relative to peripheral or subcutaneous fat depots, thereby maintaining VAT below the CVATT. The CVATT may be unique for each individual. This may help explain the phenomena of apparently lean individuals with metabolic syndrome, the so-called metabolically normal weight (MONW), as well as the obese with normal metabolic profiles, i.e., metabolically normal obese (MNO), and those who are ""fit and fat."" The concept of CVATT may have implications for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, which may include controlling dietary carbohydrates. The identification of the CVATT is admittedly difficult and its anatomical boundaries are not well-defined. Thus, the CVATT will continue to be a work in progress. © 2004 Freedland; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acylation stimulating protein; adipocytokine; adiponectin; adipsin; agouti protein; angiotensin; angiotensinogen; bone morphogenetic protein; cytokine; estrogen; fatty acid; leptin; organochlorine derivative; plasminogen activator; prostaglandin; resistin; somatomedin binding protein; testosterone; transforming growth factor beta; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; abnormally low substrate concentration in blood; adipose tissue; age distribution; atherosclerosis; carbohydrate diet; cell differentiation; cell protection; cell transport; diet restriction; endocrine gland; energy balance; environmental factor; enzyme activity; ethnology; exercise; fibroblast; glucose transport; hormone action; hormone resistance; human; hypoleptinemia; hypothesis; insulin resistance; intermethod comparison; lean body weight; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; low birth weight; macrophage; maximum allowable concentration; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; overnutrition; pathophysiology; proadipocyte; protein expression; review; statistical significance; stress; subcutaneous fat; viscera; weight gain; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15544387164

The gut microbial community (microbiota) is essential for processing dietary polysaccharides. We found that conventionalization of adult germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice with a normal microbiota harvested from the distal intestine (cecum) of conventionally raised animals produces a 60% increase in body fat content and insulin resistance within 14 days despite reduced food intake. Studies of GF and conventionalized mice revealed that the microbiota promotes absorption of monosaccharides from the gut lumen, with resulting induction of de novo hepatic lipogenesis. Fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf), a member of the angiopoietin-like family of proteins, is selectively suppressed in the intestinal epithelium of normal mice by conventionalization. Analysis of GF and conventionalized, normal and Fiaf knockout mice established that Fiaf is a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor and that its suppression is essential for the microbiota-induced deposition of triglycerides in adipocytes. Studies of Rag1-/- animals indicate that these host responses do not require mature lymphocytes. Our findings suggest that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor that affects energy harvest from the diet and energy storage in the host.","Adiposity; Energy storage; Fasting-induced adipose factor; Nutrient processing; Symbiosis","angiopoietin; fasting induced adipocyte factor; monosaccharide; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal experiment; article; body fat; cell maturation; controlled study; germfree animal; insulin resistance; intestine flora; knockout mouse; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lymphocyte; metabolic rate; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; obesity; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; unindexed sequence; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blood Proteins; Dietary Fats; Digestive System; Energy Metabolism; Germ-Free Life; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipoprotein Lipase; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Data; Obesity; Triglycerides; Animalia; Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8144226856

Sch., 675 Hoes Ln., Piscataway, N., United States","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease characterized by cartilage degeneration, a thickening of subchondral bone, and formation of marginal osteophytes. Previous mechanical characterization of cartilage in our laboratory suggests that energy storage and dissipation is reduced in osteoarthritis as the extent of fibrillation and fissure formation increases. It is not clear whether the loss of energy storage and dissipation characteristics is a result of biochemical and/or biophysical changes that occur to hyaline cartilage in joints. The purpose of this study is to present data, on the strain rate dependence of the elastic and viscous behaviors of cartilage, in order to further characterize changes that occur in the mechanical properties that are associated with OA. We have previously hypothesized that the changes seen in the mechanical properties of cartilage may be due to altered mechanochemical transduction by chondrocytes. Results of incremental tensile stress-strain tests at strain rates between 100%/min and 10,000%/min conducted on OA cartilage indicate that the slope of the elastic stress-strain curve increases with increasing strain rate, unlike the reported behavior of skin and self-assembled collagen fibers. It is suggested that the strain-rate dependence of the elastic stress-strain curve is due to the presence of large quantities of proteoglycans (PGs), which protect articular cartilage by increasing the apparent stiffness. The increased apparent stiffness of articular cartilage at high strain rates may limit the stresses borne and prolong the onset of OA. It is further hypothesized that increased compressive loading of chondrocytes in the intermediate zone of articular cartilage occurs as a result of normal wear to the superficial zone or from excessive impact loading.

We selected fifty boys and girls aged 11 to 15, who were residents of slums in São Paulo, Brazil. Twenty were stunted (S) and thirty had normal stature (NS). The children's nutritional status and body composition were assessed through anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, at the beginning of the present study and after 3 years, and changes in lean mass (LM and LM%) and fat mass (FM and FM%) were calculated. Stunted boys accumulated more body fat (FM%: S=1.62%, NS=-3.40%; P=0.003) and gained less lean mass (LM%: S=-1.46, NS = 3.21%; P=0.004). Stunted girls gained less lean mass (S = 7.87kg, NS = 11.96kg; P=01.032) and had significantly higher values of FM% at follow-up when compared with their baseline values (P=0.008), whereas non-stunted girls had a non-significant difference in FM% over time (P=0.386). These findings are important to understand the factors involved in the increased prevalence of overweight and obesity among poor populations, which appear to be associated with hunger during infancy and/or childhood. © The Authors 2004.","Body composition; Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; Stunting; Undernutrition","adolescent; anthropometry; article; body composition; body fat; Brazil; calculation; childhood; childhood disease; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; follow up; growth retardation; human; hunger; infancy; lean body weight; lipid storage; male; malnutrition; nutritional status; obesity; population research; prevalence; prospective study; school child; sex difference; statistical significance; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Body Constitution; Body Mass Index; Child; Female; Growth Disorders; Humans; Male; Nutritional Status; Prospective Studies; Puberty; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9444229996

Enzyme replacement therapy engenders improvement in hematological and visceral parameters; however, improvement in bone density (BMD) with treatment has not been confirmed. This study presents follow-up of BMD in the first tenpatients in Israel treated with low-dose recombinant enzyme for up to 108 months. BMD at femoral neck and lumbar spine was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the start of the trial, after 3-6 months, after 18-24 months, and at the most recent follow-up. BMD in all patients was very low at onset and never normalized. There was a decrease in BMD in all patients at 3-6 months. Older patients (four women, two men; >30 years of age) showed some improvement in BMD during treatment. Younger patients (four females; 18-23 years of age) did not show a statistically significant improvement. These findings might reflect the failure of patients with Gaucher disease to achieve expected peak bone density at appropriate chronological milestones despite treatment. None-theless, the z-scores of the older patients were better than those of the younger patients, implying some catch-up period. Yet, some patients with Gaucher disease evince rapid onset of osteoporosis in early adulthood. Enzyme treatment per se, as well as attendant improved well-being and increased physical activity, may induce amelioration in BMD at this later stage. One may consider adding anti-osteoporosis therapy in young adults to induce earlier ""catch up"" to peak bone mass, and then enzyme replacement in later adulthood to prevent decrements in bone mass related to Gaucher cell infiltration.","Bone mineral density; DEXA; Enzyme replacement therapy; Gaucher disease; Osteoporosis","imiglucerase; adult; adulthood; article; bone density; bone mineral; cell infiltration; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme therapy; female; femur neck; follow up; Gaucher disease; human; Israel; lumbar spine; male; physical activity; priority journal; scoring system; statistical significance; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Bone Density; Female; Gaucher Disease; Glucosylceramidase; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Recombinant Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744297087

Process compatibility and memory operation of the device were investigated. Results show that Ge-NC have good thermal stability in the HfAlO matrix as indicated by the negative Gibbs free energy changes for both reactions of GeO2 + Hf → HfO2+Ge and 3GeO2 + 4Al → 2Al2O3+3Ge. This stability implies that the fabricated structure can be compatible with the standard CMOS process with the ability to sustain source-drain activation anneal temperatures. Compared with Si-NC embedded in HfO 2, Ge-NC embedded in HfAlO can provide more electron traps, thereby enlarging the memory window. It is also shown that this structure can achieve a low programming voltage of 6-7 V for fast programming, a long charge retention time of ten years maintaining a 0.7-V memory window, and good endurance characteristics of up to 10 6 rewrite cycles. This paper shows that the Ge-NC embedded in HfAlO is a promising candidate for further scaling of FG Flash memory devices. © 2004 IEEE.",,"CMOS integrated circuits; Electric potential; Electron traps; Electron tunneling; Embedded systems; Gibbs free energy; Hafnium compounds; Nanostructured materials; Nonvolatile storage; Semiconducting germanium; Thermodynamic stability; Floating gate (FG); Nonvolatile flash memory; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8144221080

At the ecosystem scale, this organization can be observed in the thermodynamic parameters that describe it, such that these parameters can be used to track ecosystem growth and development during succession. Thermodynamically, ecosystem growth is the increase of energy throughflow and stored biomass, and ecosystem development is the internal reorganization of these energy mass stores, which affect transfers, transformations, and time lags within the system. Several proposed hypotheses describe thermodynamically the orientation or natural tendency that ecosystems follow during succession, and here, we consider five: minimize specific entropy production, maximize dissipation, maximize exergy storage (includes biomass and information), maximize energy throughflow, and maximize retention time. These thermodynamic orientors were previously all shown to occur to some degree during succession, and here we present a refinement by observing them during different stages of succession. We view ecosystem succession as a series of four growth and development stages: boundary, structural, network, and informational. We demonstrate how each of these ecological thermodynamic orientors behaves during the different growth and development stages, and show that while all apply during some stages only maximizing energy throughflow and maximizing exergy storage are applicable during all four stages. Therefore, we conclude that the movement away from thermodynamic equilibrium, and the subsequent increase in organization during ecosystem growth and development, is a result of system components and configurations that maximize the flux of useful energy and the amount of stored exergy. Empirical data and theoretical models support these conclusions. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Ecosystems; Exergy; Network analysis; Succession; Thermodynamics","ecosystem; succession; thermodynamics; article; biomass distribution; ecosystem regeneration; ecosystem restoration; energy transfer; entropy; microbial biomass; theoretical model; thermodynamics; Animals; Biomass; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Humans; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Selection (Genetics)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7544236537

Way prediction has been presented as one means of scaling the fetch engine to shorter cycle times, while providing energy efficient instruction cache accesses. However, way prediction requires additional complexity to handle mispredictions. In this paper, we examine a high-bandwidth fetch architecture augmented with an instruction cache way predictor. We compare the performance and energy efficiency of this architecture to both a serial access cache and a parallel access cache. Our results show that a serial fetch architecture achieves approximately the same energy reduction and performance as way prediction architectures, without the added structures and recovery complexity needed for way prediction. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These results establish that strong Pt-Ti intermetallic bonding provides sufficient driving force for thermal interdiffusion of Ti and Pt at a (111)-oriented interface at 700 K (427 °C), even in the absence of oxygen and a minimal influence of grain boundaries. Identification of this critical temperature provides additional fundamental information for Ti/Pt bilayer film processing considerations. This data was obtained by using He+-ISS to monitor the concentration of Ti in the topmost surface layer as a function of temperature. In these studies, we define 1 dose unit (DU) to be the amount of deposited Ti that is required to eliminate the Pt signal in He+-ISS. This amount should be close to that required to produce a one-monolayer Ti film, but it could exceed one monolayer of Ti if alloying or clustering occurs on the substrate at 300 K under these deposition conditions. For Ti films less than 1 DU, heating to 700 K slightly decreased the Ti surface concentration. Higher annealing temperatures of up to 950 K caused extensive loss of surface Ti, and this is attributed to Ti diffusion into the Pt crystal sub-surface region. For a 1-DU Ti film, temperatures of 750-800 K were required to cause sufficient interdiffusion so that Pt atoms were detected in the topmost layer, strongly suggesting that the 1-DU Ti film was more thermally stable than those of lower Ti coverage. Thicker Ti films of greater than 1 DU required temperatures of 800-1050 K before any change was detected in the Ti surface concentration as probed by the He +-ISS signal intensity. After annealing to temperatures higher than 1000 K, XPS revealed a chemical shift for the Ti (2p) peaks of 1.5 eV to higher binding energy, indicating formation of a Ti/Pt alloy. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In wild-type (WT) grain both the embryo and rest-of-grain (aleurone layer) contained about 10 and 90% of whole-grain total P and Ins P. Most of the inositol phosphate (Ins P) was phytic acid. Proportional reductions in both embryo and aleurone layer Ins P contributed to whole-grain Ins P6 reductions in M 635 and M 955, with little effect on embryo or aleurone layer total P. In terms of total P these mutations show no grain-tissue-specificity. In contrast, whole-grain Ins P6 reduction in lpa1-1 and lpa2-1 is solely or largely aleurone layer specific. In lpa1-1 the distribution of total P shifted in part, from rest-of-grain to embryo, with a net reduction in total P. Electron microscopy showed a general reduction, as compared with WT, in electron-dense globoids in both aleurone and scutellum cells in all mutants except lpa2-1, whose globoid morphology appeared indistinguishable from WT. Energy-dispersive X-ray analyses of P, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, and Zn indicated that, generally, relative levels were similar in mutant and WT aleurone layer and scutellum tissues. Likely inorganic P found in lpa grains is stored as salts of K and Mg, as is Ins P6 in WT grain. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Biochem., The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA, United States","Neural membrane phospholipids are hydrolyzed by a group of enzymes known as phospholipases. This process results in the generation of second messengers such as arachidonic acid, eicosanoids, platelet activating factor, and diacylglycerols. High levels of these metabolites are neurotoxic and are associated with neurodegeneration. The collective evidence from many studies suggests that neural membrane phospholipid metabolism is disturbed in neural trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. This disturbance is caused by the stimulation of phospholipases A 2. Stimulation of these enzymes produces changes in membrane permeability, fluidity, and alteration in ion homeostasis. Low calcium influx produces mild oxidative stress and results in neurodegeneration promoted by apoptosis, whereas a calcium overload generates high oxidative stress and causes neurodegeneration associated with necrosis. Alterations in phospholipid metabolism along with the accumulation of lipid peroxides and compromised energy metabolism may be responsible for neurodegeneration in ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head injury, and Alzheimer disease. The synthesis of phospholipases A 2 inhibitors that cross the blood-brain barrier without harm may be useful for the treatment of acute neural trauma and neurodegenerative diseases.","apoptosis; calcium influx; necrosis; neurodegeneration; oxidative stress; Phospholipases","alpha tocopherol; antimalarial agent; arachidonic acid; citicoline; diacylglycerol; enzyme; icosanoid; lipid peroxide; membrane phospholipid; mepacrine; phospholipase; phospholipase A2; phospholipase A2 inhibitor; phospholipase C; phospholipase D; thrombocyte activating factor; Alzheimer disease; apoptosis; blood brain barrier; brain; calcium transport; cell membrane fluidity; degenerative disease; energy metabolism; head injury; homeostasis; human; hydrolysis; ischemia; lipid storage; membrane permeability; metabolite; necrosis; nerve cell lesion; nerve degeneration; nerve membrane; neurologic disease; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; phospholipid metabolism; priority journal; review; second messenger; spinal cord injury; stimulation; Animals; Brain Chemistry; Humans; Isoenzymes; Membranes; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Phospholipases A; Phospholipids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042539683

Resin bonded dentin specimens were prepared using a total-etch adhesive (One-Step Plus) applied as multiple consecutive coating, or using two self-etch adhesive systems (iBond or Fluoro Bond). For the total-etch adhesive, resin application and air evaporation were performed 1, 2, 3, or 4 times. The self-etch adhesives were applied according to manufacturers' instructions. Resin-dentin bonded beams were prepared and immersed in water (control) or ammoniacal silver nitrate. After storage, microtensile bond strengths were measured. The fractured surfaces were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). No significant differences in bond strength were found between water and silver nitrate storage groups. Several types of silver depositions (spotted, reticular, or water trees) were found in adhesive joints. The bond strengths of the single coated specimens of the total-etch adhesive were significantly lower than those receiving 2-4 coatings. Single coats produced more nanoleakage than multiple coats. However, no correlation was found between the bond strengths and nanoleakage between the different adhesives (total-etch adhesive with different conditions or self-etch adhesives). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This was used to produce bone remodelling predictions for an implanted thrust plate prosthesis (Centerpulse Orthopedics Limited) in a patient specific bone model. The analysis was then repeated using different mechanical signals to drive the remodelling algorithm. The results of these simulations were then compared to the patient-specific clinical data, to distinguish which of the candidate signals produced predictions consistent with the clinical evidence. Good agreement was found for a range of strain energy based signals and also deviatoric remodelling signals.

NETL is partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in developing new directions in research under the Solid-State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) initiative for the development and commercialization of modular, low cost, and fuel flexible SOFC systems. The SECA initiative, through advanced materials, processing and system integration research and development, will bring the fuel cell cost to $400 per kilowatt (kW) for stationary and auxiliary power unit (APU) markets. The President of the U.S. has launched us into a new hydrogen economy. The logic of a hydrogen economy is compelling. The movement to a hydrogen economy will accomplish several strategic goals. The U.S. can use its own domestic resources - solar, wind, hydro, and coal. The U.S. uses 20 percent of the world's oil but has only 3 percent of resources. Also. the U.S. can reduce green house gas emissions. Clear Skies and Climate Change initiatives aim to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. SOFCs have no emissions, so they figure significantly in these DOE strategies. In addition, DG - SOFCs, reforming, energy storage has significant benefit for enhanced security and reliability. The use of fuel cells in cars is expected to bring about the hydrogen economy. However, commercialization of fuel cells is expected to proceed first through portable and stationary applications. This logic says to develop SOFCs for a wide range of stationary and APU applications, initially for conventional fuels, then switch to hydrogen. Like all fuel cells, the SOFC will operate even better on hydrogen than conventional fuels. The SOFC hybrid is a key part of the FutureGen plants. FutureGen is a major new Presidential initiative to produce hydrogen from coal. The highly efficient SOFC hybrid plant will produce electric power and other parts of the plant could produce hydrogen and sequester CO2. The hydrogen produced can be used in fuel cell cars and for SOFC DG applications.

S. military. They are paramount to the tactical performance of advanced electronic systems such as Night Vision Goggles, GPS systems, and laser target designators. The modern ""digitized"" U.S. military relies extensively on these electronic technologies and others as they are fully integrated into combat environments. However, the demand for these electronic systems, as well as new tactical capabilities, is outpacing the supply of available power and energy devices. Recent studies from Iraq show that standard military power and energy systems, such as generators and batteries, were in high demand but short supply, which often limited operational speed and capalilities. In an effort to improve upon existing military power generation and energy storage devices, the Army's Research, Development, and Engineering Centers (RDECs) are evaluating innovative technologies such as fuel cells for military applications. A variety of programs at the U.S. ARMY Communictions-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Fuel Cell lab are serving to fill the power and energy gap for soldier-based platforms. CERDEC serves as a test, evaluation, and program management center focaused on transitioning integrated systems from the labs to the users. CERDEC has adopted a ""systems of systems"" approach to the development and testing of military fuel cell units and strives to develop completely packaged systems in order to rapidly transition fuel cell technology into the field. This paper will address current Army Communications-Electronics Research Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) fuel cell technology programs and their adaptation into military environments.

To do so, one must utilize crystalloid or colloid osmotic agents to achieve ultrafiltration. These osmotic agents are systemically absorbed and thus have both potential benefits and adverse effects. With glucose-based dialysate solutions, the average patient absorbs 300-450 kcal of glucose per day on either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or the cycler. The amount of glucose absorbed varies based on peritoneal transport characteristics, prescription, and tonicity of fluids used. Alternative osmotic agents such as amino acids and macromolecular solutions, including polypeptides and polyglucose (icodextrin) solutions, have a different rate of systemic absorption and thus a different caloric load profile. In addition, there are protein losses that average about 10 g/day with glucose-based solutions and glucose losses with either amino acid or icodextrin dialysate solutions. There are also potential advantages of these alternative solutions with regard to ultrafiltration. Glucose-based solutions require the development of significant crystalloid osmotic forces, which are dissipated as glucose is absorbed systemically. In contrast, macromolecular solutions achieve ultrafiltration via differences in colloid osmotic pressure, and the absorption of these agents is of a lesser magnitude than glucose-based solutions, Further research is needed to determine other potential risks and benefits of these alternative dialysate solutions.",,"amino acid; glucose; icodextrin; insulin; osmotic agent; polypeptide; acute kidney failure; blood storage; calorie; colloid; crystalloid; dialysate; diet supplementation; extracellular space; glomerulus filtration; glucose absorption; health hazard; hemodialysis; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hyperlipidemia; kidney metabolism; kidney tubule absorption; liquid; macromolecule; membrane transport; oncotic pressure; peritoneal dialysis; peritonitis; protein depletion; protein malnutrition; rash; review; ultrafiltration; uremia; Amino Acids; Dialysis Solutions; Energy Intake; Glucans; Glucose; Hemofiltration; Humans; Osmosis; Peritoneal Dialysis; Sweetening Agents",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12144284008

Accurate projection of future climate change depends on proper accounting of these biological feedbacks. Similarly, projections of future climate change must include the potential for nonlinear responses such as thermohaline circulation (THC) weakening, which is increasingly evident in paleoclimate reconstructions and model experiments. This article uses offline simulations with the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) to determine long-term biophysical and biogeochemical responses to climate patterns generated by the third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model (HadCM3) under forced THC weakening. Total land surface carbon storage decreases by 0.5% in response to THC weakening, suggesting that the biogeochemical response would not constitute a significant climate feedback under this climate change scenario. In contrast, large regional and local changes in leaf area index (LAI) suggest that biophysical responses may constitute significant feedbacks to at least local and regional climate. Indeed, the LAI responses do lead to changes in midday direct and diffuse beam albedo over large regions of the land surface. As a result, there are large local and regional changes in the land surface's capacity to absorb solar radiation. Changes in energy partitioning between sensible and latent heat fluxes also occur. However, the change in latent heat flux from the land surface is primarily attributable to changes that occur under forced THC weakening and not a result of the subsequent changes in vegetation. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Diffusion; Heat flux; Solar radiation; Transpiration; Biophysics; Climate patterns; Geochemistry; biogeochemical cycle; biophysics; climate change; feedback mechanism; thermohaline circulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244265972

These results demonstrate that the surface reconstruction of the substrate and the periodicity determine the magnetic structure of the MnAs/GaAs superlattices. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,"High-density information storage; Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED); Spin injection; Surface reconstruction; Crystal structure; Ferromagnetism; Gallium compounds; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetization; Molecular beam epitaxy; Superlattices; Thermodynamic properties; Time varying systems; Semiconducting manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044223511

We used intermittent morphine treatment to examine the relationships between stress-induced changes in energy balance and hypothalamo-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) activity and the recovery thereafter. We studied the effects of morphine injections on energy balance, hormones and fat stores, brain neuropeptide expression, and the ACTH and corticosterone responses to restraint 12 hr after the final injection and 8 d later during recovery. Weight gain, food intake, and caloric efficiency decreased at morphine onset, and these were maintained throughout the morphine injections. At 12 hr, fat stores, leptin, insulin, and testosterone concentrations were reduced. Subsequently, body weight gain and food intake increased and caloric efficiency was above control during the final days. By the eighth recovery day, fat stores and peripheral hormones were no longer depressed. At 12 hr, an over-response of CRF mRNA to restraint occurred in the hypothalamus, similar to the facilitated ACTH and corticosterone responses. On day 8, the hypothalamic CRF mRNA response to restraint was still facilitated, opposite to inhibited ACTH responses. Hypothalamic CRF mRNA correlated highly with mesenteric fat weight in morphine-treated rats. We conclude that there is a prolonged recovery from chronic stressors involving interrelated changes in energy balance and HPA activity. Nonetheless, 8 d after withdrawal from morphine, rats still display facilitated central stress responses, similar to the HPA symptoms described in posttraumatic stress disorder patients. Repeated partial withdrawal associated with intermittent morphine treatment, compounded by complete withdrawal associated with termination of the treatment, is likely required for these metabolic and HPA derangements.","AVP; CRF; Dependence; Energy balance; HPA axis; Metabolism; Morphine; NPY; Opioid; POMC; PTSD; Stress; Withdrawal","corticosterone; corticotropin; corticotropin releasing factor; hormone; messenger RNA; morphine; neuropeptide; neuropeptide Y; animal experiment; conference paper; controlled study; drug intermittent therapy; drug withdrawal; energy balance; food intake; hormone action; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus; lipid storage; male; metabolism; molecular biology; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; rat; stress; time; weight gain; Animals; Arginine Vasopressin; Body Weight; Brain; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Drug Administration Schedule; Energy Metabolism; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Morphine; Neuropeptide Y; Neuropeptides; Organ Size; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Messenger; Stress; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome; Time Factors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044222717

Self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that realistically incorporate all of these processes are not yet computationally feasible, although some elements can now be studied with reasonable fidelity. Here we consider the manner in which turbulent compressible convection within the bulk of the solar convection zone can generate large-scale magnetic fields through dynamo action. We accomplish this through a series of three-dimensional numerical simulations of MHD convection within rotating spherical shells using our anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code on massively parallel supercomputers. Since differential rotation is a key ingredient in all dynamo models, we also examine here the nature of the rotation profiles that can be sustained within the deep convection zone as strong magnetic fields are built and maintained. We find that the convection is able to maintain a solar-like angular velocity profile despite the influence of Maxwell stresses, which tend to oppose Reynolds stresses and thus reduce the latitudinal angular velocity contrast throughout the convection zone. The dynamo-generated magnetic fields exhibit a complex structure and evolution, with radial fields concentrated in downflow lanes and toroidal fields organized into twisted ribbons that are extended in longitude and achieve field strengths of up to 5000 G. The flows and fields exhibit substantial kinetic and magnetic helicity although systematic hemispherical patterns are only apparent in the former. Fluctuating fields dominate the magnetic energy and account for most of the back-reaction on the flow via Lorentz forces. Mean fields are relatively weak and do not exhibit systematic latitudinal propagation or periodic polarity reversals as in the Sun. This may be attributed to the absence of a tachocline, i.e., a penetrative boundary layer between the convection zone and the deeper radiative interior possessing strong rotational shear. The influence of such a layer will await subsequent studies.","Convection; MHD; Sun: magnetic fields; Turbulence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044264574

Odum's systems-based understanding of energy transformation dynamics, which ultimately resulted in his emergy-based methods of ecosystem and environmental policy analysis. Odum's formulation of the principle emphasized the selective advantage potentially available to systems that acquire useful energy at the maximum rate possible within their environments, with energy deemed useful if it reinforces production through increased available energy acquisition. Based on this principle, Odum postulated a correspondence of the maintenance requirements of energy fluxes with their contributions to system power acquisition. A quantitative correlate with usefulness is thus provided by emergy, i.e., by the available energy of one kind used directly or indirectly to maintain storages and flows. A more explicit and precise understanding of the energetics of self-organization was thus suggested, and Odum accordingly reformulated the principle as selection for maximum rate of emergy acquisition (i.e., empower), which provides the standard for assessment of system adaptedness in current methods of emergy analysis. The many corollary hypotheses derived from the principle include the selective prevalence of intermediate efficiencies and process rates and of pulsing dynamics, emergy hierarchies, and territoriality under appropriate energy-influx regimes. Assessments of socioeconomic and environmental alternatives might be further improved by integrating this principle with modern theories of multilevel selection. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The breakthroughs of recent years: realization of beam energy recovery in superconducting linear accelerators; flat to round beam transformations; and new beam transport concepts (discontinuous solenoid, circulator rings, hollow beams, dispersive cooling); have promoted the feasibility of efficient electron cooling of intense high energy hadron beams. Electron cooling, in cooperation with strong SRF fields in storage rings, will allow one to obtain very short hadron bunches, as result of which the luminosity can be raised by making a low beta-star. Short bunches also would make feasible crab crossing, that allows one to remove the parasitic beam-beam interactions and maximize the collision rate. Cooling also results in flatness of uncoupled beam equilibrium; this can be used to diminish the IBS impact on luminosity. The staged cooling agenda will be discussed and illustrated. Evaluation of these advances leads one to consider that luminosity levels (in units of cm-2s-1) of 1035 in future electron-ion colliders at the hadron energy up to 150 GeV and 1037 in hadron colliders at the energy range 1-7 TeV might be feasible. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,"Computer simulation; Electron beams; Electron scattering; High energy physics; Luminescence; Mathematical models; Optimization; Particle beam bunching; Storage rings; Synchrotron radiation; Beam transformation; Electron cooling; Hadron beams; Colliding beam accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644282842

The emittance growth from IBS determines the ultimate luminosity lifetime and the only cure is cooling. Full-energy electron cooling will be installed to not only control emittance growth but also reduce emittances during a store. Before that, stochastic cooling could increase integrated luminosity by momentum cooling. Two significant benefits would follow; the average luminosity in a 10 h store would double, and the problem of coasting beam in the abort gap would be solved. Of course high-frequency bunched beam stochastic cooling is required and previous attempts at this at the TEVATRON and SPS were not successful. It appears that the conditions in the heavy ion collider are more favorable. First, the high charge state of ions gives better signal to noise ratio in the Schottky signal. Second, the anomalous coherent components in the pick up signals that caused saturation in the electronics in previous attempts are greatly reduced. Measurements of Schottky signals from gold beam in RHIC at 100 GeV and longitudinal beam transfer functions are presented to illustrate these points. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Collider; Heavy ion; Stochastic cooling","Colliding beam accelerators; Electron energy levels; Heavy ions; High energy physics; Luminescence; Mathematical models; Natural frequencies; Problem solving; Protons; Signal processing; Storage rings; Fractional energy; Intra-beam scattering; Stochastic cooling; Ion beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644258850

However, the recent appearance in the market of several electronic personal dosemeters for neutrons presents a challenge to the exclusive use of passive systems for primary or official dosimetry. This scenario drives research and development activities on passive dosemeters towards systems offering greater accuracy of response and lower detection limits. In addition, further applications and properties of the passive detectors, which are not met by the electronic devices, are also being explored. In particular, extensive investigations are in progress on the use of solid-state detectors for aviation and space dosimetry, where high-energy neutron fields are encountered. The present situation is also stimulating an acceleration in the development of international standards on performance and test requirements for passive dosimetry systems, which can expedite significantly the implementation of techniques in commercial personal dosimetry services. Upcoming standards will cover thermoluminescence albedo dosemeters, etched-track detectors, superheated emulsions and direct ion storage chambers, attesting to the level of maturity reached by these techniques.

Battelle staff are performing the shielding calculations that will determine appropriate shielding so that the facility workers will not exceed target exposure levels. The target exposure levels for workers in the facility are 5 mSv y-1 for the whole body and 100 mSv y-1 for the extremity, which presents a significant challenge to the designers of a facility that will process tons of radioactive material. The design effort depended on shielding calculations to determine appropriate thickness and composition for glove box walls, and concrete wall thicknesses for storage vaults. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) staff used ORIGEN-S and SOURCES to generate gamma and neutron source terms, and Monte Carlo (computer code for) neutron photon (transport) (MCNP-4C) to calculate the radiation transport in the facility. The shielding calculations were performed by a team of four scientists, so it was necessary to develop a consistent methodology. There was also a requirement for the study to be cost-effective, so efficient methods of evaluation were required. The calculations were subject to rigorous scrutiny by internal and external reviewers, so acceptability was a major feature of the methodology. Some of the issues addressed in the development of the methodology included selecting appropriate dose factors, developing a method for handling extremity doses, adopting an efficient method for evaluating effective dose equivalent in a non-uniform radiation field, modelling the reinforcing steel in concrete, and modularising the geometry descriptions for efficiency. The relative importance of the neutron dose equivalent compared with the gamma dose equivalent varied substantially depending on the specific shielding conditions and lessons were learned from this effect.

Because overweight/obesity are defined as an excess of adipose tissue mass, all approaches in prevention and treatment must consider redirecting lipid storage in adipose tissue to oxidative metabolism. Lipid partitioning is a complex process that involves interaction between fat and other macronutrients, particularly carbohydrate. In an isocaloric environment, when fat is stored carbohydrate is oxidized and vice versa. Processes that influence fat partitioning in a manner in which weight is maintained must be modified by changes in organ-specific fat transport and metabolism. When therapy is considered, however, changes in lipid partitioning alone will be ineffective unless a negative energy balance is also achieved, i.e. energy expenditure exceeds energy intake. The intent of this review is to focus on molecules including hormones, enzymes, cytokines, membrane transport proteins, and transcription factors directly involved in fat trafficking and partitioning that could be potential drug targets. Some examples of favorably altering body composition by systemic and/or tissue specific modification of these molecules have already been provided with gene knockout and/or transgenic approaches in mice.

They are able of producing high current pulses required in many pulsed power applications with at least one order of magnitude higher energy density than capacitive storage with similar discharge characteristics. However, the main concern with MFCGs is their intrinsic flux loss that limits severely their performance and which is not yet well understood. In general, all flux losses have a differing degree of impact, depending on the generator's volume, current and energy amplification, size of the driven load, and angular frequency of armature-helix contact point. Although several computer models have been developed in the open literature, none of them truly quantify, starting from basic physics principles, the ohmic and intrinsic flux losses in helical MFCGs. This paper describes a novel method that provides a separate calculation of intrinsic flux losses (flux that is left behind in the conductors and lost for compression) and ohmic losses, being especially easy to implement and fast to calculate. We also provide a second method that uses a simple flux quantification, making a mathematical connection between the intrinsic flux losses, quantified by the first method, and the intrinsic flux losses observed in the generators. This second method can also be used to a priori estimate the MFCG performance. Further, we will show experimental and calculated data and discuss the physical efficiency limits and scaling of generator performance at small sizes. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Calculations; Computer simulation; Electric currents; Electric discharges; Electric losses; Magnetic flux; Ohmic contacts; Contact mechanical factors; Eletroexplosive devices; Helical magnetic flux compression generators; Intrinsic flux losses; Ohmic flux losses; Magnetos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8144229473

In principle, antiproton drivers could provide a profound reduction in system mass for advanced space propulsion by ICF. We examine the physics underlying the use of antiprotons (̄p) to drive various classes of high-yield ICF targets by the methods of volumetric ignition, hotspot ignition and fast ignition. The useable fraction of annihilation deposition energy is determined for both ̄p-driven ablative compression and ̄p-driven fast ignition, in association with zero- and one-dimensional target burn models. Thereby, we deduce scaling laws for the number of injected antiprotons required per capsule, together with timing and focal spot requirements. The kinetic energy of the injected antiproton beam required to penetrate to the desired annihilation point is always small relative to the deposited annihilation energy. We show that heavy metal seeding of the fuel and/or ablator is required to optimize local deposition of annihilation energy and determine that a minimum of ∼3 × 10 15 injected antiprotons will be required to achieve high yield (several hundred megajoules) in any target configuration. Target gains - i.e. fusion yields divided by the available p-̄p annihilation energy from the injected antiprotons (1.88 GeV/̄p) - range from ∼3 for volumetric ignition targets to ∼600 for fast ignition targets. Antiproton-driven ICF is a speculative concept, and the handling of antiprotons and their required injection precision - temporally and spatially - will present significant technical challenges. The storage and manipulation of low-energy antiprotons, particularly in the form of antihydrogen, is a science in its infancy and a large scale-up of antiproton production over present supply methods would be required to embark on a serious R&amp;D programme for this application.",,"Constraint theory; Elementary particles; Engineering research; Heavy metals; Kinetic energy; Mathematical models; Antiprotons; Energy content; Solid angles; Specific energy; Inertial confinement fusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7544237622

However, tans was independent of MAPP retention. Interfacial bonding strength was related to these moduli at low MAPP retention levels, but the correlation between interfacial bonding strength and moduli was not so significant at high MAPP retention.

An analysis of monthly flux anomalies showed that above-average spring and fall temperatures were significantly correlated with greater monthly C uptake while above-average summer temperatures were correlated with decreased net C uptake. Summer months with significantly drier or wetter soils than normal were also characterized by lower rates of C uptake. Years with above-average C storage were thus typically characterized by warmer than average spring and fall temperatures and adequate summer soil moisture. Environmental and forest-atmosphere flux data recorded from a second tower surrounded by similar forest, but sufficiently distant that flux source regions ('footprints'), did not overlap significantly showed almost identical temperature and solar radiation conditions, but some differences in energy partitioning could be seen. Half-hourly as well as integrated (annual) C exchange values recorded at the separate towers were very similar, with average annual net C uptake differing between the two towers by &lt;6%.

An aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (pH 9, 42°C) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. This process was characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. The metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. The maximum degradation rate Vmax and the apparent Km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day 1) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively.

Multiple scale filtering based on the analysis of local intensity structure using the Hessian matrix is used to effectively enhance vessel structures with various diameters. The level set method is then applied to automatically segment vessels enhanced by the filtering with a speed function derived from enhanced MRA images. Since the goal of this paper is to obtain highly accurate vessel borders, suitable for use in fluid flow simulations, in a subsequent step, the vessel surface determined by the level set method is triangulated using 3-D Delaunay triangulation and the resulting surface is used as a parametric deformable model. Energy minimization is then performed within a variational setting with a first-order internal energy; the external energy is derived from 3-D image gradients. Using the proposed method, vessels are accurately segmented from MRA data.","3-D Delaunay triangulation; Filtering; Geometric deformable models; Level set methods; Multiple scale analysis; Vessel segmentation","Computerized tomography; Diseases; Flow of fluids; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Patient monitoring; 3-D Delaunay triangulation; Geometric deformable models; Level set methods; Multiple scale analysis; Vessel segmentation; Angiography; algorithm; artery; article; automated pattern recognition; biological model; carotid artery obstruction; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; elasticity; evaluation; human; image enhancement; image quality; image subtraction; information retrieval; instrumentation; magnetic resonance angiography; mathematical computing; methodology; pathology; pathophysiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Algorithms; Arteries; Carotid Stenosis; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Elasticity; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Models, Cardiovascular; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344280121

The gallop gait is the preferred high-speed gait of most cursorial quadrupeds. To gallop, an animal must generate ballistic trajectories with characteristic strong impacts, coordinate leg movements with asymmetric footfall phasing, and effectively use compliant members, all the while maintaining dynamic stability. In this paper we seek to further understand the primary biological features necessary for galloping by building and testing a robotic quadruped similar in size to a large goat or antelope. These features include high-speed actuation, energy storage, on-line learning control, and high-performance attitude sensing. Because body dynamics are primarily influenced by the impulses delivered by the legs, the successful design and control of single leg energetics is a major focus of this work. The leg stores energy during flight by adding tension to a spring acting across an articulated knee. During stance, the spring energy is quickly released using a novel capstan design. As a precursor to quadruped control, two intelligent strategies have been developed for verification on a one-legged system. The Levenberg-Marquardt on-line learning method is applied to a simple heuristic controller and provides good control over height and forward velocity. Direct adaptive fuzzy control, which requires no system modeling but is more computationally expensive, exhibits better response. Using these techniques we have been successful in operating one leg at speeds necessary for a dynamic gallop of a machine of this scale. Another necessary component of quadruped locomotion is high-resolution and high-bandwidth attitude sensing. The large ground impact accelerations, which cause problems for any single traditional sensor, are overcome through the use of an inertial sensing approach using updates from optical sensors and vehicle kinematics.","Fuzzy logic; Gallop; Intelligent control; Quadruped","Bandwidth; Energy storage; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy sets; Gait analysis; Heuristic methods; Intelligent control; Optical sensors; Springs (components); System stability; Dynamic stability; Gallop; Learning control; Quadruped; Systems analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344244515

P., United States; Cobb, J.R., Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University, USA, United States","Competition for mating territories in libellulid dragonflies involves aerial contests that require high levels of exertion and locomotor performance. Here we test the hypothesis that success of male Libellula pulchella dragonflies in territoriality and mating is affected by muscle contractile performance, and we examine how gregarine gut parasites affect muscle performance, energy reserves and territorial behaviour of their hosts. At a pond where gregarine parasites are rare, long-term territorial and mating success of males showed a significant positive association with muscle power output. At a nearby pond that had a much higher incidence and intensity of gregarine parasitism, there was no relationship between muscle performance and short-term territorial success. Instead, males assorted themselves into aggressive territory holders and submissive satellites, with the large majority of territory holders having no parasites and nearly all of the satellites parasitized. Unparasitized males showed a tight positive relationship between muscle power and fat content, which suggests that they use a known phenotypic adjustment in muscle contractile performance to allow the energy consumption rate of the flight muscles to match the rate at which energy can be mobilized from storage pools. Parasitized dragonflies showed a small decrease in average fat content and a marked change in the relationship between fat content and muscle power output. The apparent loss of the ability to match muscle contractility to the size of the energy storage pool in parasitized dragonflies suggests that gregarines may have systemic effects on signalling pathways and energy homeostasis. By indirectly choosing males that had successfully competed for territories, females consistently mated with physiologically or immunologically superior males despite large between-pond differences in male behaviour and the incidence and intensity of parasitic infection. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, metabolic target genes downstream of ERRα have not been well defined. To identify ERRα-regulated pathways in tissues with high energy demand such as the heart, gene expression profiling was performed with primary neonatal cardiac myocytes overexpressing ERRα. ERRα upregulated a subset of PGC-1α target genes involved in multiple energy production pathways, including cellular fatty acid transport, mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial respiration. These results were validated by independent analyses in cardiac myocytes, C2C12 myotubes, and cardiac and skeletal muscle of ERRα-/- mice. Consistent with the gene expression results, ERRα increased myocyte lipid accumulation and fatty acid oxidation rates. Many of the genes regulated by ERRα are known targets for the nuclear receptor PPARα, and therefore, the interaction between these regulatory pathways was explored. ERRα activated PPARα gene expression via direct binding of ERRα to the PPARα gene promoter.

PGC-1α was also shown to activate ERRα gene expression.

My colleagues and I investigated whether an analysis of donor heart viability predicts recovery of grafts challenged with a 24-hour preservation interval. Methods Dog hearts underwent cold static storage (CS) for 8 hours (n = 8) or 24 hours (n = 2) or CP for 24 hours with cold asanguinous, oxygenated solution (n = 8). Myocardial systolic and diastolic function and oxygen and lactate consumption were assessed at base line, during CP, and after Langendorff blood reperfusion. Base line endothelial function was evaluated by the percentage transcoronary change ([coronary sinus - aorta]/aorta) in myeloperoxidase and by platelet function and coronary flow reserve after 20 seconds of coronary artery occlusion. During CP, the endothelium was assessed by transcoronary protein release and coronary resistance. Edema was assessed by weight gain and histology. Results Base line systolic and metabolic functions showed no relation to post-Langendorff function. Compared with CS, CP resulted in a greater recovery in systolic function (87% ± 35% vs 65% ± 15% of baseline; p = 0.05) and a shorter interval required for lactate consumption to exceed production (7.0 ± 6.8 minutes vs 15.0 ± 8.9 minutes; p = 0.06). Endothelial function was heterogeneous: coronary flow reserve, 2.7 ± 0.7; percentage change in myeloperoxidase, -8.4% ± 6.8%; and change in platelet function, 4.3% ± 3.5%, as determined by thromboelastography angle at base line. Protein release during CP for 24 hours was 8.3 ± 7.1 g. Two factors predicted more than 75% systolic pressure generation recovery: use of CP and normal endothelial function (p = 0.05; Fisher's exact test). However, CP led to edema according to histology, weight gain (72 ± 29 g), and impaired diastolic function versus CS (end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship, 1.4 ± 0.4 mm Hg/mL vs 0.8 ± 0.3 mm Hg/mL; p = 0.08). Conclusions Better systolic function despite 16 hours' more preservation than cold storage corroborates the idea that CP supports aerobic metabolism at physiologically important levels. Viability analysis focused on endothelial function and identified organs that were able to tolerate this 24-hour preservation interval. © 2004 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.","34","myeloperoxidase; aerobic metabolism; animal experiment; aorta sinus; article; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; coronary sinus; coronary vascular resistance; cryopreservation; diastolic blood pressure; donor; endothelium; Fisher exact test; heart infarction; heart perfusion; heart ventricle enddiastolic pressure; isolated heart; lactate blood level; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; oxygenation; priority journal; protein secretion; reperfusion; systolic blood pressure; thrombocyte function; thromboelastography; treatment outcome; weight gain; Aerobiosis; Animals; Coronary Vessels; Cryopreservation; Diastole; Dogs; Endothelium, Vascular; Energy Metabolism; Heart; Heart Transplantation; Lactates; Myocardial Reperfusion; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Organ Size; Oxygen Consumption; Peroxidase; Systole; Time Factors; Tissue Donors; Ventricular Function, Left",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644290113

These areas include soldier power (<500W), sensor power (0-100W), and auxiliary power units or APUs (0.5-10kW). Soldier and sensor fuel cell systems may be man-portable/backpackable while APUs could be employed as squad battery chargers or as 'Silent Watch' APUs where low signature (acoustic, thermal, etc.) operation is a requirement. The Army's research and development efforts are focusing on methods of either storing or generating hydrogen on the battlefield. Hydrogen storage technology is considered critical to small military and/or commercial fuel cell systems, and is being pursued in a host of commercial and government programs. CERDEC, in a joint effort with the Army Research Office (ARO) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is developing several promising hydrogen generating technologies. The goal of this program is a safe, reliable hydrogen source that can provide rates up to 100W with an energy density of greater than 1000Wh/kg. For larger fuel cell units (>500W), it is imperative that the fuel cell power units be able to operate on fuels within the military logistics chain [DOD 4140.25-M, DOD Directive 4140.25 (1993)]. CERDEC is currently conducting research on catalysts and microchannel fuel reformers that offer great promise for the reforming of diesel and JP-8 fuels into hydrogen. In addition to research work on PEM fuel cells and enabling technologies, the Army is also conducting research on direct methanol and solid oxide fuel cells, and combined heat and power applications utilizing new high temperature fuel cells. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Since the assumptions of the roughness approach, used by most of the mesoscale models, are unsatisfactory at this scale, a detailed urban and rural canopy parameterisation, called DA-SM2-U, is developed inside the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) to simulate the meteorological fields within and above the urban and rural canopies. DA-SM2-U uses the drag-force approach to represent the dynamic and turbulent effects of the buildings and vegetation, and a modified version of the soil model SM2-U, called SM2- U(3D), to represent the thermodynamic effects of the canopy elements. The turbulence length scale is also modified inside the canopies. SM2-U(3D) assesses the sensible and latent heat fluxes from rural and urban surfaces in each of the computational layers inside the canopies by considering the shadowing effect, the radiative trapping by the street canyons, and the storage heat flux by the artificial surfaces. DA-SM2-U is tested during one simulated day above the city of Philadelphia, U.S.A. It is shown that DA-SM2-U is capable of simulating the important features observed in the urban and rural RSL, as seen in the vertical profiles of the shear stress, turbulent kinetic energy budget components, eddy diffusivity, potential air temperature, and specific humidity. Within the canopies, DA-SM2-U simulates the decrease of the wind speed inside the dense canopies, the skirting of the flow around the canopy blocks, warmer air inside the vegetation canopy than above open areas during the night and conversely during the day, and constantly warmer air inside the urban canopy. The comparison with measurements shows that the surface air temperature above rural and urban areas is better simulated by DA-SM2-U than by the 'standard version' of MM5. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Eddy diffusivity; Energy budget; Mesoscale models; Rural and urban canopies; Urban boundary layer","Artificial surfaces; Latent heat flux; Meteorological fields; Turbulent effects; Air quality; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Heat flux; Kinetic energy; Surface roughness; Thermodynamics; Vegetation; Meteorology; air quality; boundary layer; energy budget; mesoscale eddy; rural atmosphere; urban atmosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344593664

These include reducing the phase noise in the storage ring radio-frequency (RF) system, installing an active mirror feedback system, analyzing and changing physical mounts to better isolate portions of the beamline optics from low-frequency environmental noise, and modifying the input signals to the main ALS RF system.

After the closure of this facility, two largely independent radiography development efforts were begun at LANSCE using moderated cold and thermal neutrons from the Target-1 source and high-energy neutrons from the Target-4 source. Investigations with cold and thermal neutrons employed a neutron converter and film, a scintillation screen and CCD camera system, and a new high-resolution amorphous silicon (a-Si) flat-panel detector system. Recent work with high-energy neutrons (E n&gt;1MeV) has involved storage-phosphor image plates.

Since harvest windows differ across species, gasification-fermentation technology would enable the use of specialized harvest and collection machinery throughout many months and reduce the fixed costs of harvest machinery per unit of feedstock. This study was conducted to determine the cost to harvest lignocellulosic biomass for use as biorefinery feedstock, and to determine the potential economies of size that might result from a coordinated structure. An agricultural machinery cost computer program was used to determine which specific type of machines would result in the lowest costs at intensive levels of use. A machinery complement estimator was used to design a coordinated set of machines and estimate costs for owning and operating the machines. The designed coordinated harvest unit includes ten laborers, nine tractors, three mowers, three rakes, three balers, and one bale transporter. The cost for mowing, raking, baling, gathering, and stacking in-field was estimated to be from $11.26 to $14.01 Mg-1 depending upon biomass yield. A biorefinery with an annual feedstock requirement of 910 Gg yr-1 would require approximately 18 harvest units and an average machinery investment of $11 million. Additional research is necessary to determine the cost to procure material from the landowner, the cost to store, storage losses, and the cost to transport feedstock from in-field stacks to a biorefinery. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Biorefinery; Cost; Economics; Gasification-fermentation; Harvest; Lignocellulosic biomass","Agricultural machinery; Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Costs; Crops; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Biorefineries; Storage losses; Harvesting; alternative energy; biomass power; energy crop; harvesting; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042728218

The size of on-chip cache memory has also been consistently increasing to keep up with developments in implementation technology. However, some applications may not utilize full cache capacity and, on the contrary, require more computing resources. To efficiently utilize silicon real-estate on the chip, we exploit the possibility of using a part of cache memory for computational purposes to strike a balance in the usage of memory and computing resources for various applications. In an earlier part of our work, the idea of Adaptive Balanced Computing (ABC) architecture was evolved, where a module of an L1 data cache is used as a coprocessor controlled by main processor. A part of an L1 data cache is designed as a Reconfigurable Functional Cache (RFC) that can be configured to perform a selective core function in the media application whenever such computing capability is required. ABC architecture provides speedups ranging from 1.04x to 5.0x for various media applications. In this paper, we show that a reduced number of cache accesses and lesser utilization of other on-chip resources, due to a significant reduction in execution time of application, will result in power savings. For this purpose, the paper first develops a model to compute the power consumed by the RFC while accelerating the computation of multimedia applications. The results show that up to a 60 percent reduction in power consumption is achieved for MPEG decoding and a reduction in the range of 10 to 20 percent for various other multimedia applications. Besides, beyond the discussions in earlier work on ABC architecture, this paper presents a detailed circuit level implementation of the core functions in the RFC modules. Further, in this paper, we go much further and study the impact of converting the conventional cache into RFC on both access time and energy consumption. The analysis is performed on a wide spectrum of cache organizations with size varying from 8KB to 256KB for varying set associativity. © 2004 IEEE.","Adaptive computing; Cache access time; Cache energy dissipation; Multimedia processing; On-chip data cache","Mathematical models; Microprocessor chips; Multimedia systems; Resource allocation; Storage allocation (computer); Adaptive computing; Cache access time; Cache energy dissipation; Multimedia processing; On-chip data cache; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11944257004

The incoming radiant energy is transformed into various forms (intemal heat, potential energy, latent energy, and kinetic energy), moved around in various ways primarily by the atmosphere and oceans, stored and sequestered in the ocean, land, and ice components of the climate system, and ultimately radiated back to space as infrared radiation. The requirement for an equilibrium climate mandates a balance between the incoming and outgoing radiation, and further mandates that the flows of energy are systematic. These drive the weather systems in the atmosphere, currents in the ocean, and fundamentally determine the climate. Values are provided for the seasonal uptake and release of heat by the oceans that substantially moderate the climate in maritime regions. In the atmosphere, the poleward transports are brought about mainly by large-scale overturning, including the Hadley circulation in low latitudes, and baroclinic storms in the extratropics, but the seamless nature of the transports on about monthly time-scales indicates a fundamental link between the two rather different mechanisms. The flows of energy can be perturbed, causing climate change. This article provides an overview of the flows of energy, its transformations, transports, uptake, storage and release, and the processes involved. The focus is on the region 60°N to 60°S, and results are presented for the solstitial seasons and their differences to highlight the annual cycle.

To ensure reliability, non-destructive and destructive evaluation techniques have been employed to measure the mechanical properties of fabricated components. In carbon fiber-reinforced, polymer matrix composites, mechanical strength is primarily derived from the fiber volume fraction. Due to the lack of a non-destructive method, common techniques for fiber volume determination are currently destructive. In this investigation, a non-destructive method for the measurement of the fiber volume fraction of carbon fiber-reinforced, polymer matrix composites has been developed using cold neutron prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA). Fiber volume determination is accomplished in this technique by measuring and comparing the carbon and hydrogen content in a given sample (or samples). PGAA is a nuclear analytical technique performed by exposing a sample to neutron radiation. PGAA measurements are non-destructive and can be performed without chemical preparation of the sample. Fiber volumes of several composite coupons have been determined relative to standard samples of known fiber volume and measurements are in good agreement with values predicted by acid digestion tests. Fiber volume measurement using PGAA can potentially be applied to any composite material where the contents of the matrix and reinforcement differ. The technique can also be spatially sensitive, with resolution limited by the dimensions of the neutron beam that is used.","Composites; Fiber volume; Neutrons; Non-destructive evaluation","Acoustic generators; Activation analysis; Fiber reinforced materials; Gamma rays; Motors; Nondestructive examination; Strength of materials; Carbon fiber composite reinforcement; Polymer matrix composites; Prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA); Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444222523

When considered separately, the storage terms are generally a small fraction (&lt;5%) of the net radiation.

By being truly biodegradable, derived from renewable resources and by providing consumers with extra end-use benefits such as avoiding paying the ""green tax"" in Germany or meeting environmental regulations in Japan, polylactides (PLAs) are a growing alternative as a packaging material for demanding markets. The aim of this paper is to review the production techniques for PLAs, summarize the main properties of PLA and to delineate the main advantages and disadvantages of PLA as a polymeric packaging material. PLA films have better ultraviolet light barrier properties than low density polyethylene (LDPE), but they are slightly worse than those of cellophane, polystyrene (PS) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). PLA films have mechanical properties comparable to those of PET and better than those of PS. PLA also has lower melting and glass transition temperatures than PET and PS. The glass transition temperature of PLA changes with time. Humidity between 10 and 95% and storage temperatures of 5 to 40°C do not have an effect on the transition temperature of PLA, which can be explained by its low water sorption values (i.e. &lt;100 ppm at Aw = 1). PLA seals well at temperatures below the melting temperature but an appreciable shrinking of the films has been noted when the material is sealed near its melting temperature. Solubility parameter predictions indicate that PLA will interact with nitrogen compounds, anhydrides and some alcohols and that it will not interact with aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, sulfur compounds or water. The CO2, O2 and water permeability coefficients of PLA are lower than those of PS and higher than those of PET. Its barrier to ethyl acetate and D-limonene is comparable to PET. The amount of lactic acid and its derivatives that migrate to food simulant solutions from PLA is much lower than any of the current average dietary lactic acid intake values allowed by several governmental agencies. Thus, PLA is safe for use in fabricating articles for contact with food.","Barrier; Biodegradable; Diffusion; Permeability; Polylactides","Atmospheric humidity; Biodegradation; Carboxylic acids; Cellophane; Glass transition; Packaging materials; Polyethylene terephthalates; Polystyrenes; Renewable energy resources; Thermal effects; Melting temperature; Polylactide polymers; Polylactides; Synthetic packaging materials; Aromatic polymers; acetic acid ethyl ester; acid anhydride; alcohol derivative; aromatic hydrocarbon; carbon dioxide; cellophane; ester derivative; ketone derivative; lactic acid; limonene; nitrogen; oxygen; polyethylene; polyethylene terephthalate; polylactide; polymer; polystyrene; sulfur derivative; water; biodegradability; comparative study; film; food; Germany; Japan; market; melting point; molecular mechanics; packaging material; phase transition; review; solubility; technique; temperature; ultraviolet radiation; water permeability; Biocompatible Materials; Biotechnology; Diffusion; Glass; Heat; Lactic Acid; Models, Chemical; Polyesters; Polymers; Solubility; Spectrophotometry; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Time Factors; Biodegradation; Carboxylic Acids; Packaging Materials; Polyethylene Terephthalate; Renewable Resources; Synthetic Polymers; Phocidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4744360239

The energetics of turbulence is investigated by correlating the work done by polymers on the flow with turbulent structures. Polymers are found to store and to release energy to the flow in a well-organized manner. The storage of energy occurs around near-wall vortices as has been anticipated for a long time. Quite unexpectedly, coherent release of energy is observed in the very near-wall region. Large fluctuations of polymer work are shown to re-energize decaying streamwise velocity fluctuations in high-speed streaks just above the viscous sublayer. These distinct behaviours are used to propose an autonomous regeneration cycle of polymer wall turbulence, in the spirit of Jiménez and Pinelli (1999). © 2004 Cambridge University Press.",,"Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Drag; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Polymers; Turbulence; Vortex flow; Drag-reduced flows; Energy release; Regeneration cycles; Streamwise velocity fluctuations; Wall flow; drag reducing additive; fluid mechanics; mathematical modeling; near-wall flow; polymer; turbulence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644249917

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in regulation of body weight is becoming an increasingly important goal shared by the public and the scientific community. The key to fat deposition is the adipocyte, a specialized cell that plays a critical role in energy balance and appetite regulation. Much of our knowledge of adipogenesis comes from studies using preadipocytic cell lines that have provided important information regarding molecular control of adipocyte differentiation. However, they fall short of revealing how naive cells acquire competence for adipogenesis. Studies in preadipocytes indicate that the Notch pathway plays a role in regulating adipogenesis (Garces et al.: J Biol Chem 272:29729-29734, 1997). Given the known biological functions of Notch in mediating cell fate decisions (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al.: Science 284:770-776, 1999), we wished to test the hypothesis that the Notch pathway is required for this cellular program by examining adipogenesis in several genetic loss-of-function models that encompass the entire pathway. We conclude that the ""canonical"" Notch signaling pathway is dispensable for adipocyte specification and differentiation from either mesenchymal or epithelial progenitors. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adipogenesis; Chimera; Notch","Notch receptor; adipocyte; animal cell; article; body weight; cell differentiation; cell fate; cell specificity; energy balance; food intake; genetic association; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; signal transduction; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Epithelial Cells; Fibroblasts; Membrane Proteins; Mesoderm; Mice; Receptors, Notch; Stem Cells; Tretinoin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7744224387

Flux measurements are made using the Bowen ratio method, accompanied by measurements of soil moisture and radiation. We present data from semiarid grassland and shrubland sites, situated within 2 km of each other in New Mexico. The study includes three summer monsoon seasons. Midday available energy (Qa) is higher at the grassland than at the shrubland by 20% or 70 W m-2 because of differences in net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G). At both sites, midday evaporative fraction and daily ET are strongly correlated with surface soil moisture (θ0-5cm) but poorly correlated with water content at greater depths or averaged throughout the entire root zone. The sensitivity of EF to θ0-5cm is 30% lower at the grassland site. The differences in Qa and EF cancel, yielding similar time series of ET at the two sites. Decreases in θ0-5cm, ET, and EF following rainfall events are rapid: exponential time constants are less than 3 days. With the exception of the largest storms, infiltration following rainfall events only wets the top 10 cm of soil. Therefore the surface soil layer is the primary reservoir for water storage and source for ET during the monsoon season, suggesting that direct evaporation is a large component of ET. Given these results, predicting ET based on root zone-averaged soil moisture is inappropriate in the semiarid environments studied here.","Bouteloua eriopoda; Bowen ratio; Evapotranspiration; Grassland; Larrea tridentata; Shrubland","Arid regions; Correlation methods; Ecosystems; Moisture; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Surface waters; Bowen ratio method; Energy cycles; Flux measurements; Semiarid grasslands; Evapotranspiration; Bowen ratio; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; grassland; semiarid region; shrubland; soil moisture; New Mexico; North America; United States; Bouteloua; Bouteloua eriopoda; Larrea; Larrea tridentata; Tridentata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344284628

The suspension is suitable for flywheels used in satellites and space stations for attitude control and energy storage. Specifically, we show that flux coupling between poles of a homopolar magnetic bearing can deliver desired forces even after termination of coil currents to a subset of ""failed poles."" Linear, coordinate-decoupled force-voltage relations are also maintained before and after failure by bias linearization. We determined current distribution matrices that adjust the currents and fluxes following a pole set failure for many faulted pole combinations. We used one-dimensional magnetic circuit models with fringe and leakage factors derived from detailed, three-dimensional finite-element field models to obtain the current distribution matrices and the system response. Reliability is based on the success criterion that catcher bearing-shaft contact does not occur after pole failures. The magnetic bearing reliability is improved by increasing the number of the radial poles. An advantage of our method over other redundant approaches is a significantly reduced requirement for backup hardware such as additional actuators or power amplifiers.","Fault-tolerant control; Homopolar; Magnetic bearings; Magnetic suspensions; Reliability","Actuators; Eddy currents; Electric fault currents; Finite element method; Magnetic flux; Matrix algebra; Power amplifiers; Reliability; Rotors; Dault-tolerant control; Homopolar; Magnetic circuit models; Magnetic suspensions; Magnetic bearings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644366895

Circuit topology issues are examined based on these needs. The need for high step-up ratios, current control, low ripple, and battery storage leads to a current-sourced link converter as perhaps the best choice of conversion topology. High-frequency ac link conversion offers a possible way to reduce the number of power stages, in the form of a cycloconverter, known from previous work. It is shown that the control complexity in this converter can be addressed by adapting pulse-width modulation (PWM) techniques. Here, a multicarrier PWM approach is introduced as a convenient way to implement a high-frequency link inverter. The approach is a direct extension of conventional PWM, and supports square-wave cycloconversion methods that have appeared in prior literature. Simulation and experimental results are developed for a low-voltage ac link inverter, leading to a 48-V fuel cell input design. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Computer simulation; Electric network topology; Fuel cells; Multicarrier modulation; Power converters; Pulse width modulation; Cycloconverter; Fuel cell power conditioning; High frequency link; Pulse width modulated power converters; Electric inverters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544377193

The problem of optimal-power control of a nonlinear time-varying system is reduced to an ordinary problem of dynamic system stability in state space by applying MPP conditions in controller design. The resulting tracking system searches for the reference point and tunes the converter for maximum power delivery to a load that may represent an end-user, or an energy-storage element, or a power grid-interface. The proposed design procedure for the MPP tracking system ensures a global asymptotic stability under certain conditions, and a minimum degree of the dynamic feedback. The design is verified using the Virtual Test Bed, demonstrating accurate MPP tracking capability under unpredictable weather change, parameter variation, and load disturbance. The tracking system can be applied either to stand-alone or grid-connected photovoltaic installations, and can be implemented in either analog circuitry or a digital microcontroller. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Asymptotic stability; Control system synthesis; Mathematical models; Nonlinear control systems; Optimal control systems; Power control; Solar power generation; State space methods; System stability; Time varying control systems; Maximum power point tracking; Photovoltaic energy conversion; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544316692

FFAs induce insulin resistance, which increases with FFA levels, and this can be a beneficial adaptive response during starvation and pregnancy. However, insulin resistance can become counterproductive when there is an excess of energy intake associated with physical inactivity. The extra fuel is stored in visceral and subcutaneous fat depots. As fat accumulates, there is an ongoing increase in the levels of plasma FFAs, which causes insulin resistance. In addition, the deficit of another product of adipose tissue (e.g., adiponectin) may contribute to increased insulin resistance. To counter insulin resistance and prevent hyperglycemia, insulin levels increase. In individuals with a genetic predisposition for diabetes, however, the pancreas cannot compensate for the increased secretory demands placed on it, resulting in type 2 diabetes. The pivotal role of FFAs in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes suggests that the optimal therapeutic intervention should decrease plasma FFA levels. The PPAR family is intimately involved in lipid metabolism. Two subtypes of these receptors are the site of action of synthetic PPAR agonists: PPAR-α and PPAR-γ. The former increases fatty acid oxidation, whereas the latter results in the redistribution of fat from visceral to subcutaneous body fat and an increase in adiponectin. The outcome of activation of PPAR-γ is a lowering of plasma FFA concentrations and improved insulin sensitivity. The effects of PPAR-α on lipid metabolism may also bring about improvements in insulin sensitivity. The currently available PPAR agonists selectively activate either PPAR-α (i.e., fibrates) or PPAR-γ (i.e., TZDs) and have been shown to improve lipid metabolism. It may be that dual agonism with PPAR-α/γ agonists will provide additional benefits above and beyond those achieved with sole activation of either PPAR-α or PPAR-γ.",,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; adiponectin; fatty acid; fibric acid derivative; glucose; insulin; lipid; nicotinic acid; nicotinic acid derivative; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; caloric intake; clinical trial; congestive heart failure; drug effect; edema; evolution; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid oxidation; genetic predisposition; glucose metabolism; human; hyperglycemia; immobilization; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pregnancy; receptor upregulation; review; starvation; subcutaneous fat; viscera; weight gain; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lipids; Models, Biological; PPAR gamma",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444344507

Despite the major role of adipose tissue in regulating energy partitioning in the organism, the role of AMPK in this tissue has not been addressed. In the present study, we subjected AMPKα2 knockout (KO) mice to a high-fat diet to examine the effect of AMPK on adipose tissue formation. Compared with the wild type, AMPKα2 KO mice exhibited, increased body weight and fat mass. The increase in adipose tissue mass was due to the enlargement of the preexisting adipocytes with increased lipid accumulation. However, we did not observe any changes in adipocyte marker expression, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α(C/EBPα) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aFABP/aP2), or total cell number. Unlike impaired glucose homeostasis observed on normal, diet feeding, when fed a high-fat diet AMPKα2 KO mice did not show differences in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared with wild-type mice. Our results suggest that the increase in lipid storage in adipose tissue in AMPKα2 KO mice may have protected these mice from further impairment. of glucose homeostasis that normally accompanies high-fat feeding.

Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL or Batten Disease) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorders of childhood, resulting from autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in the CLN3 gene. Pathologically, Batten disease is characterized by lysosomal storage of autofluorescent material in all tissue types. Although characterized by seizures, mental retardation, and loss of motor skills, the first presenting symptom of Batten disease is vision loss. METHODS. High-density oligonucleotide arrays were used to profile approximately 19,000 mRNAs in the eye of 10-week-old Cln3-knockout and normal mice, and the data were compared with that for the cerebellum in the same model as a means to identify gene expression changes that are specific to the eye. RESULTS. A detailed list was compiled of 285 functionally categorized genes that have altered expression in the eye of Cln3-knockout mice before the appearance of the characteristic lysosomal storage material. Furthermore, 18 genes were identified and 6 validated by semiquantitative RT-PCR that have altered expression in the eye, but not in the cerebellum of Cln3-knockout mice. The genes that have altered expression specific to the eye of the Cln3-knockout mouse may be of importance in understanding the function of CLN3 in different tissues. CONCLUSIONS. Downregulation of genes associated with energy production in the mitochondria appears to be specific to the eye. The CLN3 defect may result in altered mitochondrial function in eye but not other tissue. More detailed experimentation is needed to understand the contribution of these changes in expression to disease state, and whether these changes are specific for certain cell types within the eye.",,"messenger RNA; adolescent; animal model; animal tissue; article; autofluorescence; autosomal recessive inheritance; cerebellum; cln3 gene; controlled study; degenerative disease; DNA microarray; energy yield; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene mutation; knockout mouse; lysosome storage disease; mental deficiency; mitochondrial respiration; motor dysfunction; mouse; neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; nonhuman; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; seizure; visual impairment; Animals; Cerebellum; Disease Models, Animal; Eye; Fluorescence; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Mice, Knockout; Molecular Chaperones; Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344670396

The algorithm works on complex real-world scenes (indoor and outdoor), which consist of an unknown number of objects (or surfaces) of various sizes and types, such as planes, conics, smooth surfaces, and cluttered objects (like trees and bushes). Formulated in the Bayesian framework, the posterior probability is distributed over a solution space with a countable number of subspaces of varying dimensions. The algorithm simulates Markov chains with both reversible jumps and stochastic diffusions to traverse the solution space. The reversible jumps realize the moves between subspaces of different dimensions, such as switching surface models and changing the number of objects. The stochastic Langevin equation realizes diffusions within each subspace. To achieve effective computation, the algorithm precomputes some importance proposal probabilities over multiple scales through Hough transforms, edge detection, and data clustering. The latter are used by the Markov chains for fast mixing. The algorithm is tested on 100 1D simulated data sets for performance analysis on both accuracy and speed. Then, the algorithm is applied to three data sets of range images under the same parameter setting. The results are satisfactory in comparison with manual segmentations. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Computer simulation; Edge detection; Global optimization; Hough transforms; Image reconstruction; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Object recognition; Probability; Three dimensional computer graphics; Bayesian formulation; Change point detection; Data clustering; Energy minimization; Jump diffusion algorithms; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Range segmentation; Image segmentation; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344570235

A secondary objective was to examine the relationship between maternal leptin and nutrient metabolism. Fifteen obese women, eight with NGT and seven with GDM, were evaluated before conception (P), at 12-14 wk (E), and at 34-36 wk (L). Energy expenditure and glucose and fat metabolism were measured using indirect calorimetry. Basal hepatic glucose production was measured using [6,6-2H2]glucose and insulin sensitivity by euglycemic clamp. There was a significant increase (6.6 kg, P = 0.0001) in fat mass from P to L. There was a 30% (P = 0.0001) increase in basal O2 consumprion (V̇o2, ml/min). There were no significant changes in carbohydrate oxidation during fasting or storage from P to L. There was, however, a significant (P = 0.0001) 150% increase in basal fat oxidation (mg/min) from P to L. Under hyperinsulinemic conditions, there were similar 25% increases in V̇o2 (P = 0.0001) from P to L in both groups. Because of the significant increases in insulin resistance from P to L, there was a significant (P = 0.0001) decrease in carbohydrate oxidation and storage. There was a net change from lipogenesis to lipolysis, i.e., fat oxidation (30-40 mg/min, P = 0.0001) from P to L. Serum leptin concentrations had a significant positive correlation with fat oxidation at E (r = 0.76, P = 0.005) and L (r = 0.72, P = 0.009). Pregnancy in obese women is associated with significant increases in fat mass and basal metabolic rate and an increased reliance on lipids both in the basal state and during the clamp. These modifications are similar in women with NGT and GDM. The increased reliance on fat metabolism is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in carbohydrate metabolism during hyperinsulinemia. The increase in fat oxidation may be related to increased maternal serum leptin.","Gestational diabetes; Leptin; Pregnancy","fatty acid; glucose; insulin; leptin; adult; article; basal metabolic rate; carbohydrate metabolism; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; fatty acid oxidation; female; gluconeogenesis; glucose oxidation; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; lipogenesis; liver metabolism; obesity; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; priority journal; Adult; Body Composition; Diabetes, Gestational; Energy Metabolism; Female; Glucose; Glucose Intolerance; Humans; Insulin; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Longitudinal Studies; Obesity; Osmolar Concentration; Oxidation-Reduction; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143094742

We characterized regional rheological differences between the leading, body, and trailing regions of isolated, adherent, and spontaneously locomoting human neutrophils. We optically trapped intracellular granules and measured their displacement for 500 ms after a 100-nm step change in the trap position. Results were analyzed in terms of simple viscoelasticity and with the use of structural damping (stress relaxation follows a power law in time). Structural damping fit the data better than did viscoelasticity. Regional viscoelastic stiffness and viscosity or structural damping storage and loss moduli were all significantly lower in leading regions than in pooled body and/or trailing regions (the latter were not significantly different). Structural damping showed similar levels of elastic and dissipative stresses in body and/or trailing regions; leading regions were significantly more fluidlike (increased power law exponent). Cytoskeletal disruption with cytochalasin D or nocodazole made body and/or trailing regions ∼50% less elastic and less viscous. Cytochalasin D completely suppressed pseudopodial formation and locomotion; nocodazole had no effect on leading regions. Neither drug changed the dissipation-storage energy ratio. These results differ from those of studies of neutrophils and other cell types probed at the cell membrane via β2-integrin receptors, which suggests a distinct role for the cell cortex or focal adhesion complexes. We conclude that 1) structural damping well describes intracellular rheology, and 2) while not conclusive, the significantly more fluidlike behavior of the leading edge supports the idea that intracellular pressure may be the origin of motive force in neutrophil locomotion.","Optical trap; Power law; Structural damping; Viscoelasticity","beta2 integrin; beta2 integrin receptor; cytochalasin D; nocodazole; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; cell membrane; cell migration; chemotaxis; complex formation; controlled study; cytoskeleton; diagnostic value; flow kinetics; focal adhesion; human; human cell; leukocyte; locomotion; neutrophil; nonhuman; pressure measurement; priority journal; rigidity; statistical significance; viscoelasticity; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Movement; Cytochalasin D; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Elasticity; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Biological; Neutrophils; Nocodazole; Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors; Plethysmography; Stress, Mechanical; Viscosity; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143070190

The devices consist of a single metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect-transistor with silicon nanocrystals fabricated through ultra-low-energy (1 keV) Si implantation of the gate oxide (7 nm in thickness) and subsequent thermal annealing. Process issues like boron contamination and parasitic currents that affect the threshold voltage and transfer characteristics of the intended devices are discussed in terms of device structure, process parameter and device simulation. It is shown that these issues can be overcome under appropriate process modifications. Threshold shift of about 2 V are obtained for a 10 ms +9 V/-9 V pulse regime where both electron and hole trapping occur. Neither degradation, nor drift in memory window is detected after 1.5 × 106 10 ms +9 V/-9 V cycles. Charge retention measurements reveal that the de-trapping mechanism of stored holes is faster than that of trapped electrons and independent on the temperature. Memory operation with reduced hole trapping, herein demonstrated for a 10 ms +9 V/-7 V regime leading to a 0.3 V 10-year extrapolated memory window at 150 °C, should be preferred for long non-volatile retention of years. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines potential technical barriers to this technology and identifies a minimum cost design. We discovered that hydrogen towers have a ""crossover pressure"" at which the critical mode of failure crosses over from fatigue to bursting. The crossover pressure for many turbine towers is between 1.0 and 1.5 MPa (approximately 10-15 atm). The hydrogen tower design resulting in the least expensive hydrogen storage uses all of the available volume for storage and is designed at its crossover pressure. An 84-m tall hydrogen tower for a 1.5-MW turbine would cost an additional $83,000 (beyond the cost of the conventional tower) and would store 940 kg of hydrogen at 1.1 MPa of pressure. The resulting incremental storage cost of $88/kg is approximately 30% of that for conventional pressure vessels.

Renewables contribute 14% and nuclear some 6%. These numbers will soon change as the world's population grows, energy demand rises, cheap oil and gas deplete, global warming effects continue rising and city pollution worsens the living conditions. The development of energy sources and devices will emerge more aggressively to address the world's energy and environmental situation. A concept of using hydrogen as an energy carrier or storage as a fuel, a replacement of burning fluid fossil fuels is presented. Sources of energy from which hydrogen can be produced in a massive quantity and at a low cost are briefly surveyed. A short account of devices to be employed for hydrogen production is given. Primarily the sun, sea, runoff waters, winds and fissionable materials are to be utilized. The discussion on the inexhaustibility of naturally occurring sources utilized and/or harnessed in this process will lead to the low cost for hydrogen production. Some hydrogen rich products including hydrogen sulfide and methane accompany the oil, gas and brine, when they are pumped out of the ground. While methane is used sometimes as fuel; the hydrogen sulfide is disposed off invariably. In principle, hydrogen can be extracted from these waste products. We discuss here to produce hydrogen in economically feasible manner. The use of brine as a means of usable solar energy in the form of heat and electricity was discussed earlier. Here, we aim at discussing the production of hydrogen from the brine and hydrogen sulfide gas. The brine is proposed to be utilized for two purposes: One for salt gradient solar pond to produce usable heat and electricity, and the other as an electrolyte to produce hydrogen out of itself. The hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide can chemically be extracted. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen; Ocean; Production methods; Solar thermal","Electricity; Electrolytes; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Hydrogen sulfide; Hydrolysis; Methane; Photolysis; Photosynthesis; Pollution control; Solar energy; Wind turbines; Ocean; Production methods; Solar bowls (S8); Solar thermal; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342586659

To assess the physicochemical characteristics and aerosol properties of suspensions of lipid-coated budesonide microcrystals dispersed in HFA-134a. Methods. Lipid-coated budesonide microcrystals were prepared by spray-drying an emulsion-based feedstock. Physicochemical characteristics of spray-dried particles were assessed by electron microscopy, laser diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. Purity and content were determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Particle aggregation and suspension stability were assessed visually, and aerosol performance was assessed by Andersen cascade impaction and dose content uniformity. Results. Spray-drying of micronized budesonide microcrystals in the presence of phospholipid-coated emulsion droplets results in the production of low-density lipid-coated microcrystals with low surface energy. These spray-dried particles form stable suspensions in HFA-134a. This translates into good uniformity in the metered dose across the contents of the inhaler and acceptable aerodynamic particle size distributions (MMAD = 3.2 to 3.4 μm). The formulation was observed to maintain its performance over 6 months at 40°C/75% RH and 16 months at 25°C/60% RH. No effect of storage orientation was observed on the content of first sprays following storage (i.e., no Cyr effect). The fine particle dose was found to be linear out to suspension concentrations of about 2% wt/vol, and FPD4.7μm values approaching 400 μg can be delivered in a single inhalation. Conclusions. Engineered particles comprised of lipid-coated microcrystals may provide an acceptable alternative formulation technology for metered dose inhalers in the new hydrofluoroalkane propellants. © 2004 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Aerosol; Corticosteroid; Hydrofluoroalkane; Metered dose inhalers; Pulmonary drug delivery","budesonide; lipid emulsion; norflurane; bronchodilating agent; budesonide; fluorinated hydrocarbon; lipid; norflurane; propellant; aerosol; article; crystal structure; differential scanning calorimetry; drug formulation; drug stability; drug storage; electron microscopy; energy; laser diffraction; metered dose inhaler; particle size; physical chemistry; priority journal; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; spray drying; surface property; suspension; chemistry; crystallization; metered dose inhaler; methodology; powder; Aerosol Propellants; Aerosols; Bronchodilator Agents; Budesonide; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Crystallization; Drug Stability; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Lipids; Metered Dose Inhalers; Particle Size; Powders; Suspensions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21644470926

It considers the policy implications for communities who have their own local power resources rather than those distributed through transmission from distant sources such as dams, coal power plants or even renewables generation from wind farms, solar thermal or other resources. The issues today, post 911 and the energy crises in California, Northeast North America and Europe, signal the need for a new and different approach to energy supply(s), reliability and dissemination. Distributed generation (DG) as explored in the earlier paper appears to be one such approach that allows for local communities to become energy self-sufficient. Along with energy conservation, efficiency, and on-site generation, local power sources provide concrete definitions and understandings for heretofore ill defined concepts such as sustainability and eco-systems. The end result for any region and nation-state are ""agile energy systems"" which use flexible DG, on-site generation and conservation systems meeting the needs of local communities. Now the challenge is to demonstrate and provide economic and policy structures for implementing new advanced technologies for local communities. For institutionalizing economically viable and sound environmental technologies then new finance mechanisms must be established that better reflect the true costs of clean energy distributed in local communities. For example, the aggregation of procurement contracts for on-site solar systems is far more cost effective than for each business owner, public building or household to purchase its own separate units. Thus mass purchasing contracts that are link technologies as hybrids can dramatically reduce costs. In short public-private partnerships can implement the once costly clean energy technologies into local DG systems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a suite of broadcast organization schemes for multiversion data broadcast, i.e., data broadcast in which more than one value is broadcast per data item. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions, multiversion broadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple server states. For example, such a functionality is essential to support applications that require access to data sequences and have limited local memory to store the previous versions, such as in the case of sensor networks. We identify two basic multiversion organizations, namely vertical and horizontal broadcasts and propose an efficient compression scheme applicable to both. We also consider a multiversion client data cache and introduce appropriate cache replacement techniques. Finally, we propose an adaptive scheme that dynamically selects the appropriate broadcast organization based on the client access pattern. We provide performance evaluation results for both flat and broadcast disk organizations and for a variety of client query patterns. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This article focuses on the past two to three decades of plutonium oxide and metal storage, during which package failures were reasonably well-documented.

Low-temperature (77 K) resonance Raman spectra of Glu181 and Ser186 mutants of bovine rhodopsin reveal only mild mutagenic perturbations of the photoproduct spectrum suggesting that dipolar, electrostatic, or steric interactions with these residues do not cause the HOOP mode frequencies and intensities.

The decoupled HOOP modes can be simulated by imposing ∼40° twists in the same direction about the C 11=C12 and C12-C13 bonds. Sequence comparison and examination of the binding site suggests that these distortions are caused by three constraints consisting of an electrostatic anchor between the protonated Schiff base and the Glu113 counterion, as well as steric interactions of the 9- and 13-methyl groups with surrounding residues.

Evidence of the viscoelastic nature of the films was observed for films thicker than 90 nm through the frequency and energy dissipation changes. For sufficiently thin films (t &lt; 40 nm), the frequency change could be effectively modeled as a simple increase in mass, as predicted by the Sauerbrey equation. The viscosity of the swollen films was independent, of initial polymer film thickness (93-205 nm). The equilibrium swelling ratio was independent of film thickness for all films examined (3-205 nm). The transition between the observation of a rigid film and a film showing viscoelastic character was found to be at β1D = 0.26 ± 0.10, where β1 = 2π/λs, λ s is the shear wavelength, and D is the film thickness. This transition agrees with the predictions of White and Schrag (J. Chem. Phys. 1999, 111, 11192).",,"Crystals; Energy dissipation; Hydration; Polyelectrolytes; Quartz; Resonators; Swelling; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Energy storages; Film thickness; Sauerbrey equations; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444257237

A novel azobenzene derivative that has a large ground-state activation barrier between the cis and trans forms in water is used. The system is actuated by excitation with UV light (wavelength of 365 nm), which photoisomerizes the azobenzene trans state to the cis ground state. The increased dipole moment of the cis state increases the free energy of mixing, causing a hydrogel swelling, which red-shifts the embedded CCA diffraction. Excitation with visible light photoisomerizes the cis state to the trans state, which resets the diffraction. This material acts as a memory storage material. Information is recorded and erased by exciting the photonic crystal in the UV or visible spectral region. The written information is read out completely and nondestructively by the wavelength of the Bragg diffraction (in this case, in the red).",,"Azobenzene; Colloidal particles; Photonic crystals; Spectral region; Benzene; Ground state; Hydrogels; Isomerization; Photons; Switching; Ultraviolet radiation; Water; Crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444228960

In the turkey, much of the force generated by the gastrocnemius muscle is stored as elastic energy during tendon deformation and not within the muscle. As limbs move, the tendons are strained causing the collagen fibers in the extracellular matrices to be strained. During growth, avian tendons mineralize in the portions distal to the muscle and show increased tensile strength, modulus, and energy stored per unit strain as a result. In this study the energy stored in unmineralized and mineralized collagen fibers was measured and compared to the amount of energy stored in molecular models. Elastic energy storage values calculated using the molecular model were slightly higher than those obtained from collagen fibers, but display the same increases in slope as the fiber data. We hypothesize that these increases in slope are due to a change from the stretching of flexible regions of the collagen molecule to the stretching of less flexible regions. The elastic modulus obtained from the unmineralized molecular model correlates well with elastic moduli of unmineralized collagen from other studies. This study demonstrates the potential importance of molecular modeling in the design of new biomaterials. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Room temperature cured bisphenol-A epoxy and styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEES) polymers are chosen as matrix materials because of their excellent chemical and mechanical properties. The polymeric network structure in the composite encapsulates the PCMs, which transform from the solid to the liquid phase. The PCMs provide the energy storage function via the solid-liquid latent heat effect. The resulting composite exhibits dry-phase transition in the sense that fluid motion of the PCM, when in the liquid phase, is inhibited by the structure of the polymer matrix. The polymer matrix is formulated to provide structural functionality. The latent heat, thermal conductivity and contact conductance, and structural moduli of composites having various PCM-to-matrix vplume fractions are measured. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Composites; Phase behavior; Thermal properties","Phase behaviors; Phase change materials (PCM); Thermal energy storage (TES); Thermal properties; Composite materials; Encapsulation; Energy storage; Epoxy resins; Phenols; Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamic stability; Thermosets; Polymers; polymer science",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042566995

As a result, insulation properties under impulse waveforms are of interest in the design of HV apparatus. This creates a need for very low energy laboratory impulse generators which can be used to test laboratory scale samples, often in conjunction with sensitive electronic instrumentation to measure sample dielectric properties. Since the sample is often the only isolation between the impulse generator and the electronics, failure of the sample will result in exposure of the electronics to the energy stored in the generator. This paper provides design details for a very low energy ( ∼ 1 nF storage), single-stage impulse generator which provides ""clean"" double exponential waveforms.","Dielectric test; Impulse generator; Nonlinear material; Surge generator","Dielectric materials; Electric insulation; Electric surges; Failure analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Standards; Waveform analysis; Dielectric testing; Impulse generators; Nonlinear materials; Surge generators; Electric generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344223564

We also examined the relationship between wingbeat frequency (WBF) and Ta in five additional species of orchid bees. Mean thoracic temperature (Tth) for Eg. imperialis hovering in a screened insectary and in the field was 39.3±0.77°C (mean ± 95% C.I.), and the slope of Tth on Ta was 0.57. Head and abdominal temperature excess ratios declined with Ta, indicating that Eg. imperialis were not increasing heat dissipation from the thorax at high Ta. Elevation of Tth above Ta was correlated with WBF, but Tth alone was not. Estimates of heat production from both respirometry and heat loss experiments decreased 33% as Ta rose from 24 to 34°C. Mean muscle efficiency over this temperature range was 18% assuming perfect elastic energy storage and 22% assuming zero elastic energy storage.

In analyzing these large-scale systems, it is often desirable to treat the overall system as a collection of interconnected subsystems. Solution properties of the large-scale system are then deduced from the solution properties of the individual subsystems and the nature of the system interconnections. In this paper we develop an energy flow modeling framework for large-scale dynamical systems based on vector dissipativity notions. Specifically, using vector storage functions and vector supply rates, dissipativity properties of the composite large-scale system are shown to be determined from the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and their interconnections. Thermodynamic principles are also established using a large-scale systems perspective.","Ectropy; Energy equipartition; Energy flow; Entropy; Semistability; Stability; Thermodynamic modeling; Vector dissipativity theory; Vector Lyapunov functions; Vector storage functions; Vector supply rates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544359248

The corresponding volumetric delivery capacity of hydrogen reaches up to 50 kg/m3, very close to the target set by the Department of Energy (DOE).

The first problem requires libraries of DNA sequences to be designed so that specific duplexes are formed during annealing while simultaneously preventing other undesirable hybridizations from occurring in the course of a computation in the tube. The second involves a search for efficient and cost-effective methods of representing non-biological information in DNA sequences for storage and retrieval of large amouns of data (tera- and peta-byte scales). Two approaches are treated, namely thermodynamic and combinatoric-computational. Both experimental and theoretical results are described. A reference list of major works in the area is given.

Consolidation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from 126 sites in 39 states and safe disposal at Yucca Mountain are vital to the US national interests. The US geologic repository programme's key objective remains to begin receiving spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed Yucca Mountain repository in 2010. To achieve this objective, the DOE must, in less than 7 years, seek and secure authorization to construct the repository from the NRC, begin constructing the repository and receive a license amendment allowing receipt of radioactive materials and operation of the repository. DOE must also develop a transportation system to ship spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from civilian and defence storage sites to the repository. This paper describes near-term efforts in developing the license application and transportation system, Successfully licensing, constructing and operating a repository will rely on information gained from more than two decades of scientific investigations at the Yucca Mountain site, all of which contribute to the technical basis for understanding the repository system. This paper also summarizes ongoing and completed in situ testing in the exploratory studies facility (ESF) and cross-drift. The ESF, a U-shaped tunnel approximately 7.9 km long and about 300 m below the crest of Yucca Mountain, has been used extensively to conduct tests in 13 alcoves and niches and to access a smaller cross-drift, 5 m in diameter and 2.7 km long. © IMechE 2004.","Exploratory studies facility; Geologic disposal; Nevada; Yucca Mountain","Accident prevention; Environmental protection; Geology; Health risks; Radioactive waste disposal; Security systems; Geologic disposal; High-level radioactive wastes; Spent fuels; radioactive waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143139630

In this paper, a mathematical model that is based on conservation of thermal energy and mass is developed to describe the locations of moisture and temperature fronts within a barrier, around a cylindrical waste canister of 1 m radius, containing radionuclides with half-lives that range from 100 to 10,000 years. The solution developed is axisymmetric: the moisture fraction w and temperature T vary only with time t, and radial distance r from the axis of the cylindrical waste canister. The model produces parabolic partial differential equations. The spatial domain is discretized such that ordinary differential equations that result are solved. Computations using a uniform mesh of 0.1 m and a cooling coefficient of 6.7×10-2 with assumed but typical data on material properties, indicate that coupling of transport processes would be negligible in the case of radionuclides with long half-lives. Also, a quasisteady vaporization front can form and propagate outward over the course of several decades after waste emplacement. The evolution of the front is somewhat insensitive to the half-life used and the permeability of the clayey barrier material. © ASCE.","Barriers; Clays liners; Containment; Design; Mathematical models; Radioactive wastes","Clay; Energy conservation; Geological repositories; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Moisture; Radioactive waste storage; Radioisotopes; Sealing (closing); Clay barriers; Waste containment barrier materials; Waste management; containment barrier; heat transfer; liner; numerical model; permeability; radioactive waste; radionuclide; Phocidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143089127

The encoder is capable of adjusting its encoding not only to suit applications but furthermore to suit different aspects of particular program execution. It achieves this by exploiting application-specific knowledge regarding program hot-spots, and thus identifies efficient instruction transformations so as to minimize the bit transitions on the instruction bus lines. Not only is the switching activity on the individual bus lines considered but so is the coupling activity across adjacent bus lines, a foremost contributor to the total power dissipation in the case of nanometer technologies. Low-power codes are utilized in a reprogrammable application specific manner. The restriction to two well-selected classes of simply computable, functional transformations delivers significant storage benefits and ease of reprogrammability, in the process obtaining significant power savings. The microarchitectural support enables reprogrammability of the encoding transformations in order to track code particularities effectively. Such reprogrammability is achieved by utilizing small tables that store relevant application information. The few transformations that result in optimal power reductions for each application hot-spot are selected by utilizing short indices stored into a table, which is accessed only once at the beginning of the transformed bit sequence. Extensive experimental results show significant power reductions ranging up to 80% for switching activity on bus lines and up to 70% when bus coupling effects are also considered.",,"Algorithms; Benchmarking; Computer hardware; Energy dissipation; Field programmable gate arrays; Optimization; Silicon; Cross-coupling transitions; Power reductions; System-on-a-chip (SOC); Wireless devices; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043167721

The capacitors had area-enhancing, hemispherical grain (HSG) polysilicon as bottom electrodes (BEs). These electrodes acted as points of high electric field, and eased charge injection into the Al2O3. As a result, the capacitors had highly asymmetric current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Time-to-fails (TTFs) were polarity-dependent, and, thus, much worse for HSG injection. However, activation energy (Ea) and charge-to-breakdown (QBD) obtained from conducting stress under opposite polarities were a unique function of the electric field only. The results point to a common, polarity-independent mechanism responsible for final breakdown, and the possibility that only the kinetics of degradation is electrode controlled. Good correlation with the thermochemical E model suggests that the breakdown mechanism in Al2O3 might be similar to SiO2. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Activation energy; Alumina; Current voltage characteristics; Dielectric properties; Dynamic random access storage; Electric breakdown of solids; Electric field effects; Electrodes; Polysilicon; Semiconducting aluminum compounds; Semiconductor device models; Semiconductor device testing; Cell capacitors; Charge-to-breakdown; Thermochemical model; Time dependent dielectric breakdown; MOS capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3943086314

This study is an initial test of our model. In a 2 x 2 design, we provided ad lib access to caioricaily dense lard and sucrose (comfort food) + chow or chow alone, and repeatedly restrained half of the rats in each group for 5 d (3 h/d). We measured caloric intake, body weight, caloric efficiency, ACTH, corticosterone (B), and testosterone during the period of restraint and leptin, insulin, and fat depot weights, as well as hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor mRNA at the end of the period. We hypothesized that chronically restrained rats would exhibit a relative increase in comfort food ingestion and that these rats would have reduced HPA responses to repeated restraint. Although total caloric intake was reduced in both groups of restrained rats, compared with controls, the proportion of comfort food ingested increased in the restrained rats compared with their nonrestrained controls. Moreover, caloric efficiency was rescued in the stressed, comfort food group. Furthermore, ACTH and B responses to the repeated restraint bouts were reduced in the rats with access to comfort food. Corticotropin-releasing factor mRNA was reduced in control rats eating comfort food compared with those eating chow, but there were no differences between the stressed groups. The results of this experiment tend to support our model of chronic effects of stress and GCs, showing a stressor-induced preference for comfort food, and a comfort-food reduction in activity of the HPA axis.",,"corticosterone; corticotropin; corticotropin releasing factor; insulin; lard; leptin; messenger RNA; sucrose; testosterone; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; corticotropin blood level; energy consumption; energy metabolism; experimental model; feeding behavior; food deprivation; hormone action; hypothalamus; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; insulin blood level; lipid storage; long term exposure; male; negative feedback; nonhuman; positive feedback; priority journal; protein blood level; rat; stress; testosterone blood level; tissue level; Adrenalectomy; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Animals; Body Weight; Chronic Disease; Corticosterone; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Eating; Energy Intake; Feedback; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Messenger; Stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843118760

The dormant pathogen can survive for decades till the host's immune system is weakened and active tuberculosis develops. Even though fatty acids are thought to be the major energy source required for the persistence phase, the source of fatty acids used is not known. We postulate that the pathogen uses triacylglycerol (TG) as a storage form of fatty acids. Little is known about the biosynthesis of TG in M. tuberculosis. We show that 15 mycobacterial genes that we identified as putative triacylglycerol synthase (tgs) when expressed in Escherichia coli showed TGS activity, and we report some basic catalytic characteristics of the most active enzymes. We show that several tgs genes are induced when the pathogen goes into the nonreplicative drug-resistant state caused by slow withdrawal of O2 and also by NO treatment, which is known to induce dormancy-associated genes. The gene (Rv3136c) that shows the highest TGS activity when expressed in E. coli shows the highest induction by hypoxia and NO treatment. Biochemical evidence shows that TG synthesis and accumulation occur under both conditions. We conclude that TG may be a form of energy storage for use during long-term dormancy. Therefore, TG synthesis may be an appropriate target for novel antilatency drugs that can prevent the organism from surviving dormancy and thus assist in the control of tuberculosis.",,"diacylglycerol acyltransferase; nitric oxide; triacylglycerol; antibiotic resistance; article; bacterial gene; bacterial metabolism; enzyme induction; fatty acid metabolism; hypoxia; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rv313c gene; tgs gene; Acyltransferases; Anaerobiosis; Bacterial Proteins; Culture Media; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Enzyme Induction; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nitric Oxide; Triglycerides; Actinobacteria (class); Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Mycobacterium; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; uncultured actinomycete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242750587

We use modeling and experimentation to assess the potential energy and performance benefits of this type of application support for a laptop disk. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a compiler framework for performing the transformations automatically. Our main modeling results show that the transformations are potentially beneficial. However, our experimental results with six real laptop applications demonstrate that, unless applications are transformed, they cannot accrue any of the predicted benefits. In addition, they show that our compiler can produce almost the same performance and energy results as hand-modifying applications.

Videocentric applications, such wireless videoconferencing, real-time video enhancement and analysis, and new, immersive modes of distance education, will exceed the computational capabilities of current microprocessor and digital signal processor (DSP) architectures. A new class of embedded computers, Portable Video Supercomputers, will combine supercomputer performance with the energy efficiency required for deployment in portable systems. This paper examines one candidate portable video supercomputer, a low memory, monolithically integrated SIMD architecture (SIMPil) that exploits the substantial data parallelism that exists in a suite of implemented video processing applications. The processing element microarchitecture is optimized using a novel technique that combines application simulation and technology modeling to provide a desired combination of performance, area, and energy consumption. Analysis results show that, for MPEG encoding, a SIMPil array implemented in 100 nm CMOS provides 100x greater performance and 10x higher energy efficiency than today's DSPs implemented 150 nm CMOS. This is accomplished using execution parallelism and a carefully selected processing element design.

The signalling systems that underlie appetite control are complex, and the present review highlights our current understanding of key components of these systems. The pattern of eating in obesity ranges from over-eating associated with binge-eating disorder to the absence of binge-eating. The present review also examines evidence of defects in signalling that differentiate these sub-types. The signalling network underlying hunger, satiety and metabolic status includes the hormonal signals leptin and insulin from energy stores, and cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, ghrelin and peptide YY3-36 from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as neuronal influences via the vagus nerve from the digestive tract. This information is routed to specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and brain stem, such as the arcuate nucleus and the solitary tract nucleus respectively, which in turn activate distinct neuronal networks. Of the numerous neuropeptides in the brain, neuropeptide Y, agouti gene-related peptide and orexin stimulate appetite, while melanocortins and α-melanocortin-stimulating hormone are involved in satiety. Of the many gastrointestinal peptides, ghrelin is the only appetite-stimulating hormone, whereas cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY3-36 promote satiety. Adipose tissue provides signals about energy storage levels to the brain through leptin, adiponectin and resistin. Binge-eating has been related to a dysfunction in the ghrelin signalling system. Moreover, changes in gastric capacity are observed, and as gastric capacity is increased, so satiety signals arising from gastric and post-gastric cues are reduced. Understanding the host of neuropeptides and peptide hormones through which hunger and satiety operate should lead to novel therapeutic approaches for obesity; potential therapeutic strategies are highlighted. © The Authors 2004.","Hormones; Obesity; Signalling systems","adiponectin; agouti related protein; alpha melanocortin stimulating hormone; antiobesity agent; cholecystokinin; ghrelin; glucagon like peptide 1; insulin; leptin; melanocortin; neuropeptide Y; orexin; peptide YY; resistin; serotonin 1A agonist; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipose tissue; appetite; arcuate nucleus; binge eating disorder; brain stem; caloric intake; central nervous system; energy balance; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; gastrointestinal tract; hormone action; human; hunger; hypothalamus nucleus; metabolic regulation; nerve cell network; obesity; peripheral nervous system; review; satiety; signal transduction; solitary tract nucleus; vagus nerve; Adipocytes; Appetite Depressants; Appetite Regulation; Brain; Eating; Gastrointestinal Tract; Homeostasis; Hormones; Humans; Hyperphagia; Male; Obesity; Peripheral Nervous System; Satiation; Signal Transduction; Agouti",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042681566

The TES module uses building load and system thermodynamics (BLAST) models for two direct ice systems (ice-on-coil external melt and ice harvester) and one indirect ice system (ice-on-coil internal melt). The TES systems are integrated as part of the EnergyPlus cooling plant components and are able to operate for any charge/discharge rates provided as input data. In this paper, the structure of the TES module as implemented in EnergyPlus is described. In addition, typical input-output variables from the added TES module are illustrated.

Hepatocytes were isolated from pigs (54-68 kg) by collagenase perfusion and seeded into collagen-coated T-25 flasks. Monolayers were established in medium containing fetal bovine serum for 1 day and switched to a serum-free medium for the remainder of the culture period. Hepatocytes were maintained in DMEM/M199 containing 1% DMSO, dexamethasone (10-6 or 10-7 M), linoleic acid (3.4×10-5 M), and carnitine (10-3 M) for 3 days. On the first day of serum-free culture, insulin was added at 1 or 100 ng/ml and glucagon was added at 0, 1, or 100 ng/ml. Recombinant human leptin (200 ng/ml) was added during the final 24 h; medium and all cells were harvested on the third day. Concentrations of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (ketone bodies) in media and glycogen deposition in the cellular compartment were determined. Ketogenesis was highly stimulated by glucagon (1 and 100 ng/ml) and inhibited by insulin. In contrast, glycogen deposition was stimulated by insulin and attenuated by glucagon; high insulin was also associated with a reduction in the ketone body ratio (acetoacetate:β-hydroxybutyrate). High levels of dexamethasone stimulated ketogenesis, but inhibited glycogen deposition at low insulin. Culture of cells with leptin for 24 h, over the range of insulin, glucagon, and dexamethasone concentrations had no effect on either glycogen deposition or ketogenesis. These data suggest that while adult porcine hepatocytes are indeed sensitive to hormonal manipulation, leptin has no direct influence on hepatic energy metabolism in swine.","Glycogen; Ketogenesis; Ketone body ratio (KBR); Leptin; Pig hepatocytes","carnitine; dexamethasone; glucagon; glucocorticoid; glycogen; insulin; ketone body; leptin; linoleic acid; recombinant protein; animal; biosynthesis; body weight; cell culture; conference paper; culture medium; drug effect; human; liver cell; metabolism; physiology; swine; Animals; Body Weight; Carnitine; Cells, Cultured; Culture Media, Serum-Free; Dexamethasone; Glucagon; Glucocorticoids; Glycogen; Hepatocytes; Humans; Insulin; Ketone Bodies; Leptin; Linoleic Acid; Recombinant Proteins; Swine; Animalia; Bovinae; Suidae; Sus scrofa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18144437120

In general, the use of energy storage with electricity generation increases the input energy required to produce electricity, as well as the total greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this increase, the life cycle GHG emission rate from storage systems when coupled with nuclear or renewable sources is substantially lower than from fossil fuel derived electricity sources. GHG emissions from PHS when coupled with nuclear and renewable energy systems are lower than those from BES or CAES.

The refined lattice parameters for the tetragonal NaAlD4 structure are found to be a=5.010Å and c=11.323Å, while those of the monoclinic Na3AlD6 structure are a=5.402Å, b=5.507Å, c=7.725Å, and β=89.491°. Results of ab initio calculations of the lattice parameters are within a few percent of the Rietveld-refined values. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is found to produce significantly better agreement with the experimental data than the local-density approximation (LDA), which is attributed to a very inhomogeneous distribution of electronic density in the alanates. The Rietveld refinement, LDA, and GGA results for the Al-H bond length in NaAlD4 are 1.626, 1.634, and 1.631Å, respectively. Refined values of the Al-H bond lengths in Na3AlD 6, are in agreement within 2% of earlier work on undoped Na 3AlD6 [J. Alloy Comp. 299 (1-2) (2000) 101]. The calculated GGA formation energies for the decomposition reactions of NaAlD 4 and Na3AlD6 are 33.5 and 49.9kJ/mol of H 2, respectively. The corresponding LDA values are significantly higher: 44.6 and 70.3kJ/mol of H2. Comparison with the experimental enthalpy data suggests that the GGA results are in a very good agreement with the measured ΔH [Proceedings of the 1999 DOE Hydrogen Program Annual Peer Review, NREL/CP-570-26938; J.

To characterize these subclasses of adipocytes, we have used a proteomics approach in which isolated adipocytes from FIRKO and control (IR lox/lox) mice were separated by size, fractionated into cytosolic and membrane subfractions, and analyzed by sucrose gradient, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry. A total of 27 alterations in protein expression at key steps in lipid and energy metabolism could be defined, which were coordinately regulated by adipocyte cell size, impaired insulin signaling, or both. Nine proteins, including vimentin, EH-domain-containing protein 2, elongation factor 2, glucose-regulated protein 78, transketolase, and succinyl-CoA transferase were primarily affected by presence or absence of insulin signaling, whereas 21 proteins, including myosin non-muscle form A, annexin 2, annexin A6, and Hsp47 were regulated in relation to adipocyte size. Of these 27 alterations in protein expression, 14 changes correlated with altered levels of mRNA, whereas the remaining 13 were the result of changes in protein translation or turnover. These data suggest an intrinsic heterogeneity in adipocytes with differences in protein expression patterns caused by transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations related to insulin action and cellular lipid accumulation.",,"Biosynthesis; Cells; Glucose; Insulin; Lipids; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Polarization; Sugar (sucrose); Tissue; Adipocytes; Cytosol; Fat-specific insulin receptor knock-out (FIRKO); White adipose tissue; Proteins; 3 oxoacid coenzyme A transferase; calphobindin II; cell protein; EH domain containing protein 2; elongation factor 2; glucose regulated protein 78; heat shock protein 47; insulin; insulin receptor; lipocortin 2; messenger RNA; myosin IIA; transketolase; unclassified drug; vimentin; adipocyte; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell fractionation; cell isolation; cell membrane; cell polarity; cell population; cell size; controlled study; correlation analysis; cytosol; energy metabolism; fat specific insulin receptor knockout mouse; genetic transcription; glucose transport; hormone action; knockout gene; knockout mouse; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polarization; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein expression; protein metabolism; signal transduction; transcription regulation; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Size; Insulin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Protein Array Analysis; Proteome; Proteomics; Receptor, Insulin; Signal Transduction; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843124287

The branched nature of glycogen is important for its function and polyglucosan bodies, particles that contain a glycogen-like polymer with reduced branching, are a feature of several disease states. The degree of glycogen branching is thought to be governed by the balance between glycogen synthesis and branching activities. However, there have been reports that the intrinsic properties of individual branching enzymes govern the degree of branching. To address the relationship between synthesis and branching more fully, we made use of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The glycogen content of yeast cells was manipulated by using different growth conditions or by the introduction of specific mutations. Whenever glycogen storage was elevated, the polysaccharide formed was found to be less branched but normal branching could be restored by overexpression of branching enzyme. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Branching; Glycogen; Polyglucosan; Yeast","1,4 alpha glucan branching enzyme; glucose polymer; glycogen; article; cell growth; concentration response; controlled study; enzyme activity; gene mutation; gene overexpression; gluconeogenesis; glycogen analysis; glycogen synthesis; nonhuman; polymerization; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; storage; yeast; yeast cell; 1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme; Glycogen; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942715072

At about the same time, however, work from a few laboratories suggested that some aspects of that elegant, relatively simple hypothesis required revision - not abandonment, but refinement to accommodate more complex movements of protons in the ATP formation mechanism than originally envisioned by Peter Mitchell. In some situations it appeared that protons were constrained to localized domains rather than always delocalized within an enclosed vesicle as envisioned by chemiosmosis. This minireview tells that story from my perspective, as one of the researchers involved in the experimental approaches that revealed more complex energy coupling proton flux patterns. Ionic conditions during isolated thylakoid storage were found to reversibly switch the $\Delta {\tilde {\mu}}_{\rm H} +$ gradient driving ATP formation between delocalized and localized energy coupling modes. Thylakoid accessible Ca 2+ ions proved to be the switching factor that was responding to the ionic conditions in the storage treatment. The mechanism of Ca 2+ was at least partially demystified when it was shown that the reversible switching between $\Delta {\tilde {\mu}}_{\rm H} +$ energy coupling modes involved Ca 2+ interactions with the 8 kDa CF 0 (the H + channel) subunit in a type of H + flux gating action. Other experiments showed that the Ca 2+ gating of H + flux into the lumen may be a critical regulatory factor in controlling the lumen pH and thereby help regulate the activity of the violaxanthin de-epoxidase enzyme, a key part of the chloroplast photoprotective response to over-energization (excess light) stress.","Andrea Melandri; ATP formation; calcium gating; Donald Ort; energy coupling; Evangalos Moudrianakis; light stress response; localized and delocalized proton gradients; Mordhay Avron; Peter Gräber; Peter Mitchell; Richard Dilley; Yaroslav de Kouchkovsky",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042764417

This research quantifies such effects on the energy balance and evapotranspiration (ET) of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Möench, a C4 grain crop) using a residual energy balance approach. During the summer and autumn of 1998 and 1999, sorghum was grown under free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) conditions near Maricopa, Arizona. Latent heat flux (λET) was determined by subtracting soil heat flux (G0) and sensible heat flux (H) from net radiation (Rn) values in both Control CO2 plots (about 370 μmol mol-1) and FACE plots (Control + 200 μmol mol -1). Rn was observed using net radiometers. G0 was measured with soil heat flux plates at a depth of 10 mm, then corrected for heat storage above the plates. H was determined using measurements of air temperature from aspirated psychrometers, leaf temperature from infrared thermometers, and wind data from a three-cup anemometer. Both FACE and Control plots were divided into semicircular halves to allow a well-watered (Wet) treatment and a drought-stressed (Dry) treatment. This allowed comparisons of the FACE effect on ET in normal and water-stressed conditions. Under Wet conditions, FACE decreased λET by 13.8±1.8% in 1998, and 11.8±1.9% in 1999. Drought-stress resulted in a reduction in λET of 8.5±3.7% for the FACE treatments in 1998, but an increase in λET of 10.5±5.1% in 1999. When soil water was readily available, midday canopy temperatures in the FACE plots were increased by 1.47±0.09°C in 1998, and 1.85±0.20°C in 1999, indicative of increased stomatal resistance due to CO2 enrichment. These data suggest that soil water availability is a determining factor for the FACE effect. Water use efficiency (WUE) increased about 28% due to elevated CO 2 under Wet conditions due to a savings of water for about the same growth, whereas under Dry conditions it increased about 16% due to much greater relative growth on only a slightly higher amount of water. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Electrical and hybrid automobiles have long been developed utilizing fuel cell technology, and all-electric aircraft will someday be a reality. To facilitate such work in electrical power simulators such as PSCAD/EMTDC and later in real-time power simulators like RSCAD/RTDS, accurate models of the transient behavior of all system components must be developed. Although the current state of power system models sufficiently encompasses most conventional systems for detailed simulations, fuel cell models for such studies are underdeveloped for power system analysis. This paper presents the integration of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell model into proposed electrical power system architecture. The fuel cell and support system for power delivery, including the appropriate power electronics and energy storage devices, are simulated and presented. The fuel cell model includes both electrical and thermal components to better capture transient behavior.","And EMTDC models; Distributed power generation; Fuel cell systems; Integrated power management","Distributed power generation; EMTDC models; Fuel cell systems; Integrated power management; Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Electric potential; Electric power systems; Integration; Parameter estimation; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042819214

The hydrophobic porous surface of these monoliths enables the transfer of sufficient energy to the analyte to induce desorption and ionization prior to TOFMS analysis. Both UV and thermally initiated polymerization using a mask or circular openings in a thin gasket have been used to define spot locations matching those of the MALDI plates. The desorption/ ionization ability of the monolithic materials depends on the applied laser power, the solvent used for sample preparation, and the pore size of the monoliths. The monolithic matrices are very stable and can be used even after long storage times in a typical laboratory environment without observing any deterioration of their properties. The performance of the monolithic material is demonstrated with the mass analysis of several small molecules including drugs, explosives, and acid labile compounds. The macroporous spots also enable the archiving of samples.

An integral aspect of hibernation is tolerance to a profound decrease of cerebral perfusion. Identification of regulatory mechanisms that control hibernation in ground squirrels can guide efforts to develop improved treatment for stroke and brain trauma. In this study, we show in multiple tissues that S473 phosphorylation of Akt (Protein kinase B), a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-regulated serine/threonine kinase, was significantly reduced (P<0.001) as was its kinase activity (P=0.023) in the 13-lined ground squirrel, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, during hibernation. T308 phosphorylation of Akt was relatively preserved. Brain immunohistochemical staining confirmed these results. In hibernating animals, reduction of immunoreactive phospho (S473)-Akt was noted throughout the brain. Akt is a key molecule in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signal transduction pathway, which plays a critical role in the balance between survival and apoptosis. The data presented here raise the possibility that down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation plays a regulatory role in hibernation. This would resemble dauer larva formation in Caenorhabditis elegans where Akt inhibition is associated with energy conservation, fat storage, expression of antioxidant enzymes and growth arrest.","Akt; Caenorhabditis elegans; Dauer larva; Disorders of the nervous system; Hibernation; Ischemia; Signaling; Tolerance","insulin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphotransferase; protein kinase B; protein serine threonine kinase; somatomedin; animal experiment; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; brain; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activity; hibernation; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; molecule; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; spermophilus tridecemlineatus; squirrel; survival; tissue; Animals; Apoptosis; Brain; Down-Regulation; Hibernation; Immunohistochemistry; Kidney; Liver; Muscle, Skeletal; Myocardium; Phosphorylation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Sciuridae; Signal Transduction; Somatomedins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942726061

Here, we report that chronic (21-day) oral administration of nalmefene at 2 or 10 mg/kg/day in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice led to significant increases (9-11%) in cumulative food intake. Mice in the nalmefene-treated groups also gained body weight at a rate faster than the control. Body composition analysis showed that the extra body weight gains in the treated animals were mostly due to increased fat accumulation. Since acute nalmefene treatment showed a trend toward a decrease rather than an increase in food intake, it is possible that the orexigenic effect of chronic oral administration of nalmefene was caused by pharmacologically active metabolites rather than the drug itself. Our results argue against the potential use of nalmefene for treating human obesity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a methodology for developing a power management strategy tailored specifically to a parallel Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicle (HHV) configured for a medium-size delivery truck. The Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicle is modeled in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment to facilitate system integration and control studies. A Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm is used to obtain optimal control actions for gear shifting and power splitting between the engine and the hydraulic motor over a representative urban driving schedule. Features of optimal control signal trajectories are then studied to derive implementable rules. System behaviour demonstrates that the new control strategy takes advantage of high power density and efficiency characteristics of hydraulic components, and minimizes disadvantages of low energy density, to achieve enhanced overall efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the potential for fuel economy improvement of delivery trucks with hydraulic hybrid propulsion can be as high as 47%.",,"Computer simulation; Hydraulics; Passenger cars; Propulsion; Transportation; Hydraulic hybrid delivery trucks; Hydraulic hybrid propulsion; Optimal power management; Trucks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9744262621

The design goal of the control strategy is to minimize fuel consumption and engine-out NOx and PM emissions on a set of diversified driving schedules. Six representative driving patterns (RDP) are designed to represent different driving scenarios. For each RDP, the Dynamic Programming (DP) technique is used to find the global optimal control actions. Implementable, sub-optimal control algorithms are then extracted by analyzing the behavior of the DP control actions. A driving pattern recognition (DPR) algorithm is subsequently developed and used to classify the current driving pattern into one of the RDPs; thus, the most appropriate control algorithm is selected adaptively. This 'multi-mode' control scheme was tested on several driving cycles and was found to work satisfactorily.",,"Algorithms; Control systems; Energy storage; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Pattern recognition; Hybrid electric trucks; Hybrid passenger cars; Representative driving patterns (RDP); Trucks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9744227341

The role of neutral lipid storage and hydrolysis, and hence the adipocyte, is central to understanding this phenomenon. The adipocyte holds the major source of stored energy in the body in the form of triacylglycerols (TAG). It has been known for over 35 years that the breakdown of TAG and release of free (unesterified) fatty acids and glycerol from fat tissue can be regulated by a cAMP-mediated process. However, beyond the initial signaling cascade, the mechanistic details of this lipolytic reaction have remained unclear. Work in recent years has revealed that both hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), generally thought to be the ratelimiting enzyme, and perilipin, a lipid droplet surface protein, are required for optimal lipid storage and fatty acid release. There are multiple perilipin proteins encoded by mRNA splice variants of a single perilipin gene. The perilipin proteins are polyphosphorylated by protein kinase A and phosphorylation is necessary for translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet and enhanced lipolysis. Hence, the surface of the lipid storage droplet has emerged as a central site of regulation of lipolysis. This review will focus on adipocyte lipolysis with emphasis on hormone signal transduction, lipolytic enzymes, the lipid storage droplet, and fatty acid release from the adipocyte.","Adipocyte; Adipophilin; ADRP; Lipid droplets; Lipolysis; Perilipin","cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; fatty acid; glycerol; hormone sensitive lipase; perilipin a; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; energy; enzyme kinetics; epidemic; gene; hormone sensitivity; hydrolysis; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; perilipin gene; protein analysis; protein phosphorylation; reaction analysis; review; RNA splicing; signal transduction; Adipocytes; Alternative Splicing; Cholesterol Esterase; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipolysis; Models, Biological; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Transport; Signal Transduction; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9444250464

The sample was composed of a granular storage layer with a saturation remanence close to unity and a soft underlayer. The time-dependent remanent coercivity was measured down to 2.3 ns. The results are in good agreement with the extrapolation of the long time data, in accordance with the thermal switching model proposed by Sharrock, with n = 2/3. The dependence of the switching field in the nanosecond regime on the initial remanence was studied. The remanent coercivity of the saturated sample was found to be lower than that of a partially demagnetized sample. This counter-intuitive behavior was confirmed by simulation, which elucidated the role of the local demagnetizing field in the switching process. The simulation also showed that the effect is sensitive to the time scale of the initial demagnetization process.","Magnetization reversal; Perpendicular magnetic recording","Angular dispersion; Energy density; Magnetization reversal; Perpendicular magnetic recording; Coercive force; Demagnetization; Granular materials; Magnetic hysteresis; Magnetic recording; Magnetization; Optical Kerr effect; Switching; Remanence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444278320

This study was carried out using a laser doppler vibrometer (LDV) to measure the amplitude of the head slider vibration. We also measured the power consumption of the spindle motor. As parameters of the spoiler shape, the thickness and the length were selected. From the experimental result, these parameters effect significantly both the head's vibration and the power consumption. This result suggests that the flow rate reduction with the spoiler causes a reduction of the HSA's FIV, and the energy loss with the spoiler causes an increase of the power consumption. We defined the spoiler's FIV-reducing efficiency as a ratio of the amplitude reduction to the power consumption increase. The length change makes the peak value. This is caused by the fact that the FIV reduction becomes almost constant when the spoiler is longer than the carriage arm length inside disk region, although the spoiler length makes power consumption monotonically large.","Flow-induced vibration; Hard disk; Head stack assembly; Spoiler","Flow-induced vibrations (FIV); Head stack assembly (HSA); Laser doppler vibrometer (LDV); Spoilers; Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Knowledge acquisition; Laser Doppler velocimeters; Parameter estimation; Reduction; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444222804

They find application in valves, switches, closures, and clasps. Mechanically bistable behavior results from the storage and release of energy, typically in springs, with stable positions occurring at local minima of stored energy. Compliant mechanisms offer an elegant way to achieve this behavior by incorporating both motion and energy storage into the same flexible element. Interest in compliant bistable mechanisms has also recently increased because of the advantages of bistable behavior in many micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). Design of compliant or rigid-body bistable mechanisms typically requires simultaneous consideration of both energy storage and motion requirements. This paper simplifies this process by developing theory that provides prior knowledge of mechanism configurations that guarantee bistable behavior. Configurations which include one or more translational, or slider, joints are studied in this work. Several different mechanism types are analyzed to determine compliant segment placement that will ensure bistable mechanism operation. Examples demonstrate the power of the theory in design. © 2004 by ASME.",,"Bistable mechanism configuration; Compliant mechanisms; Translational joints; Kinematics; Mathematical models; Mechanisms; Microelectromechanical devices; System stability; Universal joints; Machine design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344672045

Present-day fuel cells have transient (dynamic) responses that are much slower than the responses of the typical power conditioner and load to which they are attached. This disparity has significant implications on the overall power system design. In particular, some form of energy storage with adequate quick charge/discharge capability is usually needed to provide firm power backup during electrical load increases. This paper describes an effort to improve the small-signal modeling of a Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell's dynamic behavior as an initial step toward prescribing internal design modifications and/or external controller designs to improve its transient behavior. Such improvements will allow for reduced energy storage while increasing the number of suitable storage technology options. Simulation results obtained from the proposed model are presented along with corresponding test results, which show generally good agreement with each other and indicate that this model is to be preferred to another one. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Control system synthesis; Current density; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Ion exchange; Mathematical models; Perturbation techniques; Polymer membrane electrodes; Protons; Transients; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells; Small signal model; Stack voltage equation; Transient dynamic response; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242877764

To reduce development time and costs, we based our design on readily available, standardised modules such as a 486DX100 compatible CPU, a data acquisition board, a flash disk storage unit, and a high-efficiency DC/DC switch-mode power supply. Additionally, we designed and built a telemeter to supply an implanted muscle stimulator with power and control data. The signal from the natural sensors was recorded with a cuff electrode implanted around the palmar digital nerve innervating the radial aspect of the index finger. For amplification of the recorded nerve signal, we added an external low-noise nerve signal amplifier. For pre-processing of the recorded nerve signal, an optimised band-pass filter was used. A data-recording unit allowed storage and off-line analysis of the stimulator command and the recorded nerve signal. The portable system was used by a tetraplegic volunteer to test the feasibility of including natural sensors in a hand grasp neuroprosthesis for activities of daily living. The flexibility of the presented system allows rapid prototyping of experimental FES hand grasp systems intended for portable use. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IPEM.","Functional electrical stimulation; Portable system; Sensory feedback","Band-pass filter; Index finger; Neuroprosthesis; Cost effectiveness; Neurology; Portable equipment; Sensors; Signal processing; Software prototyping; Sensory feedback; algorithm; article; daily life activity; electrostimulation; energy resource; feedback system; hand function; hand prosthesis; information processing; nerve stimulation; priority journal; signal noise ratio; signal processing; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Equipment Failure Analysis; Feasibility Studies; Feedback; Feeding Behavior; Hand; Hand Strength; Humans; Male; Prosthesis Design; Psychomotor Performance; Quadriplegia; Reflex; Stress, Mechanical; Touch; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242684479

Comparators, either explicit or embedded into content-addressable logic, are used extensively throughout such designs to implement several key out-of-order execution mechanisms and support the memory hierarchy. The traditional comparator designs dissipate energy on a mismatch in any bit position. As mismatches occur with a much higher frequency than matches in many situations, considerable improvements in energy dissipation are to be gained by using comparators that dissipate energy predominantly on a full match and little or no energy on partial or complete mismatches. This paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a series of dissipate-on-match comparator designs, including designs for comparing long arguments. Second, we show how comparators, used in modern datapaths, can be chosen and organized judiciously based on the microarchitectural-level statistics to minimize the energy dissipation. We use the actual layout data and the realistic bit patterns of the comparands (obtained from the simulated execution of SPEC 2000 benchmarks) to show the energy impact from the use of the new comparator designs. For the same delay, the proposed 8-bit comparators dissipate 70 percent less energy than the traditional designs if used within issue queues and 73 percent less energy if used within load-store queues. The use of the proposed 6-bit comparators within the dependency checking logic is shown to increase the energy dissipation by 65 percent on the average compared to the traditional designs. We also find that the use of a hybrid 32-bit comparator, comprised of three traditional 8-bit blocks and one proposed 8-bit block, is the most energy-efficient solution for the use in the load-store queue, resulting in 19 percent energy reduction compared to the use of four traditional 8-bit blocks used to implement a 32-bit comparator. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Associative storage; Buffer storage; Comparator circuits; Computer simulation; Energy efficiency; Logic circuits; Energy efficient comparators; Low power datapath; Superscalar microprocessors; Microprocessor chips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242682684

High current density (e.g. 100 mA cm-2) promoted a highly ordered hexagonal pore structure with fast formation rate independent of anodizing solution. Alumina formation rates of 2000 and 1000 nm min-1 were achieved at current densities of 100 and 50 mA cm-2, respectively. These rates were approximately two orders of magnitude greater than other reports in the literature. Different electrolytes of sulfuric acid (1.8-7.2 M), oxalic acid (0.3 M) and mixed solutions of sulfuric and oxalic acids were evaluated as anodizing solutions. At fixed current density, sulfuric acid promoted smaller pore diameter with lower porosity than mixed acids and oxalic acid. The I-V characteristics of aluminium anodization show the measured voltages at given current densities strongly depend on solution composition, operating temperature, and bath agitation.

Most attention is focused on the TiZrNi quasicrystal, demonstrating that this i-phase is a low-temperature stable quasicrystal, forming almost 300. °C below the liquidus temperature. The persistence of the i-phase at low temperatures after very long duration anneals suggests it as the first realistic candidate for a ground-state quasicrystal. A structural model for i(TiZrNi) is presented, the first for any Ti/Zr/Hf-based quasicrystal; the energy is lower than for competing crystal phases, in agreement with the results of the annealing studies. With sufficient undercooling, metastable i(TiZrNi) nucleates in preference to a polytetrahedral C14 Laves phase, suggesting a local icosahedral order in the liquid. X-ray data are presented to support that conclusion. Hydrogen storage properties of these alloys are discussed briefly and pressure composition isotherm measurements are presented and analyzed.

Therefore, processes that prioritize information for storage in memory according to its survival value to the organism are likely to have evolved. Information incurring energy or time costs to acquire, or if forgotten, should be stored and retrieved more effectively than information that is less costly to acquire or forget. We manipulated the costs of acquiring and forgetting information in an eight-arm radial maze memory task for pigs, Sus scrofa, by placing ropes at the entrance to arms, which pigs had to walk over incurring an extra 2-3-s time cost for each arm entry. Each day each pig (N=16) made a sampling visit to the maze to find food in four arms, followed by a 10-min retention interval, and a recall visit in which visits to the four previously empty arms were reinforced. Baited arms were varied daily. Pigs were divided into four groups and exposed to ropes (costs) either during sampling only, recall only, both or neither. Exposure to costs during sampling visits decreased errors during recall visits. This was probably the result of enhanced attention to and encoding of information during sampling. When all groups were performing equally well, retroactive interference treatments revealed hidden differences between them. Groups experiencing costs during recall tests were least susceptible to interference effects, probably because of more considered use of retrieved information. Both memory encoding and retrieval processes may thus be modulated by even small costs of obtaining or forgetting information. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Torpor substantially reduces energy utilization and is not initiated until body mass, fat stores, and serum leptin concentrations are at their nadir. Because photoperiod-dependent torpor is delayed until fat reserves are lowest, leptin concentrations may be a permissive factor for torpor onset. This conjecture was tested by implanting osmotic minipumps into Siberian hamsters manifesting spontaneous torpor; the animals received a constant release of leptin or vehicle for 14 days. Exogenous leptin treatment eliminated torpor in a significant proportion of treated hamsters, whereas treatment with the vehicle did not. Similarly, endogenous serum leptin concentrations were markedly reduced in all animals undergoing daily torpor. Although simply reducing leptin concentrations below a threshold value is not sufficient for torpor initiation, reduced leptin concentrations nevertheless appear necessary for its occurrence. It is proposed that drastically reduced leptin concentrations provide a ""starvation signal"" to an as yet unidentified central mechanism mediating torpor initiation.","Adipose tissue; Energy balance; Hypothermia; Photoperiod; Thermoregulation","leptin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body mass; concentration response; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; food intake; hibernation; hormone blood level; hormone release; hypothermia; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; osmotic minipump; phenotype; Phodopus; photoperiodicity; photophase; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; reproduction; signal transduction; starvation; statistical significance; torpor; winter; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Temperature; Body Weight; Cold; Cricetinae; Female; Food Deprivation; Hibernation; Leptin; Male; Motor Activity; Phodopus; Photoperiod; Telemetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042745464

A physiological role for leptin in this regard remains unclear because the presence of excessive food, and therefore the need to restrain overeating under natural conditions, is doubtful. We have previously shown that CRH-deficient (Crh-/-) mice have glucocorticoid insufficiency and lack the fasting-induced increase in glucocorticoid, a hormone important in stimulating leptin synthesis and secretion. We hypothesized that these mice might have low circulating leptin. Indeed, Crh-/- mice exhibited no diurnal variation of leptin, whereas normal littermates showed a clear rhythm, and their leptin levels were lower than their counterparts. A continuous peripheral CRH infusion to CrA -/- mice not only restored corticosterone levels, but it also increased leptin expression to normal. Surprisingly, 36 h of fasting elevated leptin levels in Crh-/- mice, rather than falling as in normal mice. This abnormal leptin change during fasting in Crh-/- mice was corrected by corticosterone replacement.

The focuses of the review include energy, carbohydrate, protein, selected vitamins and minerals, and fluids. Age-associated changes in body composition, resting energy expenditure, and volume and intensity of training, may decrease the need for dietary energy and the intakes of macro- and micronutrients and fluids. The older athlete should monitor nutrient intakes to insure adequacy, especially regarding carbohydrate to promote glucose storage and use as an energy source during exercise, and protein to promote strength-training-induced muscle hypertrophy. Emphasis should also be placed on the dietary intakes of certain micronutrients, as well as the potential need for supplementation of certain vitamins and minerals, including the vitamins B 2, B6, B12, D, E, and folate, and the minerals calcium and iron. Age-associated changes in thermoregulation and an increased susceptibility to dehydration underscore the critical importance to the older athlete of adequate fluid intake to sustain health and performance. Nutrition is a tool that the older athlete should use to enhance exercise performance and health. © Elsevier Inc. 2004.","aging; elderly; exercise; macronutrient intake; minerals; sport; vitamins","alpha tocopherol; calcium ion; carbohydrate; cyanocobalamin; folic acid; iron; mineral; protein; pyridoxine; riboflavin; trace element; athlete; body composition; dehydration; dietary intake; energy; energy expenditure; energy resource; fluid intake; glucose metabolism; human; liquid; muscle hypertrophy; nutrition; priority journal; review; thermoregulation; training; Aging; Body Composition; Body Temperature Regulation; Dehydration; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Minerals; Nutrition Physiology; Physical Fitness; Sports; Vitamins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942709682

In this work, the influence of Coulomb interactions is considered for optical and quantum computing applications of quantum dots. For example, the operating frequencies of photoemitters and detectors depend on these transition energies, and some proposed charge-based quantum computing devices use these interactions to identify the binary state of a quantum qubit. To study these applications, the energy changes due to Coulomb attraction-repulsion effects are calculated here and compared with the transition energies for states confined in a single dot or occupying different, neighboring dots. The exciton binding energies for states within the same dot are non-negligible, even for large dots. The importance of this conclusion for quantum dot optical applications is discussed. Conversely, for realistic self-assembled lateral arrays of quantum dots, it is shown that the energy of charge interactions between neighboring dots is not high enough to be measured in practice. The difficulty that this poses for proposed charge-based quantum computing applications is discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, exported in-shell walnuts are disinfested using methyl bromide fumigation. Restrictions on methyl bromide use have increased interest in developing alternative postharvest treatments. Radio frequency (RF) heating is such an alternative. Our tests have shown that heating walnuts with radio frequency energy to temperatures lethal to these important insect pests has no negative effects on walnut quality, and may even reduce the susceptibility of walnuts to becoming rancid in storage. Radio frequency treatments provided acceptable rates of heating (5-6°C min -1) for in-shell walnuts to lethal temperatures. Heating walnuts to 55°C or higher resulted in 100% mortality of fifth instar navel orangeworm, which is the most resistant of the three insect pests. Moisture content of walnuts is an important factor affecting heating rates during radio frequency treatments. The relationship between average moisture content and average heating rate was linear, and the variability in moisture content and heating rates was higher with a higher average moisture content. Radio frequency treatments reduce the moisture content of walnuts. A combined system of radio frequency heating with hot air has the potential to accelerate or even replace batch drying of walnuts in the future. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Stimulation of the vagus nerve for control of seizures has become widely accepted, but rarely cures epilepsy. Stimulation of brain regions to terminate seizures is effective in animal models of seizures, and in ending experimentally induced after discharges in humans. Implantation of chronic stimulators to treat epilepsy has been attempted since 1972 with variable results. Progress in the field has been impeded by the multiplicity of stimulation sites chosen, poor understanding of network connectivity, and the rapid change in technological capabilities.

Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of diabetic myocardial disease is still poorly understood. Recent findings: Evidence has emerged that perturbed cardiac energy metabolism (excessive dependence on fatty acid utilization and diminished carbohydrate metabolism) plays a role in the development of myocardial dysfunction in diabetes. In support of this, transgenic mice with cardiac-specific activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, a nuclear receptor transcription factor that enhances the expression of myriad genes controlling cellular fatty acid utilization, exhibit several classic signatures of the diabetic heart. In particular, the hearts of these mice display: increased import, oxidation, and storage of fatty acids; strong counter-regulatory inhibition of glucose import and oxidation; and cardiomyopathic remodeling and dysfunction. A high-fat diet exacerbates the cardiomyopathic phenotype in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha transgenic mice in a completely reversible manner. The dysfunctional phenotype and its resolution correlates with levels of several potential toxic mediators, including triglycerides, ceramide, and reactive oxygen species. These findings contrast with several studies demonstrating beneficial effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ligands in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Summary: Such studies provide a rationale for greater emphasis on serum lipid-lowering strategies and the control of dietary fat content in the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, the use of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha activators or related compounds as therapeutic agents will require rigorous evaluation of the effects on cardiac function in the diabetic patient. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Diabetic cardiomyopathy; Lipotoxicity; PPAR alpha; Reactive oxygen species","ceramide; fatty acid; lipoprotein lipase; myosin heavy chain alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor; triacylglycerol; fatty acid; ligand; myosin heavy chain; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular disease; correlation analysis; diabetes mellitus; energy metabolism; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression; glucose oxidation; glucose transport; heart function; lipid diet; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathology; phenotype; protein family; protein function; review; storage; transgenic mouse; animal; cardiovascular disease; gene expression regulation; genetics; heart muscle; human; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; transgenic animal; Mus musculus; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Ligands; Lipoprotein Lipase; Metabolic Syndrome X; Mice; Myocardium; Myosin Heavy Chains; Oxidative Stress; PPAR alpha; Reactive Oxygen Species",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14844295029

Rev. (February 2003)) has posed numerous unique challenges to researchers. These networks are likely to be composed of hundreds, and potentially thousands of tiny sensor nodes, functioning autonomously, and in many cases, without access to renewable energy resources. Cost constraints and the need for ubiquitous, invisible deployments will result in small sized, resource-constrained sensor nodes. While the set of challenges in sensor networks are diverse, we focus on fundamental networking challenges in this paper. The key networking challenges in sensor networks that we discuss are: (a) supporting multi-hop communication while limiting radio operation to conserve power, (b) data management, including frameworks that support attribute-based data naming, routing and innetwork aggregation, (c) geographic routing challenges in networks where nodes know their locations, and (d) monitoring and maintenance of such dynamic, resource-limited systems. For each of these research areas, we provide an overview of proposed solutions to the problem and discuss in detail one or few representative solutions. Finally, we illustrate how these networking components can be integrated into a complex data storage solution for sensor networks. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The molecules wereassembled on the surface of an indium oxide nanowire that forms the conduction channel of the transistor. We found that the charge storage characteristics of such a device strongly depends on the structure of the terpyridine ligand: both retention time (τ) and threshold voltage shift (ΔVth) increased in the order of 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3, with τ of 200 s, 12 h, and 287 h and ΔVth at 4.8, 12, and 28 V, respectively. Furthermore, when we placed the devices with molecules 1 and 3 in a vacuum and recorded the I-Vg curves ina two-day period, we observed higher hysteresis stability for device with molecule 3. For example, ΔVth was reduced from 4.8 to 1.7 V for the device with molecule 1, while there was no reduction in ΔVth for the device with molecule 2. These results suggest that thiolate headgroup and/or longer ligand length raises the charge tunneling barrier and results in longer charge retention and wider, more stable memory window. This work demonstrates the potential of chemical synthesis toward tailored device characteristics.

Using the driver input, the state of charge (SOC) of the energy storage, the motor/generator speed, the current gear ratio and vehicle speed, a set of 44 rules have been developed, in a fuzzy controller, to effectively determine the power split between the electric machine and the internal combustion engine (ICE). The underlying theme of the fuzzy controller is to optimize the fuel flow and reduce NOx emission. The parameters in the fuzzy rules can be adjusted to trade-off the fuel economy and the NO x emission of the vehicle. Simulation results are used to assess the performance of the controller.

LiMn2O4 particles used as the active material in cathode fabrication were modified by surface adsorption of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). The adsorption and electrochemical performance of the modified cathode material were characterized and compared with that of the untreated LiMn2O4-based cathode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) confirmed the formation of a thin polymer film on the surface of LiMn2O4 particles. The modified LiMn2O4-based cathode showed improved stability during charge/discharge cycling in an organic electrolyte at room temperature. Further, the measured capacity fading after storage at elevated temperature decreased. Capacity fading measured on cathodes made of PDDA-coated LiMn 2O4 powder was lowest for cathodes obtained from powder coated in solutions containing between 30 and 50 mM PDDA. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation of the cathodes at room temperature showed minor changes in surface topography during a potential cycle. Our hypothesis is that the adsorbed polymer layer inhibits surface reactions that cause degradation.

The aerogel morphology is a critical factor in obtaining the electrochemical properties of these materials. The present paper reports OD the synthesis of V2O5 by freeze-drying, an alternative approach for producing a material with an aerogel-like morphology. In this synthesis, the sublimation of cyclohexane circumvents the capillary pressures which cause pore collapse during the normal solvent removal process. The resulting materials are very porous with specific surface areas as high as 250 m2/g. The electrochemical properties of the freeze-dried material are strongly influenced by both the specific surface area of the solid phase and crystallite size.

The seasonal cycle of the divergence of moisture, moist static energy, and dry static energy are decomposed into three terms, the mean divergence, mean advection, and eddy source, each of which are seen to have similar magnitudes and, in many cases, opposite signs. Because of this, the residuals found when comparing atmospheric energy divergence to top-of-atmosphere net radiation or when comparing moisture divergence with land surface streamflow, are highly sensitive to propagating errors. Further analysis of four times per day radiosonde observations from an earlier 18-yr period (1948-65) indicate that the divergence profile of the wind field oscillates equally strongly at seasonal, diurnal, and semidiurnal time scales. The implication of these variations is that climatological means formed by twice-daily sampling (0000 and 1200 UTC) will produce a systematic, seasonally varying bias in the water and energy budgets. To estimate this bias, the monthly mean wind divergence profile is adjusted from a prior estimate until the atmospheric energy budget is closed. The divergence of the eddy and mean-advection terms, which showed significantly less diurnal variability, are unaltered. As an independent check on the procedure, the moisture budget calculated using the adjusted wind divergence profiles are compared with streamflow-based estimates of terrestrial runoff. The adjustment procedure increases the moisture convergence from 0.2 to 0.5 mm day-1, bringing it closer to the terrestrial estimate (0.6 man day-1), and induces a qualitatively more reasonable looking seasonal cycle in the mean-divergence term. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospherics; Catchments; Climate change; Stream flow; Atmospheric column; Moist static energy (MST); Climatology; atmospheric moisture; divergence; energy budget; net radiation; streamflow; water budget; wind profile; Mississippi Basin; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242734067

We observe structure in the electron impact cross section for detaching a single electron from a C4 - cluster anion, which we attribute to the formation and decay of the C42- dianion. The system is energetically unstable and very rapidly decays via double autodetachment. The energy and width of the resonance were determined to be 8.8(5) eV and 1.4(5) eV, respectively, and the resonance lies 1.5(5) eV above the ground state of the neutral system. The experiment was conducted by merging monoenergetic electron and ion beams in the heavy ion storage ring CRYRING. The detachment channel was monitored by detecting neutral C4 fragments.",,"Atomic physics; Electric excitation; Electron resonance; Ground state; Ion beams; Negative ions; Coulomb repulsion energy; Electron impact detachment; Interelectronic repulsion energy; Ion storage rings; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042597420

In order to image a 3D object, the slat collimator device has first to spin around its axis and then rotate around the object to produce 3D projection measurements. Compared to the slice-by-slice 2D reconstruction for the parallel-hole collimator and line integral data, a more complex 3D reconstruction is needed for the slat collimator and plane integral data. In this paper, we propose a 3D RBI-EM reconstruction algorithm with spherically-symmetric basis function, also called 'blobs', for the slat collimator. It has a closed and spherically symmetric analytical expression for the 3D Radon transform, which makes it easier to compute the plane integral than the voxel. It is completely localized in the spatial domain and nearly band-limited in the frequency domain. Its size and shape can be controlled by several parameters to have desired reconstructed image quality. A mathematical lesion phantom study has demonstrated that the blob reconstruction can achieve better contrast-noise trade-offs than the voxel reconstruction without greatly degrading the image resolution. A real lesion phantom study further confirmed this and showed that a slat collimator with CZT detector has better image quality than the conventional parallel-hole collimator with NaI detector. The improvement might be due to both the slat collimation and the better energy resolution of the CZT detector. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Algorithms; Frequency domain analysis; Image quality; Optical collimators; Photon emission; Projection measurements; Spatial domains; Image reconstruction; radon; algorithm; article; collimator; comparative study; equipment design; image quality; image reconstruction; information processing; mathematical computing; mathematical model; phantom; priority journal; radiation detector; sensitivity analysis; simulation; single photon emission computer tomography; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Equipment Failure Analysis; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Rotation; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042784987

We evaluate two mechanisms affecting recruitment: diet and the potential for competition, and storage of lipid energy reserves and the relationship to overwinter survival. The fish in our study were characteristic of white bass in the northern portion of their range, feeding predominantly on zooplankton. Only the largest age-0 white bass ate fish as a significant portion of their diet. Over the summer sampling period, we found decreasing ration sizes, expressed as a percentage of maximum ration, as the summer progressed with a concomitant decrease in the relative amount of lipid storage. In laboratory experiments, age-0 white bass held at 5°C and given food ad libitum did feed, but at rates that were insufficient to maintain body weight. Loss in weight was accompanied with a loss in lipids at a rate of 2.8 mg of lipids per gram of body weight per day. Based on our data, we concluded that age-0 white bass in Lake Erie were food-limited. Food limitation resulted in reduced growth rates, presumably related to competition with other planktivorous fishes. Reduced growth results in increased mortality and, ultimately, low recruitment through increased risk of predation by larger piscivorous fishes, reduced ability for white bass to switch to more energetically profitable piscivory and the increased likelihood of higher overwinter mortality because of reduced lipid stores.","Age-0; Bioenergetics; Daily ration; Lake Erie; Mortality","abundance; bioenergetics; diet; feeding behavior; fish; mortality; Great Lakes; Lake Erie; North America; Chrysops; Morone; Morone chrysops; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344688558

This is critical because soils perform a number of essential processes including supporting food and fiber production, influencing air quality through interaction with the atmosphere, and serving as a medium for storage and purification of water. The soil quality concept was introduced to complement soil science research by making our understanding of soils more complete and helping guide the use and allocation of labor, energy, fiscal, and other inputs as agriculture intensifies and expands to meet increasing world demands. Soil quality thus provides a unifying concept for educating professionals, producers, and the public about the important processes that soils perform. It also provides an assessment tool for evaluating current management practices and comparing alternative management practices. Soil attributes comprising a minimum data set have been identified, and both laboratory and field methods have been developed for measuring them. A soil quality index is being developed to normalize measured soil quality indicator data and generate a numeric value that can be used to compare various management practices or to assess management-induced changes over time. Using previously published data, we evaluated the soil quality index as a tool to assess a wide range of management practices in the Northern Great Plains. The index ranked the treatments: grazed fertilized tame pasture > moderately grazed > ungrazed > heavily grazed > annual cropping with no-tillage > conventionally tilled crop-fallow which agrees with the way they were subjectively ranked in the publications. The soil quality index shows potential for use as a management assessment tool. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Grazing; Soil assessment; Soil function; Soil management; Soil quality index","index method; land use; management practice; soil degradation; soil quality; agriculture; animal; article; domestic animal; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; quality control; soil; soil pollutant; United States; Agriculture; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Quality Control; Soil; Soil Pollutants; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344586571

The field of NICU design is changing rapidly, and design teams will be well served by informing themselves through reading the literature, making visits to exemplary facilities, and attending conferences to learn about the successes and missed opportunities of other design efforts. Quiet infant spaces rely on isolation of the infant from facility and operational noise sources. This isolation cannot be accomplished in traditional open NICUs with adult workspaces, ancillary equipment, bulk storage, and travel paths integrated throughout infant/parent areas. Design failures may result from an inability of the clinical members to break away from traditional designs that favor wide visual and acoustic access to many infant beds, clinicians, and parents. The loss of this traditional access raises concerns about communication during emergencies, in particular, but also about changes in social relationships. Therefore, it is important to address the clinicians' need for fast, reliable communications quite early in the design process.

It is composed of two stages, the LVL2 trigger and the event filter (EF). The LVL2 trigger performs event selection with optimized algorithms using selected data guided by Region of Interest pointers provided by the LVL1 trigger. Those events selected by LVL2 are built into complete events, which are passed to the EF for a further stage of event selection and classification using off-line algorithms. Events surviving the EF selection are passed for off-line storage. The two stages of HLT are implemented on processor farms. The concept of distributing the selection process between LVL2 and EF is a key element in the architecture, which allows it to be flexible to changes (luminosity, detector knowledge, background conditions, etc.) Although there are some differences in the requirements between these subsystems there are many commonalities. An overview of the dataflow (event selection) and supervision (control, configuration, monitoring) activities in the HLT is given, highlighting where commonalities between the two subsystems can be exploited and indicating where requirements dictate that implementations differ. An HLT prototype system has been built at CERN. Functional testing is being carried out in order to validate the HLT architecture.","ATLAS; Event selection; High level trigger; Trigger control and supervision","Algorithms; Computer applications; Digital filters; High energy physics; Optimization; Particle detectors; Photons; Protons; ATLAS; Event selection; High level triggers; Trigger control and supervision; Trigger circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3342982455

Box 3000, Boulder, CO 80307, United States","Despite the importance of overshoot at the base of the solar convection zone for the storage of strong toroidal magnetic field produced there by the solar dynamo, uncertainties concerning the depth and mean subadiabatic stratification remain large. Overshoot models based on the nonlocal mixing-length theory generally produce a shallow, weakly subadiabatic region with a sharp transition to the radiative interior, whereas several numerical simulations lead to significantly subadiabatic overshoot with penetration depth of more than a pressure scale height. We present a semianalytical convection zone/overshoot region model based on the assumption that the convective energy flux is governed by coherent downflow structures starting at the top of the domain and continuing all the way down into the overshoot region, which allows for modeling both the parameter regime addressed by nonlocal mixing-length approach and the regime addressed by numerical simulations. It turns out that the main differences between the nonlocal mixing-length approach and numerical simulations (nearly adiabatic vs. strongly subadiabatic overshoot) are caused by the much larger energy flux used in numerical simulations as a consequence of larger thermal diffusivities required by numerical constraints. The depth of the overshoot region is determined predominantly by the mixing between downflows and upflows in the convection zone. Furthermore, our model shows that the sharp transition between the nearly adiabatic overshoot and radiative interior, a typical result of the nonlocal mixing-length approach, can be avoided by assuming an ensemble of downflows with different strength.","Convection; Sun: helioseismology; Sun: interior",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242713320

Over the preceding two years national parliamentarians, regional politicians and local civic and non-governmental groups had actively opposed the campaign by the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) to import irradiated material for indefinite storage and reprocessing, fearing government abuse and the environmental risks. Putin's approval ostensibly ended the formal debate over the strategic, political, social and economic merits of the programme and positioned Russia to earn a projected $21 billion in foreign contracts over the ensuing decade. The first section highlights the confusion over political power and control in national policy making that mars contemporary assessments of Putin's recentralisation reforms. The second section presents alternative neo-institutional arguments for legislative participation and administrative control which illuminate indirect mechanisms of influence and oversight over federal policy making that are typically overlooked. The remainder of the article applies these insights to the politics of spent nuclear fuel imports. The third section provides an overview of the origins of the spent nuclear fuel legislation and the range of preferences that materialised on the eve of the legislative process. The fourth section examines how parliamentary and regional officials used the new institutional landscape to influence Minatom's spent fuel programme. The fifth section evaluates the level of initial compliance with the new federal laws, focusing on the impact of direct and indirect forms of political transparency and oversight.

Shape-memory polymers possess the capacity to recover large-strain deformations by the application of heat and are candidates for small-scale transduction. The key advantages of shape-memory polymers are their low material/fabrication cost coupled with their simplicity of integration/operation. In the present study, shape-memory polymers are spin coated onto a standard Si wafer and polymerized by thermal annealing. The thermomechanics of strain storage and recovery in the polymer films are studied using instrumented microindentation. The sharp microindents demonstrate full recovery at all load levels, establishing the feasibility of microscale actuation. The microindentation response of the polymer film is shown to depend on temperature and the cooling cycle during indentation. In turn, the subsequent recovery behavior of an indent depends on the thermal history during indentation. Indents performed at higher temperatures are larger in size, but have smaller stored strain energy compared to indents performed at low temperature. The larger stored strain energy in low temperature indents results in lower shape recovery temperatures. The effects of indentation temperature and load are systematically investigated to provide a framework for the use of shape-memory polymers in microsystems. Application of shape-memory polymers is demonstrated through the development of an active microfluidic reservoir. The reservoir was created by indentation at the end of a microfluidic channel and was activated by local heating. The collapse of the filled reservoir caused the motion of fluid down the microfluidic channel. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Annealing; Indentation; Plastic deformation; Polymerization; Semiconducting polymers; Shape memory effect; Silicon wafers; Spin coating; Strain; Thermal effects; Thermomechanical treatment; Thin films; Microelectromechanical systems; Microfluidic; Shape memory polymers; Soft lithograph; Strain deformation; Thermomechanics; Microelectromechanical devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142740174

In this regard, we evaluated postclosure repository performance using Monte Carlo analyses with an NRC-developed system model that has 950 input parameters, of which 330 are sampled to represent system uncertainties. The quantitative compliance criterion for dose was established by NRC to protect inhabitants who might be exposed to any releases from the repository. The NRC criterion limits the peak-of-the-mean dose, which in our analysis is estimated by averaging the potential exposure at any instant in time for all Monte Carlo realizations, and then determining the maximum value of the mean curve within 10,000 years, the compliance period. This procedure contrasts in important ways with a more common measure of risk based on the mean of the ensemble of peaks from each Monte Carlo realization. The NRC chose the former (peak-of-the-mean) because it more correctly represents the risk to an exposed individual. Procedures for calculating risk in the expected case of slow repository degradation differ from those for low-probability cases of disruption by external forces such as volcanism. We also explored the possibility of risk dilution (i.e., lower calculated risk) that could result from arbitrarily defining wide probability distributions for certain parameters. Finally, our sensitivity analyses to identify influential parameters used two approaches: (1) the ensemble of doses from each Monte Carlo realization at the time of the peak risk (i.e., peak-of-the-mean) and (2) the ensemble of peak doses calculated from each realization within 10,000 years.

Methods: Estimates of %fat were made via AP, hydrostatic weighing (HW), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the criterion, a four-component model (4C) in 64 black (B) and white (W) men, who were either resistance trained (RT) or served as controls (C). Results: Based on a three-way ANOVA, there were no statistically significant three-way or race × musculoskeletal development interactions. There was no main effect of race on the validity of estimating %fat by AP; the mean bias between %FatAP and %Fat4C was similar for B (3.6% body fat) and W (3.7%). In addition, the density of the fat-free mass (Dffm) for B (1.098 ± 0.002 g·mL-1) was not different than 1.10 g.mL-1. There was a significant effect of musculoskeletal development on the validity of the estimation of %fat from AP; the mean difference in %fat between %FatAP and %Fat4C was less in RT (1.5% body fat) than in C (5.3%), but a large SEE of 5.5% was observed for RT. A significant (P &lt; 0.05) correlation was found between the mean bias between methods and body volume (-0.44) and mesomorphy (-0.55). Conclusions: Race does not affect the accuracy of estimating %fat by AP. Race-specific equations estimating %fat via densitometry (e.g., AP, HW) such as the Schutte are not justified, because Dffm is not greater than 1.10 g·mL-1. Estimation of %fat via AP is more accurate in larger individuals with high musculoskeletal development as a group, but individual results are highly variable.","%fat; Blacks; BOD POD; Body composition; Four-component model; Mesomorphy","accuracy; air plethysmography; analysis of variance; article; body fat; bone development; Caucasian; controlled study; correlation analysis; densitometry; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; human; hydrostatic pressure; lipid storage; male; muscle development; musculoskeletal system; Negro; normal human; plethysmography; race; statistical significance; training; African Continental Ancestry Group; Anthropometry; Body Water; Densitometry, X-Ray; European Continental Ancestry Group; Humans; Musculoskeletal Physiology; Plethysmography; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642542540

In the past three decades, significant advances have been made in delineating key extracellular and intracellular stimulators of fat cell formation or adipogenesis. In this review, the author focuses on new findings of specific inhibitors of adipogenesis. Understanding the balance between positive and negative regulators of adipogenesis has important health-related implications for anti-obesity medical therapy and lipodystrophy. Recent findings: Adipogenesis is a highly regulated process requiring coordinated expression and activation of two main groups of adipogenic transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor gamma. In response to hormonal and nutrient stimuli, the increased expression and activation of these transcription factors induce the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. More recently, several groups have identified extracellular inhibitors of adipocyte formation, including cytokines, lipid molecules, genistein, and protease inhibitors. Intracellular signaling molecules, which negatively regulate adipogenesis, include Pref-1, Foxo1, Foxa2, SMAD-3, WNT-10b, GATA-2 and GATA-3. Summary: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the United States and in other westernized societies. Understanding the mechanisms of excessive energy storage in adipose tissue is necessary to develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent and treat obesity. One potential, but unrealized, approach to obesity treatment is to target excessive adipose tissue enlargement. A number of promising extra- and intracellular inhibitors of fat cell formation have been identified, but the modulation of adipose tissue mass may have both advantageous and deleterious health effects. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Inhibitors; Lipodystrophy; Obesity; Preadipocytes","CCAAT enhancer binding protein; cytokine; genistein; lipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; proteinase inhibitor; Smad3 protein; transcription factor GATA 2; transcription factor GATA 3; Wnt protein; adipose tissue; cell proliferation; enzyme inhibition; hormonal regulation; human; lipodystrophy; metabolic inhibition; nonhuman; nutrient supply; organogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; review; transcription initiation; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Anti-HIV Agents; Cell Differentiation; Cytokines; Depression, Chemical; Fatty Acids; Genistein; HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy Syndrome; Humans; Obesity; Protease Inhibitors; Transcription Factors; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642515832

Physiologically appropriate concentrations of naturally secreted corticosteroids (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in rats) have major stimulatory effects on caloric intake and, in the presence of insulin, preference. We first address the close relationship between glucocorticoids and energy balance under both normal and abnormal conditions. Because excess caloric intake is stored in different fat depots, we also address the systemic effects of glucocorticoids on redistribution of stored energy preponderantly into intraabdominal fat depots. We provide strong evidence that glucocorticoids modify feeding and then discuss the role of insulin on the choice of ingested calories, as well as suggesting some central neural pathways that may be involved in these actions of glucocorticoids and insulin. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary utility of these actions of the stress hormones, and how dysregulatory effects of chronically elevated glucocorticoids may occur in our modern, rich societies.",,"corticosteroid; cortisone; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; insulin; abdomen; adrenalectomy; caloric intake; Cushing disease; energy; energy balance; feeding; food intake; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; malnutrition; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; short survey; Abdomen; Animals; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Insulin; Obesity; Socioeconomic Factors",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542490348

Inst., Rutgers University, 604 Allison Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8082, United States","The management of ecosystems has been improved by both a public understanding of ecosystem structure and function and by managers' understanding of public perceptions and attitudes. This is especially true for contaminated lands where there are a variety of remediation, restoration, and future land-use decisions to be made. This paper synthesizes several surveys from four US Department of Energy (DOE) sites in the states of South Carolina, Idaho, Nevada, and New York. Although ethnic composition varied among the sites, age and gender did not. The percentage of the study population engaged in hunting ranged from 30% to 41% and that in fishing ranged from 55% to 74%. Average hunting rates ranged from 9 (New York) to 15 (South Carolina) days/year; average fishing rates ranged from 12 (New Mexico) to 38 (New York) days a year. Despite the demographic and recreational rate differences, there was remarkable agreement about future land uses. Maintaining these DOE sites as National Environmental Research Parks and using them for nonconsumptive recreation rated the highest. The lowest rated future land uses were current and additional nuclear waste storage and the building of homes and factories. People who participated in a recreational activity rated those future land uses higher than nonusers. While these data on recreational rates can be used to assess the potential risk to people using contaminated sites and to aid in setting clean-up standards based on potential risk, the information on land-use preferences can be used by managers to determine future use and to plan for such use.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements of both [Cnmim]3[α-PW 12O40] salts (for n=2 and 5) were performed in acetonitrile containing either tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate, abbreviated TBAPF6, or the corresponding [Cnmim]BF 4 ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes. The results are compared with the corresponding data obtained in the neat [Cnmim]BF4 ILs without addition of other electrolytes.

This allows an auditor to verify the economic picture by checking it against a more complete representation of the flows and storages of real wealth as measured by emergy. In this study, we constructed emergy accounts for the state of West Virginia in 1997. The income statement showed annual production, consumption, and flows of emergy and dollars into and out of the state. The balance sheet evaluated the storage of emergy in some of the state's assets. Emergy indices were used to answer questions posed by managers and gain insight into the state's economic and environmental strengths and weaknesses. West Virginia has great wealth in nonrenewable resources (9E14 sej m-2 or 17 times the U.S. average). The investment ratio of emergy purchased outside to indigenous renewable and nonrenewable emergy was 2.2:1, which indicates a high potential for future development. However, the environmental loading ratio (14:1) was already 1.5 times higher than that found at an average location in the U.S. Twice as much emergy was exported as received and standard of living indicators showed that people have largely failed to benefit from their state's wealth. We propose that, just as in business, where decisions made using financial accounts ensure solvency; decisions governing the environment should be made based on an emergy accounting of activities, assets, and liabilities for the combined system of humanity and nature. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Emergy analysis; Environmental accounting; Environmental assessment; Management questions; West Virginia","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy resources; Finance; Societies and institutions; Assets; Nonrenewable resources; Environmental protection; decision making; emergy; environmental assessment; environmental economics; accounting; article; commercial phenomena; controlled study; decision making; economic development; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental economics; environmental management; financial management; government; income; United States; utilization review; Commerce; Conservation of Energy Resources; Environment; Humans; Income; Models, Economic; Policy Making; Social Conditions; State Government; West Virginia; North America; United States; West Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942476087

The Pu, possibly as Pu(V) according to EELS measurements, was dispersed within re-precipitated uranium oxide (identified as U3O8) nano-crystals between U(VI) secondary phases and the CSNF surface. The U, Pu, and Am enrichment was observed in the corrosion products with tests on different nuclear fuels.

Unlike the sensible heat storage method, the latent heat storage method provides much higher storage density, with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat. This paper reviews previous work on latent heat storage and provides an insight to recent efforts to develop new classes of phase change materials (PCMs) for use in energy storage. Three aspects have been the focus of this review: PCM materials, encapsulation and applications. There are large numbers of phase change materials that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications. Paraffin waxes are cheap and have moderate thermal energy storage density but low thermal conductivity and, hence, require large surface area. Hydrated salts have larger energy storage density and higher thermal conductivity but experience supercooling and phase segregation, and hence, their application requires the use of some nucleating and thickening agents. The main advantages of PCM encapsulation are providing large heat transfer area, reduction of the PCMs reactivity towards the outside environment and controlling the changes in volume of the storage materials as phase change occurs. The different applications in which the phase change method of heat storage can be applied are also reviewed in this paper. The problems associated with the application of PCMs with regards to the material and the methods used to contain them are also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These advanced electrical systems will require the electrical energy-storage element (one or more batteries) to operate at a partial-state-of-charge for most of its life and at unprecedented high rates (so-called 'HRPSoC duty'). The remarkable advances achieved with valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery technology for electric vehicles (EVs) during the past 8-10 years will be of only passing value in overcoming the challenges posed by HRPSoC duty. This is because the battery failure modes seen in HRPSoC operation are quite different from those faced in EV (deep-cycle) use. The replacement of the 12V automotive battery will not take place rapidly. If the applications that take its place are to be satisfied by a lead-acid product (probably VRLA), rather than by a battery of a different chemistry, a programme of development as successful as that mounted for deep-cycle duty will be required. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We have investigated the conditions under which pH gradients are maintained across the membranes of fatty acid vesicles, a model of early cell membranes. We show that pH gradients across such membranes decay rapidly in the presence of alkali-metal cations, but can be maintained in the absence of permeable cations. Under such conditions, when fatty acid vesicles grow through the incorporation of additional fatty acid, a transmembrane pH gradient is spontaneously generated. The formation of this pH gradient captures some of the energy released during membrane growth, but also opposes and limits further membrane area increase. The coupling of membrane growth to energy storage could have provided a growth advantage to early cells, once the membrane composition had evolved to allow the maintenance of stable pH gradients.",,"alkali metal; cation; fatty acid; article; cell membrane; electrochemical analysis; energy transfer; membrane component; membrane potential; membrane transport; membrane vesicle; micelle; pH; priority journal; proton transport; Arginine; Cations; Cell Division; Cell Membrane; Fatty Acids; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Liposomes; Micelles; Oleic Acid; Proton-Motive Force",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542533863

Here, the intermolecular and supramolecular electron transfer processes from electron donors (porphyrins (P), chlorophylls (Chl), phthalocyanines (Pc) and naphthalocyanines (Nc)) and their metal derivatives to electron acceptors (fullerenes such as C 60 and C 70) studied by nanosecond and picosecond laser flash photolysis techniques in polar and nonpolar solvents are reviewed. For intermolecular systems in polar solvents, photoinduced electron transfer takes place via the excited triplet states of C 60/C 70 or via the excited triplet states of P/Pc/Nc, yielding solvated radical ions in polar solvents; thus, the back electron transfer rates are generally slow. In the case of the supramolecular dyads and triads formed by axial coordination, hydrogen bonding, crown ether complexation, or rotaxane formation, the photoinduced charge separation takes place mainly from the excited singlet state of the donor; however, the back electron transfer rates are generally quite fast.

These applications include soldier and sensor power (0-100W) and auxiliary power units (500-3000W). Over the past few years, the fuel cell industry has realized remarkable decreases in the size and weight of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems. However, a safe and affordable means of storing and generating hydrogen does not yet exist to justify their transition into the field. In order to assess the hydrogen storage capacity and hydrogen generation rates of ammonia (NH3) based systems, the US Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), tested several ammonia hydride hydrogen generator systems built by Hydrogen Components Inc. (HCI). Experimental results and analysis illustrate that while there are developments necessary at the sub-system level, the hydrogen generators are ideal energy storage devices for low power (5W) operations over wide temperature ranges.

Our starting setup consists of a 70 km × 106 km segment of a model lithosphere containing a random set of thermal perturbations. This allows the development of multiple sets of interacting ductile faults. The perturbations diffuse through conduction while the model is subject to constant velocity pure shear boundary conditions. The entire lithosphere has two domains, one governed chiefly by the Peierls mechanism (cold top part) and another by power law creep (hot lower part). In the calculations, the primary creep mechanisms are not assigned but activated by their dominance through adding power and Peierls creep strain-rates. The water content is always below solubility, hence brittle fracture is not considered in this model. Extreme localization through thermal-mechanical feedback is observed in interacting ductile faults inverse cascading from short- to long-length scales. Another outstanding effect of interacting faults is the remarkable ability to reduce the time scale leading to finite amplitude-instability. Both Peierls- and power law-domains are affected, but the Peierls-domain exhibits true, ductile, faults while the power law domain develops unstable slipping events akin to brittle shear faults. This affinity to a seismic response is due to the exponential temperature dependence of power law creep leading to short creep-bursts with time scales less than a day. The addition of water can stabilize the brittle like response into a more ductile one through its effect on the activation energy. The main storage of elastic energy lies in the Peierls domain so that shear zones are attracted to an isotherm 875-1100 K, thus marking the transition between both creep regimes in the p-T-strain-rate space. Criteria for stability and accuracy in the presence of thermal feedback are developed. These show that extremely high mesh resolution (∼100-500 m local resolution) is required for accurately assessing the potential for shear localization.

It is well known from virial considerations that stringent global constraints apply for a force-free field to be confined in equilibrium against expansion into the unbounded space. This property as a basic mechanism for solar coronal mass ejections is explored by examining several sequences of axisymmetric force-free fields of an increasing total azimuthal flux with a power-law distribution over the poloidal field. Particular attention is paid to the formation of an azimuthal rope of twisted magnetic field embedded within the global field, and to the energy storage properties associated with such a structure. These sequences of solutions demonstrate (1) the formation of self-similar regions in the far global field where details of the inner boundary conditions are mathematically irrelevant, and (2) the possibility that there is a maximum to the amount of azimuthal magnetic flux confined by a poloidal field of a fixed flux anchored rigidly to the inner boundary. The nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems we treat are mathematically interesting and challenging, requiring a specially designed solver, which is described in the Appendix.","MHD; Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: magnetic fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442511998

This adaptability requires 'a clear capacity to utilize lipid and carbohydrate fuels and to transition between them' (Kelley et al. 2002b). Such capacities characterize the healthy state and can be termed 'metabolic flexibility'. However, increasing evidence points to metabolic inflexibility as a key dysfunction of the cluster of disease states encompassed by the term 'metabolic syndrome'. In obese and diabetic individuals this inflexibility is manifest in a range of metabolic pathways and tissues including: (1) failure of cephalic-phase insulin secretion (impaired early-phase prandial insulin secretion concomitant with failure to suppress hepatic glucose production and NEFA efflux from adipose tissue); (2) failure of skeletal muscle to appropriately move between use of lipid in the fasting state and use of carbohydrate in the insulin-stimulated prandial state; (3) impaired transition from fatty acid efflux to storage in response to a meal. Finally, it is increasingly clear that reduced capacity for fuel usage in, for example, skeletal muscle, as indicated by reduced mitochondrial size and density, is characteristic of the metabolic syndrome state and a fundamental component of metabolic inflexibility. Key questions that remain are how metabolic flexibility is lost in obese and diabetic individuals and by what means it may be regained.","Lipid and carbohydrate utilization; Metabolic flexibility; Metabolic syndrome","carbohydrate; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; lipid; adipose tissue; carbohydrate diet; conference paper; diabetes mellitus; energy; gluconeogenesis; human; insulin release; insulin resistance; lipid diet; liver; metabolic regulation; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; muscle; obesity; Adipose Tissue; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome X; Muscle, Skeletal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942722769

This analysis shows that the p and q powers are not associated with separate power phenomena, but with multiple phenomena. Moreover, the results of the IRP p-q Theory contradict some common interpretations of power phenomena in three-phase circuits. Namely, according to the IRP p-q Theory the instantaneous reactive current can occur even if a load has zero reactive power, Q. Similarly, the instantaneous active current can occur even if a load has zero active power, P. Moreover, these two currents in circuits with a sinusoidal supply voltage can be nonsinusoidal even if there is no source of current distortion in the load. The analysis shows that a pair of values of instantaneous active and reactive p and q powers does not enable us to draw any conclusion with respect to the power properties of three-phase unbalanced loads even in a sinusoidal situation. Thus, the Instantaneous Reactive Power p-q Theory does not identify power properties of such loads instantaneously. This conclusion may have an importance for control algorithms of active power filters. The paper reveals the relationship between the p and q powers and the active, reactive and unbalanced powers, P, Q, and D and specifies the required energy storage capability of active power filters operated under sinusoidal unbalanced conditions.","Active current; Active power filters; Apparent power; Currents' physical components (CPC) power theory; Instantaneous active power; Instantaneous reactive power; Reactive current; Switching compensators; Unbalanced power; Unbalanced systems","Active filters; Algorithms; Electric currents; Electric distortion; Electric potential; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Networks (circuits); Active current; Active power filters; Apparent power; Currents physical components power theory; Instantaneous reactive power theory; Reactive current; Switching compensators; Unbalanced power; Reactive power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942579194

These models are widespread in engineering and life sciences and typically involve the exchange of nonnegative quantities between subsystems or compartments wherein each compartment is assumed to be kinetically homogeneous. However, in many engineering and life science systems, transfers between compartments are not instantaneous and realistic models for capturing the dynamics of such systems should account for material in transit between compartments. Including some information of past system states in the system model leads to infinite-dimensional delay nonnegative dynamical systems. In this note, we develop dissipativity theory for nonnegative dynamical systems with time delay using linear storage functionals with linear supply rates. These results are then used to develop general stability criteria for feedback interconnections of nonnegative dynamical systems with time delay.","Compartmental systems; Dissipativity theory; Feedback systems; Linear storage functionals; Linear supply rates; Nonnegative systems; Time delay","Asymptotic stability; Engineering; Feedback; Kinetic theory; Mathematical models; Compartmental systems; Dissapitivity theory; Linear storage functions; Linear supply rates; Nonnegative systems; Time delay systems; Delay control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942538462

Extensible processors, which are getting increasingly popular in embedded system design, allow a designer to customize a base processor core through instruction set extensions. Existing processor energy macromodeling techniques are not applicable to extensible processors, since they assume that the instruction set architecture as well as the underlying structural description of the micro-architecture remain fixed. Our solution to the above problem is a hybrid energy macromodel suitably parameterized to estimate the energy consumption of an application running on the corresponding application-specific extended processor instance, which incorporates any custom instruction extension. Such a characterization is facilitated by careful selection of macromodel parameters/variables that can capture both the functional and structural aspects of the execution of a program on an extensible processor. Another feature of the proposed energy characterization flow is the use of regression analysis to build the macromodel. Regression analysis allows for in-situ characterization, thus allowing arbitrary test programs to be used during macromodel construction. We validated the proposed methodology by characterizing the energy consumption of a state-of-the-art extensible processor (Tensilica's Xtensa). We used the macromodel to analyze the energy consumption of several benchmark applications with custom instructions. The mean absolute error in the macro-model estimates is only 3.3%, when compared to the energy values obtained by a commercial tool operating on the synthesized register-transfer level (RTL) description of the custom processor. Our approach achieves an average speedup of three orders of magnitude over the commercial RTL energy estimator. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology also achieves good relative accuracy, which is essential in energy optimization studies. Hence, our technique is both efficient and accurate.","Application-specific instruction set processor (ASIPs); Energy estimation; Extensible processor; Macromodel","Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Intellectual property; Regression analysis; Systems analysis; Application-specific instruction set processors (ASIP); Energy estimation; Extensible processors; Macromodel; Program processors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542479965

The realization of these applications however, is limited by the lack of a similarly sized power source. Micro-scale concepts to generate electrical power include devices which use the stored energy in fuels to those which harvest energy from the environment. Many proposed power generation systems employ a piezoelectric component to convert the mechanical energy to electrical energy. Of primary importance is the efficiency of power conversion. In this paper, an exact formula is developed that predicts the power conversion efficiency for a device that contains a piezoelectric component. This formula transparently and quantitatively reveals a trade-off effect on efficiency caused by the quality factor and electromechanical coupling factor of the device. In particular, decreasing the structural stiffness leads to the largest gains in efficiency, followed by decreasing the mechanical damping and increasing the effective mass.",,"Damping; Digital signal processing; Electric power generation; Electric transformers; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Microsensors; Polymers; Q factor measurement; Coupling coefficient; Electromechanical coupling; Piezoelectric transformers; Structural stiffness; Piezoelectric devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542479730

A laboratory hydraulic flume was used to simulate a reach of sewer or storage tank. The flushing device was fabricated and installed at upstream end of the flume. The removed sediment was collected at downstream end of the flume and weighed. The test results indicate that the weight of flushed sediment increases with increasing initial water depth in the flushing device; the weight of flushed sediment decreases with increasing initial water depth in the flume; the weight of flushed sediment only changes slightly with changing height of flushing device opening for water release and does not necessarily increase with increasing opening height.

In the absence of insulin (streptozotocin-induced diabetes) diabetic rats markedly increase their chow intake in proportion to glucocorticoids. Given a choice of lard or chow, diabetic rats first eat lard, then reduce caloric intake to normal for 48 h before returning to hyperphagia on chow alone. We performed three experiments to determine the relationship of corticosterone and insulin to lard intake, chow intake, body weight, hormones, and fat depots. The results of these studies clarify the actions of both circulating glucocorticoids and insulin on caloric intake in adult male rats. Our experiments show that glucocorticoids provoke dose-related increases in total caloric intake that persist for days and weeks; the results also suggest that increasing insulin concentrations stimulated by glucocorticoids determine the amount of fat intake. Furthermore, we show that lard intake is associated with increasing insulin concentrations. Additionally, the results in adrenalectomized and adrenalectomized, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats strongly suggest that it is a combination of corticosterone and insulin that increases abdominal fat depot weight. Independently of the hormonally manipulated rats, the results also show that intact rats voluntarily eat a considerable and stable proportion of their daily calories as lard when given a choice between lard and chow. These results suggest that some human obesities may result from elevated glucocorticoids and insulin increasing the proportional intake of high density calories.",,"corticosterone; glucocorticoid; insulin; lard; adrenalectomy; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; fat intake; hormone determination; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; molecular interaction; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; streptozocin diabetes; Adipose Tissue; Adrenalectomy; Animals; Corticosterone; Dietary Fats; Drug Interactions; Energy Intake; Insulin; Male; Obesity; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042475403

Such filaments can have aspect ratios of length to radius ranging from a few tens to several thousands. Full discretizations of such 3D flows are very costly. Instead, we employ a non-local slender body theory that yields an integral equation, along the filament centerline, relating the force exerted on the body to the filament velocity. This hydrodynamical description takes into account the effect of the filament on the fluid, and is extended to capture the interaction of multiple filaments as mediated by the intervening fluid. We consider filaments that are inextensible and elastic. Replacing the force in the slender body integral equation by an explicit expression that uses Euler-Bernoulli theory to model bending and tensile forces yields an integral expression for the velocity of the filament centerlines, coupled to auxiliary integro-differential equations for the filament tensions. Based on a regularized version of these slender body equations that is asymptotically equivalent to the original formulation, we construct a numerical method which uses a combination of finite differences, implicit time-stepping to avoid severe stability constraints, and special quadrature methods for nearly singular integrals. We present simulations of single flexible filaments, as well as multiple interacting filaments, evolving in a background shear flow. These simulations show shear induced buckling and relaxation of the filaments, leading to the storage and release of elastic energy. These dynamics are responsible for the development of positive first normal stress differences, commonly associated with visco-elastic fluids that are suspensions of microscopic elastic fibers. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether PARP contributes to mechanisms of the hypothermic ischemia-reperfusion injury that occurs when kidneys are cold stored for transplantation. Cortical tissue slice PARP enzyme activity rose significantly with prolonged cold storage and was dependent on both reperfusion and preservation quality. However, prior exposure to warm ischemia abrogated this increase. PARP protein increased with cold storage but was not dependent on reperfusion. PARP enzyme activity rose quickly after reperfusion in buffer and was not different when whole blood was used. Addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide (3 mM) to normal renal slices significantly increased PARP activity over 4 h in the cortex but not in the medulla, but the medullary basal PARP synthesis rate was five times higher than that in the cortex. However, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitors catalase (2,000 U/ml), Trolox (200 μM), and DMSO (15 mM) did not reduce reperfusion-induced PARP activity in cold-stored cortical slices. Finally, PARP inhibitors potentiated preservation injury in isolated canine proximal renal tubules. In conclusion, canine renal PARP enzyme activity rises with prolonged cold storage after reperfusion and may play a protective rather than an injurious role in hypothermic preservation for transplantation. ROS are sufficient but not necessary to activate PARP under these conditions.","Adenosine 5′-triphosphate; Base excision system; Energy failure; NAD+; Pharmacological inhibition; Reperfusion injury","3 aminobenzamide; dimethyl sulfoxide; hydrogen peroxide; n (5,6 dihydro 6 oxo 2 phenanthridinyl) 2 dimethylaminoacetamide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase inhibitor; reactive oxygen metabolite; trolox C; animal model; animal tissue; article; blood; controlled study; cryopreservation; drug effect; enzyme activity; enzyme synthesis; hypothermia; ischemia; kidney cortex slice; kidney injury; kidney ischemia; kidney medulla; kidney preservation; kidney proximal tubule; kidney transplantation; nonhuman; priority journal; protection; reperfusion injury; Animals; Caspase 3; Caspases; Cryopreservation; Dogs; Enzyme Inhibitors; Hypothermia, Induced; Kidney Cortex; Kidney Transplantation; NAD; Oxidative Stress; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reperfusion Injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942471152

The ab initio approach within the coupled channel approximation has several inherent advantages in addition to the natural unification of resonant and non-resonant phenomena. It enables a general and self-consistent treatment of photoionization and electron-ion recombination employing identical wavefunction expansion. Detailed balance takes account of interference effects due to resonances in cross sections, calculated explicitly for a large number of recombined (e+ion) bound levels over extended energy regions. The theory of DR by Bell and Seaton is adapted for high-n resonances in the region below series limits. The R-matrix method is employed for (A) partial and total photoionization and photorecombination cross sections of (e+ion) bound levels, and (B) DR and (e+ion) scattering cross sections. Relativistic effects and fine structure are considered in the Breit-Pauli approximation. Effects such as radiation damping may be taken into account where necessary. Unified recombination cross sections are in excellent agreement with measurements on ion storage rings to about 10-20%. In addition to high accuracy, the strengths of the method are: (I) both total and level-specific cross sections and rate coefficients are obtained, and (II) a single (e+ion) recombination rate coefficient for any given atom or ion is obtained over the entire temperature range of practical importance in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, (III) self-consistent results are obtained for the inverse processes of photoionization and recombination; comprehensive datasets have been computed for over 50 atoms and ions.

High quality photographic images of gross specimens can be rapidly and conveniently acquired with a high-resolution digital camera, and specialized digital cameras have been developed for photomicroscopy. Digital cameras utilize charge-coupled devices (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors to measure light energy and additional circuitry to convert the measured information into a digital signal. Since digital cameras do not utilize photographic film, images are immediately available for incorporation into web sites or digital publications, printing, transfer to other individuals by email, or other applications. Several excellent digital still cameras are now available for less than $2,500 that capture high quality images comprised of more than 6 megapixels. These images are essentially indistinguishable from conventional film images when viewed on a quality color monitor or printed on a quality color or black and white printer at sizes up to 11 x 14 inches. Several recent dedicated digital photomicroscopy cameras provide an ultrahigh quality image output of more than 12 megapixels and have low noise circuit designs permitting the direct capture of darkfield and fluorescence images. There are many applications of digital images of pathologic specimens. Since pathology is a visual science, the inclusion of quality digital images into lectures, teaching handouts, and electronic documents is essential. A few institutions have gone beyond the basic application of digital images to developing large electronic hematology atlases, animated, audio-enhanced learning experiences, multidisciplinary Internet conferences, and other innovative applications. Digital images of single microscopic fields (single frame images) are the most widely utilized in hematology education at this time, but single images of many adjacent microscopic fields can be stitched together to prepare ""zoomable"" panoramas that encompass a large part of a microscope slide and closely simulate observation through a real microscope. With further advances in computer speed and Internet streaming technology, the virtual microscope could easily replace the real microscope in pathology education. Later in this decade, interactive immersive computer experiences may completely revolutionize hematology education and make the conventional lecture and laboratory format obsolete. Patient care is enhanced by the transmission of digital images to other individuals for consultation and education, and by the inclusion of these images in patient care documents. In research laboratories, digital cameras are widely used to document experimental results and to obtain experimental data. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Image processing; Medical illustration; Microcomputers; Microscopy; Optics; Photography; Photomicrography; Telepathology","metal oxide; camera; computer; device; electronics; fluorescence; hematology; image quality; Internet; medical research; microphotography; microscopy; monitor; pathology; photography; review; Computers; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Microscopy, Video; Pathology, Clinical; Photography; Photomicrography; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Software; Telepathology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842739567

Neutrons are ideal for the imaging of hydrogen fuel cells because of their sensitivity to hydrogen-containing compounds such as water. This research focused on using imaging techniques to develop methods for testing and evaluating the water management system of a fuel cell. A real-time radiography dataset consisting of 1000 images at 2-s intervals was used to create a movie which showed water production, transport, and removal throughout the cell. This dataset was also analyzed to quantify and calculate the amount of water present in the cell at any time and masking techniques were used to differentiate between water in the cell flow channels and in the gas diffusion layer. Additionally, a tomography dataset allowed for the creation of a digital 3-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of the dry cell which can be analyzed for structural defects. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

NLDAS consists of (1) four land models executing in parallel in uncoupled mode, (2) common hourly surface forcing, and (3) common streamflow routing: all using a 1/8° grid over the continental United States. The initiative is largely sponsored by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP). As the overview for nine NLDAS papers, this paper describes and evaluates the 3-year NLDAS execution of 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1999, a period rich in observations for validation. The validation emphasizes (1) the land states, fluxes, and input forcing of four land models, (2) the application of new GCIP-sponsored products, and (3) a multiscale approach. The validation includes (1) mesoscale observing networks of land surface forcing, fluxes, and states, (2) regional snowpack measurements, (3) daily streamflow measurements, and (4) satellite-based retrievals of snow cover, land surface skin temperature (LST), and surface insolation. The results show substantial intermodel differences in surface evaporation and runoff (especially over nonsparse vegetation), soil moisture storage, snowpack, and LST. Owing to surprisingly large intermodel differences in aerodynamic conductance, intermodel differences in midday summer LST were unlike those expected from the intermodel differences in Bowen ratio. Last, anticipating future assimilation of LST, an NLDAS effort unique to this overview paper assesses geostationary-satellite-derived LST, determines the latter to be of good quality, and applies the latter to validate modeled LST.

A large-area basin scale (LABs) land surface model is driven using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 15-yr Re-Analyses (1979-93) dataset. It is found that the fluctuations of the soil temperature anomalies at different soil depths, in certain geographic regions, are correlated with the ENSO signal. In other words, the temperature anomaly can penetrate into the deeper soil layers due to the long wavelength associated with the ENSO signal. Using a simplified theoretical method, it is shown that the propagation of the ENSO-related long-wavelength temperature anomaly from the land surface to deep soil needs several months. In addition, it is found that the variation of the anomaly of the terrestrial enthalpy, consisting of the soil water enthalpy and soil particle enthalpy, in the shallow soil zone is dominated by the variation of the soil water storage, while that in the deep soil zone is determined by the variation of the soil temperature. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Computer simulation; Earth atmosphere; Enthalpy; Signal processing; Soils; Weather forecasting; Soil water storage; Terrestrial enthalpy; Climatology; climate effect; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; energy flux; land surface; soil temperature; temperature anomaly; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342464904

A concise model interaction potential was constructed on the basis of ab initio potential surface points for the dimer and on comparison with ab initio results for the trimer and tetramer. The model was used to investigate key features of cluster growth, starting with the aggregation energies for clusters with up to 10 molecules. Fully anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies were evaluated for these clusters and were found to be a sizable fraction of the well depth for small clusters. Calculations on larger clusters were used to follow the approach to regular structures in large aggregations, the energetics of cluster growth, and the internal rotation potential for hydrogen molecules embedded in a large cluster.

While the performance of these batteries is mainly depended upon the electrochemical aspects and contact electrical resistance of the cell stack, issues relating to contact thermal resistance between various layers of the cell stack could become more relevant under high rate of charge/discharge and extreme temperature operating conditions. An experimental program was carried out to establish the contact thermal resistance of a typical cell stack comprising graphite-coated copper anode, lithium cobalt oxide-coated aluminum cathode, polyethylene/polypropylene separator and electrolyte under various contact pressures and temperatures. The cell stack was not electrically charged or discharged during present experiments. Tests were conducted over a range of temperatures from -20 to 50°C and pressures from 0 to 250psi (1.72MPa). The results show that, in general, resistance increases with decreasing pressure and the effect is significant when the pressure is reduced below 100psi. Damage to the separator due to hot spots was observed at interface temperatures greater than 80°C. Present results indicate that extreme operating temperatures may affect the performance of Li-ion batteries. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Initiation of qE involves protonation of violaxanthin deepoxidase and PsbS, a component of the photosystem II antenna complex, as a result of lumen acidification driven by photosynthetic electron transfer. It has become clear that the response of qE to linear electron flow, termed ""qE sensitivity,"" must be modulated in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Previously, three mechanisms have been proposed to account for qE modulation: (i) the sensitivity of qE to the lumen pH is altered; (ii) elevated cyclic electron flow around photosystem I increases proton translocation into the lumen; and (iii) lowering the conductivity of the thylakoid ATP synthase to protons (qH+) allows formation of a larger steady-state proton motive force (pmf). Kinetic analysis of the electrochromic shift of intrinsic thylakoid pigments, a linear indicator of transthylakoid electric field component, suggests that, when CO2 alone was lowered from 350 ppm to 50 ppm CO2, modulation of qE sensitivity could be explained solely by changes in conductivity. Lowering both CO 2 (to 50 ppm) and O2 (to 1%) resulted in an additional increase in qE sensitivity that could not be explained by changes in conductivity or cyclic electron flow associated with photosystem I. Evidence is presented for a fourth mechanism, in which changes in qE sensitivity result from variable partitioning of proton motive force into the electric field and pH gradient components. The implications of this mechanism for the storage of proton motive force and the regulation of the light reactions are discussed.",,"carbon dioxide; oxygen; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; violaxanthin; acidification; article; conductance; electric field; electron transport; energy; environmental factor; higher plant; kinetics; light; pH; photosynthesis; priority journal; proton motive force; proton transport; thylakoid; Chloroplast Proton-Translocating ATPases; Down-Regulation; Electron Transport; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Light; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plant Leaves; Plant Physiology; Proton-Motive Force; Spectrophotometry; Tobacco; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842681955

The rheological and dynamic mechanical behaviors of these long-chain branched PE samples were evaluated. Increasing the LCBF significantly increased the ηo)′s and enhanced shear thinning. Long-chain branching (LCB) also influenced the loss modulus and storage modulus. Increasing the LCBF led to enhanced G′ and G″ values at low shear rates and broader relaxation spectrums. The samples exhibited thermorheologically complex behavior. LCB also played a significant role in the dynamic mechanical behavior. Increasing the LCBF increased the stiffness of the polymer and enhanced the clamping or energy dissipation. However, LCB had little influence on the crystalline structure of the PE.

Glycogen synthase, which is essential for synthesizing this glucose polymer, is regulated by both covalent phosphorylation and the concentration of glucose-6-P. With the yeast glycogen synthase Gsy2p, we recently identified two mutants, R579A/R581A/R582A and R586A/R588A/R591A, in which multiple arginine residues were mutated to alanine that were completely insensitive to activation by glucose-6-P in vitro (Pederson, B. A., Cheng, C., Wilson, W. A., and Roach, P. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 27753-27761). We report here the expression of these mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, as expected from our findings in vitro, they were not activated by glucose-6-P. The R579A/R581A/R582A mutant, which is also resistant to inhibition by phosphorylation, caused hyperaccumulation of glycogen. In contrast, the mutant R586A/R588A/R591A, which retains the ability to be inactivated by phosphorylation, resulted in lower glycogen accumulation when compared with wild-type cells. When intracellular glucose-6-P levels were increased by mutating the PFK2 gene, glycogen storage due to the wild-type enzyme was increased, whereas that associated with R579A/R581A/R582A was not greatly changed. This is the first direct demonstration that activation of glycogen synthase by glucose-6-P in vivo is necessary for normal glycogen accumulation.",,"Cells; Enzymes; Glucose; Microorganisms; Mutagenesis; Yeast; Mutants; Phosphorylation; Biochemistry; alanine; arginine; glucose; glucose 6 phosphate; glucose polymer; glycogen; glycogen synthase; glycogen synthase Gsy2p; unclassified drug; article; controlled study; energy resource; enzyme activation; enzyme inactivation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme regulation; enzyme specificity; fungal gene; gene mutation; glucose utilization; nonhuman; PFK2 gene; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Glucose-6-Phosphate; Glycogen; Glycogen Synthase; Mutagenesis; Phosphorylation; Plasmids; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842640108

The CLA is not a single chemical entity, but a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of octadecadienoic fatty acids (C18:2). The cis (c)-9, trans (t)-11 CLA is the naturally occurring isomer found in ruminant food products, also known as rumenic acid. An additional t-10, c-12 CLA isomer is also biologically active and is found in synthetic mixed-isomer sources. Central to the investigation and elucidation of an explanatory mechanism for CLA's biological action is the growing realization that all lipids, including fatty acids (FA), are more than just energy generation substrates and storage molecules. The CLA with their direct participation, 1) constituatively alongside the metabolism of other lipids, 2) via lipid enzyme competitive inhibition activity, or 3) through unique and specific processes, seem to have more than enough potential avenues to elicit their reputed health benefits. If the possibility of derivative products is included, the task for clarifying these processes becomes very complex. Specific effects of CLA on lipoprotein lipase and FA desaturase enzymes have been shown. Also, altering arachidonic acid content of phospholipids appears to be an important consequence of CLA exposure. It is well established that arachidonic acid is a central biochemical branching point for many further eicosanoid products that are known players in the cellular inflammation process. Because atherosclerosis and many cancers are now recognized as having a chronic inflammatory component, CLA's beneficial effects can partially work through this mechanism. In addition, FA including CLA show evidence of altering gene expression by interaction with nuclear receptors in some model systems, thus affecting production of proteins and their enzymatic products. Conjugated linoleic acids can elicit some of their benefits via these mechanisms by altered cholesterol transport, modulation of cellular proliferation, or induced apoptosis in specific tissues. Many of these types of investigations are still in the early stages, with species and tissue heterogeneity yet to be explored. © 2004 American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists","Anti-Carcinogen; Conjugated; Inflammation; Linoleic; Vaccenic",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008157877

Methods: Motor performance and endurance items were developed based on literature review, clinician feedback, feasibility, and equipment and training needs. A standardized testing protocol and scoring rules were created. The MPS-PPM includes: Arm Function (7 items), Leg Function (5 items), and Endurance (2 items). Pilot data were collected for 10 subjects (ages 5-29 years). We calculated Spearman's rho correlations between age, severity and summary z-scores on the MPS-PPM. Results: Subjects had variable presentations, as correlations among the three sub-test scores were not significant. Increasing age was related to greater severity in physical performance (r=0.72, p<0.05) and lower scores on the Leg Function (r=-0.67, p<0.05) and Endurance (r=-0.65, p<0.05) sub-tests. The MPS-PPM was sensitive to detecting physical performance deficits, as six subjects could not complete the full battery of Arm Function items and eight subjects were unable to complete all Leg Function items. Subjects walked more slowly and expended more energy than typically developing peers. Conclusions: Individuals with MPS I have difficulty with arm and leg function and reduced endurance. The MPS-PPM is a clinically feasible measure that detects limitations in physical performance and may have potential to quantify changes in function following intervention.","Children; Mucopolysaccharidosis I; Physical activity; Testing; Youth","glycosaminoglycan; laronidase; levo iduronidase; recombinant enzyme; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; arm movement; child; clinical article; disease severity; endurance; enzyme deficiency; exercise test; female; functional assessment; genetic disorder; human; Hurler syndrome; leg movement; lysosome storage disease; male; motor performance; mucopolysaccharidosis; physical activity; physiotherapist; priority journal; rating scale; review; scoring system; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Male; Mucopolysaccharidosis I; Pilot Projects; Task Performance and Analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342662626

In contrast to existing methods where manual initialization is required to track individual cells, the proposed approach can automatically identify and track multiple cells by exploiting the shape and intensity characteristics of the cells. The capture of the cell boundary is considered as an evolution of a closed curve that maximizes image gradient along the curve enclosing a homogeneous region. An energy functional dependent upon the gradient magnitude along the cell boundary, the region homogeneity within the cell boundary and the spatial overlap of the detected cells is minimized using a variational approach. For tracking between frames, this energy functional is modified considering the spatial and shape consistency of a cell as it moves in the video sequence. The integrated energy functional complements shape-based segmentation with a spatial consistency based tracking technique. We demonstrate that an acceptable, expedient solution of the energy functional is possible through a search of the image-level lines: boundaries of connected components within the level sets obtained by threshold decomposition. The level set analysis can also capture multiple cells in a single frame rather than iteratively computing a single active contour for each individual cell. Results of cell detection using the energy functional approach and the level set approach are presented along with the associated processing time. Results of successful tracking of rolling leukocytes from a number of digital video sequences are reported and compared with the results from a correlation tracking scheme.","Cell detection; Level set; Tracking","Hough transforms; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Tracking (position); Cell detection; Leukocyte detection; Level set analysis; Shape consistency; Edge detection; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; cell motion; cell size; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; cytology; evaluation; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; leukocyte; methodology; microscopy; physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; validation study; Algorithms; Cell Movement; Cell Size; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Leukocytes; Microscopy, Video; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942532718

In this paper, we propose a data-driven strategy to optimize the memory energy consumption in a banked memory system. Our compiler-based strategy modifies the original execution order of loop iterations in array-dominated applications to increase the length of the time period(s) in which memory banks are idle (i.e., not accessed by any loop iteration). To achieve this, it first classifies loop iterations according to their bank accesses patterns and then, with the help of a polyhedral tool, tries to bring the iterations with similar bank access patterns close together. Increasing the idle periods of memory banks brings two major benefits: first, it allows us to place more memory banks into low-power operating modes and, second, it enables us to use a more aggressive (i.e., more energy saving) operating mode (hence, saving more energy) for a given bank (instead of a less aggressive mode). The proposed strategy can reduce memory energy consumption in both sequential and parallel applications. Our strategy has been implemented in an experimental compiler using a polyhedral tool and evaluated using nine array dominated applications on both a cacheless system and a system with cache memory. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy is very successful in reducing the memory system energy and improves the memory energy by as much as 36.8 percent over a strategy that uses low-power modes without optimizing data access pattern. Our results also show that optimizations that target reducing off-chip memory energy can generate very different results from those that target at improving only cache locality.","Access pattern; Banked memories; Compiler optimization; Embedded systems; Energy consumption","Computer simulation; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Graph theory; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Parallel processing systems; Access pattern; Banked memories; Compiler optimization; Buffer storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942532286

Organisms are forced to make trade-offs when allocating energy reserves during sustained periods of fasting. 2. For most animals, lipid catabolism is the preferred source of energy to safeguard important protein sources. However, marine mammals also have a compounding pressure to conserve some lipid stores. The main site of lipid storage in these animals is the blubber layer, which is not only an important energy source during fasting, but is also the primary thermal barrier when at sea. 3. To explain how the allocation of protein and lipid reserves during fasting are influenced by body condition (body mass and percentage lipid of total body mass), a dynamic state variable model that takes into account fitness consequences of different allocation strategies was developed. 4. This model was parameterized with respect to conditions faced by weaned Northern Elephant Seal (Mirounga angustirostris Gill) pups. It incorporates the independent effects of body mass and protein mass (the two state variables) on survival and the costs of utilizing either lipid or protein during the postweaning fast. 5. Predictions of lipid and protein allocation by the model were not significantly different from measurements on wild seals. Finally, the model showed that body lipid content and fasting duration both influence allocation of energy reserves.","Dynamic state variable model; Fasting metabolism; Individual variation; Lipid catabolism; Protein catabolism","bioenergetics; body condition; fasting; lipid; pinniped; resource allocation; trade-off; Animalia; elephant; Mammalia; Mirounga; Mirounga angustirostris; Phocidae; Pinnipedia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942518903

This transporter shows significant sequence homology to Drosophila Indy and the mammalian Na +-coupled citrate transporter NaCT (now known as NaC2). When heterologously expressed in a mammalian cell line or in Xenopus oocytes, the cloned ceNAC-2 mediates the Na+-coupled transport of various intermediates of the citric acid cycle. However, it transports the tricarboxylate citrate more efficiently than dicarboxylates such as succinate, a feature different from that of ceNAC-1 (formerly known as ceNaDC1) and ceNAC-3 (formerly known as ceNaDC2). The transport process is electrogenic, as evidenced from the substrate-induced inward currents in oocytes expressing the transporter under voltage-clamp conditions. Expression studies using a reporter-gene fusion method in transgenic C. elegans show that the gene is expressed in the intestinal tract, the organ responsible for not only the digestion and absorption of nutrients but also for the storage of energy in this organism. Functional knockdown of the transporter by RNAi (RNA interference) not only leads to a significant increase in life span, but also causes a significant decrease in body size and fat content. The substrates of ceNAC-2 play a critical role in metabolic energy production and in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The present studies suggest that the knockdown of these metabolic functions by RNAi is linked to an extension of life span and a decrease in fat content and body size.","Body size; Caenorhabditis elegans; Fat synthesis; Life span; RNA interference (RNAi); Sodium-coupled citrate transporter","Absorption; Acids; Biosynthesis; Cholesterol; Cloning; Digestive system; Fatty acids; Genes; Nutrition; RNA; Electrogenics; Homology; Voltage clamp; Biochemistry; cholesterol; citric acid; dicarboxylic acid; fatty acid; sodium; succinic acid; tricarboxylic acid; absorption; article; biosynthesis; body size; Caenorhabditis elegans; cell line; citric acid cycle; cloning; digestion; Drosophila; energy resource; fat content; gene expression; gene fusion; human; human cell; intestine; lifespan; mammal; metabolism; nonhuman; nutrient; oocyte; priority journal; protein expression; protein transport; reporter gene; RNA interference; sequence homology; statistical significance; voltage clamp; Xenopus; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Biological Transport; Body Composition; Body Constitution; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Cell Line; Citric Acid; Citric Acid Cycle; Cloning, Molecular; Genes, Helminth; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Intestines; Longevity; Molecular Sequence Data; Oocytes; Organ Specificity; Organic Anion Transporters; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Pigment Epithelium of Eye; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; RNA Interference; Sodium; Xenopus laevis; Caenorhabditis; Caenorhabditis elegans; Invertebrata; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842844288

Results show low removal efficiency of total Cr (2-7%) because the insoluble form of chromite dominates in the Cr-soil. However, more than 95% of leachable Cr(VI) can be removed by controlling the pH of the processing fluid at 9.0 during experiments. The removal of Cr from Cr-soil was characterized by the high Cr(VI) concentration collected at the anode, and the presence of Cr precipitates collected at cathode. The electric energy requirement under all experimental conditions varied from 1.3 to 5.8 kW h/m3.

The 2Por-TAZ molecule contains two porphyrin macrocycles attached to a triaminotriazine headgroup. Triaminotriazines are known to form a highly ordered linear supramolecular self-assembly through complementary hydrogen bonding with barbituric acid molecules at the air-water interface. Surface pressure-area isotherm measurements and polarized UV-vis absorption spectroscopic studies indicate that the 2Por-TAZ molecules adopted an edge-on orientation at the air-water interface. Polarized UV-vis absorption study also revealed that the 2Por-TAZ molecules formed linear supramolecular networks on pure water and barbituric acid subphase with porphyrin flat planes facing toward the compression direction. The binding of barbituric acid with 2Por-TAZ molecules was observed from the expansion of the Langmuir monolayer film.

Mesoscale modelling studies have shown that modification in land use affects near-surface soil moisture storage and energy balance. Such a study in the Great Plains showed that changes in land use from natural grass to irrigated agriculture enhanced soil water storage in the root zone and increased latent energy flux. This increase in latent energy flux would correspond to a decrease in sensible heat flux and, therefore, modify near-surface temperature records. To verify this deduction, we have investigated the changes in the historical near-surface temperature records in Nebraska, USA. We have analysed the long-term mean monthly maximum, minimum, and monthly mean air temperature data from five irrigated and five non-irrigated sites. The cooperative weather observation (coop) network is the source of the data. We have found that there is a clear trend in decreasing mean maximum and average temperature data for irrigated sites. For example, York, NE, reports that the mean maximum growing season temperature is decreasing at the rate -0.01 °C year-1. The results from non-irrigated sites indicated an increasing trend for the same parameters. The data from Halsey. NE, indicate a +0.01 °C year-1 increase in this century. In addition, we have conducted similar analyses of temperature data for the National Climatic Data Center's Historical Climatic Network data set for the same locations. The results are similar to that obtained with the coop data set. Further investigation of dew-point temperature records for irrigated and non-irrigated sites also show an increasing and decreasing trend respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the land-use change in the Great Plains has modified near-surface temperature records. © 2004 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Land-use change; Temperature modification; The Great Plains","Climate change; Data acquisition; Heat flux; Land use; Magnetic flux; Mathematical models; Moisture; Soils; Weather modification; Energy balance; Mesoscale modelling; Climatology; climate change; energy balance; land use change; modeling; surface temperature; Great Plains; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842854520

Spatial displacements of the warm water pools are observed on annual and interannual time scales, the latter most notably in the Pacific in association with ENSO. Whether such variations are also associated with net changes in pool energy content is investigated. Extending the work of Niiler and Stevenson and Walin who considered the time mean energy budgets for volumes bounded by an isotherm, the time-dependent version of their equation is analyzed in which the main terms involve the time variations of pool volume and average temperature, net energy exchange between the pool and overlying atmosphere, and the turbulent ocean fluxes across the pool boundaries. The dominant signal in the mean seasonal energy budgets of the warm pools is an approximate balance between the annual variation of air pool heat exchange and the time-varying energy storage; the inferred turbulent ocean heat flux per unit area across the bounding surface of the warm pools is relatively steady through the year. Interannual variations of the warm pools are characterized by changes in pool volumes and temperature on ENSO and longer time scales with indications of an out-of-phase relationship between pool pseudo-energy content and the Southern Oscillation index. The ability to diagnose the varying turbulent ocean fluxes exiting the warm water pools on these time scales was impeded by incompatibilities between ocean temperature data and several air-sea flux climatologies. For the unscaled Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) flux product that yields sensibly downgradient ocean heat flux estimates, strong positive correlation between air pool heat flux and inferred turbulent ocean flux at the pool base on an interannual time scale is found. But, given the uncertainties in the air-sea fluxes, it is difficult to firmly attribute these bottom flux changes to variations in ocean mixing processes. Though disappointing in the short term, it is suggested that time-dependent warm pool energy budget analyses constitute powerful diagnostics for validating future air-sea flux climatologies. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climatology; Estimation; Geothermal springs; Heat flux; Isotherms; Mixing; Oscillations; Thermal effects; Turbulent flow; Climate systems; Coupled ocean-atmosphere data set (COADS); Water; air-sea interaction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; energy budget; heat flux; warm pool; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342292108

Recent progress in the production and cooling of intense beams of fully stripped Au and U in the SIS/ESR synchrotron storage ring at GSI, Darmstadt has made it possible to obtain precision spectroscopy of these ions. A fully stripped beam of either Au79+ or U92+ ions is injected, stored and cooled in the ESR and interacts with an internal gas target. The capture of an electron and the subsequent population of a 2p or 3p state will lead to a decay by either Lyman or Balmer X-ray emission. Although measurements of the 1s Lamb shift in U with Ge ionization detectors accurate to ∼3% have provided a test of QED for the high Z domain, the experimental errors (±13eV) are about one order of magnitude larger than the accuracy theoreticians presently claim (±1eV). We present the results from initial broad band experiments using NTD Ge microcalorimeters to measure the 2s Lamb Shift in Au and U at the ESR. The broad band coverage of the microcalorimeter makes it possible to reduce the systematic uncertainties in the Doppler corrections while the high-energy resolution reduces the statistical error in the absolute energy calibration. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The lack of a serious challenge from other battery types has allowed lead-acid products to serve this market exclusively, with minimal demand for product improvement through research and development, and a sharp competition has, over time, cut sales prices to commodity levels. The electrochemical storage of energy in automobiles now faces the possibility of a major change, in the form of the proposed 36/42V electrical systems for vehicles that remain primarily powered by internal combustion engines, and of the hybrid electric vehicle. The duty cycle for these two applications sees the battery held at a partial-state-of-charge (PSoC) for most of its life and required to supply, and to accept, charge at unprecedented rates. The remarkable advances achieved with VRLA battery technology for electric vehicles during the past 8-10 years will be of only passing value in overcoming the challenges posed by high rate PSoC service in 36/42V and HEV duty. This is because the failure modes seen in PSoC are quite different from those faced in EV (deep cycle) use. The replacement of the 12V SLI will not take place rapidly. However, if the applications which take its place are to be satisfied by a lead-acid product (probably VRLA), rather than by a battery of a different chemistry, a program of development as successful as that mounted for deep cycle duty will be required. The present phase of the Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Consortium (ALABC) R&D program has begun to shed light on those aspects of the function of a VRLA battery which currently limit its life in high rate PSoC duty. The program is also pursuing the several technologies which show promise of overcoming those limits, including multiple tab plate design, mass transport facilitation and minor component (both beneficial and detrimental impurity) management. This paper presents a brief review of the changes which are taking place in lead-acid battery technology in response to the challenges of the new duty cycle. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The isomerism arises from different arrangements of small-molecule guests in the space of a self-assembled, cylindrical host. The cylindrical host detains three molecules each of CHCl3, 1,2-dichloroethane, or isopropyl chloride. The exchange of guests in and out of the host is slow on the NMR time scale. The dimensions of the capsular host and the sizes of the guests hinder the mobility of molecules inside, and separate NMR signals are seen for guests at the ends of the capsule and those near its center. When two different guests are encapsulated, the spectra show up to four additional species: two sets of constellational isomers. In every pairwise combination of the three guests, all isomers could be identified. The equilibrium distributions of isomers depended on the concentrations of the guests in the bulk solution. The relative stability of the constellational isomers was a function of the polarity of the guest molecule and its ability to interact with the components of the capsule.

Many proponents of sustainable energy anticipate that electric generation from renewable sources would thrive in a deregulated market, driven by consumer demand for ""green"" energy and the end of incentives to build large central power plants under the cost-plus profits guaranteed by state utility commissions. This paper examines the flaws in this expectation. After reviewing the highly cyclical nature of U.S. energy policy making in recent decades, the study links the ineffectiveness of policy with the institutional setting. Under electric utility market restructuring, renewable energy generation (wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, and small-scale hydro) must overcome barriers such as price distortions, lack of storage capability, discriminatory transmission system access, and the end of linked utility rate hikes guaranteed to cover the additional expense of renewable generation. In the absence of strong federal leadership, the state commitment to renewable energy has been uneven under utility restructuring. Moreover, nuclear power - the other leading alternative to fossil fuel use - is beset by serious problems. Only renewable energy options offer long-term hope for sustainability. Along these lines, green marketing, renewable portfolio standards, system benefit charges, carbon taxes, public power, ""Community Choice,"" and production credits - all based on recent U.S. and European experience - are critically examined and recommendations made for changing course. At present, during this highly fluid period of utility restructuring, and absent more forceful regulation and demand management, it is dubious whether U.S. electricity market reform can encourage sufficient conversion to renewable energy to stem a rising tide of greenhouse gas emissions. © 2004 by Association of American Geographers.","Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions; Electric utility; Energy policy; Renewable energy; Wind power","electricity generation; energy policy; renewable resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25144506880

This numerical study focuses on the thermal management issues that arise when electronic components experience sudden surges in power dissipation. The transient response of the energy storage system to short pulses in power dissipation is studied. Convective cooling using air-cooled heat sinks on the sides of the containment remote from the heat sources provides for the heat rejection to ambient air. The analysis is performed under different pulse frequencies. Different aspect ratios for the containment volume as well as different locations for the heat sources are studied in order to identify an optimal arrangement. Conduction and convection in the phase change material as well as conduction through the containment walls are considered in the computations. The constitutive equations are implicitly solved using a fully transient method on fixed orthogonal co-located finite volumes.

A key component of this system is the hypothalamus. Over the past two decades, major advances have been made in identifying an increasing number of peptides within the hypothalamus that contribute to the process of energy homeostasis. Under stable conditions, equilibrium exists between anabolic peptides that stimulate feeding behavior, as well as decrease energy expenditure and lipid utilization in favor of fat storage, and catabolic peptides that attenuate food intake, while stimulating sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and restricting fat deposition by increasing lipid metabolism. The equilibrium between these neuropeptides is dynamic in nature. It shifts across the day-night cycle and from day to day and also in response to dietary challenges as well as peripheral energy stores. These shifts occur in close relation to circulating levels of the hormones, leptin, insulin, ghrelin and corticosterone, and also the nutrients, glucose and lipids. These circulating factors together with neural processes are primary signals relaying information regarding the availability of fuels needed for current cellular demand, in addition to the level of stored fuels needed for long-term use. Together, these signals have profound impact on the expression and production of neuropeptides that, in turn, initiate the appropriate anabolic or catabolic responses for restoring equilibrium. In this review, we summarize the evidence obtained on nine peptides in the hypothalamus that have emerged as key players in this process. Data from behavioral, physiological, pharmacological and genetic studies are described and consolidated in an attempt to formulate a clear statement on the underlying function of each of these peptides and also on how they work together to create and maintain energy homeostasis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

These simulation tools are of great assistance to engineers and researchers to reduce product-development cycle time, improve the quality of the design, and simplify the analysis without costly and time-consuming experiments. In this paper, a modeling tool that has been developed to study automotive systems using the power electronics simulator (PSIM) software is presented. PSIM was originally made for simulating power electronic converters and motor drives. This user-friendly simulation package is able to simulate electric/electronic circuits; however, it has no capability for simulating the entire system of an automobile. This paper discusses the PSIM validity as an automotive simulation tool by creating module boxes for not only the electrical systems, but also the mechanical, energy-storage, and thermal systems of the vehicles. These modules include internal combustion engines, fuel converters, transmissions, torque couplers, and batteries. Once these modules are made and stored in the library, the user can make the car model either a conventional, an electric, or a hybrid vehicle at will, just by dragging and dropping onto a schematic blank page.","Electric drives; Electric propulsion; Electric vehicles; Hybrid electric vehicles; Power electronic converters; Vehicle simulation","Compressors; Computer aided software engineering; Electric batteries; Electric drives; Electric propulsion; Energy storage; Internal combustion engines; Power converters; Power electronics; Simulation; Steering; Vehicle suspensions; Automotive power systems; Hybrid electric vehicles; Power electronic converters; Power electronic simulator; Vehicle simulation; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942485956

Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, United States","This review considers how a honey bee colony optimally controls the timing and type of new comb construction. Optimal timing requires bees to balance the energy costs of construction with the opportunity costs of lacking storage space during nectar flows. They do so by conditioning the start of building on (1) the attainment of a fullness threshold, and (2) the availability of nectar. A dynamic optimization model has suggested that this rule is slightly suboptimal, but may compensate for this by its simplicity and generality. The emergence of this collective strategy from the decisions of individual bees is poorly understood, but recent experiments have cast doubt on the long-standing idea that building is triggered by increased distension of the crops of nest bees. Bees also regulate the relative amounts of drone and worker comb in their nests, with important consequences for their sex investment strategy. Regulation depends on the inhibitory effect of drone comb on further drone comb construction, mediated through a decentralized process requiring that workers have direct contact with the comb. Contact by the queen is not required, nor is the presence of drone brood, although the latter may enhance the strength of inhibition.","Comb; Decentralized control; Drone; Honey bee; Life history; Self-organization","honeybee; inhibition; life history; self organization; Apidae; Apinae; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Hymenoptera",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842767082

Growth rates of early juveniles (initial size 36-50 mm total length, LT) were manipulated using two temperatures (10 and 20°C) and two rations (ad libitum and 3-4% body mass day-1). Fish LT, mass and lipid content were measured every 3 weeks for 15 weeks. Irrespective of treatment, the relationship of total lipid content with body size was clearly hyperallometric; small juveniles allocated relatively more energy to growth and less to lipid storage than large juveniles. After adjusting for the influence of body size, temperature and ration significantly influenced body composition but these effects varied over the course of the experiment. In the first 3 week time period, fish on the high ration, high temperature treatment had reduced lipid storage relative to other treatments, but in all subsequent time periods their lipid concentrations were similar to or higher than those of fish on other treatments. In contrast, fish held at low rations and low temperatures initially had average levels of lipid concentration, but after 6 weeks their levels were lower than other treatments. Estimation of allocation to lipid storage over time (proportion of dry mass increase comprised of lipid) suggested that fish in all of the treatments were approaching an asymptotic level of lipid concentration (c. 50-60% of dry mass) but with different rates of lipid increase. Within a treatment, it was predicted that individual differences in allocation would result in trade-offs between somatic growth and storage. This trade-off was evident only for fish held on low rations at low temperatures. In contrast, fish held on high rations at high temperatures exhibited the opposite pattern of a positive correlation between somatic growth and storage. These results suggest that lipostatic regulation of appetite is unlikely in juvenile sablefish. When resources are unlimited, this species appears to adopt a maximizing strategy for both somatic growth and lipid accumulation. © 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Bioenergetics; Growth; Lipid storage; Trade-offs","body size; fish; growth rate; lipid; resource allocation; trade-off; Anoplopoma fimbria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642274763

We observed a much more extensive generalized stress response known as the environmental stress response (ESR), than observed previously in biotin-streptavidin-isolated cells, perhaps because the elutriated cells were further advanced in their life span.

Changes in the transverse relaxation time constant (T2) were related to water mobility. Mono-exponential analysis of relaxation curves showed that, in general, gluten retarded starch retrogradation. T2 values in gluten gels also decreased during storage, but to a much lesser extent. Distributed exponential analysis showed that two distinct regions of T2 were observed in all samples. During aging, the peak values of both regions shifted to lower values for all gels. Starch gel samples showed the most significant shift, and gluten gels showed the least. The three levels of gluten addition in starch/gluten gels produced similar shifts. For all samples the signal intensity of the less mobile region decreased more dramatically than that of the more mobile region during storage.

The influence on volatility of what many regard as a key element of the information set influencing the natural gas market is investigated. Specifically, we examine the impact on natural gas futures price volatility of the Weekly American Gas Storage Survey report compiled and issued by the American Gas Association during the period January 1, 1999 through May 3, 2002 and the subsequent weekly report compiled and issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration after May 6, 2002. We find that the weekly gas storage report announcement was responsible for considerable volatility at the time of its release and that volatility up to 30 minutes following the announcement was also higher than normal. Aside from these results, we document pronounced price volatility in this market both at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day and offer explanations for such behavior. Our results are robust to the manner in which the mean percentage change in the futures price is estimated and to correlation of these changes both within the day and across days. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842281910

Mechanical engineering majors enroll in Energy Conversion Systems (ME 472) during the fall semester of their senior year as an advanced elective. ME 472 builds directly on the material covered in Thermodynamics (EM 301) taken during the student's junior year. In the first segment of ME 472, the students study advanced thermodynamic topics including exergy and combustion analyses. The students then analyze various mechanical systems including refrigeration systems, internal combustion engines, boilers, and fossil fuel fired steam and gas turbine combined power plants. Exergetic efficiencies of various equipment and systems are determined. The final portion of the course covers direct energy conversion technology, including fuel cells, photovoltaics, thermoelectricity, thermionics and magnetohydrodynamics. Supplemental lessons on energy storage, semi-conductors and nonreactive energy sources (such as solar collectors, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants) are included here. This paper discusses the evolution of ME 472 since its inception and explains the motivations for the course's progress. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The reported results are for the C15 Laves-phase structure. The measured moduli display a normal temperature dependence, approaching 0K with zero slope and decreasing linearly with increasing temperature at the higher temperatures. The Debye temperature, calculated from the measured moduli, was found to be 500K. This material can absorb considerable amounts of hydrogen, but is unstable at ambient temperatures. The TiCr1.8-H2 system has a relatively low critical temperature, Tc, which has previously enabled thermodynamic measurements to be made above Tc. An elastic energy contribution to the enthalpy of formation has been calculated from the present measurements and compared to the thermodynamic results. The comparison suggests that the electronic contribution to the enthalpy of formation is comparable in magnitude to the elastic contribution, but opposite in sign. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The sol-gel transition of alcoholic alumatrane solutions was monitored by multiple waveform rheological measurements. The gel time could be determined from the evolution of the storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli versus time at different frequencies using the Winter Chambon criterion (convergence of the loss tangents at the gel point). Increasing pH values, hydrolysis ratio and/or temperature accelerated the kinetics of hydrolysis-condensation reactions and thus reduced the gel time. The apparent activation energy of the cross-linking leading to the gelation calculated from the gel times at various temperatures was found to be approximately 139kJmol-1 and independent of hydrolysis ratio.

In previous studies, two Musca domestica hexamerins, designated Hex-L and Hex-F were characterized. Hex-L is synthesized exclusively by the larval fat bodies, is secreted into the hemolymph and likely provides a source of amino acids and energy during metamorphosis. Hex-F synthesis is induced by a proteinaceous meal and occurs only in the adult insect fat bodies. Hex-F also is secreted into the hemolymph and it has been suggested that in females it may be an amino acid reservoir to be used during the final stages of egg formation. Genomic clones containing full-length copies of the genes MdHexL1 and MdHexF1, encoding subunits of the larval and the adult female hexamerin, respectively, were isolated. Complete nucleotide sequences, including the 5′-end untranscribed regions, were determined and analyzed for each of the genes. Comparisons of the conceptual translation products of the cloned genes indicated that MdHexL1 and MdHexF1 are related to the larval serum proteins (LSP) 1 and 2 of Calliphora vicina and Drosophila melanogaster. DNA fragments containing the putative promoters of the two hexamerin genes were compared and cloned into a plasmid vector so as to drive the expression of the GFP reporter gene.

In particular, solubility data are critical for the optimization of storage conditions and for the selection of compounds for bioscreening compatible with the assay protocol. Solubility is largely determined by the solvation energy and the crystal disruption energy, and these molecular phenomena should be assessed in structure-solubility correlation studies. The authors summarize our long-term experimental observations and theoretical studies of physicochemical determinants of DMSO solubility of organic substances. They compiled a comprehensive reference database of proprietary data on compound solubility (55,277 compounds with good DMSO solubility and 10,223 compounds with poor DMSO solubility), calculated specific molecular descriptors (topological, electromagnetic, charge, and lipophilicity parameters), and applied an advanced machine-learning approach for training neural networks to address the solubility.

The purpose of this review is to demonstrate that highly unsaturated fatty acids regulate lipid metabolism by modulating protein expression at many levels including gene transcription, messenger RNA processing, mRNA decay, and post-translational protein modifications. Although the intracellular signaling mechanisms employed by highly unsaturated fatty acids are unknown, this review presents a summary of the emerging knowledge regarding highly unsaturated fatty acids as kinase cascade activators. Recent findings: Highly unsaturated fatty acids suppress lipogenic gene transcription by reducing the DNA binding activity of several transcription factors, notably sterol regulatory-element binding protein 1 and nuclear factor Y. Highly unsaturated fatty acids inhibit the proteolytic release of sterol regulatory-element binding protein 1 from its membrane-anchored precursor through a ceramide-dependent signal, and impart a post-translational modification to nuclear factor Y. Highly unsaturated fatty acids accelerate sterol regulatory-element binding protein 1 mRNA decay and may function as antagonistic ligands for liver receptor X, thereby interfering with the liver receptor X stimulation of sterol regulatory-element binding protein 1 gene transcription. Highly unsaturated fatty acid activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha combined with their displacement of the oxysterol from liver receptor X may 'trap' liver receptor X as transcriptionally inactive peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/liver receptor X heterodimer. The gene expression consequences of liver receptor X 'trapping' may explain how dietary highly unsaturated fatty acids lead to a repartitioning of fatty acids away from storage and towards oxidation. Summary: The liver appears to use the highly unsaturated fatty acid status as a nutrient sensor to determine whether fatty acids are to be stored or oxidized. In this way highly unsaturated fatty acids may function as nutritional factors that reduce the risk of developing hepatic lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","AMP-kinase; Fatty acid synthase; Gene expression; Lipogenesis; Polyunsaturated fats","adenylate kinase; nuclear factor; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; oxysterol; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; polyunsaturated fatty acid; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; unsaturated fatty acid; carbohydrate metabolism; DNA binding; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; insulin resistance; insulin response; ligand binding; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; liver metabolism; nonhuman; nutrient; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein modification; review; RNA processing; sensor; skeletal muscle; triacylglycerol blood level; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Nuclear Proteins; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Transcription Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344701247

The term 'HIV/HAART associated dyslipidemic lipodystrophy (HADL)' describes this syndrome. Although HAART increases patient survival rates, their increased longevity and dyslipidemias place them at risk for cardiovascular disease. Identification of rationally based therapies requires an understanding of the mechanistic basis of HADL. Recent findings: A case definition for HIV lipodystrophy, based on age, gender, duration of HIV disease, serum HDL cholesterol and anthropometry, provides high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The dyslipidemias, mainly hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and low-plasma HDL cholesterol, among HIV-infected patients in the pre- and post-HAART eras are summarized. Clinical studies of HADL patients show increased lipolysis, which increases free fatty acid transfer to liver for incorporation into lipoprotein triglycerides that are secreted, and to skeletal muscle where they impair normal insulin signaling. A model of HADL that includes preferential lipolysis in femoral-gluteal fat depots is presented. Relevant therapies include those that inhibit lipolysis (niacin) or increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation (fibrates). Summary: HADL is one of several disorders characterized by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and lipodystrophy. The relative acuteness of HADL should facilitate identification of the sequence of metabolic changes that gives rise to the syndrome. Current evidence suggests that deranged energy storage in femoral-gluteal and other peripheral sites is important; the molecular details for the derangement are unknown but are under scrutiny by many investigators. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Dyslipidemia; HIV; Insulin resistance; Lipodystrophy; Lipolysis; Protease inhibitors","antiretrovirus agent; fibric acid derivative; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; nicotinic acid; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; dyslipidemia; fatty acid oxidation; highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV associated lipodystrophy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; lipolysis; metabolism; molecular model; pathophysiology; priority journal; review; steatosis; survival; Animals; Antilipemic Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Cardiovascular Diseases; Disease Models, Animal; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Lipodystrophy; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942684780

It is further shown that the electrical behavior predicted by 2-D simulations can be captured in a simple bipolar SPICE model, which is necessary for practical SEU analysis of large numbers of logic and memory cell types.

The impedance of LiNi0.8Co0.2O2/graphite lithium ion cells is observed to experience a substantial rise during accelerated calendar life storage, mainly due to the significant increase of the interfacial resistance on the cathode side. By means of electrochemical measurements and AC impedance spectroscopy, it is found that doping the LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 cathode with small amount of Al, Ti and Mg can effectively suppress this impedance rise. Possible mitigation of oxidizing ability of Ni4+ due to Al, Ti and Mg doping is proposed to achieve this impedance stabilization.","Cathode; Doping; Impedance; Rechargeable batteries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042471456

TEB's performance is evaluated with observations of surface temperatures and surface energy balance fluxes collected during the field experiments to constrain models of atmospheric pollution and transport of emissions (ESCOMPTE)-urban boundary layer (UBL) campaign. Particular attention was directed to the influence of different surface databases, used for input parameters, on model predictions. Comparison of simulated canyon temperatures with observations resulted in improvements to TEB parameterizations by increasing the ventilation. Evaluation of the model with wall, road, and roof surface temperatures gave good results. The model succeeds in simulating a sensible heat flux larger than heat storage, as observed. A sensitivity comparison using generic dense city parameters, derived from the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land cover database, and those from a surface database developed specifically for the Marseille city center shows the importance of correctly documenting the urban surface. Overall, the TEB scheme is shown to be fairly robust, consistent with results from previous studies. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Air pollution; Boundary layers; Database systems; Heat flux; Interfacial energy; Mathematical models; Soils; Weather forecasting; Biosphere; Urban canyons; Climatology; boundary layer; energy balance; street canyon; urban atmosphere; Bouches-du-Rhone; Eurasia; Europe; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842832235

As feature sizes shrink, the dominant component of this power consumption will be leakage. However, during a fixed period of time, the activity in a data cache is only centered on a small subset of the lines. This behavior can be exploited to cut the leakage power of large data caches by putting the cold cache lines into a state preserving, low-power drowsey mode. In this paper, we investigate policies and circuit techniques for implementing drowsy data caches. We show that with simple microarchitectural techniques, about 80%-90% of the data cache lines can be maintained in a drowsy state without affecting performance by more than 0.6%, even though moving lines into and out of a drowsy state incurs a slight performance loss. According to our projections, in a 70-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, drowsy data caches will be able to reduce the total leakage energy consumed in the caches by 60%-75%. In addition, we extend the drowsy cache concept to reduce leakage power of instruction caches without significant impact on execution time. Our results show that data and instruction caches require different control strategies for efficient execution. In order to enable drowsy instruction caches, we propose a technique called cache subbank prediction, which is used to selectively wake up only the necessary parts of the instruction cache, while allowing most of the cache to stay in a low-leakage drowsy mode. This prediction technique reduces the negative performance impact by 78% compared with the no-prediction policy. Our technique works well even with small predictor sizes and enables a 75% reduction of leakage energy in a 32-kB instruction cache.","Dynamic voltage scaling; LI caches; Low power; Subthreshold leakage power","Algorithms; Cache memory; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric power systems; Emitter coupled logic circuits; Leakage currents; MOSFET devices; Static random access storage; Threshold voltage; Transistor transistor logic circuits; Dynamic voltage scaling (DVC); L1 caches; Low power; Subthreshold leakage power; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642310480

The developed microreactor in combination with a micro fuel cell is proposed as an alternative to conventional portable sources of electricity such as batteries due to its ability to provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity as long as a supply of methanol and water can be provided. The microreformer-fuel cell combination has the advantage of not requiring the tedious recharging cycles needed by conventional rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. It also offers significantly higher energy storage densities, which translates into less frequent ""recharging"" through the refilling of methanol fuel. The microreactor consists of a network of catalyst-packed parallel microchannels of depths ranging from 200 to 400 μm with a catalyst particle filter near the outlet fabricated using photolithography and deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) on a silicon substrate. Issues related to microchannel and filter capping, on-chip heating and temperature sensing, introduction and trapping of catalyst particles in the microchannels, flow distribution, microfluidic interfacing, and thermal insulation have been addressed. Experimental runs have demonstrated a methanol to hydrogen molar conversion of at least 85% to 90% at flow rates enough to supply hydrogen to an 8- to 10-W fuel cell.","Fuel cell; Lab-on-a-chip; Micro fuel cells; Microfluidics; Microreactor; Microreformer; System-on-chip","Electric power supplies to apparatus; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Methanol; Microelectronic processing; Photolithography; Reactive ion etching; Semiconducting silicon; Thermal insulation; Micro fuel cell; Microreactors; Silicon chip; Silicon substrate; Microelectromechanical devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542604572

Developing effective strategies to optimize hourly offer curves for a hydrothermal power system to maximize profits has been one of the most challenging and important tasks for a GenCo. This paper presents an integrated bidding and scheduling algorithm with risk management under a deregulated market. A stochastic mixed-integer optimization formulation having a separable structure with respect to individual units is first established. A method combining Lagrangian relaxation and stochastic dynamic programming is then presented to select hourly offer curves for both energy and reserve markets. In view that pumped-storage units provide significant energy and reserve at generating and pumping, the offering strategies are specially highlighted in this paper. Numerical testing based on an 11-unit system with a major pumped-storage unit in the New England market shows that the algorithm is computationally efficient, and effective energy and reserve offer curves are obtained in 4-5 min on a 600-MHz Pentium III PC. The risk management method significantly reduces profit variances and, thus, bidding risks.","Deregulation; Offering/bidding strategies; Pumped-storage unit; Reserve market; Risk management","Algorithms; Computational methods; Deregulation; Dynamic programming; Electric power systems; Industrial economics; Numerical methods; Optimization; Random processes; Risk management; Strategic planning; Offering/bidding strategies; Pumped-storage units; Reserve market; Electric industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442288865

Even though the direction predictor by itself represents less than 1 percent of the processor's total power dissipation, prediction accuracy is nevertheless a powerful lever on processor behavior and program execution time. A thorough study of branch predictor organizations shows that, as a general rule, to reduce overall energy consumption in the processor, it is worthwhile to spend more power in the branch predictor if this results in more accurate predictions that improve running time. This not only improves performance, but can also improve the energy-delay product by up to 20 percent. Three techniques, however, can reduce power dissipation without harming accuracy. Banking reduces the portion of the branch predictor that is active at any one time. A new on-chip structure, the prediction probe detector (PPD), uses predecode bits to entirely eliminate unnecessary predictor and branch target buffer (BTB) accesses. Despite the extra power that must be spent accessing it, the PPD reduces local predictor power and energy dissipation by about 31 percent and overall processor power and energy dissipation by 3 percent. These savings can be further improved by using profiling to annotate branches, identifying those that are highly biased and do not require static prediction. Finally, the paper explores the effectiveness of a previously proposed technique, pipeline gating, and finds that, even with adaptive control based on recent predictor accuracy, pipeline gating yields little or no energy savings.","Banking; Branch prediction; Energy-aware systems; Highly-biased branches; Low-power design; Pipeline gating; Power; Processor architecture; Speculation control; Target prediction","Branch prediction; Energy-aware systems; Low-power design; Pipeline gatings; Target prediction; Adaptive control systems; Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Computer architecture; Computer software; Digital arithmetic; Energy utilization; Logic design; Performance; Pipeline processing systems; Microprocessor chips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342323881

The use of ice in insulated containers or small commercial coolers for these purposes often results in loss of RBCs due to failure to maintain temperatures within the requisite range. A lightweight and thermally efficient container capable of carrying 4 to 6 units of RBCs at 1 to 10°C for over 72 hours under extreme conditions would help resolve current problems in RBC transportation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Six different prototype containers incorporating phase-change materials (PCMs) in their designs were evaluated for their ability to maintain RBCs between 1 and 10°C while exposed to external temperatures of -24°C and 40°C. In separate experiments, a container was opened and a RBC unit removed. RESULTS: One container weighing 10 pounds with four units of RBCs was capable of maintaining the temperature of the units between 1 and 10°C for over 78 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours at 40°C, -24°C, and 23°C, respectively. Opening the container decreased these times by 2 to 3 hours. CONCLUSIONS: An energy-efficient and lightweight container that maintains RBCs at 1 to 10°C under austere environments for over 78 hours is now available. This container, known as the Golden Hour container (GHC), will facilitate transport of RBCs. The GHC will have additional applications (transport and/or storage of vaccines, other biologics, organs, reagents, etc).",,"article; blood bank; blood component therapy; blood storage; blood transport; erythrocyte; erythrocyte transfusion; human; medical technology; melting point; packaging; temperature; temperature measurement; Blood Preservation; Erythrocytes; Humans; Temperature; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242299629

Visceral obesity is closely linked to both insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We therefore hypothesized that the inheritance of an increased tendency to store fat in visceral fat depots may be a characteristic phenotypic feature in FDR contributing to their insulin resistance. Design and methods: We measured fat distribution in 20 FDR and 14 age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls employing dual energy X-ray absorbtiometry (DEXA)- and computed tomography (CT)-scanning. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (ISGU) was determined by a hyperinsulinemic clamp and maximal aerobic work capacity (VO2 max) by a bicycle ergometer test. Baseline lipolysis was measured using [3H]palmitate. The activity level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was assessed as the 24 h urinary (u -cortisol/creatinine ratio. Results: All subjects had a normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), but FDR were insulin resistant (ISGU: 6.64±0.48 vs 9.12±0.98 mg/kg ffm/min, P = 0.01). Despite similar BMI (25.2±0.5 vs 24.8±0.7 kg/m2, P = 0.61) and overall fat mass (26.4±1.6 vs 24.2±2.1%, P = 0.41) in FDR vs controls, the amount of visceral adipose tissue was substantially increased (65.9±-10.0 vs 40.1±11.3 cm2, P &lt; 0.05) and VO2 max was reduced (52.2±3.1 vs 63.3±3.9 ml/kg ffm/min, P &lt; 0.05) in FDR. Visceral adiposity was inversely correlated with ISGU (FDR: r = -0.52, P &lt; 0.05; controls: r = -0.65, P &lt; 0.01) and in multiple regression analysis visceral adiposity (P &lt; 0.01), VO2 max (P &lt; 0.001) and a family history of type 2 diabetes (P &lt; 0.05) (r2 = 0.64) all significantly and independently contributed to the level of ISGU. Baseline palmitate appearance (145±10 vs 139±15 μmol/min, P = 0.74) and the 24 h u-cortisol/creatinine ratio ((24.9±1.3 vs 27.4±2.0)·10-6, P = 0.28) were both comparable in the two groups. Conclusion: Healthy but insulin-resistant FDR have enhanced visceral obesity and reduced VO2 max compared with people without a family history of diabetes, despite similar BMI and overall fat mass. Both the visceral adiposity and reduced aerobic fitness are strongly associated with and may contribute to their insulin resistance. © 2004 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.",,"creatinine; fat; histone H3; hydrocortisone; palmitic acid; adipose tissue; adult; aerobic capacity; age; anamnesis; article; bicycle ergometry; body fat; body mass; clamp; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; correlation analysis; creatinine urine level; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; fitness; glucose transport; hormone action; human; hydrocortisone urine level; hyperinsulinemia; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; hypothesis; inheritance; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipolysis; male; multiple regression; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; phenotype; priority journal; relative; sex difference; urinalysis; viscera; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Creatinine; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exercise Test; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glucose Clamp Technique; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Insulin Resistance; Male; Matched-Pair Analysis; Physical Fitness; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Reference Values; Regression Analysis; Viscera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12144287295

The purpose of this SNS activation and its physiological impact are, however, unknown. We hypothesize that the chronic stimulation of the SNS with aging is driven in part by a progressive accumulation of body fat. This ""error"" is sensed by the central nervous system via increases in adiposity-sensitive humoral signals (e.g., leptin, insulin) that cross the blood-brain barrier, activate subcortical areas involved in the regulation of energy balance (e.g., ventromedial hypothalamus), and stimulate SNS outflow to peripheral tissues. The SNS activation is intended to increase β-adrenergic thermogenesis in order to expend excess energy as heat rather than by storage of fat. Recent evidence, however, indicates that these adjustments are not effective in augmenting energy expenditure with aging. Indeed, older sedentary adults demonstrate reduced, not increased, β-adrenergic stimulation of metabolic rate because of reduced tissue responsiveness, presumably mediated by SNS-induced impairment of β-adrenergic signaling. As a result, age-associated SNS activation, initiated as a consequence of accumulating adiposity with the intent of preventing further fat storage, ironically, may in time evolve into a potential mechanism contributing to the development of obesity with aging.",,"insulin; leptin; adrenergic system; age; beta adrenergic stimulation; blood brain barrier; body fat; energy balance; energy expenditure; human; lipid storage; metabolic rate; obesity; priority journal; review; sympathetic tone; thermogenesis; zona incerta; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Aging; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Obesity; Sympathetic Nervous System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842266865

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph.

Time-of-use electricity rates encourage shifting of electrical loads to off-peak periods at night and weekends. Buildings can respond to these pricing signals by shifting cooling-related thermal loads either by precooling the building's massive structure or by using active thermal energy storage systems such as ice storage. While these two thermal batteries have been engaged separately in the past, this paper investigates the merits of harnessing both storage media concurrently in the context of optimal control. The objective function is the total utility bill including the cost of heating and a time-of-use electricity rate without demand charges. The evaluation of the combined optimal control assumes perfect weather prediction and plant modeling, which justifies the application of a consecutive time block optimization that optimizes 24 hour horizons sequentially. The analysis shows that the combined utilization leads to cost savings that is significantly greater than either storage but less than the sum of the individual savings. The findings reveal that the cooling-related on-peak electrical demand of commercial buildings can be drastically reduced and justify the development of a predictive optimal controller that accounts for uncertainty in predicted variables and modeling mismatch in real time. © 2003 Elsevier SAS.

Current work has focused primarily on binary metal oxides and silicates. In this work, thin films of zirconium tin titanate (ZTT) were deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using a precursor solution of zirconium tert-butoxide, tin tert-butoxide, and titanium tert-butoxide. The precursor was delivered to a reactor using direct liquid injection. The precursor is mixed such that the relative ratio of the components in the solution is at or near the desired cation ratio of the films. NMR analysis of the precursor solution and each of the individual components suggests that the components in the mixture do not interact (i.e. no ligand exchange). Compositional analysis of the films correlates to the composition of the precursor within a range of values; composition of films deposited from a given precursor composition varies with deposition temperature. The zirconium content of deposited films has been shown to decrease with increasing temperature; the titanium content increases with increasing deposition temperature, while the tin content remains relatively constant with temperature. Kinetic studies of ZTT deposition rate indicate an effective activation energy of 38.8±5kcal/mol. Depending on processing parameters, dielectric constants of ZTT films were shown to range from 21 to 36 with no post-deposition anneal. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","A3.

Comparison of theoretically calculated 29Si NMR chemical shifts for such complexes with experimentally measured values in biological systems could provide a diagnostic tool for identifying which, if any of these molecules exist under physiological conditions. Results are presented here for ab initio molecular orbital calculations of 29Si NMR shifts and formation energies of silicate complexes with polyalcohols, sugar-acids, pyranose sugars, amino acids and multicarboxylic acids. The effects of functional group and molecular structure including ligand size, denticity, ring size, silicon polymerization and coordination number on calculated 29Si shifts were considered. The potential role of such compounds in biological silica utilization pathways is discussed. 29Si NMR shifts and energies were calculated at the HF/6-311+G(2d,p)//HF/6-31G* level. The main result is that only five-membered rings containing penta- and hexa-coordinated Si can explain experimentally observed resonances at ∼ -101 and -141 ppm. Further, the heptet observed in 1H-29Si coupled spectra can only be explained by structures where Si bonds to oxygens atoms in H-C-O-Si linkages with six symmetrically equivalent H atoms. While compounds containing quadra-coordinated silicon may exist in intracellular silicon storage pools within diatoms, calculated reaction energies suggest that the organism has no thermodynamic advantage in taking up extracellular organ-silicate compounds, instead of silicic acid, from the ambient aqueous environment. Hyper-coordinated complexes are deemed unlikely for transport and storage, though they may exist as transient reactive intermediates or activated complexes during enzymatically- catalyzed silica polymerization, as known previously from sol-gel silica synthesis studies. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.",,"chemical substance; silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0942280452

The structural and electronic properties of the freshly co-sputtered Mg-TM thin films in metallic and hydride states were investigated by X-ray diffraction and Mg K- and TM L-edge X-ray absorption spectra. The optical switching of Mg-TM thin films from a mirror-like metallic state to an optically transparent state by exposure to 4% H2 in He is demonstrated by optical transmission and reflectivity in the 350-2500-nm region. The corresponding edge shifts in the Mg K- and TM L-edge X-ray absorption spectra indicate the presence of hydrogen as near neighbors, and its influence on the chemical states of metal thin films is demonstrated using Mg-Ni thin films as a representative example. Aluminum K-edge X-ray absorption spectra in the near-edge region were investigated to study the coordination of Al in crystalline and 0.1 M aqueous solutions of NaAlO2, Al(NO 3)3 and Al2(SO4)3. Aluminum in NaAlO2 occupies both tetrahedral and octahedral sites unlike Al in Al(NO3)3 and Al2(SO 4)3, where it retains its six-fold coordination irrespective of hydration. Bromine L-edge X-ray absorption spectra for crystalline and 0.1 M aqueous solutions of NaBr, KBr and KBrO3 were carried out to study the ligand-field splittings of core excitations which depend on inter-atomic distances, dissociation in aqueous solution, and the resulting hydration. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on the storage of magnetic energy, in particular its potential for driving solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Our calculations indicate that both characteristic magnetic configurations are capable of storing enough magnetic energy to overcome the Aly limit for opening up an initially closed magnetic field. These calculations also indicate that magnetic topology is an important influence in magnetic energy storage. Fields with a normal configuration are more likely to attain energetic states leading to CME-type expulsions than those with an inverse configuration, a property we use to explain Leroy's observations of the height distributions of the two types of solar prominences.","MHD; Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: magnetic fields; Sun: prominences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642617568

This variability is usually associated with north-south gradients in climate, biodiversity, vegetation zones, and ecosystem structure and function. It is clear, however, that significant east-west variability in environment, ecosystem structure and function, environmental history, and recent climate variability is also important. Some areas have cooled while others have become warmer. Also, east-west differences between geographical barriers of oceans, archipelagos and mountains have contributed significantly in the past to the ability of species and vegetation zones to relocate in response to climate changes, and they have created the isolation necessary for genetic differentiation of populations and biodiversity hot-spots to occur. These barriers will also affect the ability of species to relocate during projected future warming. To include this east-west variability and also to strike a balance between overgeneralization and overspecialization, the ACIA identified four major sub regions based on large-scale differences in weather and climate-shaping factors. Drawing on information, mostly model output that can be related to the four ACIA subregions, it is evident that geographical barriers to species re-location, particularly the distribution of landmasses and separation by seas, will affect the northwards shift in vegetation zones. The geographical constraints - or facilitation - of northward movement of vegetation zones will affect the future storage and release of carbon, and the exchange of energy and water between biosphere and atmosphere. In addition, differences in the ability of vegetation zones to re-locate will affect the biodiversity associated with each zone while the number of species threatened by climate change varies greatly between subregions with a significant hot-spot in Beringia. Overall, the subregional synthesis demonstrates the difficulty of generalizing projections of responses of ecosystem structure and function, species loss, and biospheric feedbacks to the climate system for the whole Arctic region and implies a need for a far greater understanding of the spatial variability in the responses of terrestrial arctic ecosystems to climate change.",,"arctic environment; climate change; ecosystem response; regional pattern; spatial variation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844225624

The paper presents analytical methods to evaluate the energy and, accordingly, fuel efficiency of vehicles with any arbitrary number of the drive wheels. The methods are based on vehicle power balance equations analysis and give formulas that functionally link the wheel circumferential forces with slip coefficients and other forces acting onto an AWD vehicle. The proposed methods take into consideration operational modes of vehicles that are tractive mode, load transportation, or a combination of both. The methods are applicable to any type of AWD vehicles including agriculture and military applications when evaluating the energy efficiency and designing a driveline system.

As an excellent Hydrogen gas sorbent, it increases the usable storage capacity of a gas cylinder by ~25% at 3500 PSI and by ~150% at 500 PSI. Our recent NASA-Langley SBIR study shows that when a sorbent-filled tank is charged with hydrogen, it provides shielding superior to polyethylene against most types of ionizing particles. Even as hydrogen is consumed, the carbon and tank ensure that significant radiation shielding capability is maintained. Vastly improved radiation shielding is a clear requirement for a potential manned mission to Mars or a long-duration base on the surface of the Moon. However, current shielding technologies are predicated upon systems dedicated solely to the task of shielding. Such single-use material adds substantially to the mass, and therefore expense, of space operations, without otherwise helping to accomplish mission objectives. One approach to remedy these conflicting constraints is to modify other ship (or EVA suit) systems to maximize their radiation shielding properties, while still serving their primary purposes. Our carbon sorbent material takes this approach. Its performance in this key energy system application is excellent and the carbon itself is a better radiation shield against GCR's and SEP's than the excess Aluminum it can replace.

A lightweight Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell (URFC) Energy Storage System concept is being developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). This Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell System (URFCS) minimizes mass by using the surface area of the hydrogen and oxygen storage tanks as radiating heat surfaces for overall thermal control of the system. The waste heat generated by the URFC stack during charging and discharging is transferred from the cell stack to the surface of each tank by loop heat pipes, which are coiled around each tank and covered with a thin layer of thermally conductive carbon composite. The thin layer of carbon composite acts as a fin structure that spreads the heat away from the heat pipe and across the entire tank surface. Two different sized commercial grade composite tanks were constructed with integral heat pipes and tested in a thermal vacuum chamber to examine the feasibility of using the storage tanks as system radiators. The storage tank/radiators were subjected to different steady-state heat loads and varying heat load profiles. The surface emissivity and specific heat capacity of each tank were calculated. The results will be incorporated into a model that simulates the performance of similar radiators using lightweight, space rated carbon composite tanks.

However, the successful implementation of a hybrid fuel cell system requires achieving performance and efficiency benefits that offsets the additional costs, weight, and complexity of the energy storage system.

The improved fuel efficiency of these vehicles can be directly attributable to the hybridized power train on board these internal combustion engine vehicles. Similarly, hybridization of fuel cell vehicles not only helps improve fuel economy but can also help overcome other technical barriers (start up delays, transients). For fuel cell vehicles, hybridization of on-board fuel cell systems is expected to have the potential to improve the vehicle efficiency largely due to the ability to recover braking energy and via flexibility in designing the system controls. However, the advantages can be offset by the tradeoffs due to added energy losses associated with the DC/DC converter and the battery pack itself. Additional tradeoffs not explicitly addressed in this study include added overall complexity, additional packaging constraints, and potentially higher overall cost. This report will focus on a quantitative analysis of the performance of the indirect-hydrocarbon (IH, onboard fuel processor using gasoline type fuel), hybrid and load-following fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) from the viewpoint of the energy use throughout the system. Specifically, the vehicle energy use and efficiency will be compared between the load following (non-hybrid) and hybrid vehicle platforms. Several hybrid component configurations were studied and two representative configurations were investigated in depth. The first (Configuration 1), in which the DC/DC converter is placed in the path of the fuel cell stack current, there does appear to be some benefit, in terms of energy usage, in hybridizing the IH fuel cell vehicle. Specifically, on the US EPA cycles, the hybrid vehicle outperformed the load following vehicle on the FUDS sequence but the load following vehicle had slightly better results on the HIWAY cycle. However, if the DC/DC converter is placed in the battery current path only, with the fuel cell stack directly connected to the electric drive train (Configuration 2), the benefits in terms of improved fuel economy are larger than in the first configuration. The results corresponding to both these configurations will be analyzed and discussed in this paper. Overall, three main factors affect these vehicle results, all of which will be explicitly examined in this study. These factors are: vehicle weight, fuel cell system efficiency (including the battery), and regenerative braking capabilities. Specifically, the hybrid vehicle fuel economy can be reduced due to a ∼10% heavier vehicle, and a lower overall fuel cell system efficiency (when including the battery and DC/DC converter losses). One important factor is clearly the regenerative braking capability; but the other factor is associated with the ability to improve the efficiency of the fuel cell system itself by taking advantage of the flexibility offered energy storage sub-system and adopting better control strategies. The real question however is whether these gains outweigh the losses introduced by the additional components needed to hybridize the vehicle.

Such devices have various military (rail guns, electromagnetic launchers, and DEW) and commercial applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles, vehicle starting (SLI), and utility peak shaving. The storage and delivery of high levels of burst power can be achieved with a capacitor, flywheel, or rechargeable battery. In order to reduce the weight and volume of many systems they must contain advanced state-of-the-art electrochemical or electromechanical power sources. There is an opportunity and a need to develop energy storage devices that have improved high power characteristics compared to existing ultra capacitors, flywheels or rechargeable batteries. Electro Energy, Inc. has been engaged in the development of bipolar nickel metal hydride batteries which may fulfill the requirements of some of these applications. This paper describes a module rated at 300 V (255 cells) / 6 Ah. The volume of the module is 23 L and the mass is 56 kg. The module is designed to deliver 50 kW pulses of 10 seconds duration at 50% state of charge.

This ALS system must include a food processing subsystem capable of producing a variety of nutritious, acceptable, and safe edible ingredients and food products from pre-packaged and re-supply foods as well as salad crops grown on the transit vehicle or other crops grown on planetary surfaces. However, designing, building, developing, and maintaining such a subsystem is bound to many constraints and restrictions. The limited power supply, storage locations, variety of crops, crew time, need to minimize waste, and other ESM parameters influence the selection of processing equipment and techniques. Several researchers have calculated ESM of select types of food processing equipment to compare ESM for individual food types; however, a complete survey of ESM parameters for currently available food processing unit operations has not been completed. In order to direct NASA's research and technology efforts related to the food subsystem, the technologies available on Earth for food processing, preservation, and packaging must be identified and the viability of these technologies must be assessed. Minimizing mass, volume, and energy consumption are important factors to be considered when locating available food processing equipment and evaluating feasibility for use in an ALS system. Once the ESM has been estimated for available equipment, modifications can be suggested to improve efficiency and reduce ESM. The objective of this study was to compile ESM-parameter information (mass, volume, and power) for currently available, small-scale food processing equipment and to provide average, high, and low ESM values for each class of equipment (hand-held and bench-top mixers, etc.) that performs the following unit operations: mixing, size reduction, heat transfer (heating and cooling), and extraction (water, oil, and juice). In this study, each piece of equipment was assumed to perform a single task, the power required for cooling was set equivalent to the power needed to operate the equipment, and the crew-time was not considered in the preliminary ESM estimates. An additional discussion on other parameters important to consider for ESM of the food system, including multi-functional equipment and power, is provided.

While there are potential safety related issues with any combustible fuel, these have been resolved over the last 100+ years. The comfort level with gasoline fuel has resulted from the widespread application of simple safety procedures followed at every stage of gasoline refinement and handling. It is important to have analogous procedures for handling hydrogen-fueled vehicles safely and with confidence. The characteristics of hydrogen, including: a) wide flammability range, b) very low ignition energy, c) odorless and difficult to detect, d) high diffusion rate, e) high buoyancy, f) invisible flame, etc., bolster the need for safe practices and procedures. In addition, hydrogen is commonly stored in a highly compressed state (around 5000 PSI or higher), which makes the system vulnerable to leaks and may result in the formation of a combustible mixture of hydrogen and air. The presence of an electric drivetrain, high-energy batteries and many of the electrical subsystems in a hybrid electric vehicle makes it potentially risky with conventional electrical / electronic items. As with any vehicle using a combustible fuel, the possibility of having both a combustible fuel mixture and an ignition source could lead to a potential for fire. This paper presents the procedures and practices followed with a high-voltage, hydrogen-fueled vehicle during vehicle development, transportation, maintenance, and storage, including actions taken in the event of an emergency situation.

Division, UES, Inc., United States","General thermodynamic analytical investigations on the primary components of aircraft power systems, as well as vehicle integration and mission considerations, have revealed that thermal management plays a key role in limiting payload size and performance. All power system components such as batteries, capacitors, power semiconductors, generators, pulsed power sources and beam conditioners have thermal design issues when their performance is pushed to deliver higher powers. Several technology driven thermal challenges need to be addressed in the development of these envisioned aircraft based weapon power systems. High power and high heat flux cooling requirements, coupled with a limited payload capacity, is one of the primary design challenges tackled in the development of this type of power system. Partial solutions have been sought by way of increased heat transfer through the use of spray cooling, microchannel and subcooled boiling, loop heat pipes, capillary pumped loops, energy storage and spray cooling arrays. Of course complexities abound in an aircraft environment, and since payloads are severely limited, it is therefore very important to recognize these thermal challenges and approach the design and development of large power systems with cautious optimism. Power and thermal management systems will likely be optimized for specific applications and aircraft platforms, so two typical applications have been investigated: an airborne solid-state laser and a pulsed power directed energy application. Three different thermal management approaches were considered for a typical airborne solid-state laser based power system with a laser output power of 100 kW. Some of the consequences of using advanced thermal management concepts on the tactical mission legs are presented from a time-constraint and mass-constraint points of view. Several thermal management approaches were also evaluated for a pulsed power system with a directed energy application. Both open and closed aircraft level thermal management configurations were investigated. Typically an open cycle system will be considerably lighter than a closed cycle system, except when run times are lengthy. Coolant requirements for an open thermal management system, for a pulsed power source with a 30% duty cycle with an average heat load of 2.9 MW, ranged from 2007 kg of ammonia or 1127 kg of water.

The transmission leverages the advantages of an output power-split configuration for low-speed operation and a compound power-split configuration for high-speed operation. It is capable of being operated in a number of operating modes including an eVT only mode and a hybrid mode when equipped with on-board energy storage devices. The transmission provides a compact, highly efficient and potentially low cost driveline solution for both conventional vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. A virtual transmission prototype was built in EASY51. A base vehicle model was also constructed in EASY5 environment with Ricardo Powertrain Library components. Performance of the proposed transmission was evaluated in context of the base vehicle for driveline efficiency, vehicle acceleration, vehicle fuel consumption and emissions under various driving cycles. Comparison with a conventional four-speed automatic transmission was made. Results of the evaluation have demonstrated superior performance of the proposed eVT over conventional automatic transmissions. The eVT has a high efficiency of 92% over most of the speed conversion range. The infinite conversion range of the eVT enhances the vehicle's tractive effort, improving vehicle acceleration. It shortens the acceleration time by 7.5% from 0 to 60 mph, and 9.5% from 30 to 50 mph. The infinitely variable speed ratio along with the rapid speed-ratio-change capability of the electric system allows the transmission to significantly improve vehicle's fuel economy and reduce vehicle's emissions. Even under eVT only operation mode (for conventional vehicle application), 11% fuel savings for urban driving and 9% on highway driving are easily achievable. The reduction in Nox emission is predicted to be about 12% under urban drive cycles and 5% on highway. The electro-mechanical eVT allows various degrees of hybridization to provide further gains in fuel economy and environmental acceptability.

Some recent conceptual designs, such as GM's Hy-wire, have recognized this and offered innovative new architectures. Unfortunately, many other new technology concept cars do not exploit the freedoms of the new technologies, hampering themselves with traditional design cues developed for conventional powertrains. This paper will present the conceptual design of a high-power, high-speed fuel cell luxury sedan. One of the main motivations of this case study was to explore what could happen when a vehicle was designed from the ground up as a fuel cell vehicle, optimized at the overall system level as well as at the individual component level. The paper will discuss innovations in vehicle architecture and novel concepts for the electrical transmission, fuel cell system and electromagnetic suspension. Vehicle architecture introduces new topology based upon new criteria which are needed for a fuel cell electric vehicle. The main elements of the vehicle-such as the hydrogen fuel tanks, super-capacitors, electric machines, fuel cell stacks, fuel cell auxiliaries, radiators, brake resistor and power electronics-are located in positions allowing maximum active and passive safety with the same or enhanced functioning performances. These goals can be met, without punishing passenger comfort or trunk volume by using the added freedom in component placement that the electric powertrain provides. General styling introduces a very intimate amphitheater concept together with a low drag body. An adjustable trunk maximizes storage space when necessary and improves drag when the storage is not needed. The fuel cell design contains new high efficiency concepts for the stack itself as well as the auxiliary systems. Stack design eliminates the need for graphite plates and de-ionized cooling water, improving both the cold startability and the pressure drop across the stack. Integration of a fast auxiliary warm-up system further improves cold startability. This system allows for a 2-4 minute transition time when operating at - 20°C, and permits the fuel cell to start at temperatures as low as - 40°C. A continuously controlled pressure wave compressor (Comprex) offers substantial efficiency gains over a classical electrically driven compressor, with energy savings in excess of 50%. The electric transmission introduces some aspects of power electronics and energy management for low cost implementation. The fuel cell and the multi-level inverter have been designed together to eliminate any intermediary DC to DC converters. Virtual electromagnetic differentials distribute torque between the front and rear axles. Two such twin rotor electric machines allow for active traction control on all four wheels, while minimizing costs and increasing machine efficiency. A zero-power active levitation system provides the basis for the electro-magnetic suspension, which allows real-time camber control and recovery of some of the energy absorbed by suspension damping.

The bus route details were obtained by recording time-series measurements of speed and grade during actual runs of buses on the city streets under different traffic conditions. The transit buses' physical and mechanical characteristics were obtained from manufacturers' data and chassis dynamometer testing of the buses on different city cycles. Both the bus routes and the bus performance characteristics were put into the simulation package ADVISOR from the National Renewal Energy Laboratory (NREL). The most extreme results were for the San Francisco routes that have high grades. The high grades cause performance and emissions problems for both the diesel and CNG buses relative to the hybrid bus. A large portion of the performance and emissions problems can be directly related to the hydraulic torque converter that is currently used on most diesel and CNG city buses. At conditions that are typical of high grades, the hydraulic torque converters have quite poor efficiencies. Since the hybrid bus has a direct electric drive system, it does not suffer the efficiency problems to the same degree as the diesel and CNG buses. This paper also illustrates that bus performance modeling has reached a stage where it can help city bus systems evaluate bus performance before the buses are put into service. For example, it is expected that global positioning systems (GPS) will provide detailed time, speed, location, and grade information for all the bus routes in typical cities during different times of the day with different traffic conditions. This information can then be used with both old and new specifications for bus technologies to predict performance on the actual routes for which they could be used. In this way, a bus transit system could optimize bus routing assignments to minimize cost and emissions on a wide variety of routes.

This paper challenges the assumption that this relationship is easily summarized. Further, for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) the relationship between mass, performance and fuel consumption is not the same as for CVs, and vary with hybrid types. For fully functioning (all wheel regeneration) hybrid vehicles, where battery pack and motor(s) have enough power and energy storage, a very large fraction of kinetic energy is recovered and engine idling is effectively eliminated. This paper assesses two important impacts of shifting from conventional to hybrid vehicles in terms of the mass vs. fuel economy relationship - 1) significant improvements in fuel economy with little or no change in mass, and 2) once a switch to hybrid powertrains has been made, the effectiveness of mass reduction in improving fuel economy will be diminished relative to conventional vehicles. In this paper, we discuss vehicle tractive load breakdowns and impacts of hybridization on vehicle efficiency, discuss capture of kinetic energy by conversion to electrical energy via regenerative braking, assess benefits of shutting off the engine when the vehicle does not require power, and investigate energy losses associated with vehicle mass.

The introduction of gas bubbles into the coolant can have negative consequences, including: loss of centrifugal pump prime, irregular sensor readings, and blockage of coolant flow to remote systems. One solution to mitigate these problems is the development of a passive gas removal device, or gas trap, installed in the flight cooling system. In this study, a new hydrophilic, composite membrane has been developed for passage of the coolant fluid and retention of gas bubbles. The trapped bubbles are subsequently vented from the system by a thin, hydrophobic, microporous membrane. The original design for this work employed a homogeneous membrane that was susceptible to fouling and pore plugging. Spare gas traps of this variety have degraded during storage, and recreation of the membranes has been complicated due to problems with polymer duplication and property variations in the final membranes. In this work, replacements have been developed based on deposition of a hydrophilic polymer on the bore-side of a porous polyethylene (PE) tube. The tube provides excellent chemical and mechanical stability, and the hydrophilic layer provides for retention of gas bubbles due to elevated bubble pressure. Preliminary results have shown that intimate contact is required between the deposited layer and the substrate to overcome surface energy differences that reduce good adhesion. This has been accomplished by presoaking the membrane tube in the solvent to raise its surface energy. Polymer solutions of various concentrations have been used to promote penetration of the polymer layer into the porous substrate and to control separation layer thickness. The resulting composite membranes have shown repeatable decrease in nitrogen permeability, which is indicative of a decrease in membrane pore size. Studies with water permeation have yielded similar results. We have observed some swelling of the added polymer layer, which causes a slight decrease in membrane pore size, and should result in improved bubble retention. Preliminary studies have also been performed on gas retention in flowing systems. Initial results have been promising, with negligible gas permeation for the coated membranes compared to 100% gas permeation in the uncoated tube.

Principally, the need for generating and managing copious amounts of power into the Megawatt class is foreseen. Probably, the most critical and challenging area for supporting a DEW system on an aircraft is the Megawatt Class Electric Power System (MCEPS) and its associated Thermal Management Systems (TMS). MCEPS converts the aircraft fuel's chemical energy into useable power for the load or system and the TMS disposes of the waste energy, all within the extremely challenging constraints (volume, weight, EMI, etc.) For the purposes of our studies, the MCEPS consists of the following subsystems: Engine, Power Generation, Power Conditioning, Distribution, Control, and Protection. The TMS manages Component Heat Extraction, Thermal Energy Storage, and Waste Heat disposal. Using a systems engineering process of analyzing requirements, defining candidate architectures, optimizing and evaluating alternatives, and verifying the system solution ensures that the potential MCEPS design solutions are traceable back to requirements based on a specific application. The MCEPS requirements analysis process evaluates various aircraft missions to identify basic requirements such as power type, quantity, quality, duty cycles, and application constraints for proper integration. These basic MCEPS design parameters drive the design options and solutions. Potential candidate architectures for power generation include: Advance secondary batteries, fuel cells, APUs, engine driven generators (conventional/low duty cycle, & super conducting), for power conditioning: Linear or active converters, for distribution, control, and protection: AC or DC, Low or High Voltage. TMS architecture candidates include; for component heat extraction: single phase, mixed phase, and two phase, and for waste heat disposal: open cycle and closed cycle. This paper discusses the pros and cons for these various approaches and the need to consider integration impacts in an application during the MCEPS design work.

Flywheel batteries have demonstrated power density and life superiority over conventional chemical batteries; however, fears of unexpected and uncontained failures may prevent their widespread acceptance in the United States marketplace. The University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics (UT-CEM) has designed, built, and tested a full-scale composite flywheel containment system for use in mobile applications. The flywheel containment system that will be described stems from an in-depth investigation into the type of faults that are most likely to occur in mobile applications. In all cases, the worst-case scenario results in a challenge to flywheel integrity; therefore, a comprehensive flywheel containment system is considered the ""last line of defense"" in protecting personnel and equipment. The containment system described is an energy absorption device used in parallel with a UT-CEM flywheel on the hybrid electric Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB). The most important aspect of the containment device is the free-rotating composite liner intended to absorb the energy of a flywheel failure. The current containment design has been developed over a six-year period during the participation of UT-CEM in the DARPA/DOT Flywheel Containment Program. A comparison between a previous full scale containment test (November 1999) and the current configuration is made, illustrating how ""lessons learned"" from the previous test are integrated into the latest design. The test was conducted in August 2002 and a detailed description of the mounting configuration, test setup, and data acquisition is presented along with results. Of particular interest to the design team was torque on the aluminum containment housing, axial and hoop stresses in the housing, and acceleration. The test was successful in that the composite debris was contained and all metallic structures remained fully intact.

The main obstacle to the increased use of diesel engines in this platform is the upcoming extremely stringent, Tier 2 emission standard. In order to succeed, diesel vehicles must comply with emissions standards while maintaining their excellent fuel economy. The availability of technologies such as common rail fuel injection systems, low sulfur diesel fuel, NOX adsorber catalysts (NAC), and diesel particle filters (DPFs) allow the development of powertrain systems that have the potential to comply with these future requirements. In meeting the Tier 2 emissions standards, the heavy light-duty trucks (HLDTs) and medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPVs) will face the greatest technological challenges. In support of this, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has engaged in several test projects under the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels-Diesel Emission Control (APBF-DEC) activity. The primary technology being addressed by these projects is the sulfur tolerance of the NAC/DPF system and the durability implications of varying fuel sulfur levels. The test bed for one project in this activity is a 2500 series Chevrolet Silverado equipped with a 6.6L Duramax diesel engine certified to 2002 model year (MY) Federal heavy-duty and 2002 MY California medium-duty emission standards. While NAC systems have demonstrated extremely high levels of NO X reduction in steady-state laboratory evaluations, the application of a NAC system to an actual transient engine application requires the development of an integrated engine/emissions management system [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. This paper discusses the integrated engine/emissions system management and regeneration control strategies that were developed. The final control strategies achieved over 98% reductions in tailpipe NOX mass emissions over the hot-start portion of the light-duty Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75). The discussion will cover NOX mass storage modeling and NAC regeneration management strategies for transient operation over the FTP-75, Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET), and US06 test (an aggressive driving procedure from the supplemental FTP test) cycles.

Agents that enhance insulin sensitivity, such as rosiglitazone, appear to exert their therapeutic effect through adipose tissue, but the precise mechanisms of their actions are unclear. Rosiglitazone changes the morphological features and protein profiles of mitochondria in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To examine the relevance of these effects in vivo, we studied white adipocytes from ob/ob mice during the development of obesity and after treatment with rosiglitazone. The levels of approximately 50% of gene transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins were decreased with the onset of obesity. About half of those genes were upregulated after treatment with rosiglitazone, and this was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial mass and changes in mitochondrial structure. Functionally, adipocytes from rosiglitazone-treated mice displayed markedly enhanced oxygen consumption and significantly increased palmitate oxidation. These data reveal mitochondrial remodeling and increased energy expenditure in white fat in response to rosiglitazone treatment in vivo and suggest that enhanced lipid utilization in this tissue may affect whole-body energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.",,"mitochondrial protein; palmitic acid; rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; chaperonin; complementary RNA; fatty acid; insulin; messenger RNA; oxygen; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; rosiglitazone; vasodilator agent; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal model; animal tissue; article; drug effect; drug mechanism; energy; energy expenditure; genetic transcription; homeostasis; in vivo study; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; mitochondrion; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxidation; oxygen consumption; priority journal; satiety; white adipose tissue; adipocyte; animal; C57BL mouse; cell strain 3T3; chemistry; cytology; DNA microarray; fluorescence microscopy; glucose blood level; mass spectrometry; metabolism; mouse mutant; Northern blotting; obesity; pathology; time; transgenic mouse; Western blotting; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blood Glucose; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Western; Chaperonin 60; Fatty Acids; Insulin; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Mice, Transgenic; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Mitochondria; Obesity; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oxygen; Palmitic Acid; PPAR gamma; RNA, Complementary; RNA, Messenger; Thiazolidinediones; Time Factors; Vasodilator Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047689659

Data grids provide such data-intensive applications with a large virtual storage framework with unlimited power. However, conventional scheduling algorithms for data grids are unable to meet the security needs of data-intensive applications. In this paper we address the problem of scheduling data-intensive jobs on data grids subject to security constraints. Using a security- and data-aware technique, a dynamic scheduling strategy is proposed to improve quality of security for data-intensive applications running on data grids. To incorporate security into job scheduling, we introduce a new performance metric, degree of security deficiency, to quantitatively measure quality of security provided by a data grid. Results based on a real-world trace confirm that the proposed scheduling strategy significantly improves security and performance over four existing scheduling algorithms by up to 810% and 1478%, respectively. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Data grid; Degree of security deficiency; Scheduling; Security-sensitive application",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904062567

Under such sperm competition, the amount of spermatogenic tissue, the efficiency of sperm production and the capacity for sperm storage should all be under strong selection. Males of several species of fairy-wrens (Malurus) have been found to store large numbers of sperm for ejaculation, a suggested adaptation to male-biased sex ratios and high levels of reproductive promiscuity. In this study we examined the histology of testes of three species of fairy-wren: the splendid, Malurus splendens melanotus, variegated, M. lamberti assimilis, and white-winged fairy-wren, M. leucopterus leuconotus, as well as the quantity and quality (viability) of sperm in captive male splendid fairy-wrens to estimate the temporal pattern of sperm production and depletion. The daily rates of sperm production in all three species were high: 306×106sperm/day for splendid, 125×106sperm/day for variegated and 204×106sperm/day for white-winged fairy-wrens, and the efficiency of sperm production (sperm per day per g of body mass) was several orders of magnitude greater than values reported for other domestic and wild species. For splendid fairy-wrens, the estimates of sperm production varied with the method used for estimation (range of estimates 306×10 6-1367×106sperm/day). Splendid fairy-wren males held in captivity replenished their sperm reserves within 12h, which is faster than that reported for most other species thus far. There was a negative correlation between length of sampling interval and the proportion of live sperm in ejaculate samples, indicating that males that copulate more frequently have higher-quality ejaculates. Together, both experimental and morphological estimates suggest that all three species of fairy-wren invest considerable energy in the production as well as the storage of massive numbers of sperm. Intra- and interspecific variation in the rates of sperm production is most likely linked to differences in the operational sex ratios of social groups and the opportunity for extragroup parentage. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The refinements converged to R ≤ 0.017. Bonds at the O3 site are fundamental in understanding the response of the atomic arrangement as Fe concentration increases. The M2-O3a bond shortens by more than 0.06 Å, and the M2-O3b bond shortens by ∼0.02 Å over the series. This shift of the O3 oxygen toward the two coordinating M2 sites is commensurate with an increase in the M1-O3 bond length by approximately 0.03 Å, and an increase in the distortion of the M1 site. Much previous work has focused on polyhedron distortions in the olivine structure. The angle variance for the M1, M2, and T polyhedra were calculated for each phosphate sample in this study and published silicate and germanate olivine structures. In each case, the angle variance of the phosphate olivines was found to be smaller in the M1 octahedron, which is in contrast to the other olivine-structure phases examined in this study. However, if the size difference in the radius of the M1 and M2 site cations is ≥ 0.17 Å, the distortion is greater in the octahedral site that is occupied by the larger cation. The structural differences along the lithiophilite-triphylite solid-solution series may have significant effects on its solid electrolyte properties, including rates of lithium diffusion and activation energies, and thus are important in the development and design of Li-olivine storage cathodes.","Crystal structure; Lithiophilite; Lithium storage electrodes; Olivine structure; Triphylite","Activation energy; Cathodes; Chemical bonds; Crystal structure; Diffusion; Olivine; Silicates; Atomic arrangement; Polyhedron distortions; Solid-solution series; Structural variations; Lithium compounds; chemical bonding; crystal structure; olivine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7744243933

The RF motion of ions in the bath gas environment involves a large number of ion-neutral collisions that leads to the internal activation of ions and their effective ""heating"" (when a thermal distribution of internal energies results). The degree of ion activation required in various applications may range from a minimum level (e.g., slightly raising the average internal energy) to an intense level resulting in ion fragmentation. Several research groups proposed using the effective temperature as a measure of ion activation under conditions of multiple ion-neutral collisions. Here we present approximate relationships for the effective ion temperature relevant to typical operation modes of RF multipole devices. We show that RF ion activation results in near-thermal energies for ions occupying an equilibrium position at the center of an RF trap, whereas increased ion activation can be produced by shifting ions off-center, e.g., by means of an external DC electric field. The ion dissociation in the linear quadrupole ion trap using the dipolar DC ion activation has been observed experimentally and interpreted in terms of the effective ion temperature. © 2004 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.",,"Cooling; Electric field effects; Linear systems; Mass spectrometry; Ion cooling; Ion guides; Ion traps; Ions; ion; article; collisionally activated dissociation; direct current; dissociation; electric field; ion trap mass spectrometry; radiofrequency; temperature; thermal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244240779

Experimentally it is found that the central electron temperature is roughly independent of plasma density. The ASTRA code is used to model electron cyclotron heating for a magnetic configuration that is quasi-symmetric as well as for a configuration in which the symmetry is broken. The experimental results are consistent with an anomalous thermal conductivity that scales inversely with the density. However, the experimental scaling of the stored energy against density is not usually in agreement with the model. From the measured X-ray flux and the high absorbed power, as well as from the calculated low single-pass absorption efficiency, it is concluded that at low densities, a nonthermal electron population accounts for a significant fraction of the stored energy. With the ASTRA code, it is also possible to model under what conditions the central electron temperature in the quasi-symmetric configuration will be measurably greater than the temperature in the nonsymmetric configuration. These calculations depend greatly on the radial electric field of the nonsymmetric plasma but suggest that at somewhat higher density and higher power than achieved to date, differences in the central electron temperature may be observed.","ECH; HSX; Transport","Antennas; Diffusion; Electron cyclotron resonance; Energy storage; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Mirrors; Plasma density; Plasma heating; Gaussian beams; Helically symmetric experiments (HSX); Quasi-helical symmetric (QHS) configurations; Plasma devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6444242932

Groundwater circulation wells are a good candidate technology to couple with renewable energy, because the remediation system removes contamination from the subject aquifer with no net loss of the groundwater resource, while the wind turbine does not create potentially harmful air emissions. Wind data collected in the vicinity of the former Nebraska Ordnance Plant Superfund site were used to select a wind turbine system to provide a portion of the energy necessary to power a groundwater circulation well located in an area of high trichloroethylene groundwater contamination. Because utility power was already installed at the remediation system, a 10 kW grid inter-tie wind turbine system supplements the utility system without requiring batteries for energy storage. The historical data from the site indicate that the quantity of energy purchased correlates poorly with the quantity of groundwater treated. Preliminary data from the wind turbine system indicate that the wind turbine provides more energy than the remediation system treatment components and the well submersible pump require on a monthly average. The preliminary results indicate that the coupling of wind turbines and groundwater circulation wells may be an attractive alternative in terms of the system operation time, cost savings, and contaminant mass removal. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57949116374

By identifying the major physiochemical inactivation pathway(s) during storage, formulations of Ad5 were designed with specific pharmaceutical excipients leading to greatly enhanced stability. For example, results indicate that Ad5 is stabilized by non-ionic surfactants and cryoprotectants as well as excipients known to inhibit free-radical oxidation. A non-ionic surfactant is necessary to prevent adsorption of adenovirus to glass surfaces during storage, and a cryoprotectant is needed to prevent freeze - thaw-induced virus inactivation. In a base formulation (A105) containing sucrose as the cryoprotectant and polysorbate-80 as the non-ionic surfactant, metal-ion catalyzed free-radical oxidation is an important mechanism of Ad5 inactivation. The free-radical oxidation inhibitors ethanol and histidine, combined with the metal-ion chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), were determined to be effective stabilizers of Ad5. Arrhenius plots of stability data are consistent with a first-order inactivation mechanism with apparent activation energies for virus inactivation of 26.5 ± 0.9 and 28.7 ± 0.6 kcal/mol in the absence and presence of free-radical oxidation inhibitors, respectively. Optimization of formulation pH, as well as the EDTA and ethanol concentrations, allowed for the identification of formulations that further enhanced long-term storage stability. For example, Ad5 in an optimized liquid formulation (A195) lost <0.1 logs of infectivity after 24 months of storage at 4°C. The immunogenicity of a recombinant Ad5-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine candidate expressing HIV-1 gag (MRKAd5gag) formulated in A195, was shown to be equivalent to the same vaccine formulated in A105. Therefore, the use of EDTA, ethanol, and histidine did not significantly alter the immunogenicity of the vaccine in mice. The identification of 4°C stable liquid formulations should significantly enhance the utility of Ad5 as a vector for vaccines and gene therapy. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.","Adenoviral vector; Formulation; Oxidation; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Stabilization; Vaccines; Viral vectors","adenovirus vector; alcohol; chelating agent; cryoprotective agent; edetic acid; free radical; Gag protein; histidine; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; surfactant; Adenovirus 5; article; cell line; cryopreservation; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug stability; drug storage; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; immunogenicity; oxidation; pH; storage temperature; thawing; vaccination; virus inactivation; virus infectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4844222269

Laboratory, Camilla Dunham Whitehead, Andre Fargeix, Golden Gate E., Berkeley, CA, United States","This paper evaluates the impact of fluctuating electricity prices on the cost of five options to increase the water supply to urban areas in Southern California - new surface storage, water purchases, desalination, wastewater recycling, and conservation. We show that the price of electricity required to produce and transport water influences the cost of water supply options and may alter the decision makers economic ranking of these options. When electricity prices are low, water purchase is the cost effective option. When prices exceed US$ 86/MWh, conservation of electricity and water through installation of high efficiency clothes washers is the most effective option. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This creates inaccessible regions of higher temperature rocks and may reduce the amount of energy within the bed. Stratification of the segmented bed has the advantages of supplying the highest temperature air to the dwelling and the lowest temperature air to the collector. A method of preserving the stratification by segmenting the storage bed was numerically studied. Discharging was not studied. Segmenting a standard rock bed and routing the flow to segments cooler than the inlet air during charging was shown to preserve stratification throughout the bed. The simulated segmented bed contained 1% less maximum energy than an otherwise identical standard bed for an approximated solar day.

Unlike for the PW surimi, the minimum values of the AP sarimi was moisture-content dependent and there was a linear relationship between logarithm of concentration and reciprocal absolute temperature at gelation. The activation energy (Ea) for aggregation after gelation temperature at each moisture content was calculated by a nonisothermal kinetic model for both AP and PW Surimi.

Recent work has suggested that larger, aggressive branch predictors can and should be used in order to improve microprocessor performance. A further consideration is that more aggressive branch predictors, especially multiported predictors for multiple branch prediction, may be thermal hot spots, thus further increasing leakage. Moreover, as the branch predictor holds state that is transient and predictive, elements can be discarded without adverse effect. For these reasons, it is natural to consider applying decay techniques—already shown to reduce leakage energy for caches—to branch-prediction structures. Due to the structural difference between caches and branch predictors, applying decay techniques to branch predictors is not straightforward. This paper explores the strategies for exploiting spatial and temporal locality to make decay effective for bimodal, gshare, and hybrid predictors, as well as the branch target buffer (BTB). Furthermore, the predictive behavior of branch predictors steers them towards decay based not on state-preserving, static storage cells, but rather quasi-static, dynamic storage cells.

There are two main reasons that cause prefetching to be power inefficient. First, compiler inserted prefetch instructions increase code size, therefore could increase I-cache power. Secondly, inaccurate prefetching (esp. for hardware prefetching) leads to high D-cache power consumption due to the useless accesses. In this work, we show that it is possible to support power-efficient prefetching through bit-differentail offset assignment to stack variables. We target the prefetching of relocatable stack variables with a high degree of precision. By assigning the offsets of stack variables in such a way that most consecutive addresses differ by 1 bit, we can prefetch them with compact prefetch instructions to save I-cache power. The compiler first generates an access graph of consecutive memory references and then attempts a layout of the memory locations in the smallest hypercube. Each dimension of the hypercube represents a 1-bit differential addressing. The embedding is carried out in as compact a hypercube as possible in order to save memory space. Each load/store instruction carries a hint regarding prefetching the next memory reference by encoding its differential address with respect to the current one. To reduce D-cache power cost, we further attempt to assign offsets so that most of the consecutive accesses map to the same cache line. Our prefetching is done using a one entry line buffer[1]. As a consequence, many lookups in D-cache reduce to incremental ones. This results in D-cache activity reduction and power savings. Our prefetching requires both compiler and hardware support. In this paper, we provide implementation on the ARM processor with small modification to the ARM ISA. We tackle issues about out of order commit, predication and speculation through simple modifications to the processor pipeline on non-critical paths. Our goal in this work is to boost performance while maintaining/lowering power consumption. Our results show 12% speed-up and slightly lower power consumption.","Bit-Differential Addressing; Data Prefetching; Embedded Processors; Offset Assignment","Algorithms; Buffer storage; Computer programming languages; Energy efficiency; Power control; Program processors; Real time systems; Bit differential addressing; Data prefetching; Embedded processors; Offset assignment; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544341776

To meet the strict time-to-market requirements of systems containing these chips, compilers require retargetable alogrithms for effectively assigning values to the memory partitions. The EMBARC algorithm described in this paper is the first algorithm to attempt to realize a comprehensive, retargetable algorithm for effective partition assignment of variables in an arbitrary memory hierarchy. It supports a wide variety of memory models including on-chip SRAMs, multiple layers of caches, and even uncached DRAM partitions. Even though it is designed to handle such a range of memory hierarchies, EMBARC is capable of generating partition assignments of similar quality to algorithms designed for specific memory hierarchies. We use a large range of benchmarks and memory models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the EMBARC algorithm. We found that EMBARC can achieve 99% of the improvement of a dedicated algorithm for cacheless systems without SRAM. Also, for cacheless systems with SRAM, EMBARC generated the optimal partition assignment for benchmarks that were simple enough to hand-generate an optimal partition assignment. As further proof of EMBARC's generality, we also show how EMBARC can be used to generate partition assignments for a memory hierarchies with two on-chip caches that can be accessed in parallel.","Embedded Systems; Partition Assignment; Retargetable Compilers","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Cache memory; Computer systems; Dynamic random access storage; Embedded systems; Static random access storage; Experimentation; Memory partitions; Partition assignment; Retargetable compilers; Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544289987

The innate immune system provides protection during the initial stages of infection and is responsible for mediating many of the alterations in nutrient metabolism. The macrophage is the key sensory and regulatory cell of the innate immune system. Their pro-inflammatory cytokines coordinate local immunity to pathogens, yet also act systemically to alter metabolic homeostasis and decrease food intake and growth rate. Altered energy, amino acid, lipid, and mineral metabolism have nutritionally important implications. For example, an innate immune response results in decreased uptake of amino acids by skeletal muscles and a corresponding increase in uptake by the liver and to a lesser extent by leukocytes. The net result is a decrease in amino acid requirements with no change in the efficiency of their use for growth. The shift in the priority of individual tissues for nutrients appears to be accomplished by changes in the types and amounts of their nutrient transporters and storage proteins. Adaptive immune responses result in considerably more subtle changes in nutrient metabolism than innate responses.","Chicken; Cytokine; Infection; Interleukin-1; Leukocyte; Macrophage; Metabolism","Animalia; Gallus gallus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544253670

High-temperature oxide superconductors, discovered in the late 1980s, are moving into the second generation of their development. The first generation relied on bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, and the second generation is based on yttrium barium copper oxide, which has the potential to be less expensive and to perform better. The potential uses of HTS wires for electric power applications include underground transmission cables, oil-free transformers, superconducting magnetic-energy storage units, fault-current limiters, high-efficiency motors, and compact generators. Wires of 10-100 m in length can now be made, but material and processing issues must be solved before an optimized production scheme can be achieved. This issue covers a range of processing techniques using energetic beams, rolling, and laser and chemical methods to form wires with good superconducting properties.","Coated conductors; High-temperature superconductors; YBCO","Coatings; Costs; Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric currents; Grain boundaries; Textures; Ytterbium compounds; GZO template; Polycrystalline metals; Silver overcoat; Superconductor filaments; Superconducting wire",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444266112

We report a simple approach to create self-assembled nanowires of α-Fe through the decomposition of a suitably chosen perovskite. We illustrate the principle behind this approach using the reaction 2La 0.5Sr0.5FeO3 → LaSrFeO4 + Fe + O2 that occurs during the deposition of La0.5Sr 0.5FeO3 under reducing conditions. This leads to the spontaneous formation of an array of single-crystalline α-Fe nanowires embedded in LaSrFeO4 matrix, which grow perpendicular to the substrate and span the entire film thickness. The diameter and spacing of the nanowires are controlled directly by deposition temperature. The nanowires show uniaxial anisotropy normal to the film plane and magnetization close to that of bulk α-Fe. The high magnetization and sizable coercivity of the nanowires make them desirable for high-density data storage and other magnetic-device applications.",,"Anisotropy; Decomposition; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ferromagnetic materials; Iron compounds; Lanthanum compounds; Magnetization; Nanotechnology; Perovskite; Pulsed laser deposition; Self assembly; Single crystals; Thermodynamics; Transmission electron microscopy; Iron nanowires; Self-assembled nanowires; Specific energy; Thermodynamic equilibrium; Nanostructured materials; ferric ion; ferric oxide; iron; nanotube; article; chemistry; conformation; crystallization; crystallography; electricity; evaluation; materials; materials testing; metallurgy; methodology; nanotechnology; semiconductor; surface property; temperature; ultrastructure; Crystallization; Crystallography; Electric Wiring; Ferric Compounds; Iron; Manufactured Materials; Materials Testing; Metallurgy; Molecular Conformation; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Semiconductors; Surface Properties; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344680625

Examples of equipment used to carry out these processes include heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment, refrigeration equipment, dust collection systems, drying and curing ovens, kilns, and melting cupolas. Because requirements and operating conditions change over time, there is often a need to modify existing equipment. The potential for energy savings may be very large, but engineers and plant managers are still reluctant to take action because it is not easy to predict the overall effects of proposed changes in such complex systems. Computer assisted analyses are needed in many cases. GOTHIC is a general purpose thermal hydraulics code originally developed for design, licensing, safety, and operating analyses of nuclear power plant containments and other confinement buildings. It is a state of the-art program that solves conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy for multi-component, multi-phase flows. The code is user-friendly, and is capable of modeling systems with many components. This work employs GOTHIC to evaluate proposed changes to a forced convection system for cooling urethane foam logs. The logs, which are about 30 ft’ in cross section by 200 ft in length, form when liquid chemicals react on an enclosed conveyor. The exothermic reaction continues for a few hours after the log is formed. As many as 24 logs are stored in racks at one time and cooled by refrigerated air. A ventilation system removes fumes from the storage area. The system is inefficient and costly to operate because the cooling airflow pattern is not optimized, and because cool air is removed by the ventilation system. The GOTHIC code makes it possible to easily and quickly predict flows and air temperatures in the complex geometry, transient temperatures within the logs, and to optimize the cooling system. © 2004 Energy Engineering.

Due to the small size of these 'bits', it has been proposed to use this technique for high-density optical data storage. This paper is concerned with the mechanisms of the change of the index of refraction in such a small domain. We propose that the laser-induced strain field is responsible for the localized change of the index of refraction. It is demonstrated that the compressive strain field could be smaller than the area where the laser energy is absorbed in the glass.",,"Boundary conditions; Computer simulation; Dielectric materials; Energy absorption; Fused silica; Irradiation; Optical data storage; Optical glass; Parameter estimation; Refractive index; Stress analysis; Thermal diffusion; Thermoanalysis; Femtosecond lasers; Optical reflectivity; Pulse energy; Surface reflection; Laser pulses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344622054

However, thermal energy storage (TES) market penetration is small in comparison to its potential. Why? In TES’ infancy (early 1980s), a small number of manufacturers carefully researched the technology and installed equipment. In the technology’s adolescent years (late 1980s and early 1990s), dozens of manufacturers, chasing the new demand-side management rebate incentives, jumped into the marketplace. These difficult adolescent years resulted in tarnished reputations and the spread of misinformation about the technology. This article attempts to set the record straight on the myths and reality of this technology by demonstrating how TES is well-positioned to help the move towards more energy-efficient and environmentfriendly air-conditioning systems. The obvious reason for installing TES is to reduce energy costs. Although deregulation of the electric industry has created localized anomalies in energy costs, the basic reality of supply and demand is that on-peak power is more expensive than off-peak power.1 One consistently proven aspect of TES is that it saves energy costs, which has more significance now that ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1, Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, and the LEED rating system are based on energy cost savings. Several TES projects that have won ASHRAE’s Technology Award2,3,4 detail the cost-saving aspect. However, less emphasis has been given to the reductions of equipment size and infrastructure that normally occurs. The basic TES cooling systems that I base most of my analysis on are: Chiller-based systems. Throughout the adolescent years of TES, a variety of systems, including site-built liquid overfeed refrigeration systems, ice-harvesting equipment and others, were used successfully in other applications. However, 99 percent of commercial air-conditioning TES systems installed use a standard chiller to produce the cooling. Chillers are familiar, reliable, capacity rated, and competitively priced. They cool water or a glycol-water solution. Ice-based storage. For projects where space is not as much of a consideration, chilled water storage is becoming widely used.5 However, since so much HVAC work involves retrofits where space is a concern, ice is the likely choice. Closed system. Large district cooling systems use either water and/or ice as the storage media and the heat transfer fluid. These “open” systems create added hydraulic complications that need to be carefully addressed. However, most TES systems now separate the storage media from the heat transfer fluid, so the systems are the same hydraulically as most chiller systems. © 2004 Energy Engineering.

Somatostatins possess a wide variety of biological functions, including numerous secretotropic, developmental, and metabolic effects. Studies on fish have revealed considerable insight into the role of SS on the regulation of intermediary metabolism. Somatostatins promote both lipid and carbohydrate breakdown in fish and lamprey. Such actions are mediated by secretotropic effects of SS. For example, SS inhibit insulin (INS); insulin deficiency favors lipolysis and glycogenolysis over lipogenesis and glycogenesis. Somatostatins also directly stimulate the breakdown of stored triacylglycerols (TG) and glycogen in storage tissues. In addition, SS interact with the growth and reproductive axes of fish, findings that suggest SS serve to modulate energy partitioning among various growth, development and reproductive processes. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This study quantifies the extension torque contributed by elastic recoil and hydraulic pressure in the chela (tibia-tarsus) and femur-patella joints of scorpions and the patella-tibia and tibi-tarsus joints of sun-spiders. Extension torque was measured as isolated joints were cycled through a natural range of angles and angular velocities by a computer controlled stepper motor. Resilience (efficiency of elastic energy return) of transarticular sclerites in the absence of internal fluid pressure was about 60% in scorpion joints and 80% in sun-spider joints. Elastic torque increased almost linearly with flexion angle in most joints except in the scorpion chela, where elastic torque decreased rapidly as the fully closed joint began to open, increased gradually and then decreased again near the fully open position.

In the substorm event of 24 November 1996, the Interball and IMP 8 satellites were located in the midnight sector at X= -26 and -36 RE, respectively, and observed an increase and a decrease of the lobe magnetic field strength corresponding to the storage and release of the lobe magnetic energy. Both spacecraft observed B2 to decrease initially and then increase in the course of the decrease in |B X|, a feature that was reported previously as a manifestation of the tailward expansion of the current disruption region. The delay of the signatures between the two satellites confirms that the associated current system moved tailward. Motivated by this fortuitous coordination of the satellite observation, the present study revisits a global MHD simulation previously conducted specifically for this substorm event [Raeder et al., 2001]. The most noticeable feature of the modeled tail dynamics is the repeated occurrence of tail current surges, that is, temporal intensifications of the tail current that propagate tailward. The first tail current surge is accompanied by the stretching of the tail magnetic field, which starts in the inner magnetosphere and extends tailward. The associated tailward flow redistributes the plasma pressure in such a way that the tail current is reduced in its intensity in the near-Earth region, while the pressure gradient increases at the propagation front, which intensifies the local current. The last major tail current surge is caused by the near-Earth reconnection. Inside a plasmoid, the pressure gradient current is intensified on the tailward side of the 0-line, and it propagates tailward as the plasmoid grows and is released. For each tail current surge, irrespective of its cause, the intensification of the tail current is followed by the reduction, and its tailward propagation creates the aforementioned phase relationship between BX and BZ. It is probably difficult to determine based on lobe magnetic field observations whether it is caused by the tail stretching or a neutral line motion. The present study not only sheds new light about tail substorm dynamics but also provides a good exercise for evaluating the potential of the modeling effort for substorm study in general.

As a result of agreements reached at Bonn and Marrakech, carbon offsets have taken on much greater importance in meeting Kyoto targets for the first commitment period. In this study, meta-regression analysis is used to examine 981 estimates from 55 studies of the costs of creating carbon offsets using forestry. Baseline estimates of costs of sequestering carbon through forest conservation are US$ 46.62-US$ 260.29/t C ($12.71-$70.99/t CO2). Tree planting and agroforestry activities increase costs by more than 200%. When post-harvest storage of carbon in wood products, or substitution of biomas for fossil fuels in energy production, are taken into account, costs are lowest - some $12.53-$68.44/t C ($3.42-$18.67/t CO2). Average costs are greater, between $116.76 and $1406.60/t C ($31.84-$383.62/t CO2), when appropriate account is taken of the opportunity costs of land. Peer review of the studies increases costs by a factor or 10 or more, depending on the model. The use of marginal cost estimates instead of average cost results in much higher costs for carbon sequestration, in the range of thousands of dollars per t C, although few studies used this method of cost assessment. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to report on a novel phenomenon that occurs when resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (RMGICs) are bonded to moist human dentine. Methods. Dentine surfaces from extracted third molars were abraded with 180-grit SiC paper. Ten teeth were prepared for each of the two RMGICs tested (Fuji II LC, GC Corp. and Photac-Fil Quick, 3M ESPE). RMGIC buildups were made according to the manufacturers' instructions. After storage at 37°C, 100% humidity for 24 h, the bonded specimens were cut occlusogingivally into 0.9×0.9 mm beams. Dentine surfaces bonded with the two RMGICs were examined along the fractured RMGIC/dentine interfaces. Additional beams fractured within the RMGICS and at 3 mm away from the interfaces were used as controls. The fractured beams were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission-environmental SEM (FE-ESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results. SEM and FE-ESEM revealed numerous solid spherical bodies along the RMGIC/dentine interfaces. By contrast, no spherical bodies could be identified within the RMGIC fractured 3 mm distant from the bonded interface. TEM and energy dispersive X-ray analyses performed on carbon-coated ultrathin sections showed that these solid spherical bodies consisted of a thin aluminum and silicon-rich periphery and an amorphous hydrocarbon core within the air voids of the original resin matrix. Conclusion. The spherical bodies probably represent a continuation of GI reaction and poly(HEMA) hydrogel formation that results from water diffusion from the underlying moist dentine. Their existence provides evidence for the permeation of water through RMGIC/dentine interfaces. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Dentine; Interface; Permeability; Resin-modified glass-ionomer cement; Water movement","aluminum; carbon; glass ionomer; hydrocarbon; resin; silicon; article; cementation; controlled study; dentin; field emission scanning electron microscopy; human; humidity; moisture; molar tooth; storage; temperature; transmission electron microscopy; X ray analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043064250

Previous works have shown that both fat and protein are energy resources during prolonged fasting in vertebrates. While many ecological studies on energy costs of reproduction have focused on variations in fat stores, the impact of protein investment on the female has not been thoroughly investigated. Notably, as there is no specialized storage form for proteins, intense catabolism is likely to entail structural (musculature) loss that may compromise maternal physical performance after reproduction. Measurements on captive rainbow boas (Epicrates cenchria maurus) confirm that reproducing females undergo significant protein catabolism (as indicated by elevated plasma uric acid levels) and show considerable musculature loss during gestation (as detected by reduced width of the epaxial muscles). Protein mobilization entailed a significant functional loss that was illustrated by decrements in tests of strength and constriction after parturition. In wild situations, such effects are likely to decrease the snakes' ability to forage and apprehend prey. Hence, the time period needed to recover from reproduction can be extended not only because the female must compensate losses of both fat stores and functional muscle, but also because the ability to do so may be compromised. Performance alteration is likely to be of equal or greater importance than reduced energy stores in the physiological mediation of elevated post-reproduction mortality rates and infrequent reproductive bouts (e.g. biannual or triannual), two common ecological traits of female snakes. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Costs of reproduction; Musculature; Protein catabolism; Snakes; Viviparity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3542995131

The unique and most intriguing feature of this event is a systematic change of the flow direction from earthward to tailward observed by the Geotail satellite at X ∼ -21 RE. Good correlation between Vx and Bx is found for the intervals of both earthward and tailward flows, which suggests that observed variations of the flow velocity were caused by satellite motion relative to the plasma sheet rather than the temporal change of the velocity itself. It is inferred that the earthward and tailward flows lasted at least 9 and 5 min, respectively. The signs of B z and BY variations also changed systematically along with the sign of Vx. These results are consistent with the idea that the observed flow reversal was caused by the earthward movement of a neutral line, which might be formed at a preceding pseudobreakup or even earlier. It is inferred that the associated reconnection did not reach the lobe magnetic field, and that the neutral line is convected toward the Earth along with the background plasma. Interestingly, during the interval of the flow reversal, other satellites observed typical growth-phase features. The geosynchronous magnetic field continued to be stretched in the midnight sector. The Interball and IMP8 satellites observed a continuous increase of the lobe field strength at X= -20 and -34 RE, respectively, in the premidnight sector. It is therefore concluded that the tail current intensification during the growth phase is a global process, whereas the near-Earth reconnection is a local process, which, at its early stage, can proceed independently from the overall storage of the tail magnetic energy.

These decisions should be informed by future land use and long-term stewardship goals. In the United States, the Department of Energy has lands in some 34 states that require cleanup. They are involved in massive remediation and restoration efforts on lands from the Cold War legacy and wish to reduce their overall footprint. Understanding future land use preferences is essential for determining the nature and degree of remediation and restoration. The objective of this study was to examine future land use preferences for the Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory as a function of ethnicity for attendees at the Los Alamos Gun Show in New Mexico (1999), and to determine whether their own activity influences future land use preferences. The highest preferred future land uses for Los Alamos National Laboratory were hiking, camping, National Environmental Research Park, and birdwatching, followed by hunting and fishing. Increased nuclear waste storage and building homes and factories were rated the lowest. Further, hiking and camping were rated higher than at two other DOE sites. There were few ethnic differences, although American Indians rated camping, hiking, building houses, and returning the land to American Indians higher than did others, and Hispanics rated using it for a preserve as a higher preferred land use than all others. The differences, however, were not great. Relative ratings for using the land for hunting and fishing were directly related to individual frequency of hunting and fishing for both whites and Hispanics, indicating that people perceive the importance of land use by how they want to use it.

To simulate the conditions of global warming, we exposed peat monoliths (depth, 0.6 m; surface area, 2.1 m2) from a bog and fen in northern Minnesota, USA, to three infrared (IR) loading (ambient, +45, and +90 W m-2) and three water table (-16, -20, and -29 cm in bog and -1, -10 and -18 cm in fen) treatments, each replicated in three mesocosm plots. Net radiation (Rn) and soil energy fluxes at the top, bottom, and sides of the mesocosms were measured in 1999, 5 years after the treatments had begun. Soil heat flux (G) increased proportionately with IR loading, comprising about 3%-8% of Rn. In the fen, the effect of IR loading on G was modulated by water table depth, whereas in the bog it was not. Energy dissipation from the mesocosms occurred mainly via vertical exchange with air, as well as with deeper soil layers through the bottom of the mesocosms, whereas lateral fluxes were 10-20-fold smaller and independent of IR loading and water table depth. The exchange with deeper soil layers was sensitive to water table depth, in contrast to G, which responded primarily to IR loading. The qualitative responses in the bog and fen were similar, but the fen displayed wider seasonal variation and greater extremes in soil energy fluxes. The differences of G in the bog and fen are attributed to differences in the reflectance in the long waveband as a function of vegetation type, whereas the differences in soil heat storage may also depend on different soil properties and different water table depth at comparable treatments. These data suggest that the ecosystem-dependent controls over soil energy fluxes may provide an important constraint on biotic response to climate change.","Heat flux; Infrared loading; Mesocosm; Net radiation; Soil energy balance; Wetland","climate change; heat flux; infrared radiation; mesocosm; net radiation; peatland; radiative forcing; Minnesota; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242693660

This breast cancer-specific activation of FAS-dependent lipogenesis, an anabolic-energy-storage pathway of minor importance in normal cells, would render breast cancer cells more vulnerable to anti-metabolite interventions with FAS as therapeutic target. Not surprisingly, pharmacological inhibitors of FAS have been reported to produce both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in human breast cancer cells, as well as to suppress DNA replication. However, the signal transduction pathway(s) that link FAS hyperactivity and breast cancer cell growth has been unresolved. Here, we have attempted to provide a systematic approach to assess the role of FAS signaling on the survival and proliferation of human breast cancer cells. First, we assessed the level of FAS protein in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-435, ZR-75B, T47-D, BT-474, and SK-Br3). FAS expression was graded from ++++ (overexpression) in SK-Br3 cells to + (very low expression) in MDA-MB-231 cells. No correlation was noted between FAS overexpression and estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) status, whereas a positive correlation was found between high levels of FAS expression and the amplification and/or overexpression of HER-2/neu oncogene. Because metabolic adaptation of breast cancer cells to the ambient fatty acid concentration may be relevant to the goal of utilizing FAS inhibition as a chemotherapeutic target, we evaluated the effect of exogenous dietary fatty acids on the cytotoxicity resulting from the inhibition of FAS activity. Pharmacological inhibition of FAS activity by the natural antibiotic cerulenin [(2S,3R)-2,3-epoxy-4-oxo-7E,10E-dodecadienamide] resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxicity which positively paralleled the endogenous level of FAS. Supraphysiological levels of exogenous oleic acid (OA), a omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid synthesized from a primary-end product of FAS palmitate, significantly diminished cell toxicity caused by cerulenin. Indeed, OA exposure significantly reduced FAS activity and expression by 55% in FAS-overexpressing SK-Br3 cells. omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), however, were unable to rescue breast cancer cells from cerulenin-induced cytotoxicity. Pharmacological blockade of FAS activity in FAS-overexpressing SK-Br3 cells resulted in apoptosis as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for histone-associated DNA fragments, and confirmed by TUNEL DNA-end labeling experiments. We further characterized signaling molecules that participate in the cellular events that follow inhibition of FAS activity and precede apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In SK-Br3 cells, cerulenin-induced inhibition of FAS activity resulted in down-regulation of p53, and up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi) p21WAF1/CIP1. Treatment with cerulenin or a novel small-molecule inhibitor of FAS C75 resulted in a dramatic accumulation of CDKi p27KIP1, which was accompanied by a noteworthy translocation of p27KIP1 from cytosol to cell nuclei. Strikingly, FAS inhibition also caused a significant activation of the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) cell survival pathway. Interestingly, we demonstrated that inhibition of FAS activity increased the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of BRCA1, a breast cancer tumor suppressor protein, as well as it induced a nuclear translocalization of the anti-apoptotic nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). In conclusion, here we demonstrate that: a) breast cancer cells retain dependence on endogenous fatty acid synthesis and sensitivity to FAS inhibition in the presence of supraphysiological levels of dietary fatty acids, supporting the notion that FAS inhibition may be useful in treFAS inhibition may be useful in treating breast cancer in vivo; b) endogenous fatty acid synthesis is functional in breast cancer cells and is vital since its pharmacological inhibition is cytotoxic by promoting apoptosis, and c) specific blockade of FAS activity induces the accumulation, activation, and/or cellular relocalization of multiple and diverse pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, suggesting that p53-p21WAF1/CIP1, ERK1/2 MAPK, p27KIP1, BRCA1, and NF-kappaB play a novel role in the breast cancer cell response to a metabolic stress after perturbation of FAS-dependent de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.",,"BRCA1 protein; CDKN1A protein, human; cell cycle protein; cerulenin; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cycline; DNA fragment; fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein p53; tumor suppressor protein; active transport; article; biosynthesis; breast tumor; cell survival; dose response; fluorescence microscopy; human; IC 50; immunoblotting; metabolism; nick end labeling; pathology; signal transduction; time; tumor cell line; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; BRCA1 Protein; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Cerulenin; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27; Cyclins; DNA Fragmentation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fatty Acid Synthetase Complex; Fatty Acids; Humans; Immunoblotting; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; NF-kappa B; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142720785

The food-freezing process is a multi-medium, multi-phase, and transient heat-exchange phenomenon in connection with the cooling flow around the food items. The developed numerical model couples the energy equation with the Navier-Stokes equations outside the food items to simulate the velocity distribution around the food items and the heat flux across the food surfaces. The conjugate heat-transfer methodology and enthalpy method was used to solve the energy equation across the fluid-solid interface into the food item. The heat convection in the fluid and conduction in the foods are implicitly coupled to predict the heat-transfer rate and the enthalpy change during its freezing process. The conjugate heat-transfer model presented here is applicable to perform various heat-transfer calculations involved in the design of storage and refrigeration equipment and to estimate the process time required for freezing of foods. The article presents the mathematical model used, the outline of the numerical scheme, and the results of computations. The model-predicted results are compared with the experimental data available in the literature.

The hydrogen economy concept is interesting and certainly a possibility in the long-term as the fossil fuel age is expected to peak in 50-100 years, making fossil fuels increasingly expensive. However, for the short-term this idea must overcome tremendous obstacles and challenges due to the high cost of H2 production from renewables, and more importantly, the need to develop the required H2 infrastructure.

While the possibility of exposure leading to damages to public health, workers or the environment may be small, if there is to be widespread adoption of sequestration, then a regulatory system will need to evolve to manage the reservoirs. To better understand the drivers of a future regulatory system, the historical evolution of comparable regulatory regimes provides a useful guide when viewed through the lens of public goods problems. Other long-term storage problems that have at least some of the characteristics of carbon storage are evaluated according to the nature of risk, the credibility of the solutions, the regulatory environment and the potential to either borrow from or influence other policy problems across geographic or issue boundaries.

The design objectives include the obvious requirement to avoid large sudden releases and the more challenging task of keeping long-term leak rates to de minimis levels. Long-term retention requirements are a function of both the atmospheric stabilization target for greenhouse gases and the degree of reliance on CO2 capture and storage as a mitigation measure. A robust strategy will employ the CO2 capture and storage method as a component of a portfolio of programs that emphasize energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. To preserve options to stabilize greenhouse gases at prudent levels, it appears we will need to rely extensively on all three components of this portfolio.

Both the quantity and the quality of soil C inputs influence C storage and the potential for C sequestration. Changes in tillage intensity and crop rotations can also affect C sequestration by changing the soil physical and biological conditions and by changing the amounts and types of organic inputs to the soil. Analyses of changes in soil C and N balances are being supplemented with studies of the management practices needed to manage soil carbon and the implications for fossil-fuel use, emission of other greenhouse gases (such as N2O and CH4), and impacts on agricultural productivity.

Glycogenin is the core protein on which glycogen molecules are synthesized. There is one molecule of glycogenin per molecule of glycogen in skeletal muscle; therefore, glycogen storage is limited by the amount of glycogenin present in muscle. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of feeding flaxseed, a source of PUFA, and administering a growth promoter on steady-state LPL and glycogenin mRNA content of muscle in finishing cattle. Sixteen crossbred steers (initial BW = 397 kg), given ad libitum access to a 92% concentrate diet for 28 d, were used in a four-treatment, 2 x 2 factorial experiment, with flaxseed supplementation (0 or 5% of dietary DM) and implanting (not implanted or implanted with Revalor-S) as the main effects. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the LM at 0, 14, and 28 d, and used to quantify LPL and glycogenin mRNA concentrations using real-time quantitative PCR. Implanting with Revalor-S did not affect LPL (P = 0.13) or glycogenin (P = 0.98) mRNA concentrations. A day x flaxseed interaction (P < 0.001) was observed for both LPL and glycogenin mRNA concentrations. No differences (P > 0.10) were observed between 0 and 5% flaxseed supplemented steers; however, at 28 d, nonflaxseed-fed steers had 4.1- and 5.7-fold increases (P < 0.001) over flaxseed steers for LPL and glycogenin mRNA concentrations, respectively. To further evaluate the effects of α-linolenic acid (α-LA) on LPL and glycogenin mRNA concentrations, muscle satellite cells were isolated from five finishing steers, and different α-LA concentrations were applied in culture. The RNA was isolated from the bovine satellite cells. Addition of α-LA numerically increased (P = 0.16) the LPL mRNA concentration 48% at 1 μM α-LA compared with the control. The expression of glycogenin was increased (P < 0.05) 50% at 1 μM α-LA compared with the control. These results suggest that flaxseed supplementation to finishing steers for 28 d decreased gene expression of both LPL and glycogenin compared with not feeding flaxseed.

Receptors sensed the environment, memory traces were laid, and adaptive responses were made. Environmental stress, at times as dramatic as the collision of an asteroid, resulted in extinctions that favored small predators with dorsal nerve cords and cranially positioned brains. Myelination, and later thermoregulation, led to increasingly efficient neural processing. As somatosensory, visual, and auditory input increased, a neocortex developed containing both sensory and motor neural maps. Hominids, with their free hands, pushed cortical development further and began to make simple stone tools. Tools and increasing cognition allowed procurement of a richer diet that led to a smaller gut, thus freeing more energy for brain expansion. Multimodal association areas, initially developed for processing incoming sensory information, blossomed and began to provide the organism with an awareness of self and environment. Advancements in memory storage and retrieval gave the organism a sense of continuity through time. This developing consciousness eventually left visible traces, which today are dramatically evident on cave walls in France and Spain. We will take this journey from the single cell to human consciousness.","Brain; Consciousness; Evolution; Hominidae","adaptation; auditory system; awareness; behavior; brain development; brain function; cell maturation; consciousness; dorsal root; energy; environmental factor; evolution; France; hominid; human; information processing; information retrieval; memory consolidation; motoneuron; myelination; neocortex; nutrient; predator; priority journal; recall; receptor sensitivity; review; sensory nerve cell; somatosensory system; Spain; species extinction; stress; thermoregulation; visual system",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542552009

Static mechanical tests including tensile and bending tests were performed. Temperature scans in the range of- 110 to +100°C was also conducted. Results indicated improvements in the mechanical properties due to the compatibilizer addition. Storage modulus values were higher in the case of coupled composites especially at 50% fiber loading. Glass transition was hard to detect in all composite systems while increasing fiber content slightly shifted alpha transition to higher temperatures. MAPE had negligible effects on the main transitions but the effect of fiber content on the intensity and temperature of alpha transition seemed to be proportional to the fiber content. Mechanical loss factor spectra showed that at 50% fiber content, the compatibilizer caused a reduction in tanδ values indicating less energy loss when the compatibilizer was present.","Compatibilizer; Composites; Dynamic Mechanical Analysis; High-density Polypropylene; Wood flour","Automotive industry; Bending (deformation); Dynamic mechanical analysis; Natural fibers; Polyethylenes; Tensile testing; Thermal effects; Thermoplastics; Alpha transition temperature; Compatibilizers; High-density polypropylene; Wood-flour; Composite materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542494052

The Priestley-Taylor and deBruin-Keijman methods compared best with the energy-budget values; mean differences were less than 0.1 mm d-1, and standard deviations were less than 0.3 mm d-1. Both methods require measurement of air temperature, net radiation, and heat storage in the wetland water. The Penman, Jensen-Haise, and Brutsaert-Stricker methods provided the next-best values for evapotranspiration relative to the energy-budget method. The mass-transfer, deBruin, and Stephens-Stewart methods provided the worst comparisons; the mass-transfer and deBruin comparisons with energy-budget values indicated a large standard deviation, and the deBruin and Stephens-Stewart comparisons indicated a large bias. The Jensen-Haise method proved to be cost effective, providing relatively accurate comparisons with the energy-budget method (mean difference = 0.44 mm d-1, standard deviation = 0.42 mm d -1) and requiring only measurements of air temperature and solar radiation. The Mather (Thornthwaite) method is the simplest, requiring only measurement of air temperature, and it provided values that compared relatively well with energy-budget values (mean difference = 0.47 mm d-1, standard deviation = 0.56 mm d-1). Modifications were made to several of the methods to make them more suitable for use in prairie wetlands. The modified Makkink, Jensen-Haise, and Stephens-Stewart methods all provided results that were nearly as close to energy-budget values as were the Priestley-Taylor and deBruin-Keijman methods, and all three of these modified methods only require measurements of air temperature and solar radiation. The modified Hamon method provided values that were within 20 percent of energy-budget values during 95 percent of the comparison periods, and it only requires measurement of air temperature.

Thus, it is difficult to understand the physiology of energy balance without understanding its link to reproductive success. The metabolic sensory stimuli, hormonal mediators and modulators, and central neuropeptides that control reproduction also influence energy balance. In general, those that increase ingestive behavior inhibit reproductive processes, with a few exceptions. Reproductive processes, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) system and the mechanisms that control sex behavior are most proximally sensitive to the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels. The role of hormones, such as insulin and leptin, are not understood, but there are two possible ways they might control food intake and reproduction. They either mediate the effects of energy metabolism on reproduction or they modulate the availability of metabolic fuels in the brain or periphery. This review examines the neural pathways from fuel detectors to the central effector system emphasizing the following points: first, metabolic stimuli can directly influence the effector systems independently from the hormones that bind to these central effector systems. For example, in some cases, excess energy storage in adipose tissue causes deficits in the pool of oxidizable fuels available for the reproductive system. Thus, in such cases, reproduction is inhibited despite a high body fat content and high plasma concentrations of hormones that are thought to stimulate reproductive processes. The deficit in fuels creates a primary sensory stimulus that is inhibitory to the reproductive system, despite high concentrations of hormones, such as insulin and leptin. Second, hormones might influence the central effector systems [including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion and sex behavior] indirectly by modulating the metabolic stimulus. Third, the critical neural circuitry involves extrahypothalamic sites, such as the caudal brain stem, and projections from the brain stem to the forebrain. Catecholamines, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are probably involved. Fourth, the metabolic stimuli and chemical messengers affect the motivation to engage in ingestive and sex behaviors instead of, or in addition to, affecting the ability to perform these behaviors. Finally, it is important to study these metabolic events and chemical messengers in a wider variety of species under natural or seminatural circumstances. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This system is based on an ""edge-on"" microchannel plate (MCP) detector and utilizes scanning slit imaging configuration. The detector is capable of photon counting, direct conversion, high spatial resolution, controllable physical charge amplification, quantum limited and scatter free operation. The detector provides a 60 mm wide field of view (FOV) and its count rate is 200 kHz for the entire FOV. The count rate of the current system is limited by the position encoding electronics, which has a single input for all events from the entire detector, and incorporates a single channel ADC with 1 μs conversion time. It is shown that the count rate can potentially be improved to clinically acceptable levels using multichannel application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) electronics and multi-slit image acquisition geometry. For a typical acquisition time used in this study, the image noise was measured to be less than the typically acceptable noise level for medical x-ray imaging. It is anticipated that the noise level will be also low after the implementation of the ASIC electronics. The quantum efficiency of the detector was measured to be 40%-56% for an energy range of 50-90 kVp for MCPs used in this study and can be improved to > 80% using MCPs with the optimized parameters. Images of resolution and anthropomorphic phantoms were acquired at an x-ray tube voltage of 50 kVp. The value of contrast transfer function for the detector was measured to be 0.5 at a spatial frequency of 5 lp/mm. The intrinsic spatial resolution of the system is 28/μm FWHM and was limited by the accuracy of the time-to-digital conversion of the position encoding electronics. Given the advantages of the edge-on MCP detector such as direct conversion and physical charge amplification, it can potentially be applied to mammography and chest radiography. © 2004 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","ASIC; Mammography; Microchannel plate; Photon counting; Scanning-slit; X-ray imaging","Analog to digital conversion; Application specific integrated circuits; Encoding (symbols); Image enhancement; Image resolution; Image storage tubes; Imaging systems; Mammography; Medical imaging; Microchannels; Photons; Scanning; Signal encoding; X ray radiography; X ray tubes; Anthropomorphic phantoms; Contrast transfer function; Micro channel plate; Microchannel plate detector; Multi-channel application; Photon counting; Time to digital conversion; Xray imaging; X ray detectors; accuracy; article; electronics; imaging system; mammography; phantom; priority journal; quantum mechanics; radiation detector; radiation measurement; thorax radiography; X ray; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442650302

In order for that to happen, we must be able to produce hydrogen in an environmentally responsible and cost-effective way. The co-utilization of hydrogen and resources like coal and biomass for hydrogen production may provide a short-term transition to the long-term prospects of solar and biomass for cleaner and more efficient fuel mixtures to meet future energy needs. This article describes the present status of the conventional hydrogen production technologies and some of recent developments in the production of hydrogen using solar energy resources. We outline the technological status for commercial and near-commercial technologies using both fossil-based and renewable energy sources such as electrolysis using PV and solar thermal power. We found that conversion of fossil fuels and electrolysis of water using solar conversion technologies are some of the most important methods of H2 production. An economic analysis for hydrogen production costs is presented comparing steam reformation, partial oxidation, coal gasification, and electrolysis via photovoltaics and solar thermal power. Although fossil fuels are currently the cheapest and most widely used sources of hydrogen production, we argue from an economic standpoint that renewable sources of hydrogen, such as biomass and solar, are the most promising options for the future. Further, solar hydrogen represents a storable fuel that is produced from this nonstorable and intermittent source of energy.","Coal gasification; Economic analysis; Hydrogen production; Partial oxidation; Steam reformation; Thermal decomposition","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Electrolysis; Fuel storage; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Photovoltaic effects; Pollution; Pyrolysis; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Economic analysis; Hydrogen production; Partial oxidation; Steam reformation; Fuel consumption",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442616238

Intracellular Ca(2+) plays a key regulatory role in adipocyte lipid metabolism and triacylglycerol storage; increased intracellular Ca(2+) results in the stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis and the suppression of lipolysis, which results in increased lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, the increased calcitriol produced in response to low-calcium diets stimulates adipocyte Ca(2+) influx and, consequently, promotes adiposity, whereas higher-calcium diets inhibit lipogenesis, inhibit diet-induced obesity in mice, and promote lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and thermogenesis. Notably, dairy sources of calcium markedly attenuate weight and fat gain and accelerate fat loss to a greater degree than do supplemental sources of calcium. This augmented effect of dairy products relative to supplemental calcium is likely due to additional bioactive compounds, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the rich concentration of branched-chain amino acids in whey, which act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity. These concepts are confirmed by epidemiologic data and recent clinical trials, which indicate that diets that include > or =3 daily servings of dairy products result in significant reductions in adipose tissue mass in obese humans in the absence of caloric restriction and markedly accelerate weight and body fat loss secondary to caloric restriction compared with diets low in dairy products. These data indicate an important role for dairy products in both the prevention and treatment of obesity.",,"calcitriol; calcium; signal peptide; adipose tissue; animal; calcium intake; dairy product; drug effect; energy metabolism; human; lipid metabolism; metabolism; obesity; physiology; review; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Calcitriol; Calcium; Calcium, Dietary; Dairy Products; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lipid Metabolism; Obesity; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442541160

Despite this expectation, early progress was largely limited to adipose tissue's role in metabolism and storage of fatty acids, its development, and its response to endocrine and neural cues. However, efforts of the last decade have identified several molecules that are secreted from adipocytes, apparently for the purpose of signaling to other tissues. Cloning of the mouse obesity gene in 1994 is perhaps the most famous impetus for recognition that adipocytes are active in the regulation of multiple body functions. The product of this gene, leptin, has since been found to inhibit feeding, enhance energy expenditure, and stimulate gonadotropes. Evidence for the roles of other adipocyte-derived signals is being generated. Resistin is a protein that can cause whole-body insulin resistance. Its expression is correlated with body fatness and is inhibited by thiazolidinediones, perhaps mediating the association of type 2 diabetes with obesity, and the effectiveness of these drugs. Resistin and a related molecule, RELMα, can also inhibit differentiation of preadipocytes. Adiponectin/Acrp30 secretion from adipocytes is diminished in obese states. This protein can enhance use of fatty acids in lean tissues, inhibit glucose production by liver, and consequently decrease both blood glucose and BW. Adiponectin may also be responsible for the effectiveness of thiazolidinediones, given that these drugs promote adiponectin secretion. Secretion of complement proteins has been observed in adipocytes, and these interact to generate a signal called acylation-stimulating protein, which can promote triacylglycerol synthesis. These signals seem to be largely unique to adipocytes. Other signals are derived from adipose tissue, and it is unlikely that all the adipocyte's endocrine signals have been identified. Certainly, there is much to learn about how these signals function; however, it is clear that these biomedical research discoveries comprise a useful model for our study of growth and development in livestock. ©2004 American Society of Animal Science.

The alternative aspects considered here are the use of specific fats to alter the fatty acid profile of adipose tissue toward creation of value-added products and the potential for individual fatty acids to alter gene expression and control adipose tissue development. Emphasis is placed on the omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish oil, and on CLA. The most common association of fatty acids with adipose tissue is related to their storage as triglycerides in mature adipocytes and the consequences of excess accumulation in obesity. Fatty acids and their derivatives also can have hormone-like effects and have been be shown to regulate gene expression in preadipocytes, which ultimately effects their proliferation and differentiation. Long-chain, saturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to regulate transcription factors, such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, and other adipose-specific genes, very early in adipocyte development. These effects have the potential to affect fat cell number at maturity. Specifically, there is evidence that the fatty acids in fish oil, such as docosahexaenoic and eicosopentaenoic acids, and fatty acids in the CLA series, decrease preadipocyte proliferation in cell lines and reduce adiposity in rodents. There is little direct evidence of the ability of fatty acids to manipulate adipocyte development in non-rodent species. The genetic, nutritional, and pharmacological manipulation of adipose tissue in meat animals has long been of interest to animal scientists. An understanding of the ability of fatty acids to regulate factors such as adipocyte size and number, particularly in meat animals, would be of great interest. The evidence for regulatory roles of fatty acids in development from rodent and in vitro studies and their potential application to meat animals are reviewed. ©2004 American Society of Animal Science.

Responding to anecdotal evidence that corn residues are declining in cropland, we remeasured waste corn post-harvest in the Central Platte River Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska during 1997 and 1998 to compare with 1978. Post-harvest waste corn averaged 2.6% and 1.8% of yield in 1997 and 1998, respectively. After accounting for a 20% increase in yield, waste corn in 1997 and 1998 was reduced 24% and 47% from 1978. We also evaluated use of soybeans by spring-staging sandhill cranes (Crus canadensis) and waterfowl during spring 1998 and 1999. Despite being widely available in the CPRV, soybeans did not occur in esophageal contents of sandhill cranes (n=174), northern pintails (Anas acuta, n=139), greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons, n=198), or lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens, n=208) collected with food in their esophagi. Lack of soybean consumption by cranes and waterfowl in Nebraska in early spring builds upon previously published findings, suggesting that soybeans are poorly suited for meeting nutrient needs of wildlife requiring a high-energy diet. Given evidence that high-energy food and numerous populations of seed-eating species found on farmland are declining, and the enormous potential risk to game and nongame wildlife populations if high-energy foods were to become scarce, a comprehensive research effort to study the problem appears warranted. Provisions under the Conservation Security subtitle of The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 offer a potential mechanism to encourage producers to manage cropland in ways that would replace part of the high-energy foods that have been lost to increasing efficiency of production agriculture.","Corn; Cropland; Farm bill; Fat storage; Genetically modified crops; Grus canadensis; Harvest efficiency; Resident wildlife; Sandhill crane; Soybeans; Waterfowl; Weed seeds","genetically modified organism; harvesting; soybean; wildlife management; Nebraska; North America; Platte River; United States; Anas; Anas acuta; Anas acuta; Anatidae; Anser; Anser albifrons; Anser albifrons; Anser sp.; Chen; Chen caerulescens; Chen caerulescens; Crus canadensis; Glycine max; Gruidae; Grus canadensis; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142826756

Onedimensionally arranged C60 molecules coalesce gradually within the nanotube and change the structure to C 60 dimers, trimers, tetramers, and so on as intermediates. In addition to these interesting structural transformations visualized in the nanotube space, the nanotube itself is very stable, and this structural stability is very important when using the interior of the nanotube as the reaction field or the space for molecular storage. In terms of optical absorption, the lowest energy absorption band for DWNTs, ∼0.65 eV, shows broadened and downshifted features as compared with that of SWNTs We expect that this opticalabsorption feature will lead to the use of DWNTs in absorbing devices for optical-fiber communications. The Raman experiments give new information about the frequency of the C-C stretching-mode vibration for nanotubes with diameters of less than ∼1 nm, which shows a decrease in vibration frequency with decreasing tube diameter. This diameter dependence can be explained by an admixture of sp3 character in the C-C interaction.Therefore, the electronic and mechanical properties of nanotubes with diameters of &lt;1 nm are expected to be different from nanotubes of the ∼1-nm-diameter class, and we anticipate that new phenomena will occur in small-diameter tubes.","Double-walled carbon nanotubes; Fullerenes; Optical absorption; Peapods; Raman scattering; Transmission electron microscopy","Chemical bonds; Coalescence; Dimers; Frequencies; Fullerenes; Light absorption; Optical communication; Raman scattering; Stability; Transmission electron microscopy; Acid purification; Double-walled carbon nanotubes; Energy gain; Single-walled carbon nanotubes; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142725969

The large current carrying capacity and low thermal conductivity of the HTSs allows relatively short lengths to carry large currents to low-temperature devices without introducing heat to the device. Such current leads can dramatically reduce the refrigeration requirements for devices such as SMES. The HTSs make a relatively sharp transition to a highly resistive state when the critical current density is exceeded, and this effect has suggested their use for resistive fault current limiters. The bulk HTSs may also take the form of large single-grained superconductors within which circulating currents may flow at large current density without loss. They are capable of developing magnetizations, similar to that of permanent magnets, but with much larger magnetic fields. In this case, they may be used as field-trapping components. Applications in this case include brushless synchronous motors, laboratory magnets, magnetic separation, and magnetron sputtering. The bulk HTSs may also be used as diamagnetic objects in magnetic circuits to provide new types of power devices. One application that uses this effect is an inductive fault current limiters, in which the HTS shields an iron core in an inductive circuit until some current level is exceeded. This transition increases the component from low impedance to high impedance. The diamagnetic property may also be used to create low-loss magnetic bearings for use in efficient energy-storage fly-wheel devices or sensitive instrumentation. The combination of diamagnetic shielding and field trapping has suggested their use in motor designs analogous to hysteresis motors. Laboratory prototypes for all of these devices have been constructed and tested, and in some cases the devices have been field tested in actual power systems. Improvements in HTS properties, such as flux pinning, me chanical strength, and the ability to grow large grains, have greatly improved the economics of applications that use bulk HTS. © 2004 IEEE.","Current leads; Fault-current limiters (FCLs); Fly-wheel energy storage; High-temperature superconductors; Magnetic levitation; Magnetic separation; Rare-earth compounds; Sputtering; Superconducting composites; Superconducting devices","Composite materials; Flywheels; Limiters; Magnetic separation; Magnets; Rare earth compounds; Refrigeration; Rotating machinery; Sputtering; Superconducting devices; Thermal conductivity; Yttrium compounds; Current leads; Fault-current limiters (FCL); Flywheel energy storage; Magnetic leviation; Superconducting composites; Superconducting rotating machines; Trapped-field magnets; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344443437

Superconducting power components can also contribute to improved power quality and increased system reliability. This paper addresses historical developments and technology status of four superconducting power applications: cables, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), fault-current limiters, and transformers. Today, SMES is the only fully functional superconducting system and it has seen only limited use at grid power levels. A few model or demonstration units exist for each of the other three applications. Superconductivity faces several hurdles on the path to widespread use. Perhaps the most important is the need for operating voltages of 100 kV or more. Though progress in this and other areas has been rapid, considerable development is needed before superconducting devices perform reliably in the utility environment. As a result, today, most initial installations are aimed at niche applications and will be installed where space is limited, where power demands are increasing over existing corridors, and/or where initial development costs can be offset by enhanced power grid performance. © 2004 IEEE.","Cryogenics; Electric power; Fault-current limiters (FCLs); High-temperature superconductivity (HTS); Power cables; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Superconductivity; Transformers","Cryogenics; Electric cables; Electric fault currents; Electric power systems; Electric transformers; High temperature superconductors; Limiters; Thermodynamic properties; Electric power; Fault-current limiters (FCL); High-temperature superconductivity (HTS); Power cables; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Transformers; Superconductivity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21244452581

The leg for this quadruped was first designed at Ohio State University (OSU). A second-generation leg, with the same functional geometry, has been designed and tested at Stanford University. The objective of these tests was to determine that the single leg would be capable of prolonged operation at a velocity of 5 m/s, and that the control system, developed in simulation, would function under real-world conditions. The mechanical design of the quadruped is based on properties of biological quadruped animal legs. Important biomimetic design characteristics include minimal impact loss, elastic energy storage, and low inertia. The cable linkage, which works against a large spring to flex the knee, is uncoupled from the front-to-back hip actuator through a parallelogram-like cable mechanism. The controller developed for the leg is a direct adaptive fuzzy controller. The direct adaptive approach does not require system identification and can use heuristics to successfully control a complex system. With this controller, a single 2DOF leg constrained in yaw, pitch, roll and transverse translation can be successfully controlled. This controller was executed once each cycle at the top-of-flight. Parameters set by the controller were passed to PD controllers at each of the 2 joints: the hip and cable-actuated knee. The control of this leg required only 7 × 5 × 3 = 105 rules, each with a corresponding output for thigh and knee angle. This controller was implemented on an embedded processor attached to the leg. The leg reached a speed of 3 m/s. Modifications to the leg will increase this speed. The controller successfully adapted to the leg.","Fuzzy logic; Gate type selection","Actuators; Adaptive control systems; Computer simulation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Elastic waves; Embedded systems; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy sets; Mechanical engineering; Biomimetic design characteristics; Elastic energy storage; Fuzzy logic; Gate type selection; Leg system; Biped locomotion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20144379653

Options for waste management include disposal in repositories, recycling, or clearance from regulatory control, following a reasonable cooling period. This paper concerns the feasibility of recycling the heavy-ion-beam targets, in particular the hohlraum wall materials that include, for example, Au/Gd, Au, W, Pb, Hg, Ta, Pb/Ta/Cs, Hg/W/Cs, Pb/Hf, Hf, solid Kr, and solid Xe. The choice between target material disposal and recycling depends on the amount of waste generated relative to the nuclear island, the strategy to solve the recycling problem, and the impact of the additional cost and complexity of the recycling process on the overall machine. A detailed flow diagram for the elements of the recycling process was developed to analyze two extreme activation cases: (a) one-shot use and then disposal in a repository and (b) recycling continuously during plant life without removal of transmutation products. Metrics for comparing the two scenarios included waste level, dose to re cycling equipment, additional cost, and design complexity. Comparing the two approaches indicated a preference for the one-shot scenario as it generates 1 m3/yr of extremely low-level waste (Class A) and offers attractive design and economics features. Recycling reduces the target waste stream by a factor of 10 or more but introduces additional issues. It may produce high-level waste, requires remote handling, adds radioactive storage facilities, and increases the cost and complexity of the plant. The inventory analysis indicated that the heavy-ion-beam (HIB) target materials represent a very small waste stream compared to that of the nuclear island (&lt;1% of the total waste). This means recycling is not a ""must"" requirement for IFE-HIB power plants unless the target materials have cost and/or resource problems (e.g., Au and Gd). In this case, the additional cost and complexity of the recycling process should be factored into the economics of IFE power plants.","Inertial fusion; Recycling; Target materials","Cooling; Costs; Deuterium; Heavy ions; Industrial economics; Inventory control; Ion beams; Radioactive materials; Tritium; Waste disposal; Waste management; X rays; Inertial fusion; Inertial fusion energy (IFE); Target materials; Transmutation products; Recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19744381089

Visceral fat, in fact, may act as an endocrine organ, synthesizing and releasing atherogenic inflammatory cytokines, whose circulating levels depend on the individual's nutritional state, and the extent and anatomical location of fat stores. Unsuspected viral infections might also be involved in enhancing autocrine/paracrine mechanisms of cytokine release from omental fat. Elevated levels of blood cytokines may interact with the neuroendocrine system, autonomic nerves and peripheral lymphatic organs. This may lead to local inflammatory reactions in many body compartments, in particular in the heart tissue, possibly affecting the process of circulatory recovery in obese subjects, and predisposing these patients to a greater risk of myocardial inflammatory disease than individuals with normal body mass index. Circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines might be considered to determine risk categories for development of cardiovascular complications in obese subjects. In addition, their reduction with pharmacological antagonists might prevent and/or control acute cardiovascular events and increase energy expenditure in obese patients, especially after surgical treatment, through reduction of cytokine inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. © 2004, Editrice Kurtis.","Cytokines; Inflammation; Neuroendocrine system; Obesity; Visceral fat","dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 6; leptin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha; atherosclerosis; body fat; body mass; coronary artery disease; cytokine release; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; lipid storage; neuroendocrinology; obesity; protein blood level; review; risk factor; virus infection",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942520404

The resulting WPI-coated LDPE films showed good appearance, flexibility and adhesion between the coating and the base film, when an appropriate amount of plasticizer was added to the coating formulations. WPI-coated LDPE films showed significant decrease in oxygen permeability (OP) at low to intermediate relative humidity, with an Arrhenius behaviour and an activation energy of 50.26 kJ/mol. The OP of the coated films increased significantly with increasing relative humidity, showing an exponential function. Although the coated films showed a tendency to have less oxygen barrier and more glossy surfaces with increasing plasticizer content, differences in the OP and gloss values were not significant. Haze index and colour of the coated films were also little influenced by WPI coating and plasticizer content. The results suggest that whey protein isolate coating could work successfully as an oxygen barrier and have potential for replacing synthetic plastic oxygen-barrier layers in many laminated food packaging structures.

The simulated longitudinal phase space of the beam reveals a well-defined separatrix in the phase space between linac microbunches, with particles executing unbounded motion outside of the separatrix. We show that the longitudinal phase space of the beam was near steady state during the PSR experiments, such that the separatrix persisted for long periods of time.

To observe H, ATHENA uses coincident annihilation detection and ATRAP uses field ionization followed by p storage. Advantages of ATRAP's field ionization method include the complete absence of any background events, and the first way to measure which H states are produced. ATRAP enhances the H production rate by driving many cycles of e+ cooling in the nested trap, with more H counted in an hour than the sum of all the other antimatter atoms ever reported. The number of H counted per incident high energy p is also higher than ever observed. The first measured distribution of H states is made using a pre-ionizing electric field between separated production and detection regions. The high rate and the high Rydberg states suggest that the H is formed via three-body recombination, as expected. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that reduced EE in the premenarcheal period in girls constitutes a risk factor for an increase in relative weight [body mass index (BMI) z score] and percentage of body fat (%BF) during adolescence. Design: We measured EE at study entry in 196 premenarcheal nonobese girls. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by indirect calorimetry. Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured by the doubly labeled water method. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) was calculated from RMR and TEE. After the baseline study, girls were followed annually until 4 y after menarche (x-± SD: 7.1 ± 2.6 y). At each visit, height, weight, and %BF by bioelectrical impedance were measured. Girls also completed annual food-frequency and activity questionnaires. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to evaluate the longitudinal relation between BMI z score and %BF and measures of baseline EE. Results: We found no significant relation in change in %BF with RMR, AEE, or TEE. We observed a small positive relation between BMI z score and AEE and TEE (P &lt; 0.05) but no significant relation with RMR. When we stratified by parental overweight, the findings were unchanged for RMR. TEE and AEE were positively related to BMI z score in girls of overweight parents. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that EE in the premenarcheal period is not a risk factor for increases in %BF or BMI z score in girls during adolescence. © 2004 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.","Adolescence; Energy expenditure; Energy metabolism; Obesity","adolescent; article; basal metabolic rate; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; calculation; calorimetry; controlled study; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; female; food intake; human; lipid storage; menarche; metabolic rate; normal human; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; scoring system; weight gain; adipose tissue; body composition; child; diet; energy metabolism; impedance; longitudinal study; metabolism; obesity; Adipose Tissue; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Child; Diet; Electric Impedance; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544376717

Nicotine (NIC) administration produces similar effects in rats. While changes in food intake are thought to account for some of the body weight changes, few reports have investigated how NIC affects whole-body metabolism. In the present study, measures of respiratory quotient (RQ) and energy expenditure (EE) were used to investigate metabolic changes that may contribute to NIC's effects on body weight. Female rats (n=46) were implanted for 14 days with subcutaneous Alzet minipumps containing NIC (6 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle. One-hour metabolic test sessions occurred four times: 2 and 12 days after pump implant and 2 and 8 days after pump removal. NIC initially suppressed body weight gain, followed by steady recovery that was briefly exaggerated after withdrawing NIC. Daily food intake was acutely suppressed by NIC and acutely potentiated after NIC cessation. RQ, but not EE, was suppressed by NIC 2 days after pump implant indicating increased fat utilization. Conversely, RQ was increased 2 days after pump removal signaling increased fat storage. These findings indicate that acute changes in whole-body metabolism may contribute to the weight modulating effects of NIC. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Because bone is a composite material, its mechanical properties are dependent on the structure and composition at a variety of dimensional scales. At the ultrastructural level, crystal structure and protein secondary structure distort as the tissue is loaded. These structural changes are followed as perturbations to tissue spectra. We load murine femora in a custom-made mechanical tester that fits on the stage of a Raman microprobe and can accept hydrated tissue specimens. As the specimen is loaded in tension, the shifts in mineral P–O4ν1 are followed with the microprobe. Average load and strain are measured using a load cell. These devices ensure that specimens are not loaded to or beyond the yield point. Changes occur in the mineral component of bone as a response to loading in the elastic regime. We propose that the mineral apatitic crystal lattice is deformed by movement of calcium and other ions. Raman microspectroscopy shows that bone mineral is not a passive contributor to tissue strength. The mineral active response to loading may function as a local energy storage and dissipation mechanism, thus helping to protect tissue from catastrophic damage. © 2004 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"calcium ion; animal tissue; bone deformation; bone mineral; bone tissue; calcium transport; conference paper; controlled study; crystal structure; device; elasticity; female; femur; hydration; microanalysis; mouse; nonhuman; Raman spectrometry; strength; tension; ultrastructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642336279

Java is increasingly becoming the programming language of choice for applications expected to run in embedded and mobile environments. Java's platform independence and security features serve very well the needs of these environments, which expect the same application to run in a variety of environments in a secure manner. The devices used in these environments, for example hand-held computers, have a limited battery life. The needs to increase the period between recharges and to decrease the cooling costs provide the incentive to incorporate energy as an important parameter. The authors propose two implementation strategies for allocating objects that can significantly reduce the memory system energy consumption of Java applications. The first strategy uses a part of the on-chip memory resources as a local memory to achieve better performance than a cache-only architecture. The object allocation strategy is implemented using an annotation-based approach and shown to be effective in improving performance and reducing the memory system energy consumption. Specifically, energy consumption is reduced by up to 39% and cache miss rate by up to 31%. The second strategy is object co-location, which exploits the temporal locality already present in heap references to achieve better spatial locality. The object co-location is implemented in the garbage collector of a Java virtual machine. This reduces the cache miss rate by up to 47%, and a subsequent reduction in the memory energy consumption by up to 49% is observed.",,"Benchmarking; Computer software; Computer systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Information analysis; Java programming language; Microprocessor chips; Resource allocation; Static random access storage; Java programs; Java virtual machine (JVM); System-on-chip; Computer science",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542476897

This study focuses on three climate projections for the 21st century based on a 'business as usual' (BAU) global emissions scenario, evaluated with respect to a control climate scenario based on static 1995 emissions. Time-varying monthly PCM temperature and precipitation changes were statistically downscaled and temporally disaggregated to produce daily forcings that drove a macroscale hydrologic simulation model of the Columbia River basin at 1/4-degree spatial resolution. For comparison with the direct statistical downscaling approach, a dynamical downscaling approach using a regional climate model (RCM) was also used to derive hydrologic model forcings for 20-year subsets from the PCM control climate (1995-2015) scenario and from the three BAU climate (2040-2060) projections. The statistically downscaled PCM scenario results were assessed for three analysis periods (denoted Periods 1-3: 2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2098) in which changes in annual average temperature were +0.5, +1.3 and +2.1°C, respectively, while critical winter season precipitation changes were -3, +5 and +1 percent. For RCM, the predicted temperature change for the 2040-2060 period was +1.2°C and the average winter precipitation change was -3 percent, relative to the RCM control climate. Due to the modest changes in winter precipitation, temperature changes dominated the simulated hydrologic effects by reducing winter snow accumulation, thus shifting summer streamflow to the winter. The hydrologic changes caused increased competition for reservoir storage between firm hydropower and instream flow targets developed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act listing of Columbia River salmonids. We examined several alternative reservoir operating policies designed to mitigate reservoir system performance losses. In general, the combination of earlier reservoir refill with greater storage allocations for instream flow targets mitigated some of the negative impacts to flow, but only with significant losses in firm hydropower production (ranging from -9 percent in Period 1 to -35 percent for RCM). Simulated hydropower revenue changes were less than 5 percent for all scenarios, however, primarily due to small changes in annual runoff.",,"Hydrology; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); River basin projects; Water resources; Weather forecasting; Season precipitation; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; hydrological change; mitigation; resolution; streamflow; water resource; Columbia Basin; North America; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542381338

PCM climate scenarios include an ensemble of three 105-year future climate simulations based on projected 'business-as-usual' (BAU) greenhouse gas emissions and a control climate simulation based on static 1995 greenhouse gas concentrations. Downscaled transient temperature and precipitation sequences were extracted from PCM simulations, and were used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model to produce corresponding streamflow sequences. Results for the BAU scenarios were summarized into Periods 1, 2, and 3 (2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2098). Average annual temperature changes for the Colorado River basin were 0.5°C warmer for control climate, and 1.0, 1.7, and 2.4°C warmer for Periods 1-3, respectively, relative to the historical climate. Basin-average annual precipitation for the control climate was slightly (1%) less than for observed historical climate, and 3, 6, and 3% less for future Periods 1-3, respectively. Annual runoff in the control run was about 10% lower than for simulated historical conditions, and 14, 18, and 17% less for Periods 1-3, respectively. Analysis of water management operations using a water management model driven by simulated streamflows showed that streamflows associated with control and future BAU climates would significantly degrade the performance of the water resources system relative to historical conditions, with average total basin storage reduced by 7% for the control climate and 36, 32 and 40% for Periods 1-3, respectively. Releases from Glen Canyon Dam to the Lower Basin (mandated by the Colorado River Compact) were met in 80% of years for the control climate simulation (versus 92% in the historical climate simulation), and only in 59-75% of years for the future climate runs. Annual hydropower output was also significantly reduced for the control and future climate simulations. The high sensitivity of reservoir system performance for future climate is a reflection of the fragile equilibrium that now exists in operation of the system, with system demands only slightly less than long-term mean annual inflow.",,"Climate change; Computer simulation; Precipitation (meteorology); River basin projects; Stream flow; Water resources; Variable infiltration capacity (VIC); Hydrology; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; hydrological change; sensitivity analysis; water management; water resource; Colorado Basin; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542351575

Body weight, body length, and bone mineral density were decreased in UCP-H mice compared with wild-type littermates. Forelimb grip strength and muscle mass were strikingly decreased, whereas muscle triglyceride content was increased fivefold in UCP-H mice. Electron microscopy demonstrated lipid accumulation and large mitochondria with abnormal architecture in UCP-H skeletal muscle. ATP content and key mitochondrial proteins were decreased in UCP-H muscle. Despite mitochondrial dysfunction and increased intramyocellular fat, fasting serum glucose was 22% lower and insulin-stimulated glucose transport 80% higher in UCP-H animals. These beneficial effects on glucose metabolism were associated with increased AMP kinase and hexokinase activities, as well as elevated levels of GLUT4 and myocyte enhancer factor-2 proteins A and D in skeletal muscle. These results suggest that UCP-H mice have a mitochondrial myopathy due to depleted energy stores sufficient to compromise growth and impair muscle function. Enhanced skeletal muscle glucose transport in this setting suggests that excess intramyocellular lipid and mitochondrial dysfunction are not sufficient to cause insulin resistance in mice.","Insulin resistance; Lipotoxicity; Mitochondria; Uncoupling protein","adenosine triphosphate; adenylate kinase; glucose transporter 4; hexokinase; lipid; mitochondrial protein; myocyte enhancer factor 2; myocyte enhancer factor 2A; myocyte enhancer factor 2D; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; animal tissue; article; body height; body weight; bone density; bone mineral; disorders of mitochondrial functions; electron microscopy; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; female; glucose blood level; glucose transport; grip strength; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; male; mitochondrial myopathy; mouse; muscle mass; muscle metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; skeletal muscle; toxicity; transgenic mouse",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442300773

We systematically characterized several major aspects of adipocyte metabolism and functions as variables of cell age. We found that terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells is followed by a near-linear hypertrophic growth (increase in triglyceride content) of the cultured adipocytes throughout a 20-day study period. However, three metabolically and functionally distinct stages are recognized. The first stage overlaps with differentiation and is represented by small immature adipocytes. The second stage is characterized by fully mature adipocytes that show peaked overall metabolic activities. The third stage is marked by cell aging, with deterioration in every major aspect of the cell's functionality except for the function of net energy storage, which is preserved even in aged adipocytes. Compared with young mature adipocytes, older cells are increasingly insulin resistant, have decreased glucose uptake and fuel consumption, and show impaired glycerokinase-mediated fatty acid reesterification. Moreover, aged adipocytes show reduced gene expression for adiponectin and leptin, each of which is important in systemic regulation of energy metabolism. The characterization of these cell age-dependent changes in adipocyte functionality provides a model for understanding dynamic changes at the tissue level and suggests that adipose tissue is modifiable via adipocyte aging.","Adiponectin; Glycerokinase and futile cycle; Insulin sensitivity; Leptin; Triglyceride","adiponectin; glycerol kinase; leptin; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; animal cell; article; cell aging; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell function; cell maturation; cell metabolism; cell strain 3T3; cell strain 3T3 L1; chronology; energy metabolism; gene expression; hypertrophy; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; nonhuman; priority journal; tissue culture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442300762

This concept was successfully demonstrated in a commercial trough plant (13.8 MWe SEGS I plant; 120 MWht storage capacity) and a demonstration tower plant (10 MWe Solar Two; 105 MWht storage capacity). However, the HTF used in state-of-the-art parabolic trough power plants (30-80 MWe) is expensive, dramatically increasing the cost of larger HTF storage systems. An engineering study was carried out to evaluate a concept, where another (less expensive) liquid medium such as molten salt is utilized as storage medium rather than the HTF itself. Detailed performance and cost analyses were conducted to evaluate the economic value of this concept. The analyses are mainly based on the operation experience from the SEGS plants and the Solar Two project. The study concluded that the specific cost for a two-tank molten salt storage is in the range of US$ 30-40/kWhth depending on storage size. Since the salt storage was operated successfully in the Solar Two project, no major barriers were identified to realize this concept in the first commercial parabolic trough power plant. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This annual cycle of body mass gain and loss is primarily due to large-scale accumulation of lipid in the summer, which is then mobilized and oxidized for energy during winter. The rapid and predictable change in body mass makes these animals ideal for studies investigating the molecular basis for body weight regulation. In the study described herein, we monitored seasonal changes in the protein levels and activity of a central regulator of anabolic metabolism, the serine-threonine kinase Akt-protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), during the months accompanying maximal weight gain and entry into hibernation (June-November). Interestingly, under fasting conditions, Akt/PKB demonstrated a tissue-specific seasonal activation. Specifically, although Akt/PKB levels did not change, the activity of Akt/PKB (isoforms 1/α and 2/β) in white adipose tissue (WAT) increased significantly in July. Moreover, glycogen synthase, which lies downstream of Akt/PKB on a linear pathway linking the enzyme to the stimulation of glycogen synthesis, demonstrated a similar pattern of seasonal activation. By contrast, Akt/PKB activity in skeletal muscle peaked much later (i.e., September). These data suggest the existence of a novel, tissue-specific mechanism regulating Akt/PKB activation during periods of marked anabolism.","Hibernation; Insulin; Metabolism","glycogen synthase; insulin; lipid; oncoprotein; protein kinase B; proto oncogene protein akt; proto-oncogene protein akt; unclassified drug; adipose tissue; animal; animal experiment; animal tissue; antibody specificity; article; biosynthesis; blood; body mass; body weight; circadian rhythm; controlled study; enzyme regulation; enzymology; female; glycogen synthesis; hibernation; hyperphagia; male; metabolism; nonhuman; phosphorylation; physiology; priority journal; protein analysis; Sciuridae; season; seasonal variation; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; summer; weight gain; Western blotting; white adipose tissue; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342310450

This can also be used as a criterion for an MTJ with a healthy, defect-free barrier. A new dual-channel ultralow-noise amplifier is described allowing noise measurements for very low resistance (large area) devices. A ""barrier defect model"" is developed and verified for noise, tunneling magnetoresistance ratio (TMR), and defective area, using healthy MTJ devices, which are given controlled defects by means of pulsed electrical overstress. It is shown that MTJ devices are very electrostatic-damage prone; narrow voltage pulses (0.5 ns) can damage the sensors at relatively low voltages (1.5 V). Relationships are shown between pulse voltage, pulse energy, duration, number of pulses, and the drop in sensor resistance.

Furthermore, electric vehicles using batteries to store electricity are shown to be more efficient and less polluting than fuel cell powered vehicles using energy stored in hydrogen. © 2004 by ASME.",,"Air pollution; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Nuclear fuels; Renewable energy resources; Energy carriers; Energy studies; Heat energy; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13144260712

Such structures are observed in planetary magnetospheres, solar atmosphere and are expected to be widespread in nature. The thin current sheet structure resembles a collapsing MHD solution with a plane singularity. Being potential sites of effective energy accumulation, these structures have received a good deal of attention during the last decade, especially after the launch of the multiprobe CLUSTER mission which is capable of resolving their 3D features. Many theoretical models of thin current sheet dynamics, including the well-known current sheet bifurcation, have been developed recently. A self-consistent 1D analytical model of thin current sheets in which the tension of the magnetic field lines is balanced by the ion inertia rather than by the plasma pressure gradients was developed earlier. The influence of the anisotropic electron population and of the corresponding electrostatic field that acts to restore quasi-neutrality of the plasma is taken into account. It is assumed that the electron motion is fluid-like in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and fast enough to support quasi-equilibrium Boltzmann distribution along the field lines. Electrostatic effects lead to an interesting feature of the current density profile inside the current sheet, i.e. a narrow sharp peak of electron current in the very center of the sheet due to fast curvature drift of the particles in this region. The corresponding magnetic field profile becomes much steeper near the neutral plane although the total cross-tail current is in all cases dominated by the ion contribution. The dependence of electrostatic effects on the ion to electron temperature ratio, the curvature of the magnetic field lines, and the average electron magnetic moment is also analyzed. The implications of these effects on the fine structure of thin current sheets and their potential impact on substorm dynamics are presented. © European Geosciences Union 2004.",,"electron; magnetohydrodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844262881

These insights permitted the successful engineering of a large number of alloys, where the major mathematical novelty was that the surface response to external stress was anisotropic. By examining step/terrace (vicinal) surface defects it was discovered through lengthy and tedious experiments that the stored energy density (surface tension) along a step edge was a smooth symmetric function β of the azimuthal angle θ to the step, and that the positive function β attains its minimum value at θ = π/2 and its maximum value at θ = 0. The function β provided the crucial thermodynamic parameters needed for the engineering of these materials. Moreover the minimal energy configuration of the step is determined by the values of the stiffness function β″ +β which ultimately leads to the magnitude and direction of surface mass flow for these materials. In the 1990’s there was a dramatic improvement in electron microscopy which permitted real time observation of the meanderings of a step edge under Brownian heat oscillations. These observations provided much more rapid determination of the relevant thermodynamic parameters for the step edge, even for crystals at temperatures below their roughening temperature. Use of these tools led J. Hannon and his coexperimenters to discover that some crystals behave in a highly anti-intuitive manner as their temperature is varied. The present article is devoted to a model described by a class of variational problems. The main result of the paper describes the solutions of the corresponding problem for a generic integrand. © 2004 EDP Sciences, SMAI.","Complete metric space; Generic property; Variational problem","Crystal orientation; Crystal symmetry; Crystallography; Electron microscopy; Energy storage; Parameter estimation; Stress analysis; Thermodynamics; Azimuthal angle; Brownian heat oscillations; Roughening temperature; Stiffness function; Anisotropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844254359

NMR studies were carried out on bisphthalamic acid of o-TDA and SiDA model compounds to identify weak linkage in the above PAAs. Bulk viscosity, inherent viscosity, acid number, and molecular weight of CoPAA and CoPAS solutions decreased drastically as the storage time increased. CoPAS was less stable than CoPAA. BPDA-based PAA showed less viscosity drift than the BTDA-based PAA. Both CoPAA and CoPAS samples showed a two-step weight loss in air atmosphere. The first step was attributed to imidization and the second step to thermal degradation. The activation energy for thermal degradation was determined using Coats-Redfern and Chang methods and the values were found to be comparable.","Amic acid ionic salt; Photodefinable polyimides; Poly(amic acid); Poly(amic acid) ionic salt; Viscosity stability and Thermal degradation studies","copolymer; poly(amic acid); polymer; unclassified drug; article; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical reaction; degradation; molecular physics; molecular weight; reaction analysis; synthesis; temperature sensitivity; thermostability; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444297914

If it is capable of supplying enough power at all times, then it is an adequate source. Major problems presently facing the industry include the size, cost, and efficiency of the energy source. The primary energy source presently used in automotive systems is a battery. In order to reduce the cost of the battery, the current needs to be decreased and stabilized so it is not very erratic. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and justify the use of a new model for an energy source: a battery in parallel with an ultra-capacitor. The ultra-capacitor can supply a large burst of current, but cannot store much energy. Conversely, the battery can store mass amounts of energy; however, without expensive and inefficient units, a battery cannot provide the current that the ultra-capacitor can. By combining the two energy sources in parallel, the storage and peak current characteristics desired can be achieved. The standards of the vehicle are not degraded, allowing this to be a promising technique to incorporate into hybrid electric vehicles to reduce their cost and increase the efficiency of their energy-source system.","Electric drives; Electric propulsion; Energy source; Hybrid electric vehicles; Power electronic converters; Ultra-capacitor; Vehicle simulation","Capacitors; Computer simulation; Electric batteries; Electric currents; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric propulsion; Electric vehicles; Power converters; Energy source; Hybrid electric vehicle; Ultra-capacitor energy source; Electric drives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242330908

It now appears that human carcinomas and their pre-neoplastic lesions constitutively over-express FAS and undergo significant endogenous fatty acid biosynthesis. Moreover, FAS blockade specifically induces apoptotic cancer cell death and prolongs survival of cancer xenograft hosts. Therefore, FAS signaling seems to play a central role in the maintenance of the malignant phenotype by enhancing cancer cell survival and proliferation. This review documents the rapidly changing perspectives on the function of FAS in cancer biology. First, we describe molecular mechanism by which aberrant transduction cascades driven by oncogenic changes subvert the down-regulatory effects of dietary fatty acids, resulting in tumor-associated FAS insensitivity to nutritional signals. Second, we speculate on the putative function that hypoxia can play as the epigenetic factor that triggers and maintains FAS overexpression in cancer cells by inducing changes in gene expression and in metabolism for survival. Third, we explore the role that FAS exhibits in cancer evolution by specifically regulating cancer-related proteins such as Her-2/neu oncogene and estrogen receptor. Finally, we reveal previously unrecognized functions of FAS on the response of cancer cells to chemo-, endocrine-, and immuno-therapies. These findings, all together, should ultimately enhance our understanding of how FAS-dependent endogenous fatty acid metabolism, once considered a minor anabolic-energy-storage pathway in normal cells, has become a jack-of-all-trades in cancer cells.","Cancer; Fatty acid synthase; Fatty acids; Metabolism; Oncogene","docetaxel; fatty acid synthase; navelbine; paclitaxel; taxane derivative; trastuzumab; apoptosis; biosynthesis; breast cancer; cancer; cancer cell; cancer cell destruction; catalysis; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemotherapy; down regulation; energy; enzyme analysis; epigenetics; fat intake; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid synthesis; gene expression; graft survival; human; hyperactivity; hypoxia; nutrition; oncogene; oncogene neu; phenotype; prognosis; protein expression; protein function; review; sensitivity analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344278357

Most studies use control algorithms that dynamically transition devices to low power modes after they are idle for a certain threshold period of time. The control algorithms used in the past have two major limitations. First, they require painstaking, application-dependent manual tuning of their thresholds to achieve energy savings without significantly degrading performance. Second, they do not provide performance guarantees. In one case, they slowed down an application by 835%! This paper addresses these two limitations for both memory and disks, making memory/disk energy-saving schemes practical enough to use in real systems. Specifically, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a technique that provides a performance guarantee for control algorithms. We show that our method works well for all tested cases, even with previously proposed algorithms that are not performance-aware. (2) We propose a new control algorithm, Performance-directed Dynamic (PD), that dynamically adjusts its thresholds periodically, based on available slack and recent workload characteristics. For memory, PD consumes the least energy, when compared to previous hand-tuned algorithms combined with a performance guarantee. However, for disks, PD is too complex and its self-tuning is unable to beat previous hand-tuned algorithms. (3) To improve on PD, we propose a simple, optimization-based, threshold-free control algorithm, Performance-directed Static (PS). PS periodically assigns a static configuration by solving an optimization problem that incorporates information about the available slack and recent traffic variability to different chips/disks. We find that PS is the best or close to the best across all performance-guaranteed disk algorithms, including hand-tuned versions.","Adaptation algorithms; Control algorithms; Low power design; Memory and disk energy management; Multiple power mode device","Algorithms; Energy management; Optimization; Performance; Problem solving; Tuning; Adaptation algorithm; Control algorithm; Low power design; Memory and disk energy management; Multiple power mode devices; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344269160

The page miss ratio curve(MRC), i.e. page miss rate vs. memory size curve, is a good performance-directed metric to serve this purpose. However, dynamically tracking MRC at run time is challenging in systems with virtual memory because not every memory reference passes through the operating system (OS). This paper proposes two methods to dynamically track MRC of applications at run time. The first method is using a hardware MRC monitor that can track MRC at fine time granularity. Our simulation results show that this monitor has negligible performance and energy overheads. The second method is an OS-only implementation that can track MRC at coarse time granularity. Our implementation results on Linux show that it adds only 7-10% overhead. We have also used the dynamic MRC to guide both memory allocation for multiprogramming systems and memory energy management. Our real system experiments on Linux with applications including Apache Web Server show that the MRC-directed memory allocation can speed up the applications' execution/response time by up to a factor of 5.86 and reduce the number of page faults by up to 63.1%. Our execution-driven simulation results with SPEC2000 benchmarks show that the MRC-directed memory energy management can improve the Energy * Delay metric by 27-58% over previously proposed static and dynamic schemes.","Memory management; Power management; Resource allocation","Computer operating systems; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Energy management; Multiprogramming; Problem solving; Resource allocation; Virtual reality; Dynamic tracking; Memory management; Miss ratio curve (MRC); Power management; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344267104

We also identify some of the challenges that need to be faced in order to fully realize the practical benefits of nanotechnology, and discuss possible risks that may come with this new technology. In all cases, the unique advantage of nanotechnology can be traced back to nanoscale physical and chemical properties that are quite different from those encountered in more traditional microscopic (micro) or macroscopic (macro) materials and devices. Unique nanoscale properties and behaviors are already being used to increase energy efficiency, improve healthcare, and strengthen national security. However, while progress is rapid, many challenges remain. These include manufacturing at the nanoscale, integration of nanoscale materials and devices with more conventional technology, and predictive modeling that will allow nanotechnology to be engineered reliably into useful applications and products. Nanotechnology can be expected to have an increasing impact on human lives and society at large. As we strive to use nanotechnology to improve human life through better healthcare, cleaner environment, and improved national security, we must also work to detect and assess the negative impacts that nanotechnology (or any new technology) might bring. We suggest that the conduct of science should be allowed to proceed unimpeded, so that we can fully understand and appreciate the rules of nature at the nanometer scale.

It is shown that the plane wave propagation eigenpolarizations in a linear homogeneous time-independent anisotropic media without free sources, can be obtained through extremizing the difference between stored electric and magnetic energies as a variational functional. It is demonstrated that at these stationary points the wave equation is satisfied by showing that each of the Maxwell curl equations may be obtained by using the other equation as a constraint. Furthermore, it is proven that the theorem holds for extrema of the stored electric energy independently, when the medium is magnetically isotropic. It is concluded that when at least one of the permittivity and permeability tensors are scalar, both the total of and the difference between electric and magnetic energies are extremized simultaneously. As an example, the eigenpolarizations in a non-magnetic anisotropic medium with optical activity are obtained. © Sharif University of Technology.",,"Anisotropy; Electric energy storage; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Electromagnetism; Magnetic permeability; Maxwell equations; Permittivity; Tensors; Wave equations; Anisotropic media; Eigenpolarizations; Electric energy; Magnetic energies; Electromagnetic fields; electromagnetic field",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144316230

The analysis of the reactant and product molecular structures reveals the energy storage mechanism as determined by the detailed molecular rearrangements of the retinyl chromophore, including rotation of the φ(C11-C12) dihedral angle from -11° in the 11-cis isomer to -161° in the all-trans product, where the preferential sense of rotation is determined by the steric interactions between Ala-117 and the polyene chain at the C13 position, torsion of the polyene chain due to steric constraints in the binding pocket, and stretching of the salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base and the Glu-113 counterion by reorientation of the polarized bonds that localize the net positive charge at the Schiff-base linkage. The energy storage, computed at the ONIOM electronic-embedding approach (B3LYP/6-31G*:AMBER) level of theory and the S0 → S 1 electronic-excitation energies for the dark and product states, obtained at the ONIOM electronic-embedding approach (TD-B3LYP/6-31G*// B3LYP/6-31G*:AMBER) level of theory, are in very good agreement with experimental data.

It is a intermediate step leading up to the next phase of the Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP) (Phase 2), for which there will be a broader investigation of the aggregation between global scales (GSWP-1) and the river scale. This project makes use of the Rhône modeling system, which was developed in recent years by the French research community in order to study the continental water cycle on a regional scale. The main goals of this study are to investigate how 15 LSSs simulate the water balance for several annual cycles compared to data from a dense observation network consisting of daily discharge from over 145 gauges and daily snow depth from 24 sites, and to examine the impact of changing the spatial scale on the simulations. The overall evapotranspiration, runoff, and monthly change in water storage are similarly simulated by the LSSs, however, the differing partitioning among the fluxes results in very different river discharges and soil moisture equilibrium states. Subgrid runoff is especially important for discharge at the daily timescale and for smallerscale basins. Also, models using an explicit treatment of the snowpack compared better with the observations than simpler composite schemes. Results from a series of scaling experiments are examined for which the spatial resolution of the computational grid is decreased to be consistent with large-scale atmospheric models. The impact of upscaling on the domain-averaged hydrological components is similar among most LSSs, with increased evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy and a decrease in surface runoff representing the most consistent inter-LSS responses. A significant finding is that the snow water equivalent is greatly reduced by upscaling in all LSSs but one that explicitly accounts for subgrid-scale orography effects on the atmospheric forcing.",,"Agglomeration; Computer simulation; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Moisture; Runoff; Snow; Soil testing; Continental water cycle; Orography; Climatology; evapotranspiration; hydrological regime; land surface; river discharge; soil water; water budget",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744232755

The obesity syndrome observed in humans with MC4R haploinsufficiency is similar to that observed in MC4R knockout mice: increased longitudinal growth, hyperphagia, and fasting hyperinsulinemia. For comparison with other commonly investigated models of obesity and insulin resistance, we have backcrossed Mc4r-/- mice into the C57BL/6J (B6) background. Female obese Mc4r-/- mice exhibit reduced energy expenditure and an attenuated increase in fatty acid oxidation following exposure to high fat diets compared to obese Lep ob/Lepob mice. The reduced energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation correlates with changes in hepatic gene expression. The expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation increased in obese Lep ob/Lepob mice compared to wild type and obese Mc4r-/- mice. In contrast, a key lipogenic enzyme (fatty acid synthase) is increased in obese Mc4r-/- mice compared to obese Lepob/Lepob mice. Hyperinsulinemia, increased FAS mRNA expression and hepatic steatosis appear to be secondary to obesity in B6 Mc4r-/- mice. However, Mc4r-/- mice in a mixed genetic background develop severe hepatic steatosis at an early age. This might suggest an important role of the MC4R in regulating liver fatty acid metabolism this is masked on the B6 background. Interestingly, the 10- to 20-fold increase in liver triglyceride in this strain of Mc4r-/- mice is not always associated with fasting hyperinsulinemia or increased FAS mRNA expression. This observation suggests changes in liver secondary to triglyceride accumulation lead to hyperinsulinemia and increased hepatic FAS expression in Mc4r-/- mice.","Fatty acid metabolism; Insulin resistance; Liver; Melanocortin; Steatosis","fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; melanocortin 4 receptor; messenger RNA; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; diet restriction; energy expenditure; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty liver; female; gene expression; gene mutation; haploidy; hyperinsulinemia; hyperphagia; insulin resistance; knockout mouse; lipid storage; lipogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; nutrient uptake; obesity; oxidation; priority journal; protein expression; Animals; Body Weight; Dietary Fats; Eating; Fatty Acid Synthetase Complex; Fatty Acids; Fatty Liver; Female; Gene Expression; Hyperinsulinism; Insulin; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Leptin; Lipids; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphoproteins; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1042275338

Med., Chicago, IL, USA, United States","Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, α, γ and β/δ, function as important lipid sensors as well as key regulators of energy homeostasis. PPARα plays a dynamic role in energy combustion by transcriptionally upregulating fatty acid oxidation systems primarily in liver, whereas PPARγ functions as a regulator of adipogenesis and lipid storage. Overexpression of PPARγ, using adenoviral expression approach, in PPARα deficient mouse liver results in hepatic steatosis with concurrent expression of adipocyte specific genes. In this study, to gain a global molecular understanding of PPARγ1-induced gene expression in liver, we have analyzed gene expression profiles using the Affymetrix GeneChip mouse expression array set 430, that enables a comprehensive gene expression profiling with >39,000 transcripts. Microarray data analysis provided us with over 278 genes up-regulated fourfold or higher, and 121 genes down-regulated fourfold or higher in liver with PPARγ-induced hepatic adiposis. We have found 101 uncharacterized genes out of 278 up-regulated and 29 uncharacterized among the down-regulated gene categories, respectively. Of 177 functionally characterized candidate genes in the up-regulated category many appear to be involved in adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and signal transduction. To focus attention on the uncharacterized genes in the up-regulated category, we cloned the full-length cDNAs of two novel candidates, which we designated as promethin and PGLP. Promethin, a 15-kDa cytosolic protein, is not normally expressed in liver but induced robustly in liver with hepatic adiposis caused by PPARγ overexpression. PGLP, which encodes a 38:kDa cytoplasmic membranous protein, is a low abundant transcript in normal liver, but induced dramatically following PPARγ overexpression. The expression of these two genes was not increased in fatty livers induced by fasting or choline deficiency.

Distinct features within a transmitted cw probe pulse are used to identify the combination of linear chirp rate and optical power needed to produce an average Bloch-vector rotation of 90°. The resulting superposition state is thus an equal mixture of the ground and excited states on average. We find experimentally a linear relationship between the applied chirp-pulse intensity and chirp rate required to produce this half-inversion, a conclusion supported by both analytical calculations made using a Landau-Zener approach, and detailed computer simulations using the Maxwell-Bloch model. The numerical simulations predict experimentally observed phenomena such as the reshaping of probe pulses by stimulated emission or absorption. Finally, we quantify the relationship between chirp rate and optical power for half-inversion as a function of the optical density of the medium. The pump - probe experimental techniques and simulation analysis techniques developed here can be extended to produce an arbitrary mixture of ground and excited states, on average, in media spanning a wide range of optical density.

The balance between storage costs and benefits depend on the storage method and composition changes of individual stover fractions. Corn stover from bales stored inside and outside of a barn was separated into an interior and exterior layer after approximately 10 months of storage. The cobs, stalks, and leaves and husks were separated, dried, and ground through a 2 mm screen. Stover, sodium acetate (buffer), cellulase, and deionized water were added to 125 ml flasks. The mixture was held at 50°C in an incubator and samples taken for glucose determination. The average glucose concentration after 60 h of hydrolysis from cobs, leaves and husks, and stalks was 10.5, 9.6, and 3.1 g/l, respectively. Cobs, leaves, and husks produced over 300% more glucose than stalks. Storage outside of the barn decreased the glucose production from individual stover components between 4% and 8%.

This energy deficiency impairs performance, growth and health. Reproductive disorders in female athletes are caused by low energy availability (defined as dietary energy intake minus exercise energy expenditure), perhaps specifically by low carbohydrate availability, and not by the stress of exercise. These reproductive disorders can be prevented or reversed by dietary supplementation in compensation for exercise energy expenditure without any moderation of the exercise regimen. Energy balance is not the objective of athletic training. To maximize performance, athletes strive to achieve an optimum sport-specific body size, body composition and mix of energy stores. To pursue these objectives, athletes need to manage fat, protein and carbohydrate balances separately, but it is impractical for athletes to monitor these balances directly, and appetite is not a reliable indicator of their energy and macronutrient needs. To guide their progress, athletes need to eat by discipline and to monitor specific, reliable and practical biomarkers of their objectives.

Results from our laboratory have demonstrated that the predominant microbial populations of stored swine manure are anaerobic, low (G + C), Gram-positive bacteria. However, studies on pure cultures isolated from manure have found few microorganisms that produce appreciable ammonia concentrations. Therefore, selective and enrichment techniques were employed to isolate ammonia-producing bacteria from stored swine manure by using media containing peptone and amino acids as carbon and energy sources. We now report on the isolation of 40 bacterial cultures, a number of which are capable of producing at least 40 mM ammonia in peptone-amino acid medium, concentrations similar to those produced by hyper-ammonia producing (HAP) bacteria isolated from the rumen of cattle.

Educ., University of Texas, Austin, TX 78747, United States","An important goal of the athlete's everyday diet is to provide the muscle with substrates to fuel the training programme that will achieve optimal adaptation for performance enhancements. In reviewing the scientific literature on post-exercise glycogen storage since 1991, the following guidelines for the training diet are proposed. Athletes should aim to achieve carbohydrate intakes to meet the fuel requirements of their training programme and to optimize restoration of muscle glycogen stores between workouts. General recommendations can be provided, preferably in terms of grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of the athlete's body mass, but should be fine-tuned with individual consideration of total energy needs, specific training needs and feedback from training performance. It is valuable to choose nutrient-rich carbohydrate foods and to add other foods to recovery meals and snacks to provide a good source of protein and other nutrients. These nutrients may assist in other recovery processes and, in the case of protein, may promote additional glycogen recovery when carbohydrate intake is suboptimal or when frequent snacking is not possible. When the period between exercise sessions is < 8 h, the athlete should begin carbohydrate intake as soon as practical after the first workout to maximize the effective recovery time between sessions. There may be some advantages in meeting carbohydrate intake targets as a series of snacks during the early recovery phase, but during longer recovery periods (24 h) the athlete should organize the pattern and timing of carbohydrate-rich meals and snacks according to what is practical and comfortable for their individual situation. Carbohydrate-rich foods with a moderate to high glycaemic index provide a readily available source of carbohydrate for muscle glycogen synthesis, and should be the major carbohydrate choices in recovery meals. Although there is new interest in the recovery of intramuscular triglyceride stores between training sessions, there is no evidence that diets which are high in fat and restricted in carbohydrate enhance training.","Carbohydrate; Energy intake; Glycaemic index; Glycogen; Performance","carbohydrate; glucose; glycogen; lipid; protein; triacylglycerol; adaptation; athlete; body mass; carbohydrate diet; carbohydrate intake; clinical trial; conference paper; diet restriction; energy consumption; exercise; food composition; gender; glycemic index; glycogen metabolism; glycogen storage disease; glycogen synthesis; human; lipid diet; meal; muscle level; nutrient supply; physical performance; training; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Guidelines; Humans; Nutrition Physiology; Sports; Time Factors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842265782

Sci. and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, United States","One of the key challenges facing computer architects and compiler writers is the increasing discrepancy between processor cycle times and main memory access times. To alleviate this problem in array-intensive embedded signal and video processing applications, compilers may employ either control-centric transformations that change data access patterns of nested loops or data-centric transformations that modify memory layouts of multidimensional arrays. Most of the memory layout optimizations proposed so far either modify the layout of each array independently or are based on explicit data reorganizations at runtime. This paper focuses on a compiler technique, called array regrouping, that automatically maps multiple arrays into a single data (array) space to improve data access pattern. We present a mathematical framework that enables us to systematically derive suitable mappings for a given array-intensive embedded application. The framework divides the arrays accessed in a given program into several groups and each group is independently layout-transformed to improve spatial locality and reduce the number of conflict misses. As compared to the previous approaches, the proposed technique makes two new contributions: 1) It presents a graph based formulation of the array regrouping problem and 2) it demonstrates potential benefits of this aggressive array-regrouping strategy in optimizing behavior of embedded systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cache miss rates and execution times. An important advantage of this approach over the previous techniques that target conflict misses is that it reduces conflict misses without increasing the data space requirements of the application being optimized. This is a very desirable property in many embedded/portable environments where data space requirements determine the minimum physical memory capacity. In addition to performance related issues, with the increased use of embedded/portable devices, improving energy efficiency of applications is becoming a critical issue. To develop a truly energy-efficient system, energy constraints should be taken into account early in the design process, i.e., at the source level in software compilation and behavioral level in hardware compilation. Source-level optimizations are particularly important in data-dominated media applications. In this paper, we also show how our array regrouping strategy increases energy savings from using multiple low-power operating modes provided in current memory modules. Using a set of array-intensive benchmarks, we observe significant savings in memory system energy.","Array regrouping; Cache locality; Embedded systems; Layout optimizations; Memory energy consumption","Array regrouping; Cache locality; Layout optimization; Memory energy consumption; Buffer storage; Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Computer software; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Integer programming; Mobile computing; Optimization; Problem solving; Program compilers; Systems analysis; Video signal processing; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0742321100

Standard of care treatment has focused on preventing the mobilization of lipids that result from fasting and providing medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) in the diet in order to bypass the long-chain metabolic block. MCTs that are currently available as commercial preparations are in the form of even-chain fatty acids that are predominately a mixture of octanoate and decanoate. Recently, the use of odd-chain fatty acids has been proposed as an alternative treatment. We have shown previously that the even-numbered medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) that are found in MCT preparations can reduce the accumulation of potentially toxic long-chain metabolites of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In the current study, we undertook to determine if the same is true of odd-numbered MCFAs. We found that provision of odd-chain species does decrease the build-up of long-chain FAO intermediates in our in vitro skin fibroblast model, but to a lesser extent than even-numbered MCFAs. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes to view in a system architecture the flow of service (or utility) that the system will provide over its design lifetime. It suggests that the design lifetime is a fundamental component of system architecture although one cannot see it or touch it. Consequently, cost, utility, and value per unit time metrics are introduced. A framework is then developed that identifies optimal design lifetimes for complex systems in general, and space systems in particular, based on this augmented perspective of system architecture and on these metrics. It is found that an optimal design lifetime for a satellite exists, even in the case of constant expected revenues per day over the system's lifetime, and that it changes substantially with the expected Time to Obsolescence of the system and the volatility of the market the system is serving in the case of a commercial venture. The analysis thus proves that it is essential for a system architect to match the design lifetime with the dynamical characteristics of the environment the system is/will be operating in. It is also shown that as the uncertainty in the dynamical characteristics of the environment the system is operating in increases, the value of having the option to upgrade, modify, or extend the lifetime of a system at a later point in time increases depending on how events unfold. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The alga reduced inorganic N to very low concentrations (&lt;3.5 μM) across all nutrient additions while a larger proportion of the added P remained in the water at the end of the experiment (up to 20 μM in highest addition). Growth of E. intestinalis increased in proportion to enrichment across the lower four of the six treatments; range of growth was -6 to 60% change from initial wet wt. N concentration in the tissue decreased at the four lower loading rates due to dilution by growth, but increased greatly (from an initial of 2.7-5% dry wt.) in the highest loading rate partially due to lack of growth in this treatment. In contrast, the mass of N in the tissue increased linearly (slope = 0.012, r2 = 0.779, P = 0.0001) over all treatments, showing that uptake and storage were not always coupled to growth. Patterns of tissue P concentration and accumulation were similar to N. Significant amounts of dissolved organic N accumulated in the water, especially in the highest N pulses. Net retention of N in algal tissue ranged from 73 to 98% while retention of P ranged from 79 to 88%; the % lowest retention occurred when nutrient pulses were either very high or low. We hypothesize that this opportunistic, bloom-forming alga is adapted to pulses of nutrients, such that, when pulses are of very high concentration, E. intestinalis can delay growth in favor of saving energy to maximize nutrient uptake and storage. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Breaches of the cylinders could result in the release of uranium and hydrogen fluoride., Beginning in 1996, a program was begun to paint the cylinders in order to prevent corrosion of the cylinders and the surfaces of the storage yards were converted to concrete. In 1998, storm water from the cylinder storage yards was found to be toxic to Ceriodaphnia, at concentrations exceeding limits in the site's discharge permit. A six-month study was conducted to identify the source of the toxicity in the storm water. Ceriodaphnia toxicity tests with the storm water resulted in 48-h median lethal concentrations (LC50) ranging from 12 to 94%; zinc concentrations in the storm water ranged from 0.08 to 0.54 mg/L. Acute toxicity tests with zinc and linear regression identified that zinc concentrations in the storm water were sufficient to account for the toxicity observed. By tracking the sources to the discharge point, newly painted cylinders were identified as the source of the zinc in the storm water. Rainwater collected directly from the painted cylinders contained up to 13 mg Zn/L. Laboratory and field tests showed that topcoating the cylinders would reduce the amount of zinc in the runoff from the cylinders.","Acute toxicity; Ceriodaphnia; Paint; Storm water; Zinc","Corrosion prevention; Paint; Regression analysis; Zinc; Storm water; Toxicity; storm water; zinc; stormwater; toxicity; water pollution; zinc; acute toxicity; animal experiment; article; ceriodaphnia; controlled study; corrosion; ecotoxicity; fish; laboratory test; maximum allowable concentration; nonhuman; pollution control; priority journal; radioactive waste; toxicity testing; water contamination; Animals; Cladocera; Fluorides; Hazardous Waste; Lethal Dose 50; Paint; Rain; Refuse Disposal; Uranium Compounds; Water Pollutants; Zinc; Kentucky; North America; United States; Animalia; Ceriodaphnia; Daphniidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346728890

In the first paper, we analyzed mechanisms of individual fecundity scheduling and have drawn the following conclusions. 1. Individual fecundity in female flies is endowed as a flat pattern with a steady-state period of a constant rate of egg-laying. An individual female reveals three stages in her adult life history: maturation, maturity, and senescence. The first stage is a transient period of achieving a steady state at maturity, which can be maintained until the senescence stage. 2. Thus, an individual fecundity pattern has no maximum. The maximums observed experimentally are averaging-caused artifacts. 3. Two natural causes of deaths exist in flies, senescence-caused ones and premature deaths, probably due to a reproductive overload. In this paper, to confirm these findings, we use individual daily scores of egg-laying in four populations of Mediterranean fruit flies. Based on fecundity scores, we divide each Medfly population into four classes, namely zero-egg, short-, medium- and long-lived egg-layers. We demonstrate that, indeed, the three above findings definitely exist in Medflies. Our procedure allows the efficient storage of individual fecundity in parametric form, with only five numbers for each fly. Finally, this protocol will allow a more precise analysis of fecundity-energy trade-offs in flies carrying appropriate longevity mutations. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We tested the hypothesis that iron supplementation does not increase the susceptibility of LDL to undergo oxidative modification in women with low iron status. A randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover study design (n = 26) was used to examine the effects of the following diets on measures of LDL oxidation: average American diet (AAD) [36% of energy as fat; 15% saturated fatty acids (SFA)], and a Step 2 diet (26% fat; 7% SFA). In addition, subjects received either a supplement containing 160 mg of ferrous sulfate (50 mg elemental iron) or a placebo twice daily [supplement group received a total of 320 mg ferrous sulfate (100 mg elemental iron) daily]. After supplementation, serum ferritin differed between the supplement and placebo groups (P = 0.008). Measures of LDL oxidation were not affected by supplement intake; however, they were affected by diet. Lag time was shorter after the women consumed the AAD diet than after the Step 2 diet (P < 0.0001). The diets did not affect the rate of oxidation or total dienes. Although iron status was improved by aggressive iron supplementation, LDL oxidative susceptibility was not affected. As expected, lag time was increased after the women consumed the low fat, low SFA diet. Therefore, the results of this study do not support a relationship between iron status and LDL oxidation.","Dietary fat; Ferritin; Iron; Lag time; LDL oxidation","fat; ferritin; ferrous sulfate; free radical; iron; low density lipoprotein; placebo; saturated fatty acid; adult; article; atherogenesis; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet; dietary intake; double blind procedure; fat intake; female; ferritin blood level; human; iron deficiency; iron storage; iron therapy; low fat diet; normal human; oxidation; oxidative stress; randomized controlled trial",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346726184

This study investigated the development of this specialized hypodermis in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) across an ontogenetic series, including fetuses, neonates, juveniles, subadults, and adults. Blubber samples were collected at the level of the mid-thorax, from robust specimens (n = 25) that stranded along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia. Blubber was dissected from the carcass and its mass, and the depth and lipid content at the sample site, were measured. Samples were prepared using standard histological methods, viewed by light microscopy, and digital images of blubber captured. Images were analyzed through the depth of the blubber for morphological and structural features including adipocyte size, shape, and numbers, and extracellular, structural fiber densities. From fetus to adult, blubber mass and depth increased proportionally with body mass and length. Blubber lipid content increased dramatically with increasing fetal length. Adult and juvenile blubber had significantly higher blubber lipid content than fetuses, and this increase was reflected in mean adipocyte size, which increased significantly across all robust life history categories. In juvenile, subadult, and adult dolphins, this increase in cell size was not uniform across the depth of the blubber, with the largest increases observed in the middle and deep blubber regions. Through-depth counts of adipocytes were similar in all life history categories. These results suggest that blubber depth is increased during postnatal growth by increasing cell size rather than cell number. In emaciated adults (n = 2), lipid mobilization, as evidenced by a decrease in adipocyte size, was localized to the middle and deep blubber region. Thus, in terms of both lipid accumulation and depletion, the middle and deep blubber appear to be the most metabolically dynamic. The superficial blubber likely serves a structural role important in streamlining the animal. This study demonstrates that blubber is not a homogeneous tissue through its depth, and that it displays life history-dependent changes in its morphology and lipid content. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adipocyte; Blubber; Bottlenose dolphin; Cetacean; Development; Hypodermis","adipocyte; adipose tissue; aging; animal; article; body weight; cell differentiation; cell size; connective tissue; cytology; dolphin; female; fetus; growth, development and aging; histology; lipid metabolism; male; motor activity; newborn; physiology; prenatal development; swimming; thermoregulation; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Aging; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Body Temperature Regulation; Body Weight; Cell Differentiation; Cell Size; Connective Tissue; Dolphins; Female; Fetus; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Motor Activity; Swimming; Animalia; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Hypoderris; Tursiops truncatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346505562

These differences in C:N ratios among organisms means that there is more N assimilation by photosynthetic organisms in the oceans than on land despite the near equality of global photosynthetic C assimilation rates in the two environments. Aquatic organisms obtain inorganic C and inorganic N from the surrounding water. Terrestrial photolithotrophs obtain inorganic C, dinitrogen (by diazotrophy) and some combined N from the atmosphere, with the remaining combined N coming from the soil. The nitrogen cost of growth (biomass production rate per unit plant N) varies with the C:N ratio and specific growth rate of the organism. The C:N ratio of plants can be increased with no, or minimal, decrease in growth rate by switching from N-containing to N-free solutes involved in, for example, UV-B screening or by reducing the content of particular proteins. The water cost of growth (water lost per unit biomass gain) in terrestrial plants is a function of N supply and of C supply; water cost is lower with higher N and C availability. Water supply is also important in determining denitrification rates on land and on N (and C) fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic systems.","Agriculture; Algae; Astrochemistry; Carbon; Chemical defence; Compatible solutes; Ecology; Evolution; Free radical scavenging; Nitrogen; UV-B screening","Denitrification; Lipids; Nucleic acids; Photosynthesis; Polysaccharides; Proteins; Aquatic systems; Growth rates; Plants (botany); carbon; nitrogen; water; conference paper; environment; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant; Carbon; Environment; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Plants; Water; algae; Embryophyta",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346056753

Various interfaces of importance to magnetic storage devices are studied, including copper or nickel-iron (permalloy) on silicon oxynitride with additional adhesion promoters. The dynamics and kinetics of the four-point bend test are fully elucidated. A model for environmentally-controlled crack growth previously applied to bulk ceramics is used here as a model for interfacial crack growth and is found to fit the kinetic data. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
