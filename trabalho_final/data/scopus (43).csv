Its data acquisition system has to record the steady stream of very large events resulting from central collisions, with an ability to select and record rare cross section processes. These requirements result in an aggregate event building bandwidth of up to 2,5 GBytes/s and a storage capability of up to 1,25 GBytes/s, giving a total of more than 1 PBytes of data every year. This makes the performance of the mass storage devices a dominant factor for the overall system behavior and throughput. In this paper, we present an analysis of the performance of the storage system used in the ALICE experiment by studying the impact of different configuration parameters on the system throughput. The aim of this analysis is to determine the storage configuration which gives the best system performance. In particular, we show the influence of file and block size on the writing and reading rates and we present the relative performance of a clustered file system (StorNext®) and a regular journaled file system (Xfs) based on disk arrays in a Fiber Channel storage area network (SAN). We will also present a comparative analysis between different parametrizations of Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) varying the parity level and the numbers of disks in each array. At the end, we will conclude with the aggregate performance when concurrent writing and reading streams are sharing the system. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Aggregate performance; Block sizes; Collider; Comparative analysis; Configuration parameters; Cross section; Disk array; Dominant factor; Event building; Fiber channel; File systems; ITS data; Large ion collider experiments; Mass storage devices; Parametrizations; Reading rate; Redundant arrays of inexpensive disk; Relative performance; Storage capability; Storage systems; System behaviors; System throughput; Aggregates; Data structures; Disks (machine components); Disks (structural components); High energy physics; Experiments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72749114089

In real operating conditions, the maximum achievable transfer rate through a network link is not only limited by the capacity of the link itself, but also by those of the memory and peripheral buses and by the ability of the CPUs and of the Operating System to handle packet processing and interrupts raised by the network interface cards in due time. Besides the TCP and UDP maximum data transfer throughputs, we also measured the CPU loads of the sender/receiver processes and of the interrupt and soft-interrupt handlers as a function of the packet size, either using standard or ""jumbo"" Ethernet frames.

The power source is isolated by a high frequency transformer, and a 60Hz inverter is directly connected to the secondary side of the converter via DC link capacitors. Thus, the proposed converter-inverter topology greatly reduces the size and the number of parts count, while providing isolation. But, the inverter causes the DC link voltage unbalance, leading to coupled dynamics between converter and inverter. In this work, a voltage balancing algorithm and a decoupling control algorithm are derived from the average model of the DAB converter.

It is vital to provide thermo-stabilized environment and cost-effective operation conditions for bio-tech industries as well as for influenza vaccine plants. In this study, field measurement and numerical simulation of a full-scale bio-cleanroom has been carried out at a vaccine plant in Taiwan. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation were also conducted to investigate the temperature and airflow distribution as well as the energy saving potential of the bio-cleanroom. Validation of bio-cleanroom for egg-grown vaccine production was performed to meet the specification set at design stage. The results from computer simulation revealed that the improvement of energy consumption could be achieved satisfactorily by reduction of supply airflow rate and increase of supply air temperature. Different velocity and temperature of supply air could be assessed extensively not only by airflow and temperature distribution but also by transient simulation to achieve the design specification of 4°C for vaccine storage. It was also expected that CFD aided simulation could identify strategies for best practice at design stage as well as reduce running cost at full operation. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Bio-cleanroom; Computational fluid dynamics; Field measurement; Performance analysis","Bio-cleanroom; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Energy saving potential; Environmental control; Field measurement; Operation conditions; Performance analysis; Supply air temperature; Air; Clean rooms; Computer simulation; Design; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Laboratories; Measurements; Specifications; Vaccines; Computational fluid dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449209306

To achieve load/source independent stabilization, the source state estimator which estimates both source voltage and current is also proposed. The proposed methods are evaluated by experimental results.

The segmentation objective function traditionally involves parameters (i.e. weights) that need to be tuned in order to balance the underlying competing cost terms of image data fidelity and contour regularization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatic adaptive energy parameterization. In particular, our contributions are three-fold; 1) We spatially adapt fidelity and regularization weights to local image content in an autonomous manner. 2) We modulate the weight using a novel contextual measure of image quality based on the concept of spectral flatness. 3) We incorporate our proposed parameterization into a general segmentation framework and demonstrate its superiority to two alternative approaches: the best possible spatially-fixed parameterization and the globally optimal spatially-varying, but non- contextual, parameters. Our segmentation results are evaluated on real and synthetic data and produce a reduction in mean segmentation error when compared to alternative approaches. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Adapting energy functional; Adaptive regularization; Contextual weights; Energy minimization; Image segmentation; Noise estimation; Spectral flatness","Adaptive regularization; Contextual weights; Energy functionals; Energy minimization; Noise estimation; Spectral flatness; Computer science; Digital image storage; Image quality; Optimization; Parameterization; Image segmentation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449158789

As SSDs are flash memory based devices, their performance behavior differs from those of magnetic disks. However, little attention has been paid on how to exploit SSDs from the disk scheduling algorithm view point. In this paper, we first describe behaviors of SSDs that inspires us to design a new disk scheduler for the Linux operating system. Specifically, read service time is almost constant in an SSD while write service time is not. Moreover, appropriate grouping of write requests eliminates any ordering-related restrictions and also maximizes write performance. From these observations, we propose two disk schedulers: IRBW-FIFO and IRBW-FIFO-RP. Both schedulers arrange write requests into bundles of an appropriate size while read requests are independently scheduled. Then, the IRBW-FIFO scheduler provides complete FIFO ordering to each bundle of write requests and each individual read requests while the IRBW-FIFO-RP scheduler gives higher priority to read requests than the bundles of write requests. We implement these schedulers in Linux 2.6.23, and results of executing our set of benchmark programs shows that performance improvements of up to 17% compared to existing Linux disk schedulers are achieved.

The worms were grown on an artificial medium to evaluate the potential of producing them on a commercial scale. Approach: An interesting characteristic of the worms studied was that they reached their maximum weight and maximum length at the same time. Results: The larvae started to decrease in weight soon after reaching their maximum size suggesting that they should be harvested shortly before reaching their maximum length (36 days old). Only 10% mortality was observed with the older larvae of the Miombo/Mopani worm. A system where eggs are separated from adults and hatched in separate chambers would alleviate the danger of losing the population due to microbial infection. The high moisture content of the live larvae (60.5-60.9%) could cause handling and storage problems. Drying and grinding the larvae would reduce them to easily manageable forms and would improve their marketability as a novel food. The results obtained from this study showed the potential of using these insects as a protein source for human consumption. They had structured animal protein that contained the essential amino acids, lipids, vitamins, minerals and energy required for human growth and their nutrition contents are comparable to those of conventional foods. These worms are harvested from trees in Africa but the industry is facing droughts and overexploitation that has lead to local extinctions in several areas. Conclusion/Recommendations: Therefore, further research is required to evaluate their growth on low substrates and to assess the effects of environmental parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and heat production on food consumption and protein yield and quality. This information will aid in the design of an optimal commercial insect production system. Appropriate processing and marketing procedures would also insure the sustainability of the industry. © 2009 Science Publications.","Amino acids; Artificial feed; Essential elements; Fat; Growth rate; Human food; Isoberlinia paniculata worm; Miombo/mopani worm; Protein","Animalia; Hexapoda; Isoberlinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72249107360

Hunter colorimetric parameters were analyzed at different temperatures and time intervals, and nonenzymatic browning was modeled according to pseudo-zero-order kinetics. The effect of temperature on the browning rate followed the Arrhenius equation, with an activation energy of 64000 J/mol, which was not affected by the water activity level. The phytochemical contents, inhibition efficacy of protein glycation, and antioxidant properties were then analyzed in the products stored under selected ""equivalent"" conditions in terms of browning effects, namely, 120 days/20 °C, 50 days/30 °C, and 22 days/40 °C. After storage for 120 days/20 °C, the retention percentages of hydroxycinnamic acids, phloridzin, and epicatechin were >86%, but ascorbic acid, catechin, and procyanidins were less stable; concurrently dehydrated apples retained about 80% of the radical scavenging activity and 70% of the ability to inhibit protein glycation. Following storage at higher temperatures the expected browning effect occurred in a shorter time scale; however, the patterns of product degradation were different. A sharp increase in the degradation rates of all antioxidants, relative to browning rate, was observed at temperatures ≥30 °C, and this trend was accelerated with concurrent increase in water activity at >0.3 levels. The application of low-temperature/long-time conditions for storage of dehydrated apples corresponded to maximum retention of their efficacy to counteract oxidative and glycoxidative reactions, which have been linked to human chronic diseases. © 2009 American Chemical Society.","Antioxidant; Apple; Browning; Degradation; Malus domestica Borkh.; Protein glycation","apple; article; chemistry; food handling; fruit; glycation; humidity; methodology; oxidation reduction reaction; pigmentation; temperature; time; Food Handling; Fruit; Humidity; Maillard Reaction; Malus; Oxidation-Reduction; Pigmentation; Temperature; Time Factors; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73349141365

Knowing how this variable evolves allows us to anticipate faults and thus avoid failures and their consequences.

Advancement in fuel-cell technology has ignited interest in all-electric propulsion systems. Regardless of some drawbacks in terms of number of electrical storage components being used and relatively larger capacity of on-board energy storage required, compared to hybrid electric vehicles, all-electric propulsion systems offer the most effective solution for achieving zero emissions drive-trains. Both the sizing of powertrain components as well as the control strategy affects vehicle performance, due to their interdependency. Moreover, during sizing, various design constraints should also be satisfied simultaneously. Hence, optimization of fuel cell vehicle components can be simply treated as a multiobjective constrained nonlinear optimization. This paper considers a fuel cell powered electric transit bus, with battery and ultracapacitor as additional sources of power, to improve the overall drive performance and efficiency. Optimal sizing of the powertrain components is carried out, in conjunction with optimizing the overall control strategy design, through a suitably devised multi objective genetic algorithm method.

Algorithms for matching incoming packets from the network to pre-defined rules, have been proposed by a number of researchers. Current software-based packet classification techniques have low performance, prompting many researchers to move their focus to new architectures encompassing both software and hardware components. Some of the newer hardware architectures exclusively utilize Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) to improve the performance of rule matching. However, this results in systems with high power consumption. TCAM consumes a high amount of power due to the fact that it reads the entire memory array during every access, much of which is unnecessary. In this paper, we propose LOP, a novel SRAM-based architecture where incoming packets are compared against parts of all rules simultaneously until a single matching rule is found for the compared bits in the packets. This method LOP significantly reduces power consumption as only a segment of the memory is compared against the incoming packet. Despite the additional time penalty to match a single packet, parallel comparison of multiple packets can improve throughput beyond that of the TCAMapproaches, while consuming significantly low power. Nine different benchmarks were tested in two classification systems, with results showing that LOP architectures provide high lookup rates and high throughput, and low power consumption.

The DR unit can either represent a Distributed Storage (DS) unit or a dispatchable Distributed Generation (DG) unit. The proposed control strategy benefits from the power circuit configuration, dq-frame current-control scheme, and the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) mechanism that exist and are optimized in modern grid-connected DR units. Therefore, the proposed control strategy requires minimal software modifications to enable the operation of the DR unit in the islanded mode, with black-start capability, for example, for a remote microgrid application. In addition, the proposed control strategy employs feed-forward techniques to mitigate the impacts of (i) load dynamics on the system stability and performance, and (ii) inherent inter-couplings and nonlinearities of the control system. This, in turn, remarkably facilitates the controller design procedure. The principles supporting the proposed control strategy are discussed and analyzed, and the effectiveness of the control is demonstrated through digital time-domain simulations conducted on a detailed switched model of a 5.0 MV A DR unit. ©2009 IEEE.","Control; Distributed generation (DG); Distributed resources (DR); Dynamics; Feed-forward; Islanded-mode control; Microgrid; Model","Distributed generations; Distributed resources; Distributed resources (DR); Feed-Forward; Micro grid; Mode control; Control nonlinearities; Controllers; Galerkin methods; Phase locked loops; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Simulators; System stability; Control system stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71849120199

In order to optimally incorporate these storage devices in the operation of the infrastructure, the capacity constraints and dynamics of these have to be taken into account explicitly.

The results were used to calibrate and benchmark an Ls-Dyna model which had to be based only on a few and easy-to-measure material parameters. Therefore, performing only static compressive loading characterization tests, a suitable cellular Ls-Dyna material model was chosen. To justify the promising energy dissipation results, which cannot only be due to the static performances, a strain rate dependency was supposed. Based on ceramic materials which have inhomogeneities of the same size of the foam pores, a strain rate law typical of these was applied. Similar relations were applied to both the foams, and a calibrating coefficient was made on a single impact velocity test. The same model was then used to reproduce the impact at different impact velocities and very good agreement between experimental results and simulation was achieved. © 2009 WIT Press.","Ballistic impact; Carbon foam; Strain-rate effect","Ballistic impact; Ballistic performance; Carbon foam; Compressive loading; Fragment impacts; Impact velocities; Inhomogeneities; Low density; LS-DYNA; Material models; Material parameter; Speed-ups; Static performance; Strain rate dependency; Strain rate effect; Strain-rate-dependent; Ballistics; Ceramic materials; Cold storage; Compressed air; Computational methods; Energy dissipation; Foams; Simulators; Stainless steel; Strain rate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71749091831

As electricity cannot be preserved because of the highest cost of storage, electricity production must following market demand, necessarily. Short-long term wind forecasting over different time steps is becoming an important process for the management of wind farms. Time series modelling of wind speeds is based on the valid assumption that all the causative factors are implicitly accounted for in the sequence of occurrence of the process itself. Hence, time series modelling is equivalent to physical modelling. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which perform a non-linear mapping between inputs and outputs, provide a robust approach for wind prediction. In this work, these models are developed for simulating wind speed and energy production of a wind farm with three wind turbines, comparing different prediction temporal periods.

The LA could be retained by 60 wt.% into EP without melted PCM seepage from the composite and therefore, this composite was described as form-stable composite PCM. SEM results showed that the LA confined into porous of EP. FT-IR analysis indicated that the composite formation of porous EP and LA was physical. The melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of the composite were measured as 44.13 °C and 40.97 °C; 93.36 J/g and 94.87 J/g, respectively, by DSC analysis. Thermal cycling test showed that the form-stable composite PCM has good thermal reliability and chemical stability although it was subjected to 1000 melting/freezing cycling.

The grain boundary diffusivity is measured by Whipple model and grain boundary assisted lattice diffusivity by plateau rise method using Pd depth profiles constructed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. It is established that grain boundary diffusivities are about six orders of magnitude faster than lattice diffusivities. Fine grained microstructure of Pd film, high abundance of defects in Mg film and higher stability associated with Pd-Mg intermetallics are responsible for the diffusion of Pd into grain boundaries and subsequently in the interiors of Mg. Besides the indiffusion of Pd, annealing also brings about an outdiffusion of Mg into Pd film. Examination by nuclear reaction analysis involving 24 Mg(p,p′γ) 24 Mg resonance reaction shows the occurrence of Mg outdiffusion. Minimization of surface energy is presumably the driving force of the process. In addition to Pd/Mg interface, diffusion occurs across Mg/Si (substrate) interface as well on increasing the annealing temperature above 473 K. These studies show that dehydrogenation of films accomplished by vacuum annealing should be limited to temperatures less than 473 K to minimize the loss of surface Pd, the catalyst of the hydrogen absorption-desorption process and Mg, the hydrogen storing element, by way of interfacial reactions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Acoustic measurements provide two simultaneous time-resolved signals; one signal is related to the velocity or frequency of the acoustic wave and is mainly a function of adsorbed mass, while the second signal, related to the oscillation amplitude, is associated with energy dissipation and is a function of the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed layer. The methods described in this chapter explore the relationship between the acoustic measurements of adsorbed liposomes and the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer. This is carried out using a well-characterized model system consisting of liposomes prepared from an unsaturated phospholipid and a range of mole fractions of cholesterol. Real-time acoustic measurements are shown to be sensitive to changes in the liposome cholesterol content, regardless of the mode of attachment of the liposome to the device surface. This sensitivity is not due to changes in the density of the bilayer, or to changes in the extent of liposome-surface interactions, thus leaving the mechanical properties of the bilayer as the feature that is probably being measured. Some mechanisms by which the acoustic response could be generated are suggested in this chapter. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A descriptor that captures the regional properties around a given pixel is first defined for this purpose. For each pixel, the descriptor is defined as a vector composed of filter responses with varying length. This descriptor is shown to give highly discriminating pattern with respect to the background region, text region, and near text region.

The products obtained with the different techniques were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffractometry, FT-IR spectroscopy and dissolution studies. For each method, the influence of different experimental conditions on the physical-chemical properties of the final products has been also investigated. DSC analysis was used to monitor physical stability of ternary complexes during 2 years storage under ambient conditions. MW irradiation resulted to be a rapid and very convenient preparation technique. In fact, it was more effective than the considered conventional methods, enabling obtainment in shorter times of products with better performance. In particular, the Keto-Meβ-Cd-EPC3 product prepared by MW treatment at 750 W for 10 min allowed achievement of about 80% of drug dissolution after 60 min, in comparison with the 50% and 63% values obtained for the corresponding products prepared by 30-min co-grinding or 60-min sealed-heating. Moreover, such ternary products were more effective in improving drug dissolution than the corresponding Keto-Meβ-Cd systems. Furthermore, the MW treatment at such irradiation energy enabled obtainment of totally dehydrated samples, which maintained unchanged solid-state characteristics and showed no susceptibility to ambient humidity after 2 years storage at ambient temperature. Therefore, MW-treated Keto-Meβ-Cd-EPC3 systems can be successfully used for formulation of tablets with enhanced drug dissolution behaviour. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Sensing technologies have developed new smart wireless devices which integrate sensing, processing, storage and communication capabilities. Smart sensors can programmatically measure physical quantities, perform simple computations, store, receive and transmit data. Querying the network entails the (frequent) acquisition of the appropriate sensor measurements. Since sensors are battery-powered and communication is the main source of power consumption, an important issue in this context is energy saving during data collection. This chapter thoroughly describes different clustering algorithms to efficiently discover spatial and temporal correlation among sensors and sensor readings. Discovered correlations allow the selection of a subset of good quality representatives of the whole network. Rather than directly querying all network nodes, only the representative sensors are queried to reduce the communication, computation and power consumption costs. Experiments with different clustering algorithms show the adaptability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899299444

For example, the next-generation of scientific applications such as many in high-energy physics, molecular modeling, and earth sciences will involve large collections of data created from simulations or experiments. The size of these data collections is expected to be of multi-terabyte or even petabyte scale in many applications. Ensuring efficient, reliable, secure and fast access to such large data is hindered by the high latencies of the Internet. The need to manage and access multiple petabytes of data in Grid environments, as well as to ensure data availability and access optimization are challenges that must be addressed. To improve data access efficiency, data can be replicated at multiple locations so that a user can access the data from a site near where it will be processed. In addition to the reduction of data access time, replication in Data Grids also uses network and storage resources more efficiently. In this chapter, the state of current research on data replication and arising challenges for the new generation of data-intensive grid environments are reviewed and open problems are identified. First, fundamental data replication strategies are reviewed which offer high data availability, low bandwidth consumption, increased fault tolerance, and improved scalability of the overall system. Then, specific algorithms for selecting appropriate replicas and maintaining replica consistency are discussed. The impact of data replication on job scheduling performance in Data Grids is also analyzed. A set of appropriate metrics including access latency, bandwidth savings, server load, and storage overhead for use in making critical comparisons of various data replication techniques is also discussed. Overall, this chapter provides a comprehensive study of replication techniques in Data Grids that not only serves as a tool to understanding this evolving research area but also provides a reference to which future e orts may be mapped. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898271083

Thereafter, a number of universities and organizations around the world started R&D programs. The word Pyrolysis meaning, chemical change brought about by heat or thermal cracking which is widely used, even in incineration technologies, Pyrolysis is a term being used to describe the chemical reaction and molecular break down, or degradation of materials. The biomass pyrolysis is attractive because solid biomass and wastes which are very difficult and costly to manage can be readily converted into liquid and gaseous products. These liquids, as crude bio-oil or slurry of charcoal of water or oil, have advantages in transport, storage, combustion, retrofitting and flexibility in production and marketing. Direct Combustion is the old way of using biomass. The biomass is completely transformed into heat, but the efficiency is just about 10 percent. The pyrolysis pushes to the maximum level of cracking of biomass by completely transforming it into a combustible gas before burning it. The disadvantage is rather low energy yield and the air pollution. There are several ways to make use of the energy contained in the biomass from old direct burning to gasification, pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is a form of incineration that chemically decomposes organic materials by heat in the absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis and gasification are thermal processes: they use high temperatures to break down any waste containing carbon. The pyrolysis process degrades waste to produce char (or ash), pyrolysis oil and synthetic gas. Synthetic gas has a calorific value, so it can be used as a fuel to generate electricity or steam, or used as a basic chemical in the petrochemical and refining industries. Other by-products include liquids (mainly water used for washing the gas cleans) and solid residues - ash, or char. The ratio of the yields of solid char and volatile pyrolysis products depends on temperature, pressure, and heating rate. Combustion of vegetation occurs in several consecutive stages: distillation, endothermic pyrolysis, exothermic pyrolysis, ignition, flaming combustion and smoldering combustion.Gaseous organic and inorganic emissions, as well as readily condensable compounds (tars), are produced during these stages. However, the composition and rates of emission vary significantly among the different combustion stages. Depending upon the process they are classified in different cracking processes like Hydro cracking, Catalytic Cracking, Thermal Cracking, Anhydrous pyrolysis, hydrous pyrolysis (Steam cracking) and Vacuum pyrolysis. A number of types of pyrolysis have like Fixed bed reactor, Fluid bed reactor, Microwave pyrolysis, Ultrasonic pyrolysis, Supercritical fluid pyrolysis and Plasma Pyrolysis been developed to meet the different needs. A large number of chemical reactions take place during these pyrolysis processes, most of them based on free radicals. Pyrolysis is the most important technique in the present situation as it converts waste in to valuable products which are having high calorific values and can be utilized for increasing demand of energy. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Many historic buildings in Italy were split between summer and winter apartments. the summer apartment was located on the ground floor and fresoced. Its cool indoor climate was due to the presence of surrounding gardens and to the high thermal inertia of the ground and wall.

Fat imparts palatability to food, serves as a vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and supplies essential fatty acids. The digestion products of fats, along with endogenously synthesized lipids, provide a diverse group of molecules that play a critical role in multiple metabolic processes. Triacylglycerols are the major storage form of energy in animals. They also protect the body against both cold and heat loss and protect many organs from trauma due to external forces associated with day-to-day living. Lipids are vital components of cell membranes and take part in many inter-and intra-cellular signalling cascades. Lipids have multiple forms and functions, including vitamins, steroid hormones, and eicosanoids that are involved in many metabolic processes. In the previous edition of this series, Gurr (1994) provided a chapter on the nutritional signiWcance of lipids, which included aspects of their physiology and biochemistry. Since then, considerable advances have been made in lipid research, which Gurr et al. (2002) have covered recently in a very readable textbook. This chapter concentrates on the nutritional signiWcance of milk lipids, a subject that has received scant attention in recent times. This omission is, no doubt, inXuenced by the negative nutritional image milk fat has acquired in recent decades due to its perceived association with coronary artery disease, and more recently to the belief that fat in general may be linked to cancer at some sites and to the current obesity epidemic.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885804655

Each sensor node typically includes a sensing component responsible for data acquisition from the physical environment.

The power source often consists of a battery with a limited energy capacity. In many applications, sensor nodes may not be easily accessible because of the locations where they are deployed or the large scale of such networks. In both cases, network maintenance for energy replenishment becomes impractical.

Zinc is an essential element in human and animal nutrition with different and important roles. Zinc plays catalytic, structural, or regulatory functions in the more than 300 metalloenzymes that have been identified in biological systems involved in nucleic acid and protein metabolism and the production of energy. Physiologically, zinc is vital for growth and development, sexual maturation and reproduction, dark vision adaptation, olfactory and gustatory activity, insulin storage and release, and a variety of host immune defenses. Selenium, although toxic in large doses, is an essential micronutrient for animals. It is a component of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as a cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants. Selenium deficiency results also in atrophy degeneration and necrosis of cartilage tissue. The selenoproteins that result from expression of these genes are responsible for the biochemical functions of selenium. The possible functional use of Se in cosmetics is linked to its role in preventing oxidative stress due to free radical molecules. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, the application of these technologies is subject to the high capital and operative costs. This need a great scientific and technical effort in order to optimize the processes and the equipments, thus reducing the hydrogen production cost. In this field, Sotacarbo has build up a pilot platform for a combined production of hydrogen and electrical energy from coal. The platform includes two different units: a 5 MWth demonstrative plant (with a fuel capacity of 700 kg/h of coal) and a 200 kWth pilot plant (feed with 35 kg/h of coal). While the main goal of the demonstrative plant is the optimization of the gasification process, the pilot plant has been designed to develop and optimize the syngas treatment line for hydrogen production and power generation, with CO2 separation. This paper reports a description of the overall experimental equipment, with particular reference to the pilot plant (which includes a fixed-bed up-draft gasifier, a syngas depulveration system, a cold and hot gas desulphurization processes, an integrated CO-shift and CO2 absorption system, a PSA section for hydrogen purification and a syngas-feed internal combustion engine for power generation). A critical analysis of the main results obtained in the first experimental campaign in the pilot plant has been presented, together with a global hydrogen and carbon balance. Moreover, the results of a preliminary test carried out in order to evaluate the possibility to operate coal gasification with mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide as oxidant agent has been reported. These results allowed to obtain useful indications to improve the plant performances and to optimize each syngas treatment and hydrogen production process.","Carbon capture and storage; CO2-free; Coal-to-hydrogen; Experimental plant","Carbon capture and storage; Coal-to-hydrogen; Desulphurization process; Experimental plant; Hydrogen production costs; Hydrogen production process; Large scale hydrogen production; Power generation plants; Air purification; Carbon capture; Coal; Coal gasification; Hydrogen production; Internal combustion engines; Optimization; Pilot plants; Synthesis gas; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877684559

This has created a significant, and indeed unique, capture demonstration and research hub and represents a critical milestone on the pathway to large scale abatement of greenhouse gases by carbon dioxide capture and storage from fossils fuels and particularly Victorian brown coal. The first component of the research hub is International Power's CO2 Capture Project, which was designed to initially capture 25 tonnes per day (and is expandable to 50 tonne per day) of CO2 from flue gas using an amino acid based solvent process. The CO2 is being used on site for neutralisation of ash water which replaces the current use of sulphuric acid and results in the formation of calcium carbonate in a form of mineral sequestration. The plant has a footprint of 24 m x 10 m and a height of up to 27 m and provides an imposing introduction of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to the site. The second component of the research hub is the CO2CRC's H3 Project which is being used to research novel and conventional CO2 capture techniques at a range of sizes. The H3 Project is testing solvent systems, the membranes processes of gas separation and gas absorption membranes and adsorbents processes using vacuum swing adsorption. The absorption/stripping processes are being tested in the HCCP initially with the amino acid solvents and then using potassium carbonate utilising patented technologies developed by the CO2CRC. The novel processes are being trialled in purpose built rigs designed specifically for the task. This paper provides background on the development of these projects and the technologies and equipment employed, discusses the commissioning process and provides initial data and analysis of the first stages of the work. Furthermore it outlines the opportunities and challenges these technologies face in progressing from laboratory through to eventual large scale commercial operation. The eventual aim of this work is to develop cost effective designs and flow sheets for both retrofit and new build configurations. Initial work on heat integration linked to these projects indicates significant improvements over current thinking for the parasitic energy of post combustion capture.

With 174 billion barrels of recoverable reserves, Alberta's oil sands rank second in the world after Saudi Arabia. Currently over 1 million barrels per day oil sands crude are produced in Alberta most of which is exported via pipelines to the United States markets. Coal reserves total over 34 billion tonnes consisting primarily of sub-bituminous coal. Current coal production is over 37 million tonnes per year, most of which is used for thermal power generation. Alberta's oil sands and coal industries are energy intensive and account for over 50% of Alberta's total carbon emissions and about 15% of Canada's total emissions. Although Alberta's contribute less than 0.2% of the world's carbon emissions, long term sustainable development of these large resources requires on-going technical innovation. As the technology arm of the Alberta Government, the Alberta Energy Research Institute (AERI) has since 2002 been working in partnership with industry to evaluate, develop and demonstrate new and improved technologies for converting our coal and oil sands into cleaner energy products, and in January 2008 the Government of Alberta released its new Climate Change Strategy. The goal of the Strategy is to ensure that the province remains at the forefront of achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The Strategy takes action on three fronts: implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS); greening energy production; and conserving and using energy more efficiently. CCS technology involves capturing CO2 emissions from large industrial sources and transporting them by pipeline to sites where they are injected into deep rock formations for permanent storage. Alberta has unique attributes that favour successful CCS operations including close proximity of large emitters to both deep saline aquifers with large sequestration capacity and oil reservoirs amenable to CO2 enhanced oil recovery. CCS projects are expensive, and innovative processes have higher technical and financial risks. Given these risk, the Government of Alberta established a $2 billion Carbon Capture and Storage Fund (CCSF) in July, 2008 to support demonstration projects that undertake to advance the broader adoption of CCS technologies in Alberta. The ultimate goal of the CCSF is to encourage the development of three to five large scale integrated CCS facilities that will capture and permanently store up to 5 million tonnes per year of CO2 by 2015, for a period of at least 10 years. This initiative is an important first step in the broader adoption of CCS in the province and aims to create the momentum for private sector investments for CCS. In reaching this goal, greenhouse emissions at facilities such as coal-fired electricity plants, oil sands extraction sites, upgraders, and other large scale industrial facilities will be reduced. Given the strategic importance of oil sands operations and the perception that oil sands derived crude oil is ""dirtier"" than other crudes, AERI undertook a robust life cycle analysis (LCA) comparison of oil sands versus conventional crudes processed in the US. This recently completed study was carried out under the direction of a publically vetted steering team from government, academia and industry. The presentation summarizes the LCA results, describes Alberta's CCS Strategy and the status of the CCS projects (coal and oil sands based), and gives an overview of the technologies being developed in the AERI-Industry program.",,"Carbon capture and storage; Coal-fired electricity; Demonstration project; Enhanced oil recovery; Industrial facilities; Private-sector investments; Technology development; Thermal power generation; Aquifers; Bituminous coal; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal industry; Crude oil; Electric power generation; Energy resources; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Investments; Life cycle; Oil sands; Technology; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877643227

As such, unless the original combustion train fuel is lignite, the range of co-firing with wood is generally less than 15% of the energy duty. Biocarbon Energy Pellets are biomass-based fuel that has been engineered for compatibility with installed coal combustion trains. The starting ligno-cellulosic biomass has been thermally carbonized to fuel biocarbon, which is basically a charcoal that is manufactured to higher volatile matter content than biocarbons intended for soil application, metal refining or adsorption applications. The carbonization conditions are flexible enough to fine-tune the resultant biocarbon combustion properties to the intended combustion outlet with respect to combustion reactivity and rate of heat release. The actual physical properties of the biocarbon are typically different from the original coal fuel properties due to the higher porosity and internal surface area of biocarbons. After carbonization, the biocarbon is further processed for the supply chain requirements and can, again, be tailored to the specifics of the intended destination for the biocarbon product. The starting biocarbon is low density and very friable. It is subsequently processed to achieve higher density to improve transportation economics and formed into a variety of shapes, including pellets, briquettes and larger extruded cross-sections and lengths. The water-repellency and crush properties can be adjusted to meet specific supply chain conditions, including extended unprotected storage. The paper will review the overall carbonization and densification technologies, then focus on the range of physical and chemical properties available for Biocarbon Energy Pellets and other shapes of densified biocarbon. The categories explored are the biomass fuel properties, over the range from wet biomass as harvested to low volatility charcoals, the impact of fuel properties on transportation costs, the impact of fuel properties on compatibility with existing coal combustion equipment, and biocarbon on-site storage issues.",,"Biomass-based fuels; Carbonization conditions; Chemical and physical characteristics; Internal surface area; Physical and chemical properties; Rate of heat release; Supply chain requirements; Transportation economics; Biomass; Carbonization; Charcoal; Chemical properties; Coal; Fuel storage; Fuels; Metal refining; Pelletizing; Supply chains; Transportation; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877638182

Although it is not strictly present in polar bears (. Ursus maritimus) or sea otters (. Enhydra lutris), all cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds have blubber and it may comprise up to 50% of the body mass of some species at certain life stages. Blubber has long been recognized as the primary and most important site of fat, and thus also energy storage in marine mammals. However, blubber also has a number of other important functions. The blubber layer serves as an insulator in mammals living in often cold marine environments and is thus central to their entire process of thermoregulation. Blubber also affects buoyancy and functions as a body streamliner and elastic spring for efficient hydrodynamic locomotion. Although blubber is a dynamic tissue, which can reflect both nutritional state and life history stage of individuals, the tissue itself has likely evolved to best suit the lifestyles, stresses, and constraints of specific groups and even individual species of marine mammals. Hence, the study of blubber can provide unique insights not only into phylogenetic relationships and environmental adaptations but also into aspects of individual feeding habits, foraging ecology, species distribution, and demography that are otherwise difficult to study. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Solar water heaters in the past have been fabricated using different materials, which are expensive to the common man. The main barrier for a common man to use a solar water heater is its high cost. The present investigation describes the device of a low cost solar water heater which has been fabricated at our institute using locally avilable materials. The device is inexpensive and reduces the cost of solar water heater to a minimum. In this device coil of PVC pipe, coated with black paint is affixed in an insulated box, which faces the sun. During the daytime, the water inside the PVC coil gets heated up to 55 - 65°C due to exposure to sun. This usually takes 2-3 hours. The hot water is released into a storage tank, whose capacity is equal to the total volume of water in the PVC coil. The solar water heater, thus fabricated is capable to heat the water up to 55 - 65°C and is durable for several years. The heat loss encountered with this device is usually 5°C. It can be fabricated with ease and can be used even by the common man.

At present times there's a high request for a reliable technology developed for domestic applications at distributed level.

The machine, acting cyclically between desorption and adsorption, is provided of an heat storage to separate the cooling energy availability from the solar radiation.

The system may be scaled up or down in cooling capacity, acting on the porous adsorbing material volumes, and in cooling power, changing the air mass flow through the system.

The cost of a concentrator PV system is dominated by its structure and drive system. The size of these items is determined principally by the highest wind forces that will ever be experienced by the structure. If the concentrator structure need not deal with high winds, it can be implemented with a structure of very low mass and cost. The means to this end is the immersion on demand of the relatively delicate lens - thus avoiding the high wind pressures. The collectors form an array on a water surface where they can dip in for protection, and also achieve operational cooling from the water, as cooling is also a significant cost in conventional concentrators. We show a typical power output from a small model, which predicts the likely performance of larger systems. Estimates have been made for the limit costs of such collectors based on quantities of materials utilised. It is proposed that such collectors deployed on the surface of a dam used for hydroelectric generation would offset large amounts of daytime water usage by the dam's turbines, allowing effective storage of the solar generated electricity without cost.

Nevertheless, in Chile, the solar energy is mainly used for applications of solar domestic hot water and production of electrical energy in rural areas , not having until now the solar cooling, a favorable scene of investigation. Within the heat assisted technologies, there are so called absorption cooling systems, which base their operation in the production of cold supplying hot water from solar collectors. The main objective of this work is to develop a computational model that allows the simulation of an hourly basis for an absorption refrigeration system assisted by solar energy and natural gas as auxiliary fuel.

The results of the optimization process of the absorption refrigeration system assisted by solar energy, indicate that an area of 110 m2 of flat plate collectors with an inclination of 33° and 7 m3 storage tank provides an annual solar fraction of 70%, getting to cover the demand of air conditioning in a house of 149 m2 located in Santiago, maximizing the gain of useful energy of the system and minimizing the consumption of auxiliary energy.

Acoustic emission (AE) measurement is an alternative for this as it has the ability to detect crack initiations or rubbing between moving surfaces. However, AE measurement requires high sampling frequency and consequently huge amount of data are obtained to be processed. It also requires expensive hardware to capture those data, storage and involves signal processing techniques to retrieve valuable information on the state of the machine. AE signal has been utilised for early detection of defects in bearings and gears. This paper presents an online condition monitoring (CM) system for slow speed machinery, which attempts to overcome those challenges. The system incorporates relevant signal processing techniques for slow speed CM which include noise removal techniques to enhance the signal-to-noise and peak-holding down sampling to reduce the burden of massive data handling. The analysis software works under Labview environment, which enables online remote control of data acquisition, real-time analysis, offline analysis and diagnostic trending. The system has been fully implemented on a site machine and contributing significantly to improve the maintenance efficiency and provide a safer and reliable operation.","Acoustic Emission; Condition Monitoring; Low Speed Machinery; Rolling Element Bearing","AE signals; Analysis softwares; Detection of defects; Down sampling; Expensive hardware; LabViEW; Low impact energy; Low speed; Machinery condition monitoring; Maintenance efficiency; Moving surfaces; Noise removal; Off-line analysis; On-line condition monitoring system; Online condition monitoring; Real time analysis; Reliable operation; Rolling Element Bearing; Sampling frequencies; Signal processing technique; Signal to noise; Slow speed; Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Acoustic noise; Asset management; Computer programming languages; Condition monitoring; Data handling; Defects; Digital storage; Life cycle; Machinery; Signal processing; Speed",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871519104

These conditions can lead to significant problems on the grid, significantly reducing the carrying capacity of power lines or forcing the curtailment of wind generation. CSIRO is developing a smart energy storage system to reduce wind generation fluctuations by the application of fast response storage. This smoothing approach requires less expensive storage than conventional approaches which attempt to absorb total generation. Smoother output reduces the need for ancillary power services and can avoid the de-rating of power lines or even defer power infrastructure upgrades. CSIRO Ultrabattery technology is used in the system, which combines the benefits of low cost lead acid battery energy storage together with an internal ultra-capacitor enabling faster charge/discharge and longer life (Figure 2). The Ultrabattery, which was originally developed for hybrid car use, is being used here at a much larger scale. The Ultrabattery has been combined with predictive smoothing algorithms which utilise wind forecasting techniques, reducing the amount of storage required for a given effect. A grid-connected demonstration with a full-scale wind turbine system is being installed (360kW/200kWhr) on a 660kW wind turbine in 2009. Support is from the Australian Government Advanced Electricity Storage Technology fund together with Ecoult (see www.ecoult.com). Demonstrations at MW-scale are being planned.",,"Charge/discharge; Conventional approach; Energy storage systems; Fast response; Fluctuating wind; Forecasting techniques; Grid-connected; Hybrid cars; Intelligent storage; Lead acid; Low costs; Power infrastructures; Power lines; Smoothing algorithms; Storage technology; Substantial variations; Ultracapacitors; Weather conditions; Wind energy generation; Wind generation; Wind turbine systems; Automobiles; Electric energy storage; Electric lines; Electric power transmission networks; Exhibitions; Weather forecasting; Wind turbines; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869992765

This article addresses part of the thermal design of a battery storage system, based on commercially available lithium battery technology. During the design process the model assisted in assessment of design choices by checking that battery temperature rise would remain within acceptable levels. The final design is based on eight modules in parallel called PowerBlocks, where each module consists of thirty lithium batteries in series (30×12.8V = 384V; 130Ah) and a three phase converter. The complete battery storage system was modeled thermally, where validation of the model was done in the laboratory. Based on the experimental results from the validation a safe operating area was defined, which marks the thermal boundaries of the system.

However, due to the need to have them encapsulated within a container this density is reduced. Furthermore, PCMs have a low thermal conductivity which reduces the useful amount of energy which can be stored. To consider these factors, the true energy storage density of a PCM system was proposed and optimised for PCMs encapsulated in slabs. Using a validated numerical model of the system, a parametric study was undertaken to investigate the impact of the slab thickness, gap between slabs and the mass flow rate. The study showed that, when optimised, a PCM system can deliver a true energy storage density between 53% and 83% of the latent energy density of the PCM.","Phase change material; Refrigeration; Sustainability; Thermal energy storage","Energy density; Energy storage density; Low thermal conductivity; Mass flow rate; Optimisations; Parametric study; PCM systems; Phase-change thermal storages; Refrigeration system; Slab thickness; Thermal storage; Phase change materials; Refrigeration; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865577842

Loads for an actual house in the City of Milton near Toronto were estimated. TRNSYS, a system simulation software tool, was used to model the yearly performance of conventional GSHP as well as the proposed hybrid GSHP system. The house was equipped with data monitoring system which was installed to read and record fluid flow, temperature and electricity consumption in different components of the system. The actual yearly data collected from the site was examined against the simulation results. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the relationship between the solar collector area and the ground loop exchanger (GHX) length. It was shown that the ratio of GHX length reduction to solar panel area of 4.7 m/m2, results the optimum ratio which corresponds to 32m GHX length reduction with 6.81m2 solar collectors area. This study demonstrates that hybrid ground source heat pump system combined with solar thermal collectors is a feasible choice for space conditioning for heating dominated houses. It was shown that the solar thermal energy storage in the ground could reduce a large amount of ground loop heat exchanger length. Combining three solar thermal collectors with total area of 6.81m2 to the GSHP system will reduce GHX length by 15% (from 222m to 188m). The system malfunctioning in the cooling season was also detected and options for fixing the problem were presented. Sensitivity analysis was carried on different cities of Canada and results were demonstrated that Vancouver, with mildest climate compared to other cities, was the best candidate for the proposed solar hybrid GSHP system with 7.64 m/m2 GHX length reduction to solar collector area ratio. Overall system economic viability was also evaluated using a 20-year life-cycle cost analysis. The analysis showed that there is small economic benefit in comparing to GSHP.

A numerical model of a magazine subjected to 2.3 kg (5 lb) C-4 charge explosives were built based on the Nelson and Watt's experimental test. For an ALE algorithm to occur, a Lagrangian mesh is spatially overlap with an Eulerian mesh. The magazine is assumed to be rigid material for simplifying the numerical model and for reducing computation time. Effect of temperature on initial internal energy in air was considered. The result showed that overpressure and impulse values at wall for air with room temperature were significantly lower than the experimental values.

Thirty bovine incisors were prepared to expose the dentin surface and then divided into two main groups based upon the decontamination process and storage procedure: autoclaved (group A, n=15) or stored in aqueous thymol solution (group B, n=15). The surfaces of the dentin slices were schematically divided into four areas, with each one corresponding to a treatment subgroup. The specimens were either etched with phosphoric acid (control subgroup) or irradiated with erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser (subgroups: I-80mJ, II-120mJ, and III-180mJ). Samples were analyzed by micro-EDXRF, yielding three spectra for each area (before and after treatment). Surface mappings covering an area of 80×60 points with steps of 20μm were also performed on selected specimens. The amount of Ca and P in group A specimens decreased significantly (P<0.05) after the acid etching and the Ca/P ratio increased (P<0.001). Er:YAG laser-etching using lower laser energies did not produce significant changes in dentin components. The mapping data support the hypothesis that acid etching on dentin produced a more chemically homogeneous surface and thus a more favorable surface for the diffusion of adhesive monomers. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","dentin; dentin mapping; energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry; Er:YAG laser; manipulation treatment","dentin; dentin mapping; Energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometries; Er:YAG lasers; manipulation treatment; Decontamination; Etching; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Mapping; Phenols; Phosphoric acid; Spectrometry; X rays; Yttrium; Erbium; Bovinae; animal; article; cattle; chemistry; dentin; incisor; methodology; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation response; solid state laser; spectrometry; Animals; Cattle; Dentin; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Incisor; Lasers, Solid-State; Radiation Dosage; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80455140595

A novel way of energy-free adjustment of gravity equilibrators is possible by introducing the concept of a storage spring.The storage spring supplies or stores the energy necessary to adjust the balancer spring of the gravity equilibrator. In essence the storage spring mechanism maintains a constant potential energy within the spring mechanism; energy is exchanged between the storage and balancer spring when needed. Various conceptual designs using both zero-free-length springs and regular extension springs are proposed. Two models were manufactured demonstrating the practical embodiments and functionality.

Designing an effective WSN requires a good piece of engineer work, not to mention the research contribution needed to provide a credible deployment. As a matter of fact, to solve our application, we are looking for a monitoring framework scalable, adaptive with respect to topological changes in the network, intelligent in its ability to react to evolutions in the external environment, power-aware in its middleware components and endowed with energy harvesting mechanisms to grant a long lifetime for the network. The paper addresses all main aspects related to the design of a WSN ranging from the possible- need of an ad-hoc embedded system, to sensing, local and remote transmission, data storage and visualization.

Typically, these systems operate at relatively high temperatures leading to high heat losses from the ground storage volume and to low solar collector efficiencies. In this paper, a new seasonal storage strategy is proposed. First, the storage temperature is kept relatively low in order to limit heat losses and improve solar collector efficiencies. Secondly, the seasonal borehole storage is designed in such a way as to enable simultaneous charging and discharging of the ground using four pipe boreholes with two independent counter-current circuits. Finally, the temperature level is raised using heat pumps to supply heat at an acceptable temperature for space heating. The proposed configuration is simulated with TRNSYS using a modified version of the DST model. Results from simulations indicate that it is possible to keep the seasonal storage temperature at an annual average slightly above the annual mean ambient temperature using a relatively small solar collector area (about 11 m2 per house) leading to relatively high solar collector efficiencies. Combined with a heat pump, it is shown that this system can reach a solar fraction of 78%.",,"Annual average; Annual mean; Borehole heat exchangers; Counter current; Heat pumps; High temperature; Housing community; Seasonal storage; Solar fraction; Storage temperatures; Storage volumes; Temperature level; Boreholes; Collector efficiency; Computer simulation; Heat losses; Heat pump systems; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955739567

Construction of over-wrapped composite pressure vessels with inner metallic liner is for instance compatible with standards requirements of the hydrogen technology of energy storage. Therefore a typical layout manufactured by some industries consists of a cylindrical vessel with covering of carbon-epoxy laminates and metallic impermeable liner. To allow the filament winding of the composite fibres are used hoop and helical layers, respectively. A single nozzle is usually built. It requires that the vessel material is reinforced. This need imposes to have a variable thickness in the composite layer. In practice, fibres orientation angle and thickness are both variable. These aspects make hard a straight design operation by means of analytical approaches. In this paper a numerical design toolbox is developed. It includes a preliminary definition of the fibres network, found by the so-called netting analysis, the theory of composite laminates and the structural optimisation through the Finite Element Method.

Although the production of biodiesel from triglyceride by trans-esterification is currently the primary route for the production of transportation fuel, hydrotreating of triglyceride have been studied very recently to overcome problems caused by biodiesel during engine operation, handling, and storage. However, hydrotreating of triglyceride is known to consume large amount of hydrogen. In this study, new route for hydrocarbon production has been developed. The main idea is that pure hydrocarbon was produced by decarboxylation of triglycerides and fatty acids with minimized hydrogen consumption. Various types of catalysts were applied for this purpose.

Recently, porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great attention because of their potential applications as hydrogen storage materials. We have prepared various porous metal-organic frameworks, some of which showed remarkably high H2 storage capacity. In particular, MOFs with vacant coordination sites on metal centers show much higher hydrogen storage capacity than those without them in gravimetric and volumetric units of the sample, due to the higher isosteric heats of hydrogen adsorption. We have introduced mono-dispersed and small metal (Ag, Au, and Pd) nanoparticles in the MOFs by the simple immersion of the redox-active MOFs in the metal ion solutions at ambient temperature in the absence of extra reducing agent and capping agent.

Micro-CHP technologies that can produce thermal and electric energy at a small district, or even detached household level, are beginning to emerge. Despite certain similarities, micro-CHP systems for residences differ from conventional CHP in many aspects. Micro-CHP systems should not be designed to meet only one specific goal - electrical efficiency - but should rather be based on the residential energy needs including space and water heating, electrical power, cooling and indoor air quality and comfort. In this paper, integration of micro-CHP into residential heating/cooling systems has been explored. The structure of a micro-CHP system incorporating a heat pump (CHP/HP) was designed and examined. When integrating micro-CHP into residential heating systems, a thermal energy storage (TES) unit is required to store thermal energy and deliver it more intensively on demand, thus satisfying space and/or water heating needs. The design concept of the TES unit was proposed. The electrical and thermal efficiencies of micro-CHP/HP systems have been simulated against varying operating conditions, showing that more than 30% primary energy savings could be achieved as compared to grid electricity plus fuel-fired heating systems.","Heat pump; Micro-CHP; Thermal efficiency; Thermal energy storage","A-thermal; Design concept; Electric energies; Electrical efficiency; Electrical power; Grid electricity; Heat pumps; Heating system; High energy efficiency; Household level; Indoor air quality; Market potential; Micro-CHP; Micro-combined heat and power; Operating condition; Primary energy savings; Residential application; Residential energy; Residential heating; Residential homes; Thermal efficiency; Water heating; Air conditioning; Air quality; Energy efficiency; Flywheels; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Indoor air pollution; Integration; Pumps; Thermal energy; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149379060

The grape is a perennial culture, with a deep radicular system, that is able be adjusted, to certain point, to a limited supply of water. For determining the hydric need of the culture, we adopted the model proposed by FAO, that uses the equation of Penman-Monteith to define the évapotranspiration. We also considered, a layer of water for washing the soil, to avoid salinization. With the purpose of attending the hydric demand of the plant the following factors were considered: pumped volume, pluviométrie precipitation, storage of water in the soil and area to be irrigated, interrelated by the equation of mass conservation. The pumped volume is estimated by utilizability method, starting from the characteristic curve of the pump and the average monthly collected solar radiation. Finally the equipment used in the irrigation project is dimensioned and an economic analysis is carried out.","Concentrator type V; Irrigation systems; Photovoltaic pumping system","Characteristic curve; Concentrator type V; Economical analysis; Irrigation projects; Irrigation systems; Mass conservation; Penman-Monteith; Photovoltaic pumping system; Productive chain; Semiarid area; Arid regions; Biofuels; Coatings; Concentration (process); Economic analysis; Fluidics; Irrigation; Nanotechnology; Pumping plants; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Soil conservation; Soils; Sun; Water supply; Water management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958048828

The effect of MWNT concentration (0.5-7 wt%) and nanotube surface treatment (oxidative treatment in a tubular furnace at 500°C for 1 - 2 hr in a 95% nitrogen, 5% oxygen atmosphere) was investigated by several experimental techniques. Scanning electron microscopy showed good adhesion and dispersion of nanotubes in the matrix, independently of the surface treatment. TG analysis suggests that the incorporation of MWNT in the polymer results in increased oxidative stability. Electrical and rheological measurements showed that the oxidative treatment, causing some reduction of the MWNT quality (indicated by Raman Spectroscopy), decreases the efficiency of the nanotube-matrix interaction. The evaluated electrical percolation threshold is in good agreement with rheological percolation threshold. The isothermal quiescent crystallization, studied by rheometric techniques, clearly indicates that increasing the MWNT concentration in the composite the onset of crystallization occurs earlier. Such a behavior confirms the nanotube nucleant effect previously observed by non-isothermal DSC. Finally, flow induced crystallization has been investigated.","Carbon nanotubes; Electrical properties; Viscoelasticity","Electrical percolation threshold; Electrical property; Experimental techniques; Flow-induced crystallization; matrix; Melt mixing; Nanotube surface; Non-isothermal DSC; Nucleants; Oxidative stability; Oxidative treatment; Oxygen atmosphere; Percolation thresholds; Polyethylene nanocomposites; Rheological measurements; Tubular furnaces; Twin screw extruders; Biofuels; Carbon nanotubes; Coatings; Crystallization; Elasticity; Electric properties; Fluidics; Nanocomposites; Nanotechnology; Oxygen; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Percolation (solid state); Polyethylenes; Raman spectroscopy; Renewable energy resources; Rheology; Scanning electron microscopy; Solvents; Surface treatment; Thermoplastics; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958048152

Its various formulations are prepared to obtain different properties. The aim of this study is to characterise the aging properties of MTV ignition composition. In this study two different fuel rich formulations are analyzed. For the formulations Magnesium is used as fuel, Teflon and Viton B are used as binder system. In order to see the effect of binder content, magnesium percentage is kept as constant and Teflon/Viton ratio is changed. While first formulation has 8 % Viton B, second formulation has 14 % Viton B. After preparing the samples, they are packaged in bags and heat sealed. These samples are kept in conditioning chambers at different temperatures such as 50 °C, 57 °C and 70 °C. The samples are stored in these chambers for 4, 6, 8 and 10 months. At the end of each period, the samples are taken in order to measure the physical and performance parameters; such as bulk density, calorific value, friction and impact sensitivity, magnesium purity, DSC and TGA endothermic energy and peaks. The results are compared with reference values. Another test group is prepared in order to see the effect of moisture as well as temperature. These samples are kept at 57°C and 70°C temperature with 3 different moisture levels. Constant moisture environment is maintained with saturated chemical salts solutions. Both open and packaged configurations of MTV composition are prepared and exposed to those conditions. Weight increase of the samples is monitored until stationary measurement is obtained, then aging process is terminated and the samples are tested again. DSC/TGA, calorific value and purity tests are carried out on the samples. These results were compared with the reference samples. It is observed that high temperature together with humidity is the dominant factor on aging of MTV. Therefore drying before packing and sealing against humidity is required for long term storage and better aging performance. © 2009 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Accelerated aging; Aging performance; Aging process; Aging properties; Binder content; Binder systems; Bulk density; Chemical salts; Dominant factor; DSC and TGA; High temperature; Impact sensitivities; Long-term storage; Magnesium-teflon-viton; Moisture environment; Moisture level; Performance parameters; Pyrotechnic compositions; Reference values; Atmospheric humidity; Binders; Calorific value; Military applications; Moisture; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Propulsion; Magnesium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957846475

The greatest impact of overweight and obesity in adolescents is the appearance of related physical and psychosocial comorbidity and the tracking of these into adulthood. Thus, there is a strong imperative to treat adolescent overweight and obesity before lifestyles become entrenched and significant comorbidity intervenes.

Because the chemical process selectively removes the fission products, the verification can no longer rely on observation of conventional attributes such as gamma emissions of Cs-137. The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a feasibility study to determine the most suitable verification method able to provide evidence of presence of HEU in the sealed containers prior to loading in dry storage casks. Recognizing that HEU does not provide any observable passive signal, detection of neutrons from induced fissions was found to be the best method to detect the presence of HEU. However utilizing a coincidence neutron instrument to differentiate between interrogation and induced fission neutrons would be impractical, expansive and bulky. Therefore, extensive Monte Carlo simulations were run to determine a design supporting differential transmission active neutron measurement. The optimized design reduces the detector yield to the interrogation source while the induced neutrons have higher detection probability. The differential transmission technique enhances the signal to noise ratio and allows implementing a simple total neutron counting technique. Rather than designing a new counter the existing Safeguards MOx PYthon (SMOPY) device was selected as it supports both total neutron counting and gamma spectrometry. A special mechanical arrangement was prepared to safely accommodate both an americium-beryllium and the SMOPY measurement device into an integrated measurement station meant to be submerged in the spent fuel pond at Petten. The verification was smoothly carried out during the storage cask loading without significant impact on the loading schedule. Presence of induced neutrons was certified on each container selected for verification and semi quantitative evaluation of the data was even possible. The measurement method is applicable to any similar cases where HEU residues are generated from the production of medical radioisotopes. ©2009 IEEE.","IAEA; Neutron; Safeguards","Active neutron interrogation; Chemical process; Cylindrical containers; Detection probabilities; Differential transmission; Dry storage casks; Feasibility studies; Fission neutrons; Gamma emission; Gamma spectrometry; IAEA; International Atomic Energy Agency; Interrogation sources; Measurement device; Measurement methods; Medical radioisotopes; Monte Carlo Simulation; Neutron counting; Neutron instruments; Neutron measurements; Optimized designs; Semi-quantitative; Significant impacts; Similar case; Storage casks; Verification method; Americium; Beryllium; Cesium; Computer simulation; Containers; Detectors; Fission products; Loading; Measurements; Monte Carlo methods; Nuclear instrumentation; Radioisotopes; Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Spent fuels; Neutrons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954891959

The size of sensors operating wirelessly decreases with the advent of advancement in device processing technologies like micro- and nano-electromechanical systems. This decrease in dimensions of sensors causes serious problem for battery storage capacity. We address this issue and propose a model of communication and recharging of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes simultaneously using passive optical communication. We propose both Line-of-Sight and Quasi-diffuse communication for this purpose. There are some situations where direct LOS is better option while at non-line-of-sight, the energy of a multi-spot Quasi-diffuse beam can be utilized. In our model we have used modified Corner Cube Retroreflector (CCR) and a newly proposed device Thinfilm Corner Cube Retroreflector (TCCR) for passive communication and recharging sensor nodes. These devices have large angle of diversity due to which they can provide communication facility to large areas.

This makes it imperative to lay major thrust upon the search of alternative energy sources. Atmospheric air also offers one of the cost effective energy conversion system. The compressed air can be utilized as potential zero pollution working fluid for producing shaft work in the air turbine prime-mover for light vehicle. This paper details the mathematical modeling and performance evaluation of a small capacity compressed air driven vaned type novel air turbine. Effect of impingement and expansion action of high pressure air for different dimensional situations of casing and rotor diameters of the turbine have been considered and analyzed here. Study shows that the impingement work has significant contribution in total work output and varies from 2.4% to 16.8%, when other parameters like injection angle and vane angle are kept constant at 22.5° and 36° respectively and injection pressure varies from 2 to 6 bars,. It is also concluded that the expansion work as well as total work is optimum when casing diameter (D) and rotor diameter (d) are 90 mm and 85 mm respectively.

For fuelling road transportation there has been much speculation about the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, which proponents claim would usher in the ""Hydrogen Economy"". The concept of the ""complete energy conversion chain"" has been used to compare the overall energy consumption and CO2 emissions from vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells with those from vehicles using a battery and electric drive. The analysis shows that if a sustainable source of electricity is used to produce hydrogen, then the hydrogen and fuel cell system is just equivalent to a battery. The efficiency of these two different approaches has been compared, and shows that the hydrogen system would consume nearly three times the primary energy required by a battery storage system. Conventional batteries do not, however, have a sufficiently high energy storage density to provide the range needed for most drivers. A new generation of plug-in hybrid vehicles is being developed which take advantage of the best attributes of both electric vehicles and conventional fossil-fuelled vehicles. These vehicles show promise to dramatically reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases produced each year by the transportation sector.

First, magnesium sulfate was investigated in detail using TG-DSC apparatus. The results of this study revealed that magnesium sulfate is able to store almost 10 times more energy than water of the same volume. However, the material was unable to take up water (and release heat) under practical conditions. A new theoretical study identified three salt hydrates besides magnesium sulfate as promising materials for compact seasonal heat storage: aluminum sulfate, magnesium chloride and calcium chloride. These salt hydrates (including magnesium sulfate) were tested in a newly constructed experimental setup. Based on the observed temperature lift under practical conditions, it was found that magnesium chloride was the most promising material of the four tested salt hydrates. However, both calcium chloride and magnesium chloride tend to form a gel-like material due to melting or formation of a solution. This effect is undesired since it reduces the ability of the material to take up water again. Finally, it was observed that performing the hydration at low-pressure will improve the water vapor transport in comparison to atmospheric pressure hydration.

However, if the storage system is not carefully designed, under adverse pressure conditions, reverse thermosyphoning can result in increased thermal losses from the storage and reduced thermal performance of the system. To investigate this phenomenon, tests were conducted on a single tank and multi-tank thermal storage under controlled laboratory conditions. Energy storage rates and temperature profiles were experimentally measured during charge periods, and the effects of reverse thermosyphoning were quantified. A further aspect of this study was to empirically derive performance characteristics and to develop numerical models to predict the performance of the heat exchanger during reverse thermosyphon operation, and to quantify the relative magnitude of these effects on the energy stored during typical day-long charge periods. Results of this study show that the magnitude of the reverse flow rate depends on the pressure drop characteristics of the heat exchange loop, the system temperatures and the geometry of the heat exchanger and storage tank. In addition, the results show that in the case of a multi-tank thermal storage, the carry over of energy to the downstream thermal energy storages depend on the effectiveness of the exchangers used in the system.

This paper discusses the development and testing of an innovative code for the prediction of thermodynamic performances at nominal conditions and the estimation of costs of me whole plant, for different parabolic trough solar fields. The code allows a preliminary design of the solar field lay-out, the sizing of the main components of the plant and the optimization of the steam cycle. The code, named PATTO (PArabolic Trough Thermodynamic Optimization), allows to separately calculate the thermal efficiency of (i) parabolic trough systems in commerce as well as (ii) combination of components of various commercial systems, in order to exploit different technology solutions: combination of mirrors, receivers and supports. Using the selected parabolic troughs, the plant configuration is then completed by connecting pipes, heat exchangers, the steam cycle, and storage tanks. The code is also flexible in terms of working fluid, temperature and pressure range. Regarding the power block, a conventional steam cycle with super-heater and re-heater sections and up to seven regenerative bleedings is adopted. It is possible to use also simpler configuration as without re-heater or with less regenerative bleedings. Moreover, thanks to simple or sophisticated economic correlations depending on available data, the code calculates the overall investment cost for the considered solar field and the power block. The code performs steady state analysis at nominal conditions, while future developments are planned regarding part load analysis and transient simulations. The model is tested towards real applications and reference values found in literature; in particular, focusing on SEGS VI plant in the USA.

The idea behind the proposed Power Bus is to have power conversion (from solar panels) and power storage (in Li-Ion batteries) distributed all over several Power Management modules (the so-called ""tiles"") which contain, each: a solar panel; energy storage batteries with the corresponding power converters; a programmable power sink. The proposed Power Bus is such as to allow direct connection of as many modules as required (to adapt system performance to the requirements), either in parallel (to increase current) or in series (to increase voltage) or both, while allowing a number of power management functions to be handled in a distributed way. For instance: i) accumulating the power from all solar panels towards the load(s); ii) accumulating the power to charge one or more distributed batteries; iii) transferring the unused power towards a user-selectable sink (usually on the coldest surface); iv) appropriate mixtures of the above; v) other functions like housekeeping and telemetry. All the functions are implemented in a distributed way, with very limited centralized control (sometimes, even no centralized control), where each subsystem connected to it (namely: the solar panels with their MPPT converters; the batteries; the load(s); the power sinks; the over-voltage protections) have appropriate characteristics which allow self-controlled distribution of electrical power and appropriate distributed load balancing. System stability is guaranteed by the proposed characteristic of each subsystem in such a way that any number of modules can be connected to the bus without impairing overall performance and stability. The performance of the bus depend on the characteristics of each module. A specific implementation is also addressed where each module has a 15×15cm2 solar panel array and two Li-Ion rechargeable batteries, offering 6W continuous and 20W peak power and about l5Wh storage capacity, allowing max 120V, 20A, 2.5kW for the load, when using at least 75 identical tiles. The proposed Power Bus can easily be made double-redundant to increase system reliability at a very limited cost. In addition, the bus is conceived to be tolerant to single faults (with at most a graceful degradation in case of one or more faults).",,"Centralized control; Distributed load balancing; Distributed power; Electrical power; Graceful degradation; Li-ion batteries; Peak power; Power bus; Power conversion; Power distributions; Power managements; Power storage; Programmable power; Rechargeable battery; Single fault; Solar panel arrays; Solar panels; Storage capacity; System reliability; Cost reduction; Distribution functions; Electric batteries; Electric power measurement; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy management; Integrated control; Lithium batteries; Satellites; Solar concentrators; System stability; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953533505

EPS shall provide power generation, energy storage, and power control and distribution to support satellite mission during lifetime. To perform the mission successfully, the satellite should be provided with the sufficient power until end of life (EOL). To achieve energy balance per One-Orbit mission scenario, the battery shall be charged fully at the end of One-Orbit mission. To provide maximum solar array power generation, maximum peak power tracking (MPPT) method has been developed for spacecraft power system. Solar array generates primary power with high efficiency solar cell. To compensate for the solar cell's degradation at EOL in satellite, the solar array shall be designed to generate power with margin. When the spacecraft exits eclipses, the peak output power of a solar array becomes very higher than its peak output power in the normal sunlight operation power due to lower temperature. To avoid stress of electronics to handle main bus power from solar array power, the spacecraft power system should dissipate high excess power at the beginning of mission and sun entrance after eclipse. Battery is used for secondary energy source in space program. It shall be designed to provide energy to satellite loads in eclipse and maximum power demand for payload operation in sunlight. To get the high quality images and to perform the multi mission of satellite, the battery shall be required to provide higher energy with smaller sizing and lighter weight. And the paper describes the results, methods and input data used in the energy balance at End-of-Life, worst case, Energy Balance analyses for Science Mode operations in Korean LEO Space Program.

The fuel cells for NASA's Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs carried cryogenic liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The liquid oxygen invariably evaporates over a few weeks, limiting the mission duration. Also, hydrogen that is a fuel for the fuel cell is often stored cryogenically. This approach, however, is not suitable to space applications due to the limited mission time caused by the exceptionally high boiling-off rate of liquid hydrogen. In the present study, hydrogen peroxide was selected as an oxidizer for space power applications where air independence is a must. Catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was used to generate oxygen and water. The pure oxygen was provided to a fuel cell and the water was stored separately. Sodium borohydride in the solid state was used as a hydrogen source in the present study. Pure hydrogen can be generated by a catalytic hydrolysis reaction in which the water source was obtained from the hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Solid storage of hydrogen has a high energy density increasing the mission time and does not suffer from the problem of cryogenic hydrogen. A fuel cell system was fabricated to validate the fuel cell based air-independent power system proposed in the present study.

Recent studies using analytical microscopies have shown that insulators contain domains with excess fixed ions forming various kinds of potential distribution patterns, which are also imaged by potential mapping using scanning electric probe microscopy. Results from the authors' laboratory show that solid insulators are seldom electroneutral, as opposed to a widespread current assumption. Excess charges can derive from a host of charging mechanisms: excess local ion concentration, radiochemical and tribochemical reactions added to the partition of hydroxonium and hydronium ions derived from atmospheric water. The last factor has been largely overlooked in the literature, but recent experimental evidence suggests that it plays a decisive role in insulator charging. Progress along this line is expected to help solve problems related to unwanted electrostatic discharges, while creating new possibilities for energy storage and handling as well as new electrostatic devices. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Analytical microscopy; Atmospheric water; Charging mechanism; Electric probe; Experimental evidence; Hydronium ions; Insulator charging; Insulator surfaces; Ion concentrations; Potential distributions; Potential mapping; Solid insulator; Tribochemical reaction; Charge distribution; Electric furnaces; Electrostatics; Ions; Electrostatic devices",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953516311

Generally speaking, obtaining best performances from a cogeneration plant requires a proper design and a careful management, aiming to maximize the plant energy and economic savings. Solving the issue of optimization may require a dedicated simulation tool when the CHP plant faces variable loads (both electrical, thermal and in some cases cooling loads) and electricity tariffs, or significantly changes its efficiency at partial load, or integrates a heat storage which allows to extend the possible plant management strategies. In all these cases, the optimization results may not be easy predictable. However, in other cases also simpler and faster approaches may lead to correctly optimized results, depending on the application features. The purpose of this work is to compare two approaches to the optimization of trigeneration plants: (i) a detailed model already presented in previous works (DCOGEN), able to perform accurate optimization and prediction of annual energy balances but requiring detailed plant definition, accurate specifications of the user demands and a significant computational time, and (ii) a simplified and faster model based on few information and a intuitive optimization strategy. The comparison is carried out for two cases, reflecting the features of industrial CHP applications based on small scale gas turbines and reciprocating engines. Results show the advantages given by the detailed model as well as the limits of simplified approaches.

The inspection of a clearance level is a very important problem in order to ensure a social reliance for releasing radioactive materials to the environment. Korean regulations for such a clearance are described in Notice No. 2001-30 of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and Notice No. 2002-67 of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE). Most unsealed sources in RI waste drums at a storage facility are low-level beta-emitters with short half-lives, so it is impossible to measure their inventories by a nondestructive analysis. Furthermore, RI wastes generated from hospital, educational and research institutes and industry have a heterogeneous, multiple, irregular, and a small quantity of a waste stream. This study addresses a representative (master) sampling survey and analysis plan for RI wastes because a complete enumeration of waste drums is impossible and not desirable in terms of a cost and efficiency. The existing approaches to a representative sampling include a judgmental, simple random, stratified random, systematic grid, systematic random, composite, and adaptive sampling. A representative sampling plan may combine two or more of the above sampling approaches depending on the type and distribution of a waste stream. Stratified random sampling (constrained randomization) is proven to be adequate for a sampling design of a RI waste regarding a half-life, surface dose, undertaking time to a storage facility, and type of waste. The developed sampling protocol includes estimating the number of drums within a waste stream, estimating the number of samples, and a confirmation of the required number of samples. The statistical process control for a quality assurance plan includes control charts and an upper control limit (UCL) of 95% to determine whether a clearance level is met or not.

These spent filters have generally consisted of a HEPA filter after its filtering of all the contaminants in the gas stream generated during the operation of the HANARO research reactor and the nuclear fuel cycle facilities. At the moment, to secure enough storage space, it is necessary to make a volume reduction of the stored radioactive wastes through a compression treatment or a regulatory clearance. There have been many studies on a treatment and a clearance of the low level radioactive wastes generated from nuclear facilities. These methods are used in view of a reduction of a management cost and disposal cost and the security of free space for a waste storage facility approaching saturation. In order to dispose of the spent filters, it is first necessary to conduct a radionuclide assessment of them. To do that, a sampling procedure should be prepared to obtain a representative sample from a spent filter. As for conducting a nuclide analysis for this representative sample, a corresponding spent filter can be determined as either a regulatory clearance waste or a radioactive waste.

To assess the safety of membrane LNG tanks with a newly proposed configuration of CCS (Cargo Containment System) against sloshing, usually a comparative approach is adopted through numerical simulations and/or testing. The aim of the comparative approach is to assess the relative sloshing load and structural capacity under the fundamental assumption that the current membrane systems are safe. Over the period 2004-08, a JDP (joint development project) for an LNG CCS was carried out by Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) in corporation with major Korean shipyards and Korean universities. The aim of the project was to develop ""a new CCS for membrane Type LNG carriers"" which could lead to the improved and updated CCS of the structural safety. In this paper, experimental research results for the evaluation of structural performance of GTT MARK III type and KC-1 (Korean Cargo Containment System) insulation system, which is currently under development by KOGAS in corporation with major Korean shipyards, under hydro impact loads are presented. Based on the results of wet drop tests, a comparative evaluation was carried out for the time history of the impact pressure on the primary barrier and damage characteristics and soon. It is expected that the state-of-the art of engineering research described in this work can be directly applicable for the design and the development of high-valued LNG carriers and FLNGs.

Presently, this base represents an exceptional case regarding future remediation and cleanup operations due to the accident risk (∼ max. fuel inventory of 100 submarine cores) and degree of contamination (over 25 years with continuous release - still ongoing - of radionuclides into the terrestrial and marine environment). The first part of the survey consists of about 1030 measurement points established as a grid with 10 m and 5 m mesh size for the measurement of dose rate in two heights above the ground level (0.1 m, 1 m), radionuclide concentrations, drilling of 50 boreholes for further examination of the radionuclide releases on site and the establishment of a 1:500 map of the area. These surveys were completed 2002-04. The results for dose rate measurements taken 1 m above the ground level varies between background levels and 3 mSv/h. Additional measurements were completed around the main building structures at the site and as part of a geological survey of the site. The activity concentration levels for Cs-137 and Sr-90 were measured in 250 points being part of the same measurement grid as above. The results for both isotopes range from normal fallout levels from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing to above 1 MBq/kg. The main conclusion is that continuous releases of fission products from spent nuclear fuel and fuel residues in defect storage pools have, together with inadequate storage facilities for large amounts of solid radioactive waste, led to heavy contamination of fission products in large areas. The 1:500 map is not public accessible. Thus, the second part of the survey was to analyse and document the results in adequate maps. These maps, georeferenced to the UTM WGS 84 system, have been established on the basis of commercial available satellite images from 2004 and show the measurement grid and results for radiation and activity levels in addition to coastline contour and selected infrastructure elements.

Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has offered no scenario that would stabilize atmospheric levels. The capacity of the oceans to absorb CO 2 is limited to about 40% of the level of emissions in 1990. Shared equitably among the present-day world population, per capita emissions of 35% of the current European average would only return the world to 100% of 1990 emission levels. Yet world population will probably grow by 25% by 2050 and, between 1990 and 2007, global emissions increased by 29%. Our current global trajectory is hurtling us toward ever-higher levels, perhaps even disaster. Consequently, near-zero-emitting sources are the only approaches to energy generation that should be deployed. Nuclear power, with its immense energy density, is the only available source that qualifies for widespread deployment. Existing alternative options are not and cannot effectively contribute (see e.g. MacKay, 20081). The weakness in wind is the need for back-up and supplementation, not so much from its short-term fickleness but its seasonal variability. Carbon capture and storage would have to achieve far higher levels of capture than currently seem feasible. Hydroelectricity has limited remaining potential as well as needing careful deployment to avoid collateral emissions. Aggressive conservation and efficiency measures reduce but do not solve the growth in energy demand and usage. Global economic downturns provide temporary relief but huge social political pain, and energy supply security concerns remain unresolved issue for many countries, even today. Of course nuclear alone would face an overwhelming challenge. We shall need to deploy massive improvements in the efficiency with which energy is used. Solar power in various forms has promise and could have a substantial role at lower latitudes in consistently sunny areas though photovoltaic electricity is still a high-cost option. Geothermal and various forms of ocean-derived energy have development potential. However, we argue that worldwide deployment of 5000 to 10 000 nuclear reactors by 2050 is the only clearly accessible pathway to CO2 stabilization that exists today. This will require extension of the resource beyond once-through cycles and so the deployment of advanced reactor types. But it is doable, it is affordable, and our planet must plan to accomplish this deployment.

Furthermore the cyclonic eye and fringes are characterised by rapidly varying metocean conditions, particularly wind speed and direction. It is necessary to understand the weather vaning and motion responses of the vessel during these transient conditions for successful facility development. This paper presents weather vaning and motion analyses of a Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) vessel during the passage of tropical cyclones. A synthetic tropical data base developed by Woodside Energy Limited was used to generate the cyclonic conditions. The data base contains storms with return periods ranging from 10 to 100,000 years. Time histories of wave spectrum, wind and current at half-hourly intervals for several cyclones were examined. The weather vaning and motions responses of the FSO were computed using two methods: (1) a frequency domain quasi-stationary approach, and (2) a time domain approach. In the frequency domain analyses the metocean conditions were treated as stationary for each half-hour interval and the mean vessel heading and most probable amplitudes of motions were calculated. In the time domain analyses, the time histories of metocean conditions were closely matched to the synthesised cyclonic conditions, and time histories of vessel heading and motion responses were generated. Multiple realisations were simulated for each cyclone to assess variability of results associated with wave train random seed. A key finding of the study is that the worst roll response tends to occur after the eye of the cyclone has passed, at which time the wind and waves were highly non-collinear. At this time the vessel weather vanes so as to experience waves which are substantially beam-on. When the cyclonic eye is directly over the site, there is a reduction in wind speed and as a consequence the vessel weather vanes into the sea. This causes a corresponding reduction in the roll response. Results from both analysis methods have been compared and good agreement is observed. The applicability and limitations of the two analyses methods are also considered.

An isolated distributed generation (DG) system is realised using fixed pitch wind turbine. The proposed stand alone wind energy conversion system (WECS) consists of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) driven by a wind turbine. The zig-zag transformer is used for isolation of the VF controller from the system and it provides path for the neutral current of the three-phase four-wire distribution system. The VF controller consists of IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor) based voltage source converter (VSC) with a battery energy storage system (BESS) at its dc link. The VF controller injects/ absorbs both active and reactive powers and also acts as a harmonic compensator and a load balancer.

WSN is application specific, with a wide range of applications in military, survey, industrial, up to home usage. The major problems for WSN are resource limitations and dynamic network, which require unique algorithms for unique applications. Our study focused on the implementation and the characterization of the Gravity algorithm, with the Flooding algorithm as a comparison. The Gravity algorithm uses the gravity weight which is stored on each node to form a virtual contour. This contour will guide the message to reach the sink. This work is the first implementation of the Gravity model in OMNeT++. Simulations conducted in the full mesh and the layered topology show that the Gravity algorithm uses less energy and a higher diversity factor compared to the Flooding algorithm. A similar result is also acquired when the probability of failures are considered. The result shows that the Gravity algorithm outperforms the Flooding algorithm while still maintaining the simplicity of the algorithm. This is important to a WSN which is resources limited.

Progressive and haze defects continue to be the primary cause of mask degradation and mask re-clean mainly due to intensified density of photon energy involved with ArF exposure. Direct reticle inspection has been widely implemented in wafer fabs to provide early warning of haze defects before they reach critical levels. However, reticle inspection systems are increasingly challenged by aggressive optical proximity correction (OPC), subresolution assist feature (SRAF) and high requirement to detect printable defects. As we know Die-to-Die (D2D) mode has good sensitivity on main pattern but can't cover scribe line area. In this paper, we studied the integration inspection mode which combines Die-to-Die (D2D) on main pattern area and Stralight2+ on scribes and frames area. The detection capability of StarLight2+ and D2D on DRAM masks was evaluated and results shows that aggressive patterns (OPC, SRAF) are resolved well and provide early warning for crystal growth type defect on mask. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate both StarLight2+ and D2D capability to support memory wafer mask qualification requirements. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Early warning; EPSM; Grayscale; Light calibration; OPC; Re-qual; Reticle inspection; Sensitivity; SRAF; STARlight","Critical level; Detection capability; Early warning; EPSM; Gray scale; Haze defects; Inspection technology; Mask defects; Optical proximity corrections; Photon energy; Re-qualification; Reticle inspection; Scribe lines; Sub-resolution assist feature; Wafer-fabs; Calibration; Defects; Dies; Dynamic random access storage; Grain boundaries; Inspection equipment; Optical instruments; Inspection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952056623

In Brazil, the widespread distribution of NG - especially to remote points of low demand - is an important issue in market development. The use of vessels filled with activated carbon to store and transport natural gas (ANG) at moderate pressures (about 3,5 MPa) and room temperature has shown to be a potential solution as compared to the high pressure (20 MPa) required for current compressed natural gas technology. Many studies are devoted to investigate suitable adsorbent materials to optimize methane storage capacity. The present work describes experiments of NG charge and discharge cycles in a prototype storage vessel filled with activated carbon and analyses the effect of the gas composition on the adsorption capacity. The adsorption properties were evaluated by measuring isotherms of each component in a magnetic suspension balance. Relative selectivities of the several constituents of the natural gas in relation to methane were also determined and the effect of the pressure on this selectivity was observed. Since natural gas is composed of about 90 % methane together with other constituents, a decrease in adsorption capacity on the NG storage vessel due to a preferential adsorption for the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons and CO2 is possibly causing partial deactivation of the adsorbent along the cycles and will require periodic bed regeneration.",,"Adsorbed natural gas; Adsorbent materials; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption properties; Charge and discharge; Compressed natural gas technologies; Gas compositions; High pressure; Low demand; Magnetic suspension balance; Market development; Methane storage; Moderate pressures; Partial deactivation; Potential solutions; Preferential adsorption; Room temperature; Storage vessel; Energy resources; Gas adsorption; Gases; Lead acid batteries; Methane; Natural gas; Pressure effects; Suspensions (components); Activated carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951688373

Coating thickness, coated particles storage conditions and physical aging effects have been assessed. The coating thickness is found to be extremely relevant in raising the resistance to attrition. Thicker the coating and more resistant is the coated particles against attrition. This improvement is found to be more and more relevant while impact energy is increasing. The storage temperature is not influencing the morphology whereas is strongly affecting the resistance to attrition. Coated particles stored at -18 °C were found to be more resistant to attrition then ones stored at room conditions. Such differences, negligible at low energies (low numbers of impacts) increase as soon as the number of impacts and thus the energy rise. The coated particles, stored at ambient conditions, were subsequently aged in vacuum oven and the effect of aging steps was evaluated in terms of resistance to attrition. In aged coated particles were found a wasting in resistance to attrition directly proportional to the aging time. Moreover, the aging process was found to affect the breakage mechanism experienced by the coated particles during impacts tests. The common attrition mechanism was found to be layer fatigue. Using the equation proposed by Tavares and King [49] as starting point, a new equation has been developed in order to fit to the resistance to attrition data. The equation takes into account the number of impacts, the velocity of the impacts, the coating thickness, the coefficient of restitution, e, of the coated particles and the mass specific fracture energy, Ef,m. This equation has been successfully applied for different coating materials and different coating thicknesses.","Attrition; Breakage mechanisms; Repeated impacts; Resistance to attrition modeling; Storage conditions","Aging process; Aging time; Ambient conditions; Breakage mechanism; Coated particles; Coating material; Coating thickness; Coefficient of restitution; Fluid-beds; Impact energy; In-vacuum; Low energies; Mechanical properties of polymers; Physical aging; Polymer-coated particles; Repeated impact; Scanning Electron Microscope; SEM; Storage condition; Storage temperatures; Fluidization; Impact resistance; Mechanical properties; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Thickness measurement; Plastic coatings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951681588

Deploying PV on a large-scale has a penetration level threshold due to the inherent power supply intermittency associated with the solar resource. By creating a hybrid PV+CHP system there is potential of increasing the PV penetration level. One year of one second resolution pyranometer data is analyzed for Kingston Ontario to determine the total amount of PV energy generation potential, the rate of change of PV power generation due to intermittent cloud cover, and the daily CHP run time required to supply reliable base load power to the grid using this hybrid system. This analysis found that the vast majority of solar energy fluctuations are small in magnitude and the worst case energy fluctuation can be accommodated by relatively inexpensive and simple storage with conventional lead-acid batteries. For systems where the PV power rating is identical to the CHP unit, the CHP unit must run for more than twenty hours a day for the system to meet the base load requirement during the winter months. This provides a fortunate supply of heat, which can be used for the needed home heating.

Besides, a successful storage energy selection is essential to deal with some mismatches among costs, efficiency and power quality constrains. This paper presents a methodology taking as basis the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy logic. By exploiting a multi-criteria decision making, this methodology evaluates the operation of storage energy systems such as: pumped hydro storage (PHS), compressed air energy storage (CAES), H2 storage, flywheel and super-capacitors. The main objective of the study is to develop a multicriteria analysis to find the most appropriate storage energy system concerning a power quality scenario.

Particularly, we investigate how to proceed with a low voltage, high-current PEM Fuel-Cell. The proposed system is developed from the concept of Loss-Free Resistor, and can be easily adapted to any type of energy source and storage elements. Among the advantages of the proposed system, the PV array keeps its maximum power point (MPP), with independence of the power delivered by the new source. In addition, the proposed system allows also a particular MPPT for the new source if required. Finally, as additional benefits, sources can the incorporated or extracted with hot-swapping, and the energy production profile can be smoothed, predictable, and even constant, as wanted by the utility grid regulators. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Electronic systems; Energy productions; Energy source; Grid connected PV system; High-current; Hot-swapping; Low voltages; Maximum power point; New sources; PV arrays; PV system; Storage Elements; Utility grids; Fuel cells; Photovoltaic effects; Industrial electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951568246

The wireless communication link design problem needs to be revisited for these sensors as the energy harvested can be random and small and not available when required. In this paper, we develop a simple model that captures the interactions between important parameters that govern the communication link performance of a EHS node, and analyze its outage probability for both slow fading and fast fading wireless channels. Our analysis brings out the critical importance of the energy profile and the energy storage capability on the EHS link performance.

Due to clean and efficient power generation, the hydrogen fed fuel cell vehicle (FCVs) has received considerable attention. However, major obstacles such as cost of the hydrogen infrastructure, driving range, and cost of the fuel cell greatly influence FCV development. At the same time, proper utilization of grid power, along with a modified electrical system infrastructure, would encourage automakers to envisage plug-in versions of fuel cell vehicles. This paper presents the optimal powertrain component sizing of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric (FC-PHEV) vehicle, comprised of a fuel cell with electrolyser, Ni-MH battery as secondary energy storage, and a propulsion motor. Such a PHEV architecture provides an additional degree of freedom, as the gird power can be used to recharge batteries, or for the electrolysis of water, to generate hydrogen and oxygen, which increases the driving range of vehicle as well as the overall powertrain efficiency. Hence, the overall performance and efficiency are much superior when compared to ordinary PHEV or FC-HEV powertrains. This paper uses a small vehicle power train for modelling and simulation purposes. Optimal sizing of the power train components using multi-objective genetic algorithm will be presented. Moreover, overall vehicle performance and fuel economy for different driving loads will also be analysed. Finally, an overall cost analysis will also be presented. ©2009 IEEE.","Efficiency; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Modelling; Power electronics; Road vehicles","Degree of freedom; Driving range; Efficient power; Electrical systems; Electrolysers; Fuel cell vehicles; Fuel-efficient vehicles; Grid power; Hydrogen infrastructure; Modelling and simulations; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Ni-MH batteries; Optimal sizing; Overall costs; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Plug-ins; Power trains; Powertrain components; Propulsion motors; Recharge batteries; Road vehicles; Small vehicle; Vehicle performance; Zero emission; Air pollution; Automobile electronic equipment; Cells; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Hydrogen; Industrial electronics; Multiobjective optimization; Oxygen; Power electronics; Railroad cars; Roads and streets; Automobile parts and equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951539374

This paper aims to compare different strategies with a particular attention to Plug-In-HEVs (P-HEV) energy management algorithms. In facts many control strategies have been developed and discussed on traditional parallel HEV in order to find out the most efficient energy management of the Electrical Motor (EM) and the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). The adoption of these control strategies on a P-HEV, with an oversized on board energy storage system (vs. traditional HEV), do not lead to a significant improvement of the global vehicle efficiency because they use the Electrical Motor (EM) only for short operation time and they consider all the energy stored into the battery produced by the ICE. Control strategies developed for traditional parallel HEV have been taken into account and they have been opportunely adapted in order to utilize the extra amount of energy stored into the batteries. A full energetic simulation model has been used in order to compare the performances of different control strategies. The P-HEV model has been specialized for the vehicle realized at Mechanical Dept. of Politecnico di Milano and it has been validated using experimental data. ©2009 IEEE.","Energy management; Plug-in HEV; Simulation and modeling","Control strategies; Electrical motors; Energy control; Experimental data; Hybrid electrical vehicle; On-board energy storage; Operation time; Plug-ins; Simulation and modeling; Simulation model; Vehicle efficiency; Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; Energy management; Industrial electronics; Internal combustion engines; Ice control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951536281

The HydroHelp 5 computer program has been developed to design and cost pump-turbine projects, and three examples of site costing are included, for Lake Uist in Nova Scotia, for Saguenay Fjord in Quebec, and for a theoretical site with a deep underground reservoir. To assist in the assessment task, a set of guidelines is desirable, to determine what site parameters have to be within such limits as - minimum head; maximum length of the water passages; minimum capacity and storage conditions; based on a given differential in energy costs, in order for the site to be economic. Using the computer program HydroHelp 5, a set of conditions has been developed for a variety of energy cost differentials using a fixed interest rate of 5%. Prospective developers can use the same program to develop their own particular set of conditions. ©2009 IEEE.","Costing; Design; Hydro; Pump-turbines","Assessment tasks; Computer program; Energy cost; Interest rates; Low head; Market price; North American; Nova Scotia; Parametric analysis; Peak energy; Pump-turbines; Rocky Mountains; Small hydro; Storage condition; Underground storage; Costs; Design; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Hydraulic turbines; Pumps; Underground reservoirs; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951487148

At high wind penetration levels and due to the lack of controlled rotating machines, wind fluctuation might cause unacceptable frequency excursions in the system and they need to be mitigated. A virtual synchronous machine control is designed to emulate a virtual inertia via power injection from/to the energy storage system. The impact of this control strategy on the system is analyzed. Based on the case study, the major conclusion is that virtual inertia control reduces the maximum rotor speed deviation, but in exchange for increasing the inertia, the system becomes slower and more oscillatory. Possible solutions for the latter are pointed out, but further work is required.

Unlike conventional vehicles, the presence of high charge sustaining rechargeable energy storage system (battery) in HEV distributes the vehicular power demand, thus considerably reducing the size of the internal combustion engine and in turn the fuel consumption. The HEV is equipped with a high power traction motor that is powered by the battery or the generator and is directly connected to the transmission. This motor also has regenerative braking capability, thus transferring energy back into the battery which otherwise would have been wasted in the form of heat. The present automotive industry is using different types of motors for HEV application, depending upon the extent of their use and power requirement. The battery performance is a function of the motor operation. In this paper, the characteristics of different types of traction motors will be discussed. DC and induction motors will be then tested against a designed electric circuit model of battery in order to determine the respective charge-discharge characteristics. The designing of the battery management system is dependent on the analysis of this charge-discharge variation for determining the precision battery parameters such as voltage and current limits, and permissible state-of-charge. ©2009 IEEE.","Battery; Battery management system; Hybrid electric vehicle; Internal combustion engine","Battery management system; Battery performance; Charge-discharge; Charge-discharge characteristics; Current limits; Electric circuit model; Energy storage systems; Environmental concerns; HEV applications; High-power; Hybrid electric vehicle; Power demands; Power requirement; Regenerative braking; State of charge; Automobile engines; Automobile parts and equipment; Automotive industry; Combustion; DC motors; Electric discharges; Electric network analysis; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric vehicles; Engines; Fuel storage; Fuzzy control; Induction motors; Management; Secondary batteries; Smoke; Synchronous motors; Traction (friction); Traction motors; Electric traction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951427665

However, the locations of these data-centric nodes significantly impact the power consumption and efficiency for information queries and storage capabilities, especially in a multi-sink environment. This paper proposes a novel dissemination approach, which is namely the Dynamic Data-Centric Routing and Storage Mechanism (DDCRS), to dynamically determine locations of data-centric nodes according to sink nodes' location and data collecting rate and automatically construct shared paths from data-centric node to multiple sinks. To save the power consumption, the data-centric node is changed when new sink nodes participate when the WSNs or some queries change their frequencies.

These centres normally face a variety of problems associated with the dimensioning and configuration of several services which must satisfy performance targets under different usage patterns. Therefore, the identification of key variables and the estimation of their impact on services performances is challenging. For example, given an hardware-software configuration for a considered service, how will service performance vary in relation to user dependent settings? Will it be able to support a certain number of requests per minute over the common parameter ranges? In addition, it is difficult to generalize the impact of same settings over different usage scenarios. Therefore, the design of a mathematical model able to relate services performance to key variables in the user computing patterns under common hardware-software settings can help to optimize the exploitation of computing resources. In the present work, starting from the analysis of a typical job of ATLAS as representative HEP user communities, we focus on how local data movement operations use hardware-software resources of INFN-CNAF computing centre and which variables affect data movement performances. As a result of this framework analysis we identify GridFTP protocol and GPFS data storage as core services whose performance to study in dependancy of typical user defined variables. We therefore decompose data movement commands in operations of increasing complexity i.e., cp, globus-url-copy with and without network, and after defining the mean throughput per file per unit size as target metric, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the contribution and relevance of considered variables across explored usage scenarios. Finally, we conduct a qualitative fit analysis of the behaviour of chosen throughput metric as a function of relevant user dependent variables. For each scenario and for each variables a best fit model function is selected according to R-square goodness of fit index. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Best-fit models; Computing resource; Data movements; Data storage; Dependancy; Distributed systems; Goodness of fit; GridFTP; Hardware and software; Key variables; Local data; Parameter range; Per unit; Performance targets; Quantitative analysis; R square; Service performance; Software configuration; Software resources; Software settings; Usage patterns; Usage scenarios; User communities; User-dependent; Computer software; High energy physics; Mathematical models; Nuclear physics; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951170765

The SDRAM has a data transfer bandwidth of 450 MB/S, thus for raw data acquisition, only two channel ADCs can be simultaneously used at sampling rate of 100 MHz (for 8 channel simultaneous acquisition, the maximum sampling rate is about 28 MHz). In this study, data packages containing pulse arrival time, baseline, energy and position were saved instead of raw data of whole gamma signal pulse to reduce the amount of output data. Parallel signal processing containing arrival time detection, baseline calculation, pulse energy calculation and channel ID generation were implemented by model-based design method to achieve high performance PET signal processing. Finally, data packaging and down sampling approaches were employed to achieve 8-channel simultaneous signal acquisition at 100 MHz sampling rate without exceeding the SDRAM data transfer bandwidth. To examine the functionality of the signal acquisition method, PET images were obtained using a pair of detectors. The PET detector is composed of a Geiger mode avalanche photodiode (GAPD) array (3 mm x 3 mm, 4 x 4 ) coupled with LYSO array crystal (3 mm x 3 mm x 20 mm, 4 x 4). By rotating a pair of PET detectors for 180 degrees (6 degrees x 30 times) and simultaneously acquiring 8 channel (4 channels from each GAPD array) signals using one acquisition card, PET images of two F-18 line sources were successfully acquired. The energy resolution for 8-channel gamma signals was 19% and the timing resolution for the coincidence channels was 1.5 ns. The spatial resolution for the acquired PET image was 3.1 mm. Finally, a brain PET system using three DAQ cards has been developed and high quality PET images were acquired. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Acquisition cards; Arrival time detection; DAQ cards; Data packages; Down sampling; Energy resolutions; Gamma signals; Geiger mode avalanche photodiode; High quality; High-speed; Line sources; Model-based design; Multi-channel; Output data; Parallel signal processing; PET data; PET detectors; PET images; Pulse arrival time; Pulse energies; Sampling rates; Signal acquisitions; Simultaneous acquisition; Spatial resolution; Timing resolutions; Two channel; Bandwidth; Data structures; Data transfer; Detectors; Dynamic random access storage; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Nuclear physics; Semiconductor diodes; Signal analysis; Signal processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951165037

On the other hand, when the railcar brakes, the regenerative power is created and it increases the line voltage at the pantograph of the railcar. If it is possible to install an energy storage system near the train, the regenerated power can be saved to this system. This paper describes the control of energy storage system which consists of a supercapacitor bank and a bidirectional DC-DC converter. Supercapacitor can be used for storing the regenerative energy and for peak power requirement to increase the efficiency and life cycle of the system. This paper presents a method to identify the parameters of supercapacitor equivalent circuit by using the experimental results. In order to verify the validity of this method, parameters of a Maxwell BCAP 3000F are extracted through the experiments and then the equivalent circuit model using these parameters is implemented for PSiM simulation.

The proposed PT is able to convert high-frequency signals into low-frequency ones, making them much easier to be compressed. In combination with wavelet transform and subband decomposition, the PT is able to significantly reduce signal energy in high-frequency subbands and achieve a significant transform coding gain. This has important applications in efficient data representation and compression. Results demonstrate that, in wavelet-based subband decomposition, the signal energy in high-frequency subbands can be reduced by up to 60% if a PT is applied. The PT image encoder outperforms state-of-the-art JPEG2000 and H.264 (INTRA) encoders by up to 2-3 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), especially for images with a significant amount of high-frequency components.

An emerging science may help speed an all-system approach to implementing sustainable urban planning. The many innovative approaches to engineering and planning will lead to cities and suburbs where water, urban travel, energy chains and food provision infrastructures are bound together by ESD values, flow-on principles and a workable process of sustainability achievement. JCU Townsville is developing such a process of Sustainability Implementation Planning (SIP) and Engineering, aspiring to become a tropics sustainability exemplar. This article reports on a 90-strong workshop: Paths to Sustainability held in August 2008, with strong regional leadership support. An integrated intellectual frame and 'futures oriented' blueprint is provided to achieve the myriad cultural, social, economic, energy, water, food, engineering and environmental needs to 'go sustainable' in an urban setting, where most of us live. The workshop results show SIP water management begins with local raindrops, local capture, local ground penetration, use and reuse, entering local nutrient flows to local urban food gardens and then used as a source to grow aquatic protein and fuel oils.

With device size scaling, copper-related dielectric degradation becomes one of the most important concerns due to the scaled dielectric thicknesses. The Cu out-diffusion from the direct contact (DC) bottom to the adjacent gate was observed for the failed samples with high temperature storage (HTS) stressing. HTS tests were performed at various temperatures to extract the activation energy for HTS failure. The predicted lifetime for the samples with Cu contamination was found to be 12 years at normal operating condition without stressing bias. Even though the root cause of the Cu contamination was not clearly revealed, based on the diffusion distance of Cu in silicon (Si), we speculated that the Cu contamination can be caused by the Cu migration into Si from the backside of wafer when the contamination was involved with one of packaging processes. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Device reliability; Device sizes; Dielectric degradation; Diffusion distance; Direct contact; High temperature storage; Normal operating conditions; Out-diffusion; Packaging process; Root cause; Activation energy; Dynamic random access storage; Electric batteries; High temperature superconductors; Reliability; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Silicon wafers; Technical presentations; Contamination",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951063473

The design of these structures should address their access time and misprediction recovery penalty. While direct-mapped RAMs provide faster access times, CAMs are more appropriate to avoid recovery penalties. Although they are more complex and slower, CAMs usually match the processor cycle in current designs. However, they do not scale with the number of physical registers and the pipeline width. In this paper we present a new hybrid RAM-CAM register renaming scheme, which combines the best of both approaches. In a steady state, a RAM provides the current mappings quickly; on mispeculation, a low-complexity CAM enables immediate recovery and further register renaming. Compared to an ideal CAM in a 4-way state-of-the-art superscalar microprocessor, and for almost the same performance (1% slowdown) and area (95% of the ideal CAM size), the proposed scheme consumes about 90% less dynamic energy. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Access time; Current mapping; Dynamic energy; Fast recovery; Immediate Recovery; Low-complexity; Physical registers; Power-aware; Register renaming; Steady state; Superscalar micro-processors; Superscalar Processor; Associative storage; Design; Cams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951006423

One possible solution to overcome this problem is to use a data compression technique where an image is viewed as a matrix and then the operations are performed on the matrix. In this paper, image compression is achieved by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique on the image matrix. The advantage of using the SVD is the property of energy compaction and its ability to adapt to the local statistical variations of an image. Further, the SVD can be performed on any arbitrary, square, reversible and non reversible matrix of m x n size. In this paper, SVD is utilized to compress and reduce the storage space of an image. In addition, the paper investigates the effect of rank in SVD decomposition to measure the quality in terms of Compression Ratio and PSNR. © 2009 IEEE.","Color image compression; Rank approximation; SVD","Color image compression; Compression ratios; Data compression techniques; Energy compaction; Image matrix; matrix; Possible solutions; Reversible matrices; Statistical variations; Storage spaces; SVD decomposition; Color; Compaction; Compression ratio (machinery); Computer simulation; Data compression; Digital image storage; Image compression; Magnetic susceptibility; Singular value decomposition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950982773

In order to supply the power consumption of the tramway (due to the auxiliary services and four traction induction motor drives), the hybrid system presents two power sources: 1) a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell (FC) as primary energy source; and 2) a Ni-MH battery as secondary energy source, which serves as a supplement to the FC for tramway acceleration or for energy recovery during braking. In addition, a braking chopper is required to absorb the regenerative energy produced by motors deceleration when it cannot be absorbed by the battery due to its limitations. Both FC and battery are coupled to a dc/dc power converter, which enables an active control of the two power sources. An energy management system (EMS) is responsible for: 1) the appropriate distribution of the power demanded by the tramway between the power sources; and 2) the braking chopper operation when required during regenerative braking. The simulation results show the hybrid system capability to allow the tramway to properly follow the driving cycle.","Batteries; Dc/dc converter; Energy management; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Transportation","Active control; Auxiliary services; Batteries; Battery hybrid systems; Braking chopper; Driving cycle; Energy management system; Energy recovery; Induction motor drive; Modeling and control; Ni-MH batteries; Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells; Power Consumption; Power sources; Primary energy source; Regenerative braking; Regenerative energy; Secondary energy sources; Simulation result; Transport applications; Braking; Control system analysis; Electric drives; Electric grounding; Energy storage; Flywheels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Induction motors; Magnetic susceptibility; Power electronics; Secondary recovery; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950881555

The commonly used definition of dissipativity often requires an assumption on the controllability of the system. However, it is very natural to think of Lyapunov functions as storage functions for autonomous systems with power supplied to the system equal to zero. We use a definition of dissipativity that is slightly different (and less often used in the literature) to study a linear, time-invariant, possibly uncontrollable dynamical system. This paper contains various results in the context of uncontrollable dissipative systems that smoothly bridge the gap between storage functions for controllable dissipative systems and Lyapunov functions for autonomous systems. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for an uncontrollable system to be strictly dissipative with respect to a supply rate under the assumption that the uncontrollable poles are not ""mixed""; i.e., no pair of uncontrollable poles is symmetric about the imaginary axis: this condition is known to be related to the solvability of a Lyapunov equation. We show that for an uncontrollable system the set of storage functions is unbounded, and that the unboundedness arises precisely due to the set of Lyapunov functions for an autonomous linear system being unbounded. Further, we show that stabilizability of a system results in this unbounded set becoming bounded from below. Positivity of storage functions is known to be very important for stability considerations because the maximum stored energy that can be drawn out is bounded when the storage function is positive. In this paper we establish the link between stabilizability of an uncontrollable system and existence of positive definite storage functions. In the context of autonomous systems, we prove that the Lyapunov operator is onto if and only if its image has observable symmetric rank one matrices. ©2009 IEEE.","Behaviors; Dissipativity; Lyapunov equation; Storage functions; Uncontrollability","Analysis and synthesis; Autonomous systems; Dissipative systems; Dissipativity; Imaginary axis; Lyapunov; Lyapunov equation; New results; Positive definite; Stabilizability; Storage function; Stored energy; Strictly dissipative; Sufficient conditions; Supply rate; Time invariants; Differential equations; Dynamical systems; Energy dissipation; Linear systems; Lyapunov methods; Mathematical operators; Poles; Lyapunov functions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950839505

Using an efficient test metrology combining the IM test and the soak test to stress the sampled SRAM (Static random access memory) ICs, the smaller contaminated metal size with scanning electron microscope was measured, about W x L = 15 × 120 um 2. The composition of metal particle with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) in material analysis exhibited two main peaks attributed to manganese (Mn) and ferrum (Fe). In speculation, the humidity effect after the soak test provided the electro-chemical reaction environment between two neighboring IC pins, spacing 130 um, in the fine pitch package. The IM test enhancing the electrical field accelerated this electro-chemical reaction. Therefore, even though the smaller contaminated metal particles exist, they with the double-combination test still can be screened out. Due to this effort, the risk selling ICs to customers is tremendously reduced. The assembly houses after information feedback are able to trace the root causes in production line and improve the package yield. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Assembly house; Contaminated metal; Electrical field; Electrochemical reactions; Energy dispersive x-ray; Fine pitch; Humidity effects; IC pins; IC reliability; Infant mortality; Information feedback; Material analysis; Metal contamination; Metal particle; Production line; Root cause; Scanning Electron Microscope; Static random access memory; Chemical reactions; Contamination; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Metals; Newtonian flow; Particles (particulate matter); Random access storage; Scanning electron microscopy; Three dimensional; Testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950823554

The superconducting magnetic energy storage system (SMES) being a fast acting device can swallow well these oscillations and help in reducing the frequency and tie-power deviations. For better performance achievement, the use of nonlinear neural adaptive predictive control for active power modulation of SMES is proposed in this paper. Online nonlinear identification of each control area of the power system is performed using a two-layer nonlinear network with tapped delay line (TDL) inputs and then one-step ahead prediction of new area control error (NACE) is used for generating an optimal power command for SMES. The NACE, a newly introduced variable in this paper, comprises of area control error (ACE), a term proportional to derivative of ACE and a term proportional to SMES coil current deviation. The resulting control signal has an anticipatory character and intelligently meets the challenging control objectives. The power conditioning system (PCS) for the SMES comprises of IGBT-based voltage source converter (VSC) and two-quadrant DC chopper. Various components of the hybrid system are modeled and two special blocks - one for SMES unit and its PCS and another for adaptive neural identification, prediction and control, are built by developing S-function code in MATLAB. These blocks are used along with other standard blocks available in SIMULINK-Library for versatile SIMULINK implementation of the proposed scheme and simulation experiments are then carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Chopper; Intelligent control; LFC; Non-linear neural networks; S-function; SMES","Active power; Adaptive predictive control; Area control error; Coil current; Control area; Control engineers; Control objectives; Control signal; DC choppers; Deadbands; Electromechanical oscillation; LFC; Load demand; Load-frequency control; Multi area power systems; Neural identification; Non-Linearity; Nonlinear identifications; Nonlinear neural networks; Optimal power; Power conditioning systems; Power systems; Prediction and control; S-function; Simulation experiments; Simulink; Simulink implementation; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage systems; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Tapped delay line; Two layers; Voltage source converters; Active filters; Circuit oscillations; Electric control equipment; Electric energy storage; Electric frequency control; Electric load management; Flywheels; Hybrid systems; Identification (control systems); Intelligent control; Magnetic storage; MATLAB; Neural networks; Power converters; Press load control; Superconducting cables; Superconducting magnets; Superconductivity; Three term control systems; Adaptive control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950793639

Load capacity is the main parameter of an Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) design. This parameter has to take into account the external disturbance force which may be constant, synchronous with the rotor angular velocity or completely general. To relatively simplify this study, we restricted the effect of external disturbance to a constant unbalance force only. The latter plays a high part on the size of bearing system. Before optimizing the AMB design, we have built and validated an Excel theoretical model with 2-D Finite Element Method (FEM). Several optimizations have been made in order to seek the minimum of both copper and iron losses we could obtain for a given load capacity. Then, evolution of losses functions of angular velocity speed of rotor has been drawn. Flywheel discharge time has been computed to pass from 9000 rpm to 4500 rpm and evolution of this time versus mass of AMB has been shown for different values of unbalance forces.","Active magnetic bearing; Long Term Flywheel Energy Storage; Losses; Optimization","2-D finite element method; Active Magnetic Bearing; Active magnetic bearings; Bearing systems; Discharge time; External disturbances; Flywheel energy storage; Iron loss; Load capacity; Long term; Main parameters; Theoretical models; Unbalance forces; Angular velocity; Electric machinery; Energy storage; Finite element method; Flywheel propulsion; Magnetic amplifiers; Magnetic bearings; Magnetic storage; Optimization; Poles; Spreadsheets; Wheels; Flywheels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950598873

As the demand increases, the quality of query services inevitably degrades. With the rapid evolution of storage, networking, and power management on mobile devices, nowadays most of MHs are capable of caching a reasonable amount of previous query results in their local buffers and are connected through peer channels on MANET-like networks. Such a technology can be utilized to distributively cache popular query results on mobile hosts. Therefore, MHs can communicate among themselves to share query results rather than having to rely on the communication link to a base station. As a result, the server workload can be alleviated, and thus the query delay and link congestion can be also improved. In this paper, we reform the query process and propose Mobile- host Cooperative Caching (MCC) to improve the quality of providing range query services. MHs can avoid issuing new queries or narrow the query range by utilizing the results cached by nearby MHs. We also discuss five approaches to select Candidate MHs (CMHs) to download their cached similar results, which are First Come First Download (FCFD), Largest Range First Download (LRFD), Smallest Range First Download (SRFD), Largest Non-Overlap Download (LNOD), and the hybrid method of SRFD and LNOD, namely SRFD & LNOD Hybrid Download (SLHD).

While Localized region based Chan-Vese model allows any region based segmentation energy to be reformulated in local way. Thus is capable to segment the object with heterogeneous features, which would be difficult to capture by Global Region. But in this case, the speed of algorithm is dependent on the choice of radius which is critical to find for image.

Despite that, cost still a concern, when compared with others energy resources. Therefore, efficiency improvement can be seen as one way for cost reduction. Use of maximum power point tracker allows generating more energy with the same amount of panels, which means more energy per panel. Nevertheless, the whole power processing has more than panels. It also includes converters, inverter, electrical motor, pump and batteries, which store energy for further use during solar outrage. The aim of this paper is to show how to achieve an effective photovoltaic pumping system without batteries. In this solution the role of batteries are replaced by fluid storage and, steady state operation depends on the amount of available power. Evaluations of all system devices, for each processed power level, allow to conclude about their efficiency and to clarify how they can be controlled to make the whole system operates at maximum efficiency level.

Current heavy commercial vehicles commonly use a S-cam air brake system, where compressed air is used as the medium to transmit the energy needed for braking. An Antilock Braking System (ABS) is an important safety device that ensures the stability and steerability of vehicles during braking in emergency situations, poor road/weather conditions, etc. The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the overall longitudinal dynamic response of a commercial vehicle equipped with an electropneumatic braking system. This will provide better insight into the performance of the vehicle and open room for improvements. This model will be ultimately used for the analysis of various schemes that can be used for ABS development. Such a model based approach will allow for computer based analysis of commercial vehicles equipped with ABS which may result in a reduction of expensive and time consuming experimental development trial runs. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Analysis of various; Antilock braking systems; Brake systems; Commercial vehicles; Computer-based analysis; Critical component; Electro-pneumatic braking; Electropneumatic brake; Emergency situation; Experimental development; Heavy commercial vehicle; Longitudinal dynamics; Model based approach; Model-based analysis; Motor vehicle; Safe operation; Air brakes; Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; Cold storage; Compressed air; Computer aided analysis; Dynamic response; Economic analysis; Mathematical models; Taxicabs; Trucks; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949933521

This enables a complete exchange of energy between vehicles, even when they are not braking and accelerating at precisely the same time, as is most frequently case in everyday service. The energy saving rate is related to the headway. If the headway is long/short, the energy saving goes up/down. When the headway is long, the ESS can save a lot of regenerative energy. The headway of SeoulMetro line 2 is very short in Korea urban transit system. So, the energy saving rate will be very low. If the ESSs are applied to another railway system, we expect that the effectiveness is better than the results of SeoulMetro line 2.

Every expert has to use efficient hardware and software documentation to make battery last longer and make a correlation between microcontrollers' duties and the remaining energy of batteries. In order to make battery last longer, battery information must be evaluated continuously. In many devices, fluctuating current is used due to its own load so alternating current makes it hard to compute the remaining battery level. For many devices, there could be battery level indicator as solution. This solution gives clue about the remaining time for user but it does not give any hint for microcontroller about battery situation. For low cost devices, it could be very difficult to estimate the remaining storage energy in the battery. In this study, microcontroller compatible sealed lead acid battery remaining energy predictor based on adaptive neural fuzzy inference system has been designed and proposed. In order to test proposed method, mean absolute error and leave one out have been used to measure proposed system performance.

Popular Data Concentration (PDC) is a well known technique to reduce the power consumption of disk arrays. We extended PDC by adding NAND flash based Solid State Drive (SSD) and achieved better performance and energy savings. We developed a novel file placement policy which places popular files on either one of flash disk or hard disk based on their size, popularity and access characteristics. Our placement policy places large and sequential read files on HDD and small and random read files on SSD. This placement takes advantage of the benefits of each medium and hides their shortcomings. To boost the HDD's performance, we further clustered correlated files and placed them on the HDD in a sequential manner. This reduces seek counts hence leading to a performance improvement. And we reserved some space of HDD to use it for write caching. By this, all the requests including reads and writes are concentrated on a designated hard disk and flash disk letting other disks to stay longer in low-power mode. We evaluated our architecture with trace driven simulator and the results show that our architecture is more energy efficient and performance effective compared with existing energy efficient architectures. © 2009 IEEE.","Clustering; Energy conservation; NAND flash; Simulator; Write cache","Data concentration; Disk array; Energy efficient; Energy saving; Existing energies; File placement; Flash disks; Hard Disk Drive; Hard disks; Low-power mode; NAND Flash; Network server; Performance improvements; Power Consumption; Disks (structural components); Energy conservation; Grid computing; Servers; Simulators; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77749333395

The emissions of these gases are potentially dangerous for pellet warehouse workers and can result in fatal accidents. To understand the emission of these gases under a real time scenario a large column container was designed, fabricated and installed in the Clean Energy Research Center, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada. The dimensions of the container are 15′ in length and 4′ in diameter. The container was further insulated to prevent any loss of heat during the storage studies. Thirty thermocouple points and seven pressure transducers have been arranged at different levels of the container to record the temperature and pressure developed during the storage studies. The temperature and pressure data will help to understand the temperature distribution and pressure build up in the container due to stratification of gases. Gas sampling and pellet sampling ports are arranged to at different levels of the container to collect off-gases and pellets during storage studies. The off-gases collected will be further analyzed for their composition like CO, CO2 and CH4 and also for O2 concentration in the container which will help to understand the gas stratification during storage of wood pellets. The pellets collected during the storage period will be further studied to understand the changes in the physical properties like moisture content, length, diameter, durability, bulk density, pellet density, ash content and calorific value. Experiments will be conducted initially in a closed environment and latter with heating and ventilation. The date from the large column container will help to understand and design proper ventilation system for safe storage of wood pellets.","Bulk density; Durability index; Gas chromatography; Off-gas; Pellet density; Wood pellets","Ash contents; Biological engineering; Bulk density; Clean energy; Closed environment; Fatal accidents; Gas pellets; Gas sampling; Headspaces; Moisture contents; Off-gases; Offgassing; Pressure build up; Pressure data; Real time; Safe storage; Storage periods; Storage studies; University of British Columbia; Ventilation systems; Wood pellet; Chromatographic analysis; Containers; Durability; Gas chromatography; Gases; Ore pellets; Pelletizing; Physical properties; Thermocouples; Transducers; Ventilation; Warehouses; Wood; Density of gases; Ash Content; British Columbia; Bulk Density; Canada; Containers; Density; Durability; Emission; Gas; Gas Chromatography; Pelleting; Pellets; Thermocouples; Ventilation; Wood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649096233

SRAM cells are faster and require no refresh since reads are not destructive. In contrast, DRAM cells provide higher density and minimal leakage energy since there are no paths within the cell from Vdd to ground. Recently, DRAM cells have been embedded in logic-based technology, thus overcoming the speed limit of typical DRAM cells. In this paper we propose an n-bit macrocell that implements one static cell, and n-1 dynamic cells. This cell is aimed at being used in an n-way set-associative first-level data cache. Our study shows that in a four-way set-associative cache with this macrocell compared to an SRAM based with the same capacity, leakage is reduced by about 75% and area more than half with a minimal impact on performance. Architectural mechanisms have also been devised to avoid refresh logic. Experimental results show that no performance is lost when the retention time is larger than 50K processor cycles. In addition, the proposed delayed writeback policy that avoids refreshing performs a similar amount of writebacks than a conventional cache with the same organization, so no power wasting is incurred.

We show that under real-world traces some probes can wear one order of magnitude faster than other probes leading to premature expiry of some probes. Premature expiry has severe consequences for the reliability, timing performance, energy-efficiency, and the lifetime of MEMS-based storage devices. Therefore, wear-leveling is a must to preclude premature expiry. We discuss how probe wear in MEMS-based storage is different from medium wear in Flash, calling for a different treatment. We present three policies to level probe wear. By simulation against three real-world traces, our work shows that an inevitable trade-off exists between lifetime, timing performance, and energy efficiency. The policies differ in the size of the trade-off. One of the policies maximizes the lifetime, so that it is optimal; and the other two are less optimal, and are used based on the configuration of the device.","MEMS-based storage; Probe storage; Probe wear; Wear leveling","Order of magnitude; Probe storage; Real-world; Storage devices; Timing performance; Wear leveling; Computer simulation; Energy efficiency; MEMS; Microelectromechanical devices; Telecommunication systems; Time measurement; Probes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76349084482

However, due to the presence of a diode in series with the input source, the power flow is limited to one direction, i.e. from the dc source to the ac side. However, for some energy storage applications such as ultracapacitor banks, battery banks etc., bidirectional power flow is essential for the operation. This can be achieved by connecting a transistor in parallel with the dc link diode for reverse conduction of current. This paper describes how such a bidirectional Z-Source inverter can be designed and controlled to facilitate power flow in both directions. The switching signal of this additional transistor is derived so that its presence would not affect the voltage buck/boost ratio. Design guidelines are presented in sizing the components and logic circuit used in generating switching signal of transistor is described. Computer simulations results are presented to verify the proper operation of the converter.","Bidirectional; Energy storage; Inverter; Shoot-through; Switching; Z-source","AC-side; Battery banks; Bidirectional power flow; DC links; DC sources; DC voltage; Design and control; Design guidelines; Energy storage applications; Power flows; Reverse conduction; Shoot-through; Single stage; Switching signals; Ultracapacitors; Z-Source; Z-source inverter; Capacitor storage; Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Flywheels; Logic circuits; Logic design; Switching circuits; Switching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76249109177

The current trend in resource management relies on the introduction of control mechanisms, such as control message exchanges, node-specific addressing, and storage of partial network state information. These mechanisms typically incur communication and processing overhead that does not scale well for larger or denser networks. Instead of introducing control mechanisms for network resource management, this article proposes and evaluates a Directed Broadcast with Overhearing (DBO) approach for sensor networks that combines directed broadcast at the network layer with CSMA and packet overhearing at the MAC layer. Through avoidance of control messaging and exchange of network state information, DBO trades off limited packet duplication overhead for control messaging overhead. This article introduces an analytical model that provides the basis for DBO evaluation and for analysis of the approach's transient packet retransmissions, route convergence, and energy consumption in the average and worst cases. We also present the model implementation details and the simulation experiments that explore the suitability of DBO for networks of different sizes with three different radio models that vary the width of grey regions, and we compare DBO's energy consumption against conventional unicast beacon-based and snooping-based routing protocols. The results indicate that that DBO's route convergence requires an average of five hops for ideal radio reception, seven hops for narrow grey regions, and twelve hops for wide grey regions. These results confirm that DBO shifts energy consumption from critical nodes near the base station to nodes near the source. The overall energy consumption of limited packet duplication overhead with DBO compared to unicast routing shrinks for medium- to large-size networks, rendering it more favorable than conventional communication approaches for large and dense sensor networks. © 2009 ACM.","Architecture; Cross-layer; Directed broadcast; Overhearing; Protocols; Sensor networks","Analytical model; Control mechanism; Control messages; Critical node; Cross-layer; Current trends; Dense sensor networks; Different sizes; Directed broadcast; Energy consumption; Large sizes; MAC layer; Model implementation; Network resource; Network resource management; Network state information; Packet duplications; Packet retransmissions; Processing overhead; Radio model; Radio reception; Resource management; Simulation experiments; Unicast; Unicast routing; Worst case; Computer simulation; Natural resources management; Network architecture; Network layers; Network protocols; Radio broadcasting; Resource allocation; Sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149126828

The current power system comprises multiple generators. Their intrinsic kinetic energy buffer (rotor inertia) plays an important role in short term system stability. Generators that are connected via power electronic power converters lack these kinetic buffers. Optimal power transfer from source to grid is often used as a control objective to optimize the energy yield. At power system level this approach may compromise stability. In this paper it is demonstrated that by emulation of rotor inertia, stability problems on a system level can be mitigated. For that purpose a short-term energy buffer is added to the system that can be controlled at a fast rate, thereby forming a so-called Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG). Power system stability support then becomes an additional control objective of the DG.

Such expansion is entirely complementary to the wider uptake of intermittent renewable resources and to distributed generation in general, which are likely to present a whole range of new business opportunities for storage systems and their suppliers. In the paper, by assuming that Distribution System Operator has got the ownership and operation of storage, a new software planning tool for distribution networks able to define the optimal placement, rating and control strategies of distributed storage systems that minimize the overall network cost is proposed.

On the other hand developments in energy storage and the availability of loads which are not time critical bring up possibilities to provide more flexibility in the grid and to use the available system more efficiently. In this paper, these and other advantages of as well distributed energy storage as load management of not time critical loads are discussed. An approach is described to analyse the available capacity in the grids, to investigate how this capacity can be used by applying storage or load management and to compare the benefits of storage and load management. This approach is illustrated using a real medium voltage network and measured data. It shows the part of the capacity in the distribution grids which is now unused, but can be made available by applying storage or load management of non-critical loads. The size of the storage and the non-critical loads which are needed to use this capacity are determined. The characteristics of future loads, the need to support integration of distributed generation and the desired level of reliability of supply are factors that determine the size of the storage and how storage or load management can be applied best. © 2009 IEEE.","Energy storage; Load management; Power distribution","Available capacity; Critical load; Distributed energies; Distributed Generation; Distributed storage; Distribution grid; Load management; Measured data; Medium voltage networks; Power distribution; Power distributions; Reliability of supply; Electric load management; Energy storage; Flywheels; Management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74949119737

In this context, this paper proposes the use of Data-Mining techniques to predict the short-term electricity price in the Brazilian market. In Brazil, the market model adopted has unique characteristics with a centralized form of dispatch due to the predominance of hydro generation. To apply the proposed prediction model, all features of the Brazilian electricity market are considered, such as the transmission restrictions among geo-electrical regions and the price dependency with storage energy in reservoirs. In the proposed prediction model, the electricity price is the dependent variable and the monthly time series data sets from the Brazilian system (such as power load, stored energy and thermal generation) are the independent variables. First, clustering of the data samples is performed to group similar behavior of the attributes. After that, a decision tree algorithm is applied to extract if-then rules from database. The rules obtained allow the identification of attributes that most influence the short-term electricity price. Results show that the proposed model can be an attractive tool to all electricity market players to forecast the short-term electricity price and mitigate the risks in purchasing power. © 2009 IEEE.","Clustering; Data-mining; Decision trees; Short-term electricity price forecasting","Brazilian electricity markets; Brazilian system; Clustering; Clustering data; Data sample; Decision-tree algorithm; Dependent variables; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy markets; Hydro generation; If-then rules; Independent variables; Market model; Power load; Power markets; Prediction model; Purchasing power; Storage energy; Stored energy; Thermal generation; Time-series data; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Mathematical models; Profitability; Time series; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74949113183

The economic models thus provide the designer the ultimate leeway of selecting more intrinsically reliable and more inherently maintainable components or subsystem of the infrastructure system at a more affordable investment costs. The paper focusses on a user friendly formulation for incorporating the social costs, which are typical for infrastructures that operate in the public domain, in the cost structure of infrastructure systems.

Properties of MEMS-based storage devices include high density, small form factor, and low power. The use of this type of devices in mobile infotainment systems, such as video cameras is not at all obvious. We must explore their configuration and assess their benefit with respect to existing devices, such as Flash. In this paper, we study the configuration of the data layout of MEMS-based storage devices for predominately streaming applications. The configuration targets: the timing performance, energy consumption, and the capacity. We show that formatting the data layout based on knowledge of the expected streaming workload results in devices that consume at least 22% less energy than Flash and perform comparably. We present a fast and effective configuration method to format the data layout. This method exploits the bimodal distribution of the request size in streaming applications. Using the fast method, we present a design rule for streaming environments: reducing the amount of prefetching of streaming data allows to reach configurations with small trade-offs between the design targets. © 2009 IEEE.","Data layout; Design space; Energy efficiency; Probe storage; Quality of service; Secondary storage","Bimodal distribution; Data layout; Data layouts; Design rules; Energy consumption; Fast methods; High density; Infotainment systems; Low Power; Micro-electro-mechanical; Prefetching; Probe storage; Secondary storage; Small form factors; Storage devices; Storage systems; Streaming applications; Streaming data; Timing performance; Approximation theory; Design; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; MEMS; Microelectromechanical devices; Probes; Quality control; Quality of service; Video cameras; Real time systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549177647

The current study was undertaken to determine whether dietary supplementation with Codonopsis lanceolata root water extract attenuates the development of alcoholic fatty liver in rats and to elucidate the molecular mechanism for such an effect. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed normal diet (ND), ethanol diet (ED) (36% of total energy from ethanol), or 0.5% C. lanceolata root extract-supplemented ethanol diet (ED+C) for 8 weeks. C. lanceolata root water extract supplemented to rats with chronic alcohol consumption ameliorated the ethanol-induced accumulations of hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride. Chronic alcohol consumption up-regulated the hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol metabolism, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), liver X receptor α (LXRα), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase α (ACC), stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). The ethanol-induced up-regulations of TNFα, LXRα, SREBP-1c, HMGR, and LDLR genes in the liver were reversed by feeding C. lanceolata root water extract for 8 weeks. Moreover, ethanol-induced decreases in the ratio of phospho-5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α/AMPKα and phospho-ACC/ACC protein levels in the liver were significantly restored (135% and 35% increases, respectively, P<.05) by supplementing them with C. lanceolata root water extract. In conclusion, C. lanceolata root water extract appears to be protective against alcoholic fatty liver through the regulation of SREBP-1c, LXRα, HMGR, and LDLR genes and by the phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC, which are implicated in lipid metabolism. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.","Cholesterol metabolism; Chronic alcohol consumption; Ethanol diet; Fatty acid synthesis; Gene expression; Hepatoprotective effect","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; acyl coenzyme A desaturase 1; Codonopsis lanceolata extract; fatty acid synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase alpha; liver protein; liver X receptor alpha; low density lipoprotein receptor; plant extract; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; alcohol consumption; alcoholic fatty liver; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cholesterol liver level; cholesterol metabolism; Codonopsis; Codonopsis lanceolata; controlled study; diet supplementation; drug isolation; drug mechanism; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid synthesis; gene expression regulation; histopathology; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver protection; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant root; priority journal; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; Animals; Codonopsis; Disease Models, Animal; Fatty Liver, Alcoholic; Gene Expression; Humans; Liver; Male; Plant Extracts; Plant Roots; Protective Agents; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Codonopsis lanceolata; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74349126877

The study does not take into account the losses due to power electronics and windage losses (due to the friction between external rotor surface and the air). Therefore, we restricted the loss computation to those of radial AMB only. To simplify this work, we focused on the effect of external disturbance on unbalance force induced by rotor eccentricity for instance. The unbalance force has fixed the maximum radial load capacity of the rotor in order to design the radial AMB. 2-D Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to validate the theoretical model.

The maximal electrical power is obtained for the photovoltaic system. The least auxiliary heat energy and the shortest time of the capital recovery are searched for the solar hot-water heater system, respectively. In this study, Taipei, Taichung, Tinan and Hengchung are selected to analyze. First, the sun's position at any time and in any city is predicted with the mathematical procedure of Julian dating. Then, we adopt a step by step method to calculate the optimal size of the solar panel which has maximal investment effect for the solar hot-water heater on each site. The results show that the optimal size of solar panel are not only affected by the location of the solar panel, but also are affected by the water storage. The economy of energy consumption is obvious while both the water storage and size of solar panel are increased.

The large scale and the stringent energy constraints of such networks however challenge the conventional classification techniques that demand enormous storage space and centralized computation. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical distributed classification approach, in which local classifiers are built by individual sensors and merged along the routing path. The classifiers are iteratively enhanced by combining strategically generated pseudo data and new local data, eventually converging to a global classifier for the whole network.

Decisional DNA, as a knowledge representation structure, offers great possibilities on gathering explicit knowledge of formal decision events as well as a tool for decision making processes. Its versatility is shown in this chapter when applied to decisional domains in finances and energy. The main advantages of using the Decisional DNA rely on: (i) versatility and dynamicity of the knowledge structure, (ii) storage of day-to-day explicit experience in a single structure, (iii) transportability and share ability of the knowledge, and (iv) predicting capabilities based on the collected experience.

In this scheme, node communicates with their neighbors to setup pair wise keys without any central authority. Proposed protocol is fully distributed and uses negligible communication for key setups between different nodes. Distributed nature of this protocol makes it more faults tolerant. Pair wise keys are different for each pair of nodes, so a small part of network is affected due to node compromise attacks. It is fully developed in TinyOS-2.x and tested in avrora emulator.

The β3-peptide H-β3hVal-β3hLys-β3hSer(All) -β3hPhe-β3hGlu-β3hSer(All) -β3hTyr-β3hIle-OH (1; with allylated βhSer residues in 3-and 6-position), and three tethered β-peptides 2 - 4 (related to 1 through ring-closing metathesis) have been synthesized (solid-phase coupling, Fmoc strategy, on chlorotrityl resin; Scheme). A comparative CD analysis of the tethered β-peptide 4 and its non-tethered analogue 1 suggests that helical propensity is significantly enhanced (threefold CD intensity) by a (CH2)4 linker between the β3hSer side chains (Fig. 2). This conclusion is based on the premise that the intensity of the negative Cotton effect near 215 nm in the CD spectra of β3-peptides represents a measure of 'helical content'. An NMR analysis in CD3OH of the two β3- octapeptide derivatives without (i.e., 1) and with tether (i.e., 4; Tables 1 - 6, and Figs. 4 and 5) provided structures of a degree of precision (by including the complete set of side chainside chain and side chain - backbone NOEs) which is unrivaled in β-peptide NMR-solution-structure determination. Comparison of the two structures (Fig. 5) reveals small differences in side-chain arrangements (separate bundles of the ten lowest-energy structures of 1 and 4, Fig. 5, A and B) with little deviation between the two backbones (superposition of all structures of 1 and 4, Fig. 5, C). Thus, the incorporation of a CH 2-O-(CH2)4-O-CH2 linker between the backbone of the β3-amino acids in 3-and 6-position (as in 4) does accurately constrain the peptide into a 314-helix. The NMR analysis, however, does not suggest an increase in the population of a 3 14-helical backbone conformation by this linkage. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between the conclusion from the CD spectra and from the NMR analysis are discussed. © 2009 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG.",,"CD spectra; Cotton effects; Degree of precision; Helical content; High resolution; Lowest energy structure; NMR analysis; NMR structures; Olefin metathesis; Ring closing metathesis; Side chains; Side-chain; Solid-phase; Structure determination; Amino acids; Aviation; Data storage equipment; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Olefins; Organic acids; Resins; Synthesis (chemical); Tetherlines; Peptides; amino acid; beta 3 octapeptide; glutamic acid; isoleucine; lysine; octapeptide; phenylalanine; serine; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; allylation; amino acid sequence; article; chemical structure; circular dichroism; conformation; nuclear magnetic resonance; nuclear Overhauser effect; olefination; peptide synthesis; priority journal; ring closing metathesis; structure analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74049095619

These studies have become increasingly imperative and desirable for an understanding and quantification of the influences of the land surface moisture on atmospheric processes. These influences or ""memory"" of the soil moisture may play an important role under conditions of extreme climate such as drought and flood. The recollection of a wet or dry anomaly by the soil moisture memory is a fundamental component of any regional land-atmosphere interactions, which possess significant implications for seasonal forecasting. The 13,000 km 2 Upper Assiniboine River Basin in Central Saskatchewan with its outlet at Kamsack is the domain of this study; via deploying a land surface model variously known as the Variable Infiltration Capacity/Xinanjiang/ARNO model driven offline both in the water and energy balance modes, it was possible to capture the dynamics and seasonal response of the soil moisture storage up to a depth of about 1.5-metre. Meteorological inputs required to drive the model were retrieved respectively from Environment Canada and the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset at daily and sub-daily time steps correspondingly. The propagation of precipitation deficit into the terrestrial hydrologic system resulting in the soil moisture deficit has been corroborated by the coincidence in the timing between the negative precipitation anomaly with that of negative soil moisture anomalies in the second and third layers from the model. Currently, since no databank exists for either measured or simulated soil moisture data or total water storage anomalies dataset over the Canadian Prairie, this study is a first attempt at providing some simulated soil moisture data over the Upper Assiniboine River Basin that could prove resourceful to the community of researchers working as part of the Canadian Drought Research Initiative.","Assiniboine river basin; Canadian Prairie drought; Soil moisture anomaly; Soil moisture memory; VIC; Water balance","Assiniboine river basin; Canadian prairie; Canadian Prairie drought; River basins; Water balance; Civil engineering; Drought; Groundwater; Moisture determination; Permittivity; Rivers; Soil moisture; Surface measurement; Watersheds; Weather forecasting; Geologic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949103807

This results in causing huge overhead. For large scale WSNs, these schemes still need each sensor to be loaded with a bulky amount of keys. In many-to-one traffic pattern of sensor networks, large numbers of sensor nodes send data to single or few base stations. Thus a sensor node may communicate with a small set of neighbors. Based on this fact, in this paper, a novel Traffic-Adaptive Key Management (TKM) scheme is developed for WSNs, which only establishes shared keys for active sensors which participate in direct communication, based on the topology information of the network.

However, this method could not reconstruct the path once the target moves out of the reconstruction area. In this paper, we propose a lightweight routing protocol for mobile target detection.

The chain-based routing scheme is one of the famous routing schemes that are proposed for reducing energy dissipation of communication in the networks. The chain-based routing schemes construct the chains for routing path. The chain-based routing schemes can reduce energy dissipation of transmitting data to base station by using the concept of multi-hop routing. PEGASIS, concentric-clustering routing scheme, and extended concentric-clustering routing scheme belong to the chainbased routing schemes. PEGASIS and concentric-clustering routing scheme do not balance energy dissipation among the sensor nodes. Especially the extended concentric-clustering routing scheme can distribute energy dissipation among each cluster. The extended concentric-clustering routing scheme fixes the number of sensor nodes in each cluster for balancing of energy dissipation among each cluster. Therefore the extended concentric-clustering routing scheme is able to make lifetime of the networks longer than the other chain-based routing schemes. However the extended concentric-clustering routing scheme still has limitation. This scheme cannot distribute energy dissipation. This difference is occurred by difference among transmitting data size of each cluster head. Because of this difference, energy dissipations are unbalanced and lifetime of the sensor networks is reduced. To overcome these problems, we propose an energy efficient concentric-clustering scheme. In our scheme, the number of sensor nodes is differently deployed to balance energy dissipation. As the simulation results, our scheme can distribute energy dissipation among the whole networks better than the extended concentricclustering routing scheme. © 2009 IEEE.","The chain-based routing scheme; Wireless sensor networks","Cluster head; Clustering scheme; Design factors; Energy efficient; Multi-hop routing; Routing path; Routing scheme; Simulation result; Transmitting data; Computer simulation; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Energy dissipation; Energy dissipators; Information management; Routing protocols; Semiconductor storage; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73549108538

Therefore, energy efficient algorithms and protocols have been one of the most challenging issues for WSNs. Many researchers have focused on developing energy efficient cluster based protocols for WSNs, but there has not been much research on event driven WSNs and, their focus is on continuous networks. In this paper, we propose a modified algorithm of Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol which is a well known energy efficient clustering algorithm for WSNs. Our modified protocol called ""Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks (EECED)"" is aimed at prolonging the lifetime of a sensor network by balancing energy usage of the nodes. EECED makes the nodes with more residual energy have more chances to be selected as cluster head. Also, we use elector nodes which take the responsibility of collecting energy information of the nearest sensor nodes and selecting the cluster head. We compared the performance of our EECED algorithm with the LEACH protocol using simulations. © 2009 IEEE.","Clustering algorithm; Energy consumption; Event-driven wireless sensor network","Balancing energy; Cluster head; Cluster-based protocol; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy information; Environmental surveillance; Event driven; Event-driven wireless sensor network; Health monitoring; Intelligent transportation; Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchies; Modified algorithms; Physical phenomena; Residual energy; Wireless devices; Adaptive algorithms; Electric load forecasting; Information management; Intelligent buildings; Leaching; Network protocols; Semiconductor storage; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73549105495

Each cluster has a number of sensors nodes and one of the nodes is elected as the coordinator. The coordinator is responsible for not only the general mission but also collecting the sensed data of other nodes and routing to the sink. Accordingly, the energy-consumption is higher than other nodes. Therefore, the coordinator selection methods will affect the life-time of a network. Besides, the conventional coordinator selection method cannot be available to different requests of sensor networks. In this study, we divided the missions into two types. One is that a mission can be performed by most of the sensor nodes. The other is that a mission can be performed by just few of the sensor nodes.

In particular, Mobile IP and Hierarchical Mobile IP are well-known methods for these researches. In these works, mobile nodes are assumed to be always in the active state whether they move to the other cell or not. However, since more than 95% of mobile nodes are moving in the idle state actually, they should change their states first to the active state for location update. Due to the mentioned problem, it causes the power consumption extremely. Even though some paging schemes for cellular networks can solve the waste of power consumption, they don't consider the high velocity environment. Therefore, in this paper we propose a low power IP paging scheme with dynamic paging areas where the paging areas are configured dynamically according to the velocity of the mobile node.

Several data-centric storage techniques had been proposed to exploit data storing and retrieving, but all of them failed to effectively deal with hotspot storage due to irregular sensor deployments or data distribution. In this paper, we propose a cover-up scheme for data-centric storage in wireless sensor networks. In our scheme, the storage node generates a virtual coordinate to feign that it is far away from the hash location. A geographic routing protocol forwarding an event data to a storage node will ignore the original storage node and find a new storage node whose coordinate is the closest to the hash location. Our cover-up mechanism can adjust to another storage node dynamically when a storage node is full. Simulations have shown that our cover-up scheme can reduce the energy consumption and achieve better quality of data.","Data-centric storage; Energy efficiency; Hash location; Load balancing; Quality of data; Wireless sensor networks","Critical problems; Data distribution; Data storing; Data-centric storage; Energy consumption; Geographic routing protocols; Hot spot; Load-Balancing; Quality of data; Sensor deployment; Sink nodes; Storage nodes; Virtual coordinates; Energy efficiency; High energy physics; Sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73149098686

We examined Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scats to ascertain if selective feeding compensates the shortage of free water by the ingestion of more prey rich in water such as insects. In addition, we discussed our results in light of increasing habitat fragmentation that, in turn, influences the prey availability. At different spatial levels, recombination of prey assemblages in the diet reaches a solution for variable shortage of water. This was true especially at the landscape level (different degree of aridity) and indirectly for habitat types. Nevertheless, the effects of landscape characteristics probably influenced foxes through the influence of suitable habitats, which partitioned prey species. In fact, increasing values of patchiness had a negative effect on measured energetic gain indices but foxes try to exploiting different patches including small and isolated ones because these surveys become important to obtain water moistures from alternative prey (Orthopters). © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Energy; Patchiness; Prey choice; Tunisia; Vulpes vulpes; Water","body fluid; fragmentation; habitat fragmentation; habitat type; mammal; patchiness; prey availability; prey selection; semiarid region; surface water; water storage; Canidae; Hexapoda; Vulpes; Vulpes vulpes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73149094733

In this paper, we consider the use of Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) as a write cache for metadata of the file system in embedded systems. NVRAM is a state-of-the-art memory that provides characteristics of both non-volatility and random byte addressability. By making NVRAM a write cache for dirty metadata, we retain the same integrity of a file system that always synchronously writes its metadata to storage, while at the same time improving file system performance to the level of a file system that always writes asynchronously. To show quantitative results, we develop an embedded board with NVRAM and modify the VFAT file system provided in Linux 2.6.21 to accommodate the NVRAM write cache. The experimental results show that substantial reductions in execution time are possible from an application viewpoint. Another consequence of the write cache is its benefits at the FTL layer, leading to improved wear leveling of Flash memory and increased energy savings, which are important measures in embedded systems.

This paper is focused on the development of the power supply systems, in particular on switching converters for energy harvesting applications. Its main goal is the development of high efficiency conversion systems, featuring the minimum number of conversion stages and of magnetic components, and the optimization of the power management. In particular the paper is focused on multi-input/multi-output dc-dc converters, enabling the connection of one or more sources of energy (solar, vibrational, RF, etc.), of some energy accumulation devices (micro-batteries, capacitors, supercapacitors), and several loads (microcontroller, transmitter, sensors, etc.).

Ghrelin circulates in acylated (A-Ghr) and nonacylated (NA-Ghr) forms, and their potential differential associations with insulin resistance (IR) in childhood obesity remain undefined. Objective: We investigated the associations of ghrelin forms with IR in normal weight and obese children and the impact of metabolic syndrome (MS) on their plasma values. Design: A total of 210 children in four subgroups of normal weight/obese children with and without components of MS were studied. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and acylated and total ghrelin were examined. IR was determined by a homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR. Results: In the entire population, plasma insulin and HOMA-IR were associated negatively with T-Ghr and NA-Ghr, but positively with the ratio of A/NA-Ghr after adjustment for age, gender, and Tanner stage. Obese metabolically abnormal children had lower T-Ghr and NA-Ghr, but comparable A-Ghr and a higher A/NA-Ghr ratio than obese metabolically normal subjects. Compared with lean healthy children, lean metabolically abnormal subjects had higher A-Ghr and the A/NA-Ghr ratio, but comparable T-Ghr and NA-Ghr. A multiple regression analysis showed that A-Ghr and the A/NA-Ghr ratios were positively associated with HOMA-IR, independent of age, gender, Tanner stage, and body mass index (or waist circumference) and other components of MS. Conclusions: A-Ghr excess may negatively modulate insulin action in obese and nonobese children, and may contribute to the association of IR and MS. © 2009 European Society of Endocrinology.",,"acylated ghrelin; ghrelin; glucose; insulin; lipid; nonacylated ghrelin; unclassified drug; age distribution; article; body mass; child; controlled study; developmental screening; female; glucose blood level; hormone action; hormone blood level; hormone release; human; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; priority journal; school child; Tanner stage; Acylation; Blood Glucose; Child; Female; Ghrelin; Homeostasis; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72949115929

The generation system of the powertrain is constituted by an internal combustion engine (ICE) connected to a three-phase permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). This machine is in the three phase open end winding configuration and is driven by the dual two-level inverter. The two dc-links of the multilevel converter supply two motor drives connected to the wheels. The control algorithm of the generation system is combined with a proper modulation strategy of the dual two-level converter allowing to share the generated power between the two output drives at each switching period. The power sharing capability of the generation system satisfies the different power demand from the two output drives. This architecture can be applied to road vehicles (i.e. buses, urban light truck) where the two wheels are driven by the two motor drives.

Two dosages (4 and 8 mg/kg per day) of olanzapine (OL) were infused in 36 female mice for 30 days by osmotic mini-pumps. This study was also designed to further extend the implications raised in other experiments by our model of AAP-induced metabolic dysregulation. Through the use of the osmotic mini-pumps, this model is aimed to circumvent the shorter (than in humans) half-life of AAPs in rodents and to chronically administer OL by a reliable and less disturbing method. Indirect calorimetry was used to evaluate metabolic rate (MR) and respiratory exchange ratio together with weight and caloric intake. Serum insulin, leptin, and glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test) were assessed. Pancreatic beta cells insulin levels, periuterine and liver fat content were also analyzed. Olanzapine-infused mice exhibited a reduction of overall MR (kilojoule per hour) and resting MR and respiratory exchange ratio, with periuterine fat significantly enlarged. All metabolic alterations were detected at the highest dose, with major effects found on weight gain and hyperphagia. Impaired glucose metabolism, associated with hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia were found. Insulin resistance was evidenced by the raise of HOMA-IR index. Increased insulin and lipid storage were detected at pancreatic and hepatic levels respectively. These findings illustrate the development of a cluster of risk factors (metabolic syndrome) and, for the first time, a decrease of energy expenditure (MR) due to chronic OL infusion.

The supply system employs clean alternative energy sources, namely photovoltaic (PV) modules, wind turbines, a fuel cell as backup generator and a storage battery bank. A detailed description is made and experimental data are shown of a prototype system where the PV modules are directly connected to the DC bus and an on/off strategy is used to control the power flow to the battery bank and to the load.

This process enables a nondendritic morphology of the primary Al phase in the cast samples, which is beneficial in mitigating hot tearing tendencies and enabling castability of dilute Al (wrought) alloys to obtain castings with superior mechanical and performance properties. In this study, a hypothesis is proposed to describe the mechanism of the CDS process, specifically the processes of mixing two precursor alloys and a subsequent solidification process. Al - 4.5 wt pct Cu was used as an example alloy system to propose a hypothesis and to verify the various features in the mechanism of mixing two alloys. Experimental results show that the mixing process naturally causes copious nucleation of one of the alloys mixed and that the turbulence energy during mixing distributes these nuclei uniformly to enable a favorable solidification condition for a nondendritic cast microstructure. It is critical that the alloy with the higher thermal mass (mass and temperature) is mixed into the alloy with lower thermal mass to obtain a valid CDS process and that the reverse will not yield a favorable homogeneous cast sample. Certain critical parameters during the CDS process have also been identified and quantified for a favorable microstructure of the casting. © 2009 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Al alloys; Alloy system; Cast microstructure; Castability; CdS; Controlled diffusion solidification; Critical parameter; Hot tearing; Hypoeutectic alloys; Mixing process; Novel process; Performance properties; Precursor alloys; Primary aluminum; Solidification condition; Solidification process; Thermal mass; Turbulence energy; Aluminum; Casting; Crystallization; Data storage equipment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Mixing; Solidification; Alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149126875

The model incorporates power generation as well as CO2 emissions from a fleet of generating stations (hydroelectric, fossil fuel, nuclear, and wind). The model is formulated as a mixed integer program and is used to optimize an existing fleet as well as recommend new additional generating stations, carbon capture and storage, and retrofit actions to meet a CO2 reduction target and electricity demand at a minimum overall cost. The model was applied to the energy supply system operated by Ontario power generation (OPG) for the province of Ontario, Canada. In 2002, OPG operated 79 electricity generating stations; 5 are fueled with coal (with a total of 23 boilers), 1 by natural gas (4 boilers), 3 nuclear, 69 hydroelectric and 1 wind turbine generating a total of 115.8 TWh. No CO2 capture process existed at any OPG power plant; about 36.7 million tonnes of CO2 was emitted in 2002, mainly from fossil fuel power plants. Four electricity demand scenarios were considered over a span of 10 years and for each case the size of new power generation capacity with and without capture was obtained. Six supplemental electricity generating technologies have been allowed for: subcritical pulverized coal-fired (PC), PC with carbon capture (PC+CCS), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), IGCC with carbon capture (IGCC+CCS), natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), and NGCC with carbon capture (NGCC+CCS). The optimization results showed that fuel balancing alone can contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions by only 3% and a slight, 1.6%, reduction in the cost of electricity compared to a calculated base case. It was found that a 20% CO2 reduction at current electricity demand could be achieved by implementing fuel balancing and switching 8 out of 23 coal-fired boilers to natural gas. However, as demand increases, more coal-fired boilers needed to be switched to natural gas as well as the building of new NGCC and NGCC+CCS for replacing the aging coal-fired power plants. To achieve a 40% CO2 reduction at 1.0% demand growth rate, four new plants (2 NGCC, 2 NGCC+CCS) as well as carbon capture processes needed to be built. If greater than 60% CO2 reductions are required, NGCC, NGCC+CCS, and IGCC+CCS power plants needed to be put online in addition to carbon capture processes on coal-fired power plants. The volatility of natural gas prices was found to have a significant impact on the optimal CO2 mitigation strategy and on the cost of electricity generation. Increasing the natural gas prices resulted in early aggressive CO2 mitigation strategies especially at higher growth rate demands. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Energy; Environmental engineering; Green engineering; Mathematical modeling; Optimization","Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon mitigation; Coal-fired power plant; Cost of electricity; Demand growth; Electricity demands; Energy planning; Energy supply system; Energy usage; Generating stations; Green engineering; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Mathematical modeling; Mitigation strategy; Mixed-integer programs; Natural gas combined cycles; Natural gas price; Ontario , Canada; Ontario power generations; Optimal structures; Overall costs; Power generating systems; Pulverized coals; Reduction targets; Retrofit actions; Significant impacts; Coal; Coal fired boilers; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Costs; Electric power generation; Electricity; Environmental engineering; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas fired boilers; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Integer programming; Mining; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Optimization; Retrofitting; Wind power; Electric generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149088805

Its gas-phase hydrogenation properties are different from those of specimens prepared by conventional methods. For the particle morphology of the as-cast and gas-atomized powders, it can be seen that the mechanically crushed powders are irregular, while the atomized powder particles are spherical. In PCT (Pressure-Composition-Temperature) measurements, for the gas-atomized particles smaller than 50 μm, the hydrogen storage capacity is dramatically decreased and the hysteresis loop becomes larger than that of the gas-atomized particles larger than 50 μm. In addition, the increase of jet pressure of gas atomization results in the decrease of hydrogen storage capacity and the slope of plateau pressure significantly increases. TEM and EDS studies showed the increase of jet pressure in the atomization process accelerated the phase separation within grain of the gas-atomized alloy, which brought about a poor hydrogenation property. In the measurements of hydrogen absorption-desorption kinetics, the improvement of desorption kinetics of gas-atomized AB2 alloys was mainly caused by the higher plateau pressure, which is attributed to the smaller grain size and higher site energy for hydrogen in the gas-atomized alloys. © 2009 Professor T.

Two refineries' schemes were simulated through a linear programming optimization model in order to compare the optimum configuration obtained before and after the input of different CO2 prices. The cases analyzed represent refining projects to be located in Brazil, a growing market for fuels and petrochemical feedstocks, as well as an oil producing country with rising crude exports. After 2012, emerging countries, such as Brazil, may adopt carbon emission reduction targets. Therefore, it is worth analyzing the impact of pricing CO2 emissions in these countries, where the majority of new refining projects will be located. Our findings indicate that the initial refinery configurations proposed are quite rigid technologically for CO2 prices up to US$ 100/t CO2. For CO2 prices higher than US$ 100/t CO2, refineries reduced their emissions by increasing the consumption of natural gas used to produce hydrogen, and through changes in the original configurations towards less-energy consuming process units. Promising technological advances, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), can also diminish the rigidity of the model and facilitate actions to curb carbon emissions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of these plants do not have a thermal storage system for maintaining the power block performance at nominal conditions during long non-insolation periods. Because of that, a proper solar field size, with respect to the electric nominal power, is a fundamental choice. A too large field will be partially useless under high solar irradiance values whereas a small field will mainly make the power block to work at part-load conditions. This paper presents an economic optimization of the solar multiple for a solar-only parabolic trough plant, using neither hybridization nor thermal storage. Five parabolic trough plants have been considered, with the same parameters in the power block but different solar field sizes. Thermal performance for each solar power plant has been featured, both at nominal and part-load conditions. This characterization has been applied to perform a simulation in order to calculate the annual electricity produced by each of these plants. Once annual electric energy generation is known, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for each plant is calculated, yielding a minimum LCOE value for a certain solar multiple value within the range considered. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The model permits the analysis of different configurations and components such as multiple-glazing, transparent insulation, air-gaps, surface coatings, opaque insulation and energy accumulation in water or PCM internal stores. In order to obtain information of practical interest, the solar thermal devices are modelled following virtual testing procedures in accordance to the experimental test methods described by European and International standards. This paper describes the basis of the model and shows some comparison of numerical and experimental data as an example of the validation process that has been carried out in order to assess the credibility of the numerical model. For simplicity, the explanation is restricted to standard multiple-glazed flat-plate collectors.

In many parts of the world, direct solar radiation is considered to be one of the most prospective sources of energy. In this study, the thermal performance of a phase change thermal storage unit is analyzed and discussed. The storage unit is a component of ten pieced solar air collectors heating system being developed for space heating of a greenhouse and charging of PCM. CaCl26H2O was used as PCM in thermal energy storage with a melting temperature of 29 °C. Hot air delivered by ten pieced solar air collector is passed through the PCM to charge the storage unit. The stored heat is utilized to heat ambient air before being admitted to a greenhouse. This study is based on experimental results of the PCM employed to analyze the transient thermal behavior of the storage unit during the charge and discharge periods.

In lean rats, no differences were observed between MP and SP as regards enzyme release, bile production and NOx levels except for SP at 20 °C in which high enzyme release and low bile flow were observed. In lean rats ATP/ADP was higher and NOx was lower with MP at 20 °C than with SP at 20 °C.

Based on the currently available literature, it is concluded that Type 2 diabetes patients should be stimulated to participate in specifically designed exercise intervention programs. More attention should be paid to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning as well as motivational factors to improve long-term treatment adherence and clinical efficacy.

The scattering potential needed is calculated by on-the-fly calls to the external SCELib library for molecular properties, recently ported to GPU computing environment and ClearSpeed platforms, and made available by means of an Application Program Interface (SCELib-API) which is also provided with the VOLSCAT package in a beta version. The result is a high throughput approach to the solution of the complex e- / e+-molecule scattering problem, with allows for intensive calculations both for the number of systems which can be studied and for their size. Accurate partial and total elastic cross sections are produced in output together with the associated eigenphase sums. Indirect scattering processes arising from the formation of temporary negative ions can also be analyzed through the computation of the resonances' parameters.

Programming language: Fortran90. Computer: All SMP platforms based on AIX, Linux and SUNOS operating systems over SPARC, POWER, Intel Itanium2, X86, em64t and Opteron processors. Operating system: SUNOS, IBM AIX, Linux RedHat (Enterprise), Linux SuSE (SLES). Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes. The parallel version in the present release of the code is limited to the OpenMP calculation of the exchange potential VFEGE or VSCE. The number of OpenMP threads can then be set in the input script. RAM: For a typical (isolated) biomolecule (e.g. Cytosine or Ribose) a converged calculation would require from 320 MB up to 2.5 GB. Word size: 64 bits. Classification: 16.5. External routines: LAPACK (dsyev, dgetri, dgetrf) (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). Nature of problem: In this set of codes an efficient procedure is implemented to calculate partial cross section for the scattering between an electron/positron and a molecular target as a function of the collision energies. Solution method: The scattering equations are derived in the framework of the Single Center Expansion (SCE) procedure which allows the reduction of the original three-dimensional problem to a radial (one-dimensional) equation through the expansion of the scattering potential and the system wavefunction in a set of symmetry-adapted (real) spherical harmonics. The local part of the electrostatic interaction between the charged projectile (electron/positron) and the molecular target is provided in input by the SCELib library, which also provides the correlation and polarization corrections for the short-range and long-range part, respectively, of the interaction. A proper Application Programming Interface (API) is used by VOLSCAT to load the energy-independent part of the potential while the non-local exchange contribution is approximated by a local form and calculated on the fly in the VOLSCAT run for each desired collision energy. The resulting SCE one-dimensional homogeneous scattering equation is rewritten in an integral form by means of the standard Green's function technique resulting in a set of Volterra coupled equations which are solved to give the phase shifts and cross sections for any desired impact energy in terms of the partial components defined by the irreducible representations of the symmetry point group to which the target molecule belongs. The total cross section can then be straightforwardly calculated by summing over all the partial cross sections produced in the output. By the Breit-Wigner analysis of the eigenphase sum produced as a function of the energy one can also get information on the location of possible resonance states arising in the collision process. Restrictions: Depending on the molecular system under study and on the operating conditions the program may or may not fit into available RAM memory. Additional comments: A beta version of SCELib-API is included in the distribution package. Running time: The execution time strongly depends on the molecular target description and on the hardware/OS chosen, it is directly proportional to the (r, θ, φ) grid size and to the number of angular basis functions used. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that ingot samples were α-Al, intermetallic Al3Ni and Al2Cu phases. The optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy results show that the microstructures of rapidly solidified ribbons are clearly different from their ingot alloy. Al-10Ni-5.6Cu ribbons reveal a very fine cellular structure with intermetallic Al3Ni particles.

Bactericidal efficacy of the dressings was measured via log reductions, while bacteriostatic longevity was determined via plate-to-plate transfer corrected zones of inhibition. Morphological evolution of the dressing was studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while changes in heat flow were measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Increasing temperature increased the rate at which dressing bactericidal activity and bacteriostatic longevity decreased. Once changes in dressing properties began, they occurred nonlinearly with time. The earliest biological, chemical, and physical indicators of altered dressing properties were loss of bacteriostatic longevity, silver-oxygen bonds, and fine features, respectively. An early change in heat flow appeared to be responsible for these indicators, while a later change corresponded to rapid grain growth occurring after a critical crystallite size (∼30 nm) was reached. The grain growth exponent was determined to be 2.8 for temperatures of 100-110 °C, with an activation energy of 177 kJ/mol, suggesting that normal grain growth occurred, with volume and/or grain boundary diffusion as the dominant forms of diffusion. The thermal instability of nanocrystalline silver should be accounted for during production, storage, and use of dressings. The properties required for nanosilver antimicrobial efficacy demonstrated in this study, as well as its thermal instability, should be taken into consideration for the development of nanosilver products in the future. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A detailed analysis, coupled with a case study based on the literature data, follows. The ice making techniques are compared on the basis of energy and exergy performance criteria including charging, discharging and storage efficiencies, which make up the ice storage and retrieval process. Losses due to heat leakage and irreversibilities from entropy generation are included. A vapor-compression refrigeration cycle with R134a as the working fluid provides the cooling load, while the analysis is performed in both a full storage and partial storage process, with comparisons between these two. In the case of full storage, the energy efficiencies associated with the charging and discharging processes are well over 98% in all cases, while the exergy efficiencies ranged from 46% to 76% for the charging cycle and 18% to 24% for the discharging cycle. For the partial storage systems, all energy and exergy efficiencies were slightly less than that for full storage, due to the increasing effect wall heat leakage has on the decreased storage volume and load. The results show that energy analyses alone do not provide much useful insight into system behavior, since the vast majority of losses in all processes are a result of entropy generation which results from system irreversibilities. © 2009.","Coil; Efficiency; Encapsulated; Energy; Exergy; External; Ice; Internal; Performance; Slurry; Storage; Thermal","Coil; Encapsulated; Energy; External; Internal; Performance; Storage; Thermal; Cooling; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Entropy; Exergy; Refrigeration; Ice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349771964

The cold storage unit is composed of an energy storage tank, liquid-side heat exchanger, suction-side heat exchanger and energy storage material (ESM), water. When the cooling load is lower than the nominal cooling capacity of the system, the cold storage unit can store extra cold energy of the system to subcool the condenser outlet refrigerant. Hence, both the cooling capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) of the system will be increased. This experiment tests the two operation modes: subcooled mode with energy storage and non-subcooled mode without energy storage. The results show that for fixed cooling loads at 3.05 kW, 3.5 kW and 3.95 kW, the COP of the subcooled mode are 16.0%, 15.6% and 14.1% higher than those of the non-subcooled mode, respectively.

Classically, these data are fed to several scenarios with different solar panel, wind turbine, and storage battery number combinations. The solutions with minimal cost which also satisfy the desired maximum loss of energy probability are selected. Since the utilized data have random fluctuations because of atmospheric phenomenon, past years' data are unlikely to appear in a similar manner in future years. Hence, using a robust model that characterizes the general behavior of the data instead of directly using past data should yield more accurate sizing solutions. In order to compare the sizing accuracy obtained by directly using the data to the accuracy obtained by indirect modeling from data, an analytical solar radiation model is first explained. Using this model, 3-year solar radiation data of three geographical sites are analyzed. It was observed that the differences between sample-by-sample hourly recordings corresponding to different years are significantly larger than the difference between these recordings and the data model obtained from an arbitrary year. This provides a hint that a sizing approach carried out using the data of a previous year would not be accurate in producing the same Loss of Load Probability (LLP) for a future year. On the contrary, the accuracy would improve if a generic analytical model of the solar radiation is used in the sizing process. This foresight is tested by comparing the LLPs obtained in the two ways mentioned above. Results obtained using available data are in accordance with the aforementioned propositions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The performance of LHTS systems is limited by the poor thermal conductivity of PCMs employed. Successful large-scale utilization of LHTS systems thus depends on the extent to which the performance can be improved. A great deal of work both experimental and theoretical on different performance enhancement techniques has been reported in the literature. This paper reviews the implementation of those techniques in different configurations of LHTS systems. The influence of enhancement techniques on the thermal response of the PCM in terms of phase change rate and amount of latent heat stored/retrieved has been addressed as a main aspect.

Its unique capability to fabricate new structures at atomic scale has already produced novel materials and devices with great potential applications in a wide number of fields. Among them, significant breakthroughs are especially required in the energy sector that will allow us to maintain our increasing appetite for energy, which increases both with the number of people that join the developed economies and with our demand per capita. This needs to be done in a way that includes the environment in the wealth production equation as we gather more evidences of the human impact on the climate, biodiversity and quality of the air, water and soil. This review article does not cover in detail all the specific contributions from nanotechnology to the various sustainable energies, but in a broader way, it collects the most recent advances of nanotechnology to sustainable energy production, storage and use. For this review paper, solar, hydrogen and new generation batteries and supercapacitors are described as the most significant examples of the contributions of nanotechnology in the energy sector.

The results were compared to earlier studies. It was discovered that over the past 5-10 years, the hot weather peak load has extended from 3 pm to 6 pm and that a more northwesterly orientation of solar panels is of assistance. It was also found that wind is of little assistance in hot weather peaks, in contrast to data for the NSW central tablelands region; however solar contributes at least 50% of its nominal peak capacity. As hot weather peaks are now extending into the early evening, it was found that storage would be of great benefit and would enhance the use of renewable energy sources.

Thirty bovine incisors were prepared to expose the dentin surface and then divided in two main groups based upon the decontamination process and storage procedure: autoclaved (group A, n=15) or stored in thymol aqueous solution (group B, n=15). The surfaces of the dentin slices were schematically divided into four areas, with each one corresponding to a treatment subgroup. The specimens were either etched with phosphoric acid (control subgroup) or irradiated with erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser (subgroups: I-80mJ, II-120mJ, and III-180mJ, and total energy of 12J). Samples were analyzed by FT-Raman spectroscopy; we collected three spectra for each area (before and after treatment). The integrated areas of five Raman peaks were calculated to yield average spectra. The areas of the peaks associated with phosphate content (P<0.001), type I collagen, and organic C-H bonds (P<0.05) were reduced significantly in group A (control). Analyses of samples irradiated with reduced laser energies did not show significant changes in the dentin components. These results suggest that thymol storage treatment is advised for in vitro study; furthermore, 12J of Er:YAG laser energy does not affect dentin components. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","collagen; dentin; Er:YAG laser; FT-Raman spectroscopy; manipulation treatment","After-treatment; Bovine incisors; C-H bond; dentin; Er:YAG laser; Er:YAG lasers; Erbium doped; Fourier; FT-Raman spectroscopy; In-vitro; Integrated areas; Laser energies; Laser etching; Main group; manipulation treatment; Raman peak; Total energy; Type I collagen; Collagen; Decontamination; Doping (additives); Erbium; Phenols; Phosphoric acid; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Yttrium; Fourier transforms; Bovinae; animal; article; cattle; chemistry; dentin; in vitro study; incisor; infrared spectroscopy; methodology; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation response; Raman spectrometry; solid state laser; Animals; Cattle; Dentin; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Incisor; Lasers, Solid-State; Radiation Dosage; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Spectrum Analysis, Raman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650286911

It is remarked that the requisites for this objective are (i) minimize as much as possible the consumption of hydrogen (or hydrogen sources), (ii) produce fuels that can be easily stored and transported, and (iii) use renewable energy sources. From this perspective, the preferable option is to produce alcohols (preferably ≥C2) using solar energy to produce the protons and electrons necessary for the reaction of CO2 reduction. It is evidenced, however, that this is still a long-term objective, even if already some good advances in this direction exist. The different topics discussed in the review include CO2 (i) reverse water-gas shift and (ii) hydrogenation to hydrocarbons, alcohols, dimethyl ether and formic acid, (iii) reaction with hydrocarbons to syngas, (iv) photo- and electrochemical/catalytic conversion, and (v) thermochemical conversion. Other relevant options, such as the use of micro-algae or other bio-catalysis based processes, or the use of microwave and plasma processes are instead not addressed. Therefore, the area of carbon dioxide conversion to fuels and chemicals is a very active R&amp;D sector, and it is anticipated that it represents a challenging possibility for companies to develop complementary strategies to CSS to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In assessing the possibilities for new materials and designs, issues of thermal properties and heat transfer must be considered. While current technologies largely utilise convective heat transfer of liquids, a promising approach is the use of conductive heat transfer with highly aligned graphite in air as the storage material at temperatures ≤600 °C.

A VPP is a flexible representation of a portfolio of Distributed Energy Resources (DER: distributed generation, demand response and electricity storage). One of the key activities of a VPP is the delivery of (near-)real-time balancing services. In order to operate such a (near-)real-time coordination activity optimally, the VPP needs to maintain a dynamic merit-order list of all DER participating in the VPP. In order to make optimal decisions based on this list, the merit order needs to be based on the true marginal cost (or marginal benefit in case of demand response) of the individual DER units. The marginal electricity costs of most types of DER are highly dependent on local context and, hence, change over time. From analysis of the short-term bid strategies of various DER units, the existence of a bid strategy spectrum becomes clear. On one end of the spectrum, bidding strategies are based straightforwardly on true marginal cost or benefit. Further along the spectrum, optimal bidding strategies become less dependent on marginal cost levels and more on the price dynamics in the (VPP) market context. These results are relevant for VPP operations both from business and technical perspectives.",,"Bid strategies; Bidding strategy; Demand response; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed Generation; Electricity costs; Marginal benefit; Marginal costs; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimal decisions; Order list; Price dynamics; Time balancing; Virtual power plants; Costs; Distributed power generation; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Occupational risks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450235345

The matrix converter is a single stage converter. It does not require any dc-link energy storage component. So, the structure only requires small mounting place because the braking resistance or regeneration converter is unnecessary. In addition, it has a high-power-factor sinusoidal input current with a bidirectional power flow for the whole matrix converter control system. In this paper, the matrix converter is used to drive a PMSM servo motor. A sliding mode with a neural network controller design is proposed to improve the performance of the matrix converter-PMSM drive system. By using this scheme, the chattering of the speed is improved. In addition, the drive system has a better disturbance rejection capability and a fast speed response. All the control loops, including the switching strategy, current-loop, and control law, are implemented by TMS320LF2407A digital signal processor. The hardware circuit is very simple. Several experimental results are shown to validate the theoretical analysis. © 2009 IEEE.","Matrix converter; Neural network; PMSM; Sliding mode","AC/AC converter; Bidirectional power flow; Control laws; Control loop; Dc-link; Drive systems; Energy storage components; Hardware circuits; Highpower-factor; Matrix converter; Matrix converter drives; Neural network controllers; PMSM drives; Single stage converters; Sinusoidal input; Sliding mode controller; Sliding modes; Speed response; Switching strategies; TMS320LF2407A; AC motors; Digital signal processors; Disturbance rejection; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Permanent magnets; Power converters; Signal processing; Synchronous motors; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450192747

Samples were prepared by modified tartaric acid assisted sol-gel route and annealed in air between 300 to 600 °C in order to vary the crystallite sizes. From Reitveld refinement of XRD data, FTIR, SAD patterns, Raman and XPS studies, it has been confirmed that the synthesized samples are having single phase tetragonal rutile structure. The tetragonality 'c/a' value seems to change systematically with decreasing crystallite size. TEM studies revealed that the surface nanoparticles are aggregating with increasing particle size without forming any secondary phases within the limit of surface diffusion of dopant. The reduction of intensities of Raman peaks, shift in their positions, their shape and size distribution are found to be influenced predominantly by the nano size of the materials. The optical band gap of the materials clearly indicates a blue shift with decreasing particle sizes. From XPS data, it has been observed that the core level Co 2p binding energy values and FWHM values have been changed systematically with decreasing the nano size of the materials. However, the non-linear variation of FWHM of Ols core level XPS spectra has been observed. These results are attributed not only due to the random distribution of crystallites and local structural disorder but also due to the effect of nano size on electronic structural modifications. Moreover, surface defects are playing main role in controlling the surface bonds and associated surface properties with varying crystallite size. The Magnetization studies clearly indicated the presence of room temperature ferromagnetism in all the prepared samples. Further, the mechanism was analyzed in influencing the nano size effects on the behaviour of ferromagnetism of nano crystalline Sn 0.95Co0.05O2 powders, which may exploit for spintronic, magneto-optical, magnetic storage and ferrofluidic applications.","Diluted magnetic semiconductors; Electronic structure; Ferromagnetism; Nanocrystalline","Blue shift; Core levels; Diluted magnetic semiconductors; Electronic and magnetic properties; FTIR; Magneto-optical; Nano-size; Nanocrystallines; Nanosize effects; Non-linear variation; Phonon confinement effect; Raman peak; Random distribution; Reitveld refinement; Room temperature ferromagnetism; Secondary phasis; Shape and size; Single phase; Sol-gel routes; Spintronics; Structural disorders; Structural modifications; Surface bonds; Surface effect; Systematic investigations; Tartaric acids; TEM; Tetragonal rutile structure; Tetragonality; XPS; XPS data; XPS spectra; XRD; Agglomeration; Binding energy; Crystallite size; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Ferromagnetism; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Magnetic bubbles; Magnetic properties; Magnetic semiconductors; Magnetic storage; MEMS; Microelectromechanical devices; Nanocrystalline alloys; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Oxide minerals; Sol-gel process; Structural properties; Surface defects; Surface properties; Tin; Titanium oxides; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Surfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450203889

After annealing, the resulting film consisted of well-ordered, vertically oriented, nanocrystalline TiNT arrays of ∼130 nm pore diameter, ∼25 nm wall thickness, and ∼46 μm length, corresponding to a high aspect ratio (the length/diameter) of ∼250. The surface modification of the TiNT-array film using a simple solution-based method was carried out to fabricate a CdS nanoparticle-sensitized TiNT heterostructure-array (CdS/TiNT) film. Except for the significant shift in spectral photoresponse to a lower energy, the induced electron-hole pairs were extracted efficiently by their type-II band alignments in the CdS/TiNT arrays. This was confirmed by the incident photon-to-electron efficiency measurements and the kinetics of photocurrent decay in response to on-off irradiation. As a result of the strong absorption within the solar spectrum and the effective suppression of electron-hole pair recombination, a significant increase of ∼10 times in the apparent first-order rate constant (kobs) of methylene blue (MB) photo-degradation under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) illumination was obtained as compared with the commercial Degussa P25 film. This free-standing film provides the advantage of the use of back-side illumination where light directly strikes the CdS/TiNT arrays, largely reducing incident light loss through the solution. In this case, the kobs value was further increased by ∼30% compared with that in front-side illumination. The ease of free-standing TiO2 nanotube array film fabrication and CdS sensitization in this process will facilitate the development of environmental contaminants' solar light-driven decomposition. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, as with any form of speculation, Transactional Memory too wastes a considerable amount of energy when the speculation goes wrong and transaction aborts. For Transactional Memory this wastage will typically be quite high because programmer will often mark a large portion of the code to be executed transactionally[4]. We are proposing to turn-off a processor dynamically by gating all its clocks, whenever any transaction running init is aborted. We have described a novel protocol which can be used in the Scalable-TCC like Hardware Transactional Memory systems. Also in the protocol we are proposing a gating-aware contention management policy to set the duration of the clock gating period precisely so that both performance and energy can be improved.

High temperature storage (HTS) test, temperature cycling test (TCT), pressure cooker test (PCT) and high temperature/high humidity (HT/HH) test were conducted to investigate the reliability of chips bonded on flex substrates. The environmental parameters for reliability tests were complied with the JEDEC standards. After various reliability tests, the peeling test and microstructure observation on tested specimen were performed to evaluate the reliability. The bonding strength increased with increasing the storage durations of HTS test. The HTS test provided sufficient thermal energy to promote atomic interdiffusion between Au bumps and Cu electrodes. A metallurgical bonding between Au bump and the Cu electrode was formed, and the bonding strength is thus improved. The bonding strength of chips and flex substrates assembly without applying ultrasonic in bonding process was decreased with increasing the storage durations of PCT. The typical failure for PCT was the interfacial delamination between NCP and flex substrates. Approximately 80% specimen exhibited fully separated after PCT at 336 h, implying the NCP cannot withstand the PCT test and lost its adhesion strength. The mean bonding strength of chips and flex substrates assembly with an ultrasonic power of 14.46 W in bonding process slightly varied with increasing storage durations of PCT, and standard deviation of bonding strength increased dramatically in the range of storage durations from 196 h to 336 h. Although the adhesion strength of NCP decreased, a part of Au bumps well bonded on Cu electrodes as the storage duration increased to 336 h. Applying the adequate ultrasonic power to bonding process was not only to improve the bonding strength, but also the bonding strength could be maintained in high level after PCT. There was no significantly change in bonding strength for chips bonded on flex substrates after TCT test. It shows that specimen has great reliability for TCT test. The bonding strength increased with increasing storage durations of HT/HH test. Neither cracks nor defects at boding interface are observed. The reliability for chips bonded the flex substrate using thermosonic flip-chip bonding process with NCP meets the requirements stated in JEDEC specifications, exception of the adhesion strength of NCP for PCT should be improved. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Adhesion strengths; Atomic interdiffusion; Au bump; Bonding process; Bonding strength; Conductive pastes; Cu electrode; Environmental parameter; High temperature storage; Interfacial delamination; JEDEC standards; Metallurgical bonding; Microstructure observation; Nonconductive paste; Peeling test; Pressure cooker tests; Reliability test; Standard deviation; Temperature cycling tests; Thermosonic flip-chip bonding; Ultrasonic power; Adhesion; Bond strength (chemical); Bond strength (materials); Cracks; Diffusion bonding; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Flip chip devices; Gold; High temperature superconductors; Inorganic coatings; Packaging; Reliability; Substrates; Testing; Ultrasonics; Chip scale packages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449911743

However, there are other aspects which usually must be ensured in order to provide an efficient design of WSNs, such as area coverage and network connectivity. This paper proposes a multiobjective hybrid approach for solving the Dynamic Coverage and Connectivity Problem (DCCP) in flat WSN subjected to node failures. It combines a multiobjective global on-demand algorithm (MGoDA), which improves the current DCCP solution using a Genetic Algorithm, with a local online algorithm (LoA), which is intended to restore the network coverage when one or more failures occur. The proposed approach is compared with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based approach and a similar mono-objective approach with regard to coverage, energy consumption and residual energy of the solution provided by each method. Results achieved for a test instance show that the hybrid approach presented can obtain good solutions with a considerably smaller computational cost than ILP. The multiobjective approach still provides a feasible method for extending WSNs lifetime with slight decreasing in the network mean coverage. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Computational costs; Connectivity problems; Dynamic coverages; Efficient designs; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Hybrid approach; Integer Linear Programming; Multi objective; Multiobjective approach; Network connectivity; Network coverage; Node failure; On-Demand; On-line algorithms; Residual energy; Test instances; Computational efficiency; Electric load forecasting; Energy efficiency; Integer programming; Internet protocols; Linearization; Multiobjective optimization; Sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449786584

A detailed evaluation of the energies of various intermediates, generated by the addition of molecular hydrogen, and their interconverting barriers have been carried out using ab initio and DFT methods. Several rearrangement possibilities of the H2-phosphinoborane adduct have been investigated so as to unravel the lower energy pathways that convert the initial adduct to a series of other intermediates. The initial adduct formed by the heterolytic addition of a molecular hydrogen across the C-B bond is identified to undergo a series of rearrangement reactions until it terminates at the C-P end of the molecule. Among the possible 1,n-migrations (for which n = l-5), 1,2-proton migrations are found to possess lower energy transition states, whereas 1,2-hydride (in a zwitterionic intermediate) and 1,4-proton-coupled electron transfers exhibited much higher energy transition states. The minimum energy pathway for the transfer of a proton and hydride from the C-B bond to the C-P bond is found to involve a cascade of 1,2proton transfers followed by a 1,2-hydride migration and finally a 1,4proton-coupled electron transfer. The higher energy pathways identified for the hydride transfer suggest the possibility of a cascade of reversible proton migrations from a thermodynamically stable intermediate (Ma). Possible uptake of two hydrogen molecules by the phosphine-borane system is additionally considered in the present study, in which relatively higher barriers than those with one molecule of hydrogen are observed. The computed thermodynamic parameters are found to be in accordance with the experimental observations, in which the uptake and storage of molecular hydrogen are carried out at lower temperatures whereas the liberation demands elevated temperatures. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

As the CMOS device size shrinks down, the oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) multi-layer where charge storage takes place in discrete traps in the silicon nitride layer needs the optimization of thickness and material properties in order for the SONOS flash device to follow the CMOS technology development trend. However, the retention characteristics of SONOS flash memory degrade with the scaling of tunnel oxide, although the program/erase speed is enhanced with the decrease of tunnel oxide thickness. To overcome this problem, we adopted the SONOS structures with bandgap-engineered tunnel oxide layer. The bandgap- engineered SONOS flash memory provides faster erase speed and better retention characteristics than the conventional SONOS flash memory in our previous work. In order to identify the limitation of the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of the ultra-thin ONO barrier which replaces the single tunnel oxide layer in the conventional SONOS structures, we have controlled the EOT of the ONO barrier by the standard CMOS process and investigated their effects on the program/erase speed, memory window, and data retention characteristics of the bandgap-engineered SONOS flash memory device. As a result, the experimental data show that the ONO has a degree of freedom in the thickness of each layer but the data retention loss should be still considered. The SONOS flash memory with bandgap engineering by adopting the ONO barrier instead of single tunnel oxide layer should have a lower limit of 3 nm as the EOT for both performance and reliability. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Band gap engineering; Band gaps; Charge storage; CMOS devices; CMOS technology; Data retention; Degree of freedom; Discrete traps; Equivalent oxide thickness; Experimental data; Flash devices; Lower limits; Material property; Memory window; Nonvolatile memory devices; Oxide nitride oxides; Program/erase; Retention characteristics; SONOS flash memory; SONOS structure; Standard CMOS process; Tunnel oxide layers; Tunnel oxide thickness; Tunnel oxide]; Ultra-thin; CMOS integrated circuits; Energy gap; Nanotechnology; Nonvolatile storage; Silicon nitride; Speed; Technological forecasting; Wind tunnels; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449637701

Human SAA1 mRNA is increased by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment in human cells. These studies asked whether DHA decreases fat deposition through SAA1 and explored the mechanisms involved. We demonstrated that DHA increased human SAA1 and C/EBPa mRNA expression in human hepatoma cells, SK-HEP-1. Utilizing a promoter deletion assay, we found that a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ)-binding site in the SAA1 promoter region between -242 and -102 bp was critical for DHA-mediated SAA1 expression. Mutation of the putative C/ EBPβ-binding site suppressed the DHA-induced SAA1 promoter activity. The addition of the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 negated the DHA-induced increase in C/EBPβ protein expression. The up-regulation of SAA1 mRNA and protein by DHA was also inhibited by H89. We also demonstrated that DHA increased protein kinase A (PKA) activities. These data suggest that C/EBPβ is involved in the DHA-regulated increase in SAA1 expression via PKA-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of DHA on triacylglycerol accumulation was abolished by H89 in SK-HEP-1 cells and adipocytes, indicating that DHA also reduces lipid accumulation via PKA. The observation of increased SAA1 expression coupled with reduced fat accumulation mediated by DHA via PKA suggests that SAA1 is involved in DHA-induced triacylglycerol breakdown. These findings provide new insights into the complicated regulatory network in DHA-mediated lipid metabolism and are useful in developing new approaches to reduce body fat deposition and fatty liver. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Adipocytes; Body fats; Ccaat/enhancer-binding proteins; Docosahexaenoic acid; Fatty liver; Hepatoma cells; Human cells; Human hepatoma cells; Lipid metabolisms; mRNA expression; New approaches; Promoter activities; Promoter deletions; Promoter region; Protein expressions; Protein kinase A; Reduced fat; Regulatory network; Serum amyloid a; SK-Hep-1; Triacylglycerols; Up-regulation; Acids; Binding energy; Body fluids; Glycerol; Glycoproteins; Laws and legislation; Proteins; Binding sites; amyloid A protein; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; docosahexaenoic acid; messenger RNA; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; article; binding site; concentration response; controlled study; fatty liver; gene deletion; hepatoma cell; human; human cell; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; mutation; priority journal; promoter region; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; regulatory mechanism; upregulation; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Enzyme Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Isoquinolines; Lipids; Middle Aged; Molecular Sequence Data; Serum Amyloid A Protein; Sulfonamides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450237084

The binding of molecular hydrogen to the boron sheet (0.05 eV) is stronger than that to graphene. We find that dispersion of alkali metal (AM = Li, Na, and K) atoms onto the boron sheet markedly increases hydrogen binding energies and storage capacities. The unique structure of the boron sheet presents a template for creating a stable lattice of strongly bonded metal atoms with a large nearest neighbor distance. In contrast, AM atoms dispersed on graphene tend to cluster to form a bulk metal. In particular, the boron-Li system is found to be a good candidate for hydrogen storage purposes.

The key enzymes for PHA biosynthesis are PHA polymerases, which catalyze the covalent linkage of 3-hydroxyacyl coenzymeA thioesters by transesterification with concomitant release of CoA. Pseudomonas putida GPo1 and many other Pseudomonas species contain two different class II polymerases, encoded by phaC1 and phaC2. Although numerous studies have been carried out on PHA polymerases and they are well characterized at the molecular level, the biochemical properties of the class II polymerases have not been studied in detail. Previously we and other groups purified the polymerases, however, the activities of the purified enzymes were several magnitude lower than the granule-bound enzymes. It is problematic to study the intrinsic properties of these enzymes with such low activities, although they are pure. Results: PHA polymerase 1 (PhaC1) and PHA polymerase 2 (PhaC2) from P. putida GPo1 were overexpressed in the PHA-negative host P. putida GPp104 and purified from isolated PHA granules. Only minor activity (two to three orders of magnitude lower than that of the granule bound proteins) could be recovered when the enzymes were purified to homogeneity. Therefore, kinetic properties and substrate ranges were determined for the granule bound polymerases. The polymerases differed significantly with respect to their association with PHA granules, enzyme kinetics and substrate specificity. PhaC2 appeared to bind PHA granules more tightly than PhaC1. When R-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid was used as substrate, the granule-bound PhaC1 exhibited a Km of 125 (± 35) μM and a Vmax of 40.8 (± 6.2) U/mg PhaC1, while a Km of 37 (± 10) μM and a Vmax of 2.7 (± 0.7) U/mg PhaC2 could be derived for the granule-bound PhaC2. Granule-bound PhaC1 showed a strong preference for medium chain length (mcl-) 3-hydroxyacly-CoAs, with highest affinity towards 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA (40 U/mg PhaC1). Granule-bound PhaC2 demonstrated a far broader specificity ranging from short chain length up to long chain length substrates. Activity increased with increasing chain length with a maximum activity for 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs containing 12 or more C-atoms. Conclusion: The kinetic properties and substrate ranges were determined for both granule bound polymerases. Evidence was provided for the first time that two PHA polymerases exhibited significant differences in granule release and in vitro activity profiles, suggesting that there are substantial functional differences between granule bound PhaC1 and PhaC2. © 2009 Ren et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme a; 3 hydroxydecanoyl coenzyme A; bacterial enzyme; coenzyme A; polyhydroxyalkanoate polymerase 1; polyhydroxyalkanoate polymerase 2; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; unclassified drug; 3 hydroxyoctanoic acid; 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid; acyltransferase; bacterial protein; octanoic acid derivative; poly(3 hydroxyalkenoate)polymerase; poly(3-hydroxyalkenoate)polymerase; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; amino acid sequence; article; binding affinity; enzyme activity; enzyme isolation; enzyme kinetics; enzyme purification; enzyme specificity; enzyme substrate; enzyme substrate complex; gene overexpression; nonhuman; Pseudomonas putida; biosynthesis; chemistry; enzymology; genetics; kinetics; metabolism; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas putida; Acyltransferases; Bacterial Proteins; Coenzyme A; Kinetics; Octanoic Acids; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Pseudomonas putida; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71949120485

In general, there are several approaches, e.g., automatic repeat request, multi-path routing and source coding, used for providing reliable data transfer in WSNs. We note that the overhead and performance of such end-to-end single-path approaches are often dominated by some poor-quality links or nodes on the path. That is, these traditional approaches are not able to quickly and properly react in this multi-hop wireless environment. To cope with the above issues, in this work we would like to propose an efficient reliable data transfer scheme with network coding for WSNs. To guarantee expected reliability with appropriate overhead, we not only derive an analytic model to estimate the proper amount of redundancy, but also propose the cluster-based and distributed scheme to dynamically adjust the redundancy at each hop. Through simulations in ns2, our results show that, compared with existing reliable data transfer schemes, our approach can achieve the required reliability with significantly fewer transmissions. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Adaptive networks; Analytic models; Automatic repeat request; Cluster-based; Computational capability; Distributed schemes; Multi path routing; Multi-path; Multihop; Network coding; Network lifetime; Rapid changes; Reliable data transmission; Reliable transmission; Scarce resources; Signal strengths; Single path; Source-coding; Storage spaces; Wireless environment; Wireless link; Data transfer; Quality assurance; Redundancy; Sensor networks; Simulators; Transmissions; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449514407

Palmprint identification involves image preprocessing, an efficient algorithm for fast palmprint recognition using texture analysis, palmprint image matching and calculation of biometric parameters. It also provides facility to change orientation of palmprint image. A robust image coordinate system is defined and central part of palmprint image is extracted to facilitate image alignment for feature extraction. In addition, a 2D Gabor phase encoding scheme is proposed for palmprint feature extraction and representation, feature extraction, thus saving storage space and reduce time of authenticating a person efficiently.

The method combines large grain TMR with special voters capable of signalizing the faulty module and check point states that allow the sequential synchronization of the recovered module with the Xilinx TMR (XTMR) approach. As a result, only the faulty domain is reconfigured, minimizing time and energy spent in the process. In addition, the use of checkpoint states avoids system downtime, since the synchronization of the recovered module is performed while the others are kept running. Experimental results show that the method has a reduced fault recovery time compared to the standard TMR implementation, maintaining the compatible area overhead and performance. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Area overhead; Check points; Dynamic partial reconfiguration; Fault recovery time; Fault-tolerant; Innovative method; Large-grain; Partial reconfiguration; Soft error; Triple modular redundancy; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Security of data; Static random access storage; Fault tolerant computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449390591

Due to this reason, the gap between demand and supply is constantly increasing. To reduce this gap, there are two alternative ways: one is to generate more electricity, which requires huge investment and second is to conserve the electricity from utility side that is Demand side. The generation capacity in our country is around 1, 05, 000 MW, but due to inefficiency of power system, lack of advanced meters at various stages viz. generation, transmission and distribution, about 40 percent of energy is wasted. Therefore, there is urgent need to improve the efficiency of the power system from generating point to consumer end to reduce this wastage of energy. Simultaneously, it is required to give an attention for conservation of energy at all levels, otherwise our country may lag behind. The Demand Side Management is a strong tool for Energy Management and Conservation in industries. For effective energy management and conservation, IT based Energy Auditing is employed, where-in computers are used for data storage and display. By connecting clamp-on meters with computers, it is possible to have data management, network communication, remote monitoring, report formats, harmonics data analysis etc. This paper explains how conservation and management of electrical energy can be made possible by using computers and advanced metering technologies in industrial sector.","Demand side management; Energy saving company organization; File transfers port; Time-of-day tariffs","Conservation of energy; Data analysis; Data management; Data storage; Demand and supply; Demand side management; Demand side managements; Demand-side; Effective energy; Electrical energy; Energy auditing; Energy saving company organization; File transfers port; Generation capacity; Industrial sector; Metering technology; Network communications; Power systems; Remote monitoring; Report formats; Time-of-day tariffs; Transmission and distribution; Competition; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy management; Investments; Management; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449363628

The coding algorithm is based on the spatial orientation tree (SOT). The major feature of this WBTC algorithm is that it fuses both zero-tree and zero-block algorithm. The key feature of wavelet decomposition is its energy clustering property in space and frequency. When the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied, image is represented by set of wavelet co-efficients. Then the WBTC algorithm is applied and significance is tested at each level. It will partition the image into significant and insignificant blocks. Significant block is quad partitioned into four sub blocks until all the significant co-efficients are found. This procedure is repeated to the next resolution. Performance of the proposed method is compared with the other state-of-art coding algorithms including JPEG2000, SPIHT for many images. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a better coding efficiency over the other coders at very low bit rates.","DWT; SPIHT image compression method; Zero block; Zero tree","Block algorithm; Block trees; Coding algorithms; Coding efficiency; DWT; Image coding algorithms; JPEG 2000; Key feature; Significant blocks; Simulation result; Spatial orientations; SPIHT image compression method; Sub-blocks; Substantial reduction; Very low bit rate; Zero block; Zero tree; Algorithms; Data compression; Digital image storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Energy conservation; Image compression; Visual communication; Wavelet decomposition; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449344419

Stored keys are often protected by poorly selected user passwords that can either be guessed or obtained through brute force attacks. This is a weak link in the overall encryption system and can potentially compromise the integrity of sensitive data. Combining biometrics with cryptography is seen as a possible solution but any biometric cryptosystem must be able to overcome small variations present between different acquisitions of the same biometric in order to produce consistent keys. This paper discusses a new method which uses an entropy based feature extraction process coupled with Reed-Solomon error correcting codes that can generate deterministic bit-sequences from the output of an iterative one-way transform. The technique is evaluated using 3D face data and is shown to reliably produce keys of suitable length for 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).",,"3D faces; Advanced Encryption Standard; Asymmetric encryption; Brute-force attack; Cryptosystems; Encryption system; Error correcting code; Key generation; Possible solutions; Private key; Reed solomon; Sensitive datas; Small variations; Weak links; Biometrics; Energy conservation; Feature extraction; Keys (for locks); Cryptography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449334330

Data security ensures that kind of private and sensitive data from corruption and the access to it is suitably controlled. Enterprise businesses and government agencies around the world face the certainty of losing sensitive data from crashed devices. This drives the need for a complete data protection solution that secures data on all common platforms, deploys easily, scales to any size organization and meets strict compliance requirements related to privacy laws and regulations. The reliability and data assurance at adverse conditions is the requirement of this century. Particularly in the paradigm of ""Volunteer Computing"" which is a specific type of distributed system, where shared resources are provided in a volunteer fashion by the clients of the Desktop Data Grid System. In this paper, we propose an architecture for the desktop data grids with a centralized server which increases the performance of the system and reduces the complexity of the server. The efficiency of the system not only depends on the security level of the client but also considers the sensitivity of the data being stored in the system. Altogether a simple metric termed Fragmentation Factor (FF) is proposed in this system which considers both the security of the client and the sensitivity of the data. The erasure tornado codes are applied to cope up with unreliable data storage components in the distributed data grid systems. The enhanced levels of security can be achieved in the corporate environment by imposing Security Auditing. To ensure the security of the various servers and systems, the security has to be assessed through proper audit tools.","Attacks; Centralized server; Client/server; Fragmentation factor; Grid; Login; Security; Web-based services","Attacks; Centralized server; Client/server; Fragmentation factor; Grid; Login; Security; Web-based services; Communication systems; Cryptography; Energy conservation; Grid computing; Internet protocols; Large scale systems; Laws and legislation; Network protocols; Servers; Web services; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449334172

In the first step, the lithium storage properties of graphene have been investigated by first principles calculations. The results show that lithium can be stably stored on both sides of graphene sheets (LiC3), inducing in a theoretical capacity of 744 mAh/g. In the second step, a synthetic approach has been designed to prepare Sn/graphene nanocomposite with 3D architecture, in which Sn nanoparticles act as a spacer to effectively separate graphene nanosheets. FESEM and TEM analysis revealed the homogeneous distribution of Sn nanoparticles (2-5 nm) in graphene nanosheet matrix. Cyclic voltammetry measurement has proved the highly reversible nature of the reaction between Li+ and Sn/graphene nanocomposite.

The alane is synthesised via a chemical reaction between lithium alanate (LiAlH4) and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) at room temperature within a ball mill and at 77 K within a cryogenic mill. The reaction product formed consists of alane nanoparticles embedded within a lithium chloride (LiCl) by-product phase. The LiCl is washed with a solvent resulting in alane nanoparticles which are separated from the by-product phase but are kinetically stabilised by an amorphous particle surface layer. The synthesis of a particular alane structural phase is largely dependent on the milling conditions and two major phases (α, α′) as well as two minor phases (β, γ) have been identified. Ball milling at room temperature can also provide enough energy to allow alane to release hydrogen gas and form aluminium metal nanoparticles.

Major structural defects in the CPRS, such as the low medium-term target for emission reductions, the exemption of significant polluters from the CPRS's initial start up phase, the emphasis on the unproven technology of CCS both domestically and in Australia's negotiating stance in the lead up to the crucial Copenhagen meeting in 2009, as well as the failure to engage with the significant opportunities presented by energy efficiency and renewable energy, are all significant weaknesses in Australia's new found engagement with climate change.",,"anthropogenic effect; carbon sequestration; climate change; developing world; emission control; environmental legislation; environmental policy; international cooperation; negotiation process; policy development; Asia; Australasia; Australia; Bali; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Malay Archipelago; Poland; Poznan [Poland]; Southeast Asia; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449133859

The persistent requirements for high storage capacity have given rise to the increase of bit density per cell as in multi-level cells but this has come at the expense of performance and has resulted in degradation of durability. In this paper, we introduce a complementary approach to boost the performance and durability of MLC-based storage systems by employing a non-volatile buffer that temporarily holds the data heading to MLCs.

Endowed with complex morphologies they give a structure to the whole community, moreover, being efficient suspension feeders, they play a key role in plankton-benthos energy flow and CO2 storage. Thus, the structure and the development of benthic, hard bottom communities are linked to gorgonian survival. The red coral Corallium rubrum (L. 1758) is a precious gorgonian endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. Harvested and traded world-wide since ancient times red coral is a clear example of overexploited marine resource. This species is structured into self-seeding, genetically differentiated populations, some of which, living in the shallower part of the species bathymetric distribution, was recently affected by anomalous mortality events linked to global climate change. The co-occurrence of overharvesting and mass mortality could dramatically affect such populations. Demographic population models, widely applied by conservation biologists to check population viability and to project population trends over time are fundamental to foster survival of such populations matching harvesting to population growth rates. Therefore we set out a dynamic model of a genetically differentiated red coral population living in shallow waters. This population is characterised by small/young, crowded colonies and high recruitment rate. On the basis of the size-age structure determined for this population, a static life-history table, in which survival and reproduction coefficients of the different size-age classes were reported, has been set out. Demographic data were included in a non-linear, discrete, age-structured dynamic model, based on a Leslie-Lewis transition matrix. Our field data indicate that the recruits-to-larvae ratio is actually density-dependent. Such dependence, positive for low and negative for high density values, was included into the model and the effect of colonies of different size-age classes on recruits-to-larvae ratio was considered to be proportional to the number of polyps they have. We applied such model to simulate the trends of the studied population under different increases of survival and life-span. As some populations of gorgonians actually show the dominance of sparse, big/old colonies and low recruitment rate, while others are characterised by crowded, small/young colonies and high recruitment rate, we simulated the shift from the former to the latter structure increasing survival and life-span. Our results suggest that a dramatic mortality increase of bigger-older colonies (due, in the case of red coral to overfishing) could have determined the population structure we found. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Power consumption has been one of the most important issues in TCAM-based engines. In contrast, SRAM can be operated with low power and latency but it cannot store variable-sized data directly. While it may need several accesses per lookup, TCAM needs only one access because of its parallel search. In this paper we propose a hybrid IP forwarding engine which elaborately combines TCAM and SRAM to allow both low power and high throughput. It consists of three stages based on different kinds of memories. Each stage may or may not be operated depending on a given IP address to maximize performance and save energy. Experiment results show that the proposed engine is at least 7.3 times faster than the normal TCAM-based engine with only 1.8% energy of that engine. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","A hybrid architecture; IP address lookup; Power saving; TCAM partitioning","A hybrid architecture; High throughput; IP address lookup; IP addresss; IP forwarding engine; Lookup operations; Lookups; Low Power; Parallel search; Power Consumption; Power saving; Save energy; TCAM partitioning; Three stages; Engines; Internet protocols; Logic gates; Static random access storage; Network architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350686731

To investigate the role of menopause, body mass index BMI and aging on body fat distribution in women. Design. In this population-based cross-sectional study, 335 women 126 in pre-menopause, 75 in peri-menopause and 134 in post-menopause according to Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria were evaluated for body mass composition and fat distribution by dual X-ray absorptiometry procedure. A sub-group of 79 women with similar age and BMI was extracted from the sample to examine the relative influence of BMI in body fat distribution. Results. ANCOVA analysis of total sample showed an age-independent increase of total fat mass p < 0.001 and percentage on total weight p < 0.001, arms fat mass p < 0.01, legs fat mass percentage on total fat p < 0.05 and trunk fat mass p < 0.001 and percentage p < 0.05 in peri- and post- with respect to pre-menopausal women. In the sub-sample including age and BMI matched women the difference of regional fat parameters among menopausal status was no more statistically significant. Conclusion. BMI, and not age, is the main determinant of the increase of body fat mass total and abdominal observed during the menopausal transition. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.","Abdominal fat; Aging; Body mass index; Dual X-ray absorptiometry; Menopause","abdominal fat; adult; age; aging; arm; article; body fat; body mass; body weight; bone mineral; climacterium; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; lean body weight; leg; lipid storage; menarche; population research; postmenopause; premenopause; priority journal; trunk; waist hip ratio; Abdominal Fat; Adult; Aging; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Menopause; Middle Aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350604525

The ratio c = b/a, of outer to inner electrode radii, and the operating voltage V0 are kept constant. E0 is varied by changing the capacitance C0. Parametric variation at each E0 follows the order operating pressure P 0, anode length z0 and anode radius a until all realistic combinations of P0, z0 and a are investigated. At each E0, the optimum combination of P0, z0 and a is found that produces the biggest Ysxr. At low energies the soft x-ray yield scales as Ysxr ∼ E01.6 whilst towards 1 MJ it becomes Ysxr ∼ E00.8. The Y sxr scaling laws are found to be Ysxr∼ I peak3.2 (0.1-2.4 MA) and Ysxr∼ I peak3.6 (0.07-1.3 MA) throughout the range investigated. When numerical experimental points with other c values and mixed parameters are included, there is evidence that the Ysxr versus Ipinch scaling is more robust and universal, remaining unchanged whilst the Y sxr versus Ipinch scaling changes slightly, with more scatter becoming evident. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Inner-electrodes; Low energies; Neon plasma; Numerical experimental; Numerical experiments; Operating pressure; Operating voltage; Optimum combination; Parametric variation; Plasma focus; Soft X-ray; Storage energy; Neon; Plasma devices; Plasmas; X ray lithography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350578856

Surface energies, dispersibility, morphology, and the presence of amorphous domains were determined by inverse gas chromatography, twin stage impinger, scanning electron microscope and dynamic vapour sorption, respectively. The fine particle fraction of mixture decreased significantly in 4 weeks (P < 0.05), reaching a static level in 3 months. Amorphous content was not detected in the micronized lactose, coarse lactose and salmeterol xinafoate. After conditioning stored samples at 75% RH for 2 h, dispersive surface energy of both micronized and coarse lactose significantly decreased (P < 0.05), while the polar surface energy of all significantly increased (P < 0.05) resulting in significant increase in total surface energy after storage. After conditioning stored samples at 0% RH for 2 h, no significant difference was observed in any surface energy parameter. This study concluded that the total surface energy increased during storage at high RH due to the adhered surface moisture. The mechanism of decreased dispersibility was related to increased capillary/solid bridging interactions and to possible increased interaction of contiguous particles due to increased polar surface energy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By these new definitions, energy factor and energy storage can be extended into ac system. They can be used to compare the performance of different topologies of dc converters. The investigation of transformer's energy storage indicates that transformer has important influence to the characteristics of whole circuit. It depends on the way that transformer operates. If the transformer run as inductor (like Flyback converter), then it will improve the energy factor of the whole converter. But if the transformer run as a real transformer, then it will increase the non-active power consumption and make the energy factor worse. Simulation results explain BuckBoost and Flyback converter absorb the same amount of non-active power from front-end power supply. But the latter has better inner characteristics.

The flywheel is supported by two radial permanent magnet passive bearings. Permanent magnet passive bearings use the repulsive forces between two sets of permanent magnets so that contact-free rotation is possible. A set of voice coil actuator provides the axial stability, resulting in a complete magnetic levitation. A toroidally-wound BLDC machine which has high efficiency and little additional negative radial stiffness is used for motoring and generation. The optimization is carried out in two stages. The first stage is at the component level where separate optimizations for the bearings, actuator and BLDC machine are performed. System-level optimization determines axial sizes of these components and the placement in the system to have the maximum energy storage capacity. ©2009 IEEE.",,"BLDC machines; Component levels; Electrical energy; Energy storage capacity; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel energy storage system; Free rotation; High efficiency; Optimal design; Radial stiffness; Repulsive forces; Rotational kinetic energy; System level optimization; Two stage; Voice coil actuators; Actuators; Asymptotic analysis; Bearings (structural); Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Kinetic energy; Magnetic devices; Magnetic levitation; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Mechatronics; Optimization; Permanent magnets; Set theory; Wheels; Intelligent mechatronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350449246

The other design has a much smaller gyroscopic coupling for the ease of control. In order to analyze the stability of the systems accurately, we derived dynamic models of the flywheel rotor using finite-element method, and reduced-order models using modal truncation. The rotor model is combined with those of active magnetic bearings, amplifiers, and position sensors, resulting in a system simulation model.

This paper presents the modeling and controller design of the PV charger system implemented with the single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC). The designed SEPIC employs the peak-current-mode control with the current command generated from the input PV voltage regulating loop, where the voltage command is determined by both the PV module maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control loop and the battery charging loop. The control objective is to balance the power flow from the PV module to the battery and the load such that the PV power is utilized effectively and the battery is charged with three charging stages. This paper gives a detailed modeling of the SEPIC with the PV module input and peak-current-mode control first.

This paper introduces a new algorithm for shape from focus (SFF) based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. In contrast to the conventional focus measures operators, a three dimensional neighborhood, enabling to capture the effect of pixels from previous as well as next frames on focus value, is considered for each pixel in the image volume. A similarity matrix is computed using Euclidean metric for the sequence of these 3D neighborhoods corresponding to each object point. This matrix is then provided as input to MDS algorithm. The monotonic regression is applied which computes the fitness of the approximated configuration by using stress function as the criterion for the fitness. The energy of the components in lower dimensions is employed to compute the best focused point and its corresponding depth. The proposed method is experimented using synthetic and real image sequences. The evaluation is gauged on the basis of unimodality and monotonicity of the focus curve. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the new method. © 2009 SPIE.","3D shape; Distance matrix; Focus measure; Multidimensional scaling; Shape from focus","3D shape; Distance matrix; Focus measure; Multidimensional scaling; Shape from focus; Computer vision; Digital image storage; Image acquisition; Imaging systems; Mathematical operators; Optical data processing; Optical microscopy; Pixels; Shape optimization; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350416959

One of the most interesting salt hydrates for compact seasonal heat storage is magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H 2O). This paper describes the characterization of MgSO 4·7H2O to examine its suitability for application in a seasonal heat storage system for the built environment. Both charging (dehydration) and discharging (hydration) behaviors of the material were studied using thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, particle distribution measurements, and scanning electron microscope. The experimental results show that MgSO4·7H2O can be dehydrated at temperatures below 150°C, which can be reached by a medium temperature (vacuum tube) collector. Additionally, the material was able to store 2.2 GJ/m3, almost nine times more energy than can be stored in water as sensible heat. On the other hand, the experimental results indicate that the release of the stored heat is more difficult. The amount of water taken up and the energy released by the material turned out to be strongly dependent on the water vapor pressure, temperature, and the total system pressure. The results of this study indicate that the application of MgSO4·7H 2O at atmospheric pressure is problematic for a heat storage system where heat is released above 40°C using a water vapor pressure of 1.3 kPa. However, first experiments performed in a closed system at low pressure indicate that a small amount of heat can be released at 50°C and a water vapor pressure of 1.3 kPa. If a heat storage system has to operate at atmospheric pressure, then the application of MgSO4·7H2O for seasonal heat storage is possible for space heating operating at 25°C and a water vapor pressure of 2.1 kPa.Copyright © 2009 by ASME.","Building; Chemistry; Heating; Measurement; Solar; Storage; Testing","Built environment; Closed systems; Heat storage systems; Heptahydrates; Long-term storage; Low loss; Low pressures; Magnesium sulfate; Medium temperature; Particle distributions; Salt hydrates; Scanning Electron Microscope; Sensible heat; Solar; Solar heat; System pressure; Vacuum tube; Water vapor sorption; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric pressure; Differential scanning calorimetry; Heat storage; Heating; Hydrates; Hydration; Hydrostatic pressure; Magnesium; Scanning electron microscopy; Sorption; Vapor pressure; X ray diffraction; X ray microscopes; Water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955217124

The thermal, mechanical and economic aspects have been integrated into an iterative step-by-step optimization procedure, which is shown to be effective through application to the case study of a 600 MW h thermal storage system. The optimal design turns out to be an internally insulated, carbon steel storage tank characterized by a maximum allowable height of 11 m and a diameter of 22.4 m.

The model also incorporates the effect of the varying fluid inlet temperature to accommodate the actual conditions that prevails in the solar collector. Experimental apparatus utilizing paraffin as PCM, which is filled in high-density polyethylene spherical capsules, is constructed and integrated with a solar flat plate collector to conduct the experiments. The water used as HTF to transfer heat from the solar collector to the storage tank also acts as a sensible heat storage (SHS) material. The results of the numerical model are compared into the experimental results of the temperature profile for various porosities and HTF flow rates.

The existing approaches are quite unstructured in nature which results in poor resource management and hence inefficiency. Therefore there is a need for an application specific decentralized approach for managing data. In this paper the architecture for reliable and real time approach by using sensor clusters has been proposed for storage management. It is assumed that the sensor nodes are aware of their locations in their deployment area, and they are time synchronized. For data dissemination and action in the wireless sensor network the usage of Action and Relay Stations (ARS) has been proposed. In this paper, various design parameters pertaining to the architecture have been studied and analyzed in order to achieve the objective of reliable and efficient communication performance. © 2009 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Action and Relay Stations (ARS); Base station; Cellular; Centralized clustering; Data persistent; Reliability","Action and Relay Stations (ARS); Application specific; Cellular; Clustering data; Communication performance; Data dissemination; Data placement; Decentralized approach; Design parameters; Distributed approaches; Energy saving; Mission critical; Real time; Real-world; Relay stations; Resource management; Sensor cluster; Sensor data; Sensor inputs; Storage management; Wireless sensor; Base stations; Reliability; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Telecommunication repeaters; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952250049

PCM are a suitable and promising technology for this application. This paper presents an experimental setup to test PCM with various typical insulation and construction materials in real conditions in Puigverd de Lleida (Lleida, Spain). Nine small house-sized cubicles were constructed: two with concrete, five with conventional brick, and two with alveolar brick. PCM was added in one cubicle of each typology. For each type of construction specific experiments were done. In all cubicles, free-floating temperature experiments were performed to determine the benefits of using PCM. A Trombe wall was added in both concrete cubicles and its influence was investigated. All brick cubicles were equipped with domestic heat pumps as Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system; therefore, the energy consumption was registered, providing real information about the energy savings. Results were very good for the concrete cubicles, since temperature oscillation were reduced by up to 4°C through the use of PCM and also peak temperatures in the PCM cubicle were shifted in later hours. In the brick cubicles, the energy consumption of the HVAC system in summer was reduced by using PCM for set points higher than 20°C. During winter an insulation effect of the PCM is observed, keeping the temperatures of the cubicles warmer, especially during the cold hours of the day.

Callus cultures that did not form somatic embryos served as control. While increased levels of proline and POX activity were noticed in globular stages of embryos, CAT activity increased during early and late heart-shaped embryo formation indicating tissue-specific activation of these enzymes. The activity of PAL reached a peak during torpedo and cotyledonary stages of embryo development. On the other hand, MDH activity enhanced during the germination of somatic embryos inferring more requirement of energy during this stage.

We propose two new energysaving schemes: one improves the utilization of DRAM in storing prefetched frames, and the other extends this approach by making use of auxiliary flash memory.

However, autoxidation of biodiesel fuels during storage is easily caused by air, reducing fuel quality by adversely affecting its properties such as kinematic viscosity and acid value. One approach to improve the resistance of biodiesel fuels to autoxidation is to mix them with antioxidants. This study investigated the effectiveness of five such antioxidants in mixtures with biodiesel fuels produced by three biodiesel manufacturers: butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), propyl gallate (PrG) and α-tocopherol. An engine test was also performed to investigate the combustion characteristics of biodiesel fuel with antioxidants in an indirect-injection (IDI) diesel engine. Oxidation stability was determined using Rancimat equipment. The results showed that TBHQ, BHA, and BHT were the most effective and α-tocopherol was the least effective in increasing the oxidation stability of biodiesel. The combustion characteristics and exhaust emissions in diesel engine were not influenced by the addition of antioxidants in biodiesel fuel. This study recommends TBHQ and PrG to be used for safeguarding biodiesel fuel from the effects of autoxidation during storage. © KSME & Springer 2009.","Antioxidant; Biodiesel fuel; Exhaust emissions; Oxidative stability; Storage; Vegetable oil","Antioxidants; Biodiesel; Butylated hydroxyanisole; Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Energy storage; Fuel oils; Oxidation; Stability; Unsaturated fatty acids; Vegetable oils; Acids; Biodiesel; Bioinformatics; Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Esters; Fatty acids; Fuel oils; Hydrocarbons; Leakage (fluid); Lubricating oils; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Smoke; Stability; Synthetic fuels; Vegetable oils; Alternative diesel fuel; Bio-diesel fuel; Butylated hydroxytoluene; Combustion characteristics; Exhaust emission; Long chain fatty acid; Oxidative stability; Tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ); Acid value; Alternative diesel fuel; Animal fat; Bio-diesel fuel; Butylated hydroxytoluene; Combustion characteristics; Engine test; Exhaust emission; Exhaust emissions; Fuel quality; Kinematic viscosity; Long-chain fatty acids; Oxidation stability; Oxidative stability; Propyl gallate; Rancimat; Tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ); Fuel storage; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549174641

Particle-like Ti(Ni, Cu)2 precipitates formed in CRA are more numerous and smaller than plate-like Ti(Ni, Cu)2 precipitates formed in HRA and thus the hardness and storage modulus of the former are higher. The broader transformation peaks exhibited in CRA compared to HRA can be explained by the assistance of the tensile stress field around the plate-like Ti(Ni, Cu) 2 precipitates. The different transformation peak temperatures of B2→B19 and B19→B19′ in between HRA and CRA result from the different Cu content in the matrix.

In order to apply the multi-banked register file to a low-power microprocessor, we have to design a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) approach for the MBRF to reduce its power consumption. However, when the temporary values are stored into an MBRF, their distributed storage locations will make us difficultly identifying when a register bank should be powered up or powered down. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we analyze the accessed frequencies of the temporary-values in a program and cluster them into register banks by their frequencies through register assignment. The major goal is to make those infrequently accessed register banks have more opportunities to stay in the idle mode. Through a proposed DVS circuit, we can then supply these infrequently-accessed register banks a low voltage to save the static power. Simulation results show that, for a four-banked register file, on average, our approach reduces about 60% energy consumption while performance loss can be limited to less than 17%, compared to an MBRF without DVS.","Accessed frequency; Dynamic voltage scaling; Monolithic register file; Multi-banked register file; Register assignment","Banked register file; Distributed storage; Dynamic voltage scaling; Energy consumption; Frequency dynamics; Idle mode; Low Power; Low voltages; Performance loss; Power Consumption; Power-aware; Register assignment; Register bank; Register files; Simulation result; Static power; Voltage stabilizing circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549106341

The complex would operate on a year round basis with the ""wastes"" of one product being the feedstock for another. The complex could be introduced in stages to an existing sugar mill and is illustrated in block flow diagram and described in the text. The concept is based on existing and developing practice in producing sugar, paper pulp and fertiliser. By integrating operations we believe the sugar industry could effect a major increase in income, profitability and market flexibility. By expanding into new growth areas the concept could minimise Australia's energy and climate change problems. Potential products of an IAIC include; paper pulp, motor fuel ethanol, Ecophos a non-leaching fertiliser, sugar, lignin and electric power. Crops include; high fibre sugarcanes, sweet sorghum and nalgrass. Other raw materials include; phosphatic mine waste, fertiliser grade potash, lime and hydrogen peroxide. The main ""wastes"" arise from producing paper pulp are pith and other fines removed from bagasse to make a strong paper pulp, and potash pulping black liquor. Integration of sugar milling with the processing of other products allows a major saving in capital and operating costs. In particular it avoids the storage and reclaim of bagasse ahead of paper pulp production. Integration also allows the production of ethanol without the need to produce and dilute molasses feedstock. As an indication, the requirement of modifying an ""average size"" sugar mill could be of the order of $100 million ($ = Australian dollars) and the engagement of 30 extra mill employees. The exact numbers would depend on location and product mix. The major capital and operating costs involve addition of an ethanol plant. Potash pulping without reagent recycling is relatively cheap, as is alkali fertiliser manufacture from crandallites (the overburden waste from certain phosphate mines).","Diversification; Ethanol; Fertiliser; Integration; Paper; Profitability","Agro-industrial complex; Block flow diagrams; Capital and operating costs; Diversification; Electric power; Ethanol plants; Pulping black liquor; Sugar millings; Automotive fuels; Bagasse; Climate change; Crops; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Integration; Operating costs; Paper; Potash; Profitability; Sugar factories; Sugar industry; Pulp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149105100

In line with this hypothesis, we propose that hyperinsulinemic androgen excess in PCOS is often underpinned by exhaustion of the capacity to expand subcutaneous AT in a metabolically safe way. Such exhaustion might occur when a positive energy imbalance meets a normal fat-storage capacity and/or when a normal energy balance faces a low fat storage capacity.

In 2007 the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) examined the potential for the application of nanotechnologies to future energy systems in Australia. Four workshops were held in major cities around Australia bringing ATSE Fellows and experts together for brainstorming sessions and a questionnaire was circulated more widely. These provided inputs on future energy needs in Australia and the critical areas to be considered in research and commercialisation of nanotechnologies in energy systems. Using a matrix approach a number of opportunities were identified as short term - energy conservation, environmental management, catalysts for combustion, photovoltaic cells; medium term - catalysts for conversion of biomass, gas and coal, fuel cells, advanced photovoltaics, capture and storage of carbon dioxide; and long term - hydrogen production, storage and use. These applications are discussed in the Australian context. The implications for government policy on support of the findings are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

XRD patterns show that no phase formation between MgH2 and elements of the alloys takes place during milling and after cycling. Different morphology of the powders as-milled and after cycling was observed by SEM. Pressure-composition isotherms of these composites were obtained in the pressure and temperature range of 0.1-15 bar and 200-300 °C respectively. The maximum reversible storage capacity was found to be 6.2 wt% at 300 °C. Absorption/desorption kinetics data at pressures of 0.1-5.0 bar and temperatures of 275 °C and 300 °C show that an activation process of about 20 cycles at 300 °C is necessary for stabilization of the kinetics and for achievement of the full hydrogen capacity. The thermodynamic parameters, i.e. enthalpy of formation and dissociation calculated using Van't Hoff plots, were found to be 73.53 kJ mol-1 and 87.63 kJ mol-1 respectively, in agreement with MgH2 data reported in literature. © 2009 Professor T.

Nowadays several hydrogen storage methodologies are available. Technologies are being developed and/or engineered other than the classical compression and liquefaction of hydrogen, which are based on the chemical (metal hydrides, ammonia) and physical (e.g., carbon nanotubes) adsorption of H2. Also, a novel technology is in progress, which is based on clathrate hydrates of hydrogen. The object of the present work is to evaluate the features and performances of those storing systems with the aim to determine the best available technology throughout the ""hydrogen chain"". For each one of the storage solutions presented, we have compared key parameters such as: interaction energy between hydrogen and support, storage capacity, specific energy consumption (SEC). By this work, it is demonstrated that a technology based on clathrate hydrates of hydrogen, while far from being optimized, may be competitive with the other approaches. © 2009 Professor T.

The objective of this work is to use the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), a numerical mesoscale model generally used for weather forecast and atmospheric case studies, to simulate the flow over isolated hills, covered with vegetation of uniform and non-uniform roughness length. The ability of the model to simulate this type of flows is tested by comparison with actual microscale data. The flow is assumed to be two-dimensional and quasi-steady, and the atmosphere is dry under statically neutral and non-neutral stability conditions. The numerical grid covers a large physical domain, with constant mesh spacing in the horizontal direction and a telescopic mesh in the vertical direction. All cases studied show that the domain size, the boundary conditions and the turbulence models play an important role in the simulations. The numerical results indicate that the Mellor and Yamada turbulence model performs better than the Smagorinsky model. When compared to the Askervein, Black Mountain, Cooper's Ridge field data and other numerical and analytical results from the literature, the RAMS results predict reasonably well the vertical profiles of the mean velocity and of the absolute and relative speedups. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents an approach for the design and analysis of FC hybrid systems (FCHSs) oriented to automotive applications. The FCHS is considered to be the most attractive long-term option for propulsion of passenger cars. The design stage includes the determination of the electrical topology and the determination of the hybridization degree (HD) according to drivability conditions. With the selected design, the optimal hydrogen consumption for different driving cycles and the energy flows in the hybrid vehicle are analyzed. The entire study is performed with a detailed model of the FCHS in the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR): the determination of the HD according to drivability requirements, the analysis of the energy flows, and the computation of the optimal hydrogen consumption. The results show that hybridization allows a significant improvement in the hydrogen economy through the recovered energy from breaking. At the same time, the results suggest a conflict between a design according to drivability conditions and a design for the highest efficiency. The conclusion is that hybridization with SCs in FC-based vehicles is a meaningful procedure that enhances performance. © 2009 IEEE.","Automotive applications; Fuel cells (FCs); Hybrid vehicles; Hydrogen economy; Supercapacitors (SCs)","Advanced vehicle; Automotive applications; Design and analysis; Design stage; Detailed models; Driving cycle; Energy flow; Hybrid vehicles; Hybridization degree; Hydrogen economy; Recovered energy; Specific energy; Storage devices; Supercapacitors; Automobile simulators; Automobiles; Capacitors; Design; Electric grounding; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Land vehicle propulsion; Power converters; Simulators; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450171802

The models were tested for their validity at 12°C and found to be in good agreement with the experimentally observed respiration rates.","Enzyme kinetics; Guava; Modeling; Regression coefficient; Respiration rate","Arrhenius equation; Guava; Model parameters; Modeling; Preexponential factor; Regression coefficient; Respiration rate; Storage temperatures; Activation energy; Enzymes; Enzyme kinetics; Psidium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449397975

However, the reporting of weight loss as mean values disguises those individuals who do lose significant amounts of fat. Why some participants produce significant exercise-induced fat loss whereas others lose little or increase fat stores is likely to be an outcome of a range of behavioural (e.g. sleep deprivation, caloric intake), inherited (e.g. muscle fibre type, gender) and physiological (e.g. hyperinsulinaemia, hypothyroidism) factors. The following review highlights possible factors involved in weight loss and discusses how individual differences may determine the extent of weight loss after an exercise intervention.

Major landscape elements include drumlin swarms and tunnel valleys. Drumlins are composed of bedrock, diamicton and glaciofluvial sediments; their form truncates the substrate. Tunnel valleys of various scales (km to 100s km length), incised into bedrock and sediment, exhibit convex longitudinal profiles, and truncate drumlin swarms. Okanagan Valley is the largest tunnel valley in the area and is eroded >300 m below sea level. Over 600 m of Late Wisconsin-age sediments, consisting of a fining-up sequence of cobble gravel, sand and silt fill Okanagan Valley. Landform-substrate relationships, landform associations, and sedimentary sequences are incompatible with prevailing explanations of landsystem development centred mainly on deforming beds. They are best explained by meltwater erosion and deposition during ice sheet underbursts. During the Late-Wisconsin glaciation, Okanagan Valley functioned as part of a subglacial lake spanning multiple connected valleys (few 100s km) of southern British Columbia. Subglacial lake development started either as glaciers advanced over a pre-existing sub-aerial lake (catch lake) or by incremental production and storage of basal meltwater. High geothermal heat flux, geothermal springs and/or subglacial volcanic eruptions contributed to ice melt, and may have triggered, along with priming from supraglacial lakes, subglacial lake drainage. During the underburst(s), sheetflows eroded drumlins in corridors and channelized flows eroded tunnel valleys. Progressive flow channelization focused flows toward major bedrock valleys. In Okanagan Valley, most of the pre-glacial and early-glacial sediment fill was removed. A fining-up sequence of boulder gravel and sand was deposited during waning stages of the underburst(s) and bedrock drumlins in Okanagan Valley were enhanced or wholly formed by this underburst(s). Subglacial lake development and drainage had an impact on ice sheet geometry and ice volumes. The prevailing conceptual model for growth and decay of the CIS suggests significantly thicker ice in valleys compared to plateaus. Subglacial lake development created a reversal of this ice sheet geometry where grounded ice on plateaus thickened while floating valley ice remained thinner (due to melting and enhanced sliding, with significant transfer of ice toward the ice sheet margin). Subglacial lake drainage may have hastened deglaciation by melting ice, lowering ice-surface elevations, and causing lid fracture.

Principal advantages of the RAM are the simplicity of construction/disassembly and the attendant large energy savings due to the absence of internal elements. The absence of internal obstructions benefits the performance of the RAM in several ways. The geometry is amenable to in-depth analysis and is easier to scale up and optimize for specific applications. The absence of internals also has the benefit of making the RAM less susceptible to clogging and fouling, which can reduce downtime and maintenance cost. The RAM exploits chaotic advection to mix and transport heat in viscously dominated (low Reynolds number) flows. Among other things the RAM can effect good in-line mixing of viscous materials with a pressure drop that is the same as that of an open pipe; moreover, the RAM has several control parameters to tune the chaotic advection, making it flexible for applications.

In the grid-connected mode, the proposed control enables the wind power unit to operate with or without battery energy storage, as desired. In case that the wind-power unit is augmented with battery energy storage, in the islanded mode, the proposed control strategy enables voltage and frequency regulation for the network, and parallel operation with constant-speed wind-power units, induction motor loads, and passive loads. The proposed control strategy employs a unified controller for all of the foregoing modes of operation and, therefore, relieves the need for switching between different controllers or reconfiguration of the hardware.

Specially, power systems have more Distributed Generation, which installs near the consumer, increasingly. The resources of Distributed Generation are more clean and economical than conventional generation and fit into the variable power demand. Generally, Distributed Generator installs in consumer or near consumer for reducing transmission cost. The large-scale Distributed Generators connect with Power Company, and supplies electrical power energy to consumer via power grid. On the contrary, small-scale renewable energy resources in consumer side can supply the electrical power to the local consumer and other consumers, which connect with power system. The change of the power system configuration needs for development of the equipment that controls and/or monitoring the power system. There are too many efforts in development of the monitor and control the power system. From these results lead to develop the EMS (Energy Management System) and SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system. Nevertheless, these systems are too huge and too expensive to install in consumer side that works with small-scale renewable energy source. From that reason, it is need that develop a small size and inexpensive equipment that role of EMS or SCADA. In this paper describes development process of the inexpensive monitoring equipment that works with Distributed Generator at consumer side, and shows validity of measuring data.

As sensor nodes have limited battery paower, computing, and storage resources, the energy efficient security techniques are needed.We provide a new heuristic approach to search for balanced and small weight routing spanning trees in a network. The approach is a modification of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree (MST) search algorithm and is based on a distributed search by hierarchical clusters. It provides spanning trees with a lower maximum degree, a bigger diameter and can be used for balanced energy consumption routing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The approach can be implemented in parallel as well as a simple locally distributed algorithm. Simulations of a realistic scenario WSN are done based on the transmission energy matrix. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can extend the functional lifetime of a WSN in 3-4 times in terms of sensor transmission energy.

However, a FC system combined with an energy storage system (ESS) can display a preferable performance for vehicle propulsion. As the additional ESS can fulfill the transient power demand fluctuations, the fuel cell can be downsized to fit the average power demand without facing peak loads. Besides, braking energy can be recovered by the ESS. This study focuses on a vehicular system powered by a fuel cell and equipped with two secondary energy storage devices: battery and ultra-capacitor (UC). However, an advanced energy management strategy is quite necessary to split the power demand of a vehicle in a suitable way for the on-board power sources in order to maximize the performance while promoting the fuel economy and endurance of hybrid system components. In this study, a wavelet and fuzzy logic based energy management strategy is proposed for the developed hybrid vehicular system. Wavelet transform has great capability for analyzing signals consisting of instantaneous changes like a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) power demand. Besides, fuzzy logic has a quite suitable structure for the control of hybrid systems.

A variety of methodologies have been proposed to cut these emissions. A preferred method is CO 2 Capture and Storage in geological formations (CCS). Despite exceptional CCS potential in the Province of Alberta, there are legal and regulatory issues that must be resolved to allow its implementation. Without these changes there will not be enough certainty to enable the industry to make appropriate decisions that encourage investment. Existing regulations of Alberta in oil and gas sector designed to regulate acid gas disposal provide a basis for regulating geological storage of CO 2. However, these regulations cannot be directly used to handle huge CO 2 storage volumes compared to the acid gas disposal amounts. Disposal of CO 2-rich acid gas streams is mainly regulated by the directives of Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (AERCB). Guidelines are provided in this paper to show how these regulations can be the basis for geological storage projects. The guidelines are given for different CO 2 storage project stages of: planning and design, operation, closure, and post-closure. The guidelines presented in this work are applicable to any regulatory regime for assessment and management of the risks associated with CO 2 storage activities. At the planning and design stage of the project, certain criteria for site selection are proposed, including comprehensive reservoir characterization and modeling for risk assessment and performance prediction of storage project. The regulatory regime can then use performance-based and procedural regulations to ensure sufficient data is acquired and a model with a specified confidence limit is available. Risk of leakage is highest during the operation stage because the formation pressure is the highest at this stage. Considerations to be made by the regulatory regime to ensure containment of the CO 2 during this stage are proposed. Guidelines are given on what should be considered by the regulatory regime to ensure sufficient level of monitoring. Implementing these changes encourages, but does not guarantee the regulatory system to be compatible with future technologies and adapt to changes in risk and remediation.

In particular, reduced energy consumption generally leads to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants into the environment. It also helps reduce the operational costs in the facility. There is a strong need to take some energy saving measures in every plant/facility. Although these may be quite diverse, some of these measures include thermal insulation, use of more efficient equipment, heat recovery systems, high efficiency lighting, changing the fuel, reducing the cost of compressed air, and enhancing productivity. In this study, some certain energy conservation measures are considered for assessing a packaging film manufacturing facility in Gaziantep, Turkey. Taking advantage of dry and hot climates of the city, cooling compressor inlet air by evaporative cooling technique is also assessed. Our investigation shows that there is a huge room for energy conservation measures. The total savings potential are expected to be 869,350 YTL (about $725,000) representing about 16% of the total energy consumption. The payback periods for the identified measures are justified.

T2N 1N4, Canada","The upper Columbia River, British Columbia, Canada, shows typical anastomosing morphology - multiple interconnected channels that enclose floodbasins - and lateral channel stability. We analysed field data on hydraulic and sedimentary processes and show that the anastomosing morphology of the upper Columbia River is caused by sediment (bedload) transport inefficiency, in combination with very limited potential for lateral bank erosion because of very low specific stream power (≤ 2.3 W/m2) and cohesive silty banks. In a diagram of channel type in relation to flow energy and median grain size of the bed material, data points for the straight upper Columbia River channels cluster separately from the data points for braided and meandering channels. Measurements and calculations indicate that bedload transport in the anastomosing reach of the upper Columbia River decreases downstream. Because of lateral channel stability no lateral storage capacity for bedload is created. Therefore, the surplus of bedload leads to channel bed aggradation, which outpaces levee accretion and causes avulsions because of loss of channel flow capacity. This avulsion mechanism applies only to the main channel of the system, which transports 87% of the water and &gt; 90% of the sediment in the cross-valley transect studied. Because of very low sediment transport capacity, the morphological evolution of most secondary channels is slow. Measurements and calculations indicate that much more bedload is sequestered in the relatively steep upper anastomosing reach of the upper Columbia River than in the relatively gentle lower anastomosing reach. With anastomosing morphology and related processes (e.g., crevassing) being best developed in the upper reach, this confirms the notion of upstream rather than downstream control of upper Columbia River anastomosis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Anastomosing river; Avulsion; Bedload; Fluvial geomorphology; Sediment transport; Stream power","avulsion; bank erosion; bedload; braided river; channel morphology; meander; river channel; sediment transport; stream bed; streamflow; Columbia River; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949117808

Generally, there are three types of SMES-solenoid, multiple solenoid, and toroid. Among these types, toroid type seems to require more wires than solenoid type and multiple solenoid type at the same operating current. However toroid type reduces normal field in the wire and stray field dramatically because magnetic field is confined inside the coil. So, the total length of wire in the toroid type can be reduced in comparison with that in the solenoid type by increasing operating current. In this paper, a 2.5 MJ class SMES with HTS magnets of single solenoid, multiple solenoid and modular toroid type were optimized using a recently developed multi-modal optimization technique named multi-grouped particle swarm optimization (MGPSO). The objective of the optimization was to minimize the total length of HTS superconductor wires satisfying some equality and inequality constraints. The stored energy and constraints were calculated using 3D magnetic field analysis techniques and an automatic tetrahedral mesh generator. Optimized results were verified by 3D finite element method (FEM). © 2009.","HTS magnets; MGPSO; SMES","3-D finite element method; 3-D magnetic field analysis; HTS magnet; HTS magnets; Inequality constraint; MGPSO; Modular toroid; Multi-modal optimization; Operating currents; Optimal design; Power system applications; SMES; Stored energy; Stray field; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Superconducting technology; Tetrahedral meshes; Total length; Constraint theory; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; High temperature superconductors; Magnetic fields; Magnetic storage; Magnets; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Solenoids; Superconductivity; Three dimensional; Wire; Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149152907

Each double pancake coil consists of two solenoid coils with an inner diameter of 500 mm, an outer diameter of 691 mm, and a height of 10 mm. The aluminum plates of 3 mm thickness were arranged between double pancake coils for the cooling of the heat due to the power dissipation in the coil. The magnet was cooled down to 5.6 K with two stage Gifford McMahon (GM) cryocoolers. The maximum temperature at the HTS magnet in discharging mode rose as the charging current increased. 1 MJ of magnetic energy was successfully stored in the HTS magnet when the charging current reached 360A without quench.

The effects of core size and shell thickness on the optical properties of CdSe/CdS heterostructure nanocrystals are investigated. We report a reliable synthetic method to grow thick CdS shells on CdSe cores with sizes ranging from 2.5-4.7 nm. We provide a calibration curve, which enables determination of CdS shell thickness (±0.1 nm) over a wide range of core sizes, circumventing the need for time-consuming HRTEM analyses. Epitaxial growth of the shells was verified by HRTEM, XRD, and SAED. In-situ reaction measurements revealed the average per particle (p) deposition rates for cadmium and sulfur to be kCd = 5.38 × 10-25 mol s -1 p-1 and kS = 4.83 × 10-24 mol s-1 p-1. Faster sulfur deposition rates are attributed to the absence of strong sulfur binding ligands in the growth medium. Through the rigorous use of high resolution transmission electron microscopy, a direct link between the dimensions of the heterostructures and their band-edge transition energies, quantum yields, and excited state lifetimes is established. The experiments show that the band-edge transition energies of the core samples, which initially span approximately 431 meV, condense to span only 163 meV after the growth of a 6 monolayer-thick CdS shell. Furthermore, shifts in the band-edge transition energies were found to be extremely sensitive to core size. The QY of the as-prepared core/shells ranged from 25 to 60%. The QYs and band-edge lifetimes of the core/shells were found to depend upon the ligands adsorbed to the particle surface. These data prove that one or both of the charge carriers still has access to the particle surface despite the presence of a 2.2 nm thick CdS shell. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Band edge; Band edge transition; Binding ligands; Calibration curves; CdS; CdSe/CdS; Core size; Direct links; Excited state lifetimes; Growth medium; Heterostructures; HRTEM analysis; In-situ reactions; Particle surface; Shell thickness; Sulfur depositions; Synthetic methods; XRD; Cadmium; Cadmium compounds; Data storage equipment; Deposition rates; Epitaxial growth; Heterojunctions; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ligands; Monolayers; Nanocrystals; Optical properties; Reaction rates; Shells (structures); Sulfur; Semiconducting cadmium compounds; cadmium selenide; cadmium sulfide; nanocrystal; article; chemical binding; chemical structure; electron diffraction; quantum yield; reaction time; structure analysis; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Cadmium Compounds; Kinetics; Microscopy, Electron; Nanoparticles; Selenium Compounds; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Sulfides; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349929841

Standardization is difficult because they are usually mixtures of many constituents and the active principle in most cases is unknown. However it is possible to generate a physico-chemical fingerprint for the standardization of these drugs with reference to authentic drugs, for monitoring variation between preparations from different companies and for evaluating batch to batch changes during long term storage. The present study was on the characterization of some of the metal based herbal medicines which were in traditional use for treating infectious diseases. Approach: Modern techniques such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX), Infrared spectroscopy (IR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to generate physico-chemical fingerprint. Results: Our results showed that the metals in most of the herbal medicines were in the oxide or sulfide form. Some of the medicines contained metal particles in the nano range.

In the process, a glass roller is first coated with a metal thin film. A high-energy pulsed laser directly machines the metal thin film and thus defines the pattern on the roller's surface. Subsequent wet etching on the patterned roller using the residual metal layer as the etching mask completes the fabrication of seamless glass roller molds. Digital image processing techniques are incorporated into the laser machining processes so that complicated patterns can be successfully transferred. Experimental results demonstrate a smallest feature size down to 20 J1m for both linear grating and dot-array patterns. The advantages of this method are: (1). seamless patterns on roller mold, (2). good machining accuracy, (3). easiness in achieving complicated patterns, and (4). low cost.

Nanowires are made from a metallic photonic crystal and a dielectric photonic crystal where the former is embedded into the latter. Photons are localized within the metallic crystal and are reflected from the dielectric crystal. The nanowire is doped with nanoparticles, which are interacting with the localized photons. It is found that number of bound photons states within the wire depends on the plasmon frequency. The bound photon energy decreases as the plasmon energy increases. Numerical simulations of the absorption coefficient predict that the position of a transparent state can be switched by changing the frequency of plasmons.

Apoptosis, known as programmed cell death, is an active form of cell death mechanism that is tightly regulated by multiple cellular signaling pathways and requires ATP for its appropriate process. Apoptotic death plays essential roles for successful development and maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis in mammalian. In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is classically considered as a passive cell death process that occurs rather by accident in disastrous conditions, is not required for energy and eventually induces inflammation. Regardless of different characteristics between apoptosis and necrosis, it has been well defined that both are responsible for a wide range of human diseases. Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD-I) is a kind of human genetic disorders and is caused by the deficiency of a microsomal protein, glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α) or glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) responsible for glucose homeostasis, leading to GSD-Ia or GSD-Ib, respectively.

Therefore, it can be viewed as a promising solution to increase a system's thermal efficiency and greatly improving exhaust emissions. This paper presents experimental study results concerning the operating capabilities of the HPPS and the effect of the contraction of the cross-sectional area (CSA) at the merging region of the energy merger pipe for the change in the compressed airflow pressure (Pair) on the exhaust-gas energy recycling of the HPPS. The experiments were performed on an HPPS that uses an innovative energy merger pipe with a total length of 530 mm, a diameter of 34 mm, and an angle between the two pipes of 30°, and the CSA was adjusted for the change in Pair. The experimental results show that the exhaust-gas energy recycling and the merger flow energy are significantly dependent on the CSA adjustment for the change in Pair. The optimum conditions for the best merging process can be achieved at a CSA of around 5-35% in the full range of Pair. Under these conditions, the exhaust-gas energy recycling efficiency reached approximately 75-81%; therefore, a vehicle equipped with an HPPS can achieve efficiency that is approximately 40% higher than that of conventional vehicles.

Thermal analysis of the precursor salt showed the onset of crystallization of CeO2 at 300 °C. Therefore, cerium dioxide thin films were prepared at different deposition temperatures from 300 to 450 °C. Films were transparent (T ~ 80%), polycrystalline with cubic fluorite crystal structure and having band gap energy (Eg) in the range of 3.04-3.6 eV. The different morphological features of the film obtained at various deposition temperatures had pronounced effect on the ion storage capacity (ISC) and electrochemical stability. The larger film thickness coupled with adequate degree of porosity of CeO2 films prepared at 400 °C showed higher ion storage capacity of 20.6 mC cm- 2 in 0.5 M LiClO4 + PC electrolyte. Such films were also electrochemically more stable than the other studied samples. The Ce4+/Ce3+ intervalancy charge transfer mechanism during the bleaching-lithiation of CeO2 film was directly evidenced from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The optically passive behavior of the CeO2 film (prepared at 400 °C) is affirmed by its negligible transmission modulation upon Li+ ion insertion/extraction, irrespective of the extent of Li+ ion intercalation. The coloration efficiency of spray deposited tungsten oxide (WO3) thin film is found to enhance from 47 to 53 cm2 C- 1 when CeO2 is coupled with WO3 as a counter electrode in electrochromic device. Hence, CeO2 can be a good candidate for optically passive counter electrode as an ion storage layer. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Among the solutions proposed, hydrogen storage by physisorption on porous solids constitutes a main avenue of research, and for intelligent design of such materials a detailed knowledge of gas adsorption thermodynamics is of the utmost importance. Analysis of the available data for hydrogen adsorption on alkali and alkaline-earth cation exchanged zeolites clearly shows that standard adsorption enthalpy (ΔH0) and entropy (ΔS0) are correlated, in the sense that larger ΔS0 values correspond to larger ΔH0 values. It was also shown that, referring to absolute values, the relative rate at which adsorption entropy changes decreases gradually as adsorption enthalpy increases thus resulting in a non-linear correlation between ΔH0 and ΔS0. These results are discussed and corresponding implications for hydrogen storage via physisorption are highlighted. © TÜBİTAK.","Adsorption thermodynamics; Enthalpy-entropy correlation; Hydrogen physisorption; Hydrogen storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77449124299

These properties made these materials excellent candidates as active compounds for high capacity cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries. LiCoO 2 is the most common lithium storage material for lithium rechargeable batteries, used widely to power portable electronic devices. Operation of lithium rechargeable batteries is dependent on reversible lithium insertion and extraction processes into and from the host materials of lithium storage. In this study, LiCoO2 thin films were prepared by the sol-gel spin coating technique using metal acetate and citric acid as starting materials. Citric acid acts as a chelating agent, which promotes the preliminary reaction between lithium and cobalt and suppresses the precipitation of acetates. The sol-gel method is well known as one of promising thin-film preparation methods, which has good advantages such as low fabrication cost, relatively easy stoichiometry control, high deposition rate and also known as a low-temperature synthesis method for various ceramics. In addition, the crystal phases involved in the thin film can also be controlled by changing the chemical compositions of the sol. The crystallinity, microstructure and electrochemical properties of final films are also studied by XRD, SEM, AFM and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling test. Films heat-treated under appropriate conditions exhibit high capacity and good crystallinity so those films are considered to be candidates as cathodes for thin-film micro batteries. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Characterization; LiCoO2 thin films; Sol-gel","Active compounds; AFM; Cathode materials; Chelating agent; Chemical compositions; Crystal phasis; Crystallinities; Extraction process; Fabrication cost; Galvanostatic charge/discharge; High capacity; High deposition rates; High energy densities; Host materials; LiCoO2 thin films; Lithium insertion; Lithium rechargeable batteries; Lithium storages; Long cycles; Low temperature synthesis; Metal acetate; Micro battery; Portable electronic devices; Preparation method; Rechargeable lithium battery; SEM; Sol-gel methods; Sol-gel spin coating; Starting materials; Stoichiometry control; Thin film cathodes; Transitional metal oxide; Working conditions; XRD; Acids; Cathodes; Chelation; Citric acid; Cobalt; Electrochemical properties; Gels; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Materials properties; Metal recovery; Metallic compounds; Occupational risks; Secondary batteries; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Sols; Stoichiometry; Synthesis (chemical); Thin film devices; Thin films; Film preparation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449097851

Four different models, Peleg's, Weibull, first order and exponential association, were applied to experimental data, and the corresponding parameters of the models were obtained. In addition, the kinetic parameters of the models were correlated with the ratio of microwave output power to sample amount and temperature. Although all the models applied provided a good agreement with the experimental data with high values of the coefficient of determination of R2, the first-order kinetic model was chosen as the appropriate model because of its simplicity. By using the kinetic parameters of this model, the activation energy for rehydration kinetics was estimated as 1.15 kJ/mol. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Drying, in general, is a means of removal of water from the material. The purpose of drying food products is to allow longer periods of storage with minimized packaging requirements, reduce shipping weights, and preserve seasonal plants and make them available to consumers during the whole year. Besides these advantages, some important changes take place, as structural and physicochemical modifications, which affect the final product quality during dehydration. Rehydration is a complex process aimed at the restoration of raw material properties when dried material contacted with water, and can be considered as a measure of the injury to the material caused by drying. The objective of rehydration study is to attain as many products in their original characteristics as fast as possible. An improved knowledge of rehydration kinetics would significantly enhance the feasibility of this process. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Abelmoschus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350451945

Some explanations emphasize traits enhancing net carbon gain; others emphasize energy conservation traits such as storage of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). To date, cross-species studies have provided mixed support for the role of NSC storage in low-light survival. We examined NSC status, survival, biomass, and growth of large seedlings of two evergreen species of differing shade tolerance (Nothofagus nitida and N. dombeyi) grown in deep shade and 50% light for two growing seasons. We expected to find higher NSC concentration in the more shade-tolerant N. nitida and since allocation to storage involves sacrificing growth, higher growth rate in the shade-intolerant N. dombeyi. NSC concentration of both species was >twofold higher in 50% light than in deep shade, and in roots and stems did not differ significantly between species in either environment. NSC contents per plant were also similar between dead and living plants in deep shade. N. dombeyi outgrew N. nitida in 50% light, while this pattern was reversed in deep shade. Survival in deep shade was not correlated with NSC concentration. Leaf mass fraction was similar between species in 50% light, but lower in N. dombeyi in deep shade. Results provide little evidence of a link between carbohydrate storage and low-light survival in Nothofagus species, and support the view that understorey survival is primarily a function of net carbon gain. Patterns of variation in NSC concentration of the temperate species we studied are likely dominated by more important influences than adaptation to shade, such as limitation of growth or adaptation to cold stress. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.","Allocation; Carbon gain; Non-structural carbohydrates; Shade tolerance; Temperate forest","adaptation; biomass; carbohydrate; evergreen tree; growth rate; light effect; net ecosystem exchange; resource allocation; shade tolerance; survival; temperate forest; Nothofagus; Nothofagus dombeyi; Nothofagus nitida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350366412

At 150 min after feeding, the concentration of free amino acids in arterial and portal blood plasma of rats fed legume proteins was significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from rats fed animal protein (lactalbumin). In arterial plasma the concentration for Met, Leu, Trp and Lys in rats fed legume proteins was lower than lactalbumin controls and for Val and Cys higher; in portal plasma, the concentration of free Met, Leu, Trp and Lys was lower, and the concentration of Cys was higher in rats fed legume proteins than in rats fed lactalbumin.

Hypotheses: Egg nutrients sustain development to the exotrophic larval stage in echinoderms with feeding (planktotrophic) larvae and to the exotrophic juvenile stage in species with nonfeeding (lecithotrophic) larvae. Whereas planktotrophic echinoderm development requires egg lipid reserves that are readily metabolized, lipids suitable for long-term energy storage might be more appropriate fuels for lecithotrophic development. Organisms: We considered closely related asteroid and ophiuroid species that possess a range of egg sizes and represent three modes of larval development (planktotrophy, planktonic lecithotrophy, benthic lecithotrophy). Methods: We used Iatroscan TLC-FID to quantify maternal investment of lipids on a per egg basis for each species and focused on egg content of the two dominant classes of energy storage lipid, triacylglycerol (TAG) and diacylglycerol ether (DAGE). Results: Energetic lipids in the small eggs of echinoderms with feeding larvae are primarily TAG, a class of short-term storage lipids. DAGE, which is metabolized more slowly than TAG, dominates the large eggs of echinoderms with non-feeding larvae. Increased deposition of DAGE lipids in the eggs of planktotrophic species may facilitate the transition to lecithotrophy. © 2009 Thomas A.A.

Excess fat tissue causes significant morbidity, and adipose tissue dysfunction caused by excessive adipocyte hypertrophy has been proposed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disease. Studies in both humans and animal models show that metabolic dysfunction is more closely associated with visceral than subcutaneous fat accumulation. Here, we show that in mice fed a high-fat diet, visceral fat (VAT) grows mostly by hypertrophy and subcutaneous fat (SAT) by hyperplasia, providing a rationale for the different effects of specific adipose depots on metabolic health. To address whether depot expansion is controlled at the level of stem/progenitor cells, we developed a strategy to prospectively identify adipogenic progenitors (APs) from both depots. Clonogenic assays and in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) studies show that APs are eightfold more abundant in SAT than VAT, and that AP proliferation is significantly increased in SAT but not VAT in response to high-fat diet. Our results suggest that depot-specific differences in AP abundance and proliferation underlie whether a fat depot expands by hypertrophy or hyperplasia, and thus may have important implications on the development of metabolic disease. In addition, we provide the first evidence that dietary inputs can modulate the proliferation of adipogenic progenitors in adults. © AlphaMed Press.","Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Flow cytometry; Obesity; Stem cells","broxuridine; adipogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell hyperplasia; cell proliferation; cell size; clonogenic assay; controlled study; fat body; female; in vivo study; intraabdominal fat; lipid diet; lipohypertrophy; male; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonhuman; stem cell; stem cell expansion; subcutaneous fat; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Bromodeoxyuridine; Cell Count; Cell Division; Cell Proliferation; Colony-Forming Units Assay; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Food, Formulated; Hyperplasia; Hypertrophy; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Stem Cells; Animalia; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350228797

This review discusses angiotensin II (Ang-II), the biologically active component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Evidence suggests that a functioning RAS is present in adipose tissue. Animal studies have demonstrated that modifying the amount of Ang-II in the body (eg, using RAS knockout/transgenic animal models or the pharmacological treatment of animal models to prevent the formation or action of Ang-II) directly influences body weight and adiposity. In humans, body fat is correlated with levels of angiotensinogen, a precursor of Ang-II. Thus, the treatment of obesity could be improved through the use of substances that interfere with Ang-II. © Thomson Reuters (Scientific) Ltd.","Adipose; Angiotensin; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; Body fat; Metabolism; Obesity","angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; angiotensin II; bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist; candesartan; captopril; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; enalapril; losartan; telmisartan; valsartan; adipose tissue; body fat; body weight; clinical trial; drug effect; human; hypertension; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; review; treatment response; Adipose Tissue; Adiposity; Angiotensin II; Angiotensinogen; Animals; Body Weight; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Obesity; Receptors, Angiotensin; Renin-Angiotensin System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349747133

Whereas adipose tissue is by far the largest storage site of fatty acids as TAG, subcellular TAG-containing structures - referred to as lipid droplets (LD) - are also present in other tissues. Until recently, LD were considered inert storage sites of energy dense fats. Nowadays, however, LD are increasingly considered dynamic functional organelles involved in many intracellular processes like lipid metabolism, vesicle trafficking, and cell signaling. Next to TAG, LD also contain other neutral lipids such as diacylglycerol. Furthermore, LD are coated by a monolayer of phospholipids decorated with a variety of proteins regulating the delicate balance between LD synthesis, growth, and degradation. Disturbances in LD-coating proteins may result in disequilibrium of TAG synthesis and degradation, giving rise to insulin-desensitizing lipid intermediates, especially in insulin-responsive tissues like skeletal muscle. For a proper and detailed understanding, more information on processes and players involved in LD synthesis and degradation is necessary. This, however, is hampered by the fact that research on LD dynamics in (human) muscle is still in its infancy. A rapidly expanding body of knowledge on LD dynamics originates from studies in other tissues and other species. Here, we aim to review the involvement of LD-coating proteins in LD formation and degradation (LD dynamics) and to extrapolate this knowledge to human skeletal muscle and to explore the role of LD dynamics in myocellular insulin sensitivity.

Canada as a catalytic additive for MgH2 has been investigated. Each n-Ni filament is composed of nearly spherical interconnected particles having a mean diameter of 42 ± 16 nm. After ball milling of the MgH2 + 5 wt.%n-Ni mixture for 15 min the n-Ni particles are found to be uniformly embedded within the particles of MgH2 and at their surfaces. Neither during ball milling of the MgH2 + 5 wt.%n-Ni mixture nor its first decomposition at temperatures of 300, 325, 350 and 375°C the elemental n-Ni reacts with the elemental Mg to form the Mg2Ni intermetallic phase (and eventually the Mg2NiH4 hydride). The n-Ni additive acts as a strong catalyst accelerating the kinetics of desorption. From the Arrhenius and Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov theory the activation energy for the first desorption is determined to be ∼94 kJ/mol. After cycling at 300°C the activation energy for desorption is determined to be ∼99 kJ/mol. This is much lower than ∼160 kJ/mol observed for the undoped and ball milled MgH2. During cycling at 275 and 300°C the n-Ni additive is converted into Mg2Ni (Mg2NiH4). The newly formed Mg2NiH4 has a nanosized grain on the order of 20 nm. Its catalytic potency seems to be similar to its n-Ni precursor. The formation of Mg2Ni (Mg2NiH4) may be one of the factors responsible for the systematic decrease of hydrogen capacity observed upon cycling at 275 and 300°C. © 2009 Professor T.

Most non-grid connectedareas, mostly rural, are powered with solar home systems whose sustainability is limited by the short life span, low power density and low storage efficiency of the battery storage. The electromechanical flywheel rotor is made from glass fiber and epoxy composite and designed using novel shape profiles based on Berger, Porat and Stodola's design. Dr. Stodola's design utilizes a stress based solution by introducing a central hole for a shaft inclusion. An Axial flux brushless DC machine was considered because of the low cost, ease of construction and simple control. The system stores 1,080kJ and supplies 100W with an operating speed range of 8,000-25,000 rpm. Stress, modal and thermal analysis are performed on the flywheel system using finite elements and analytical methods.

Flywheel technology have been widely used in varies of areas, including power system, space craft, and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). An effective flywheel system mainly attribute to its good Motor /Generator (M/G) design. This paper describes the design of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) as an M/G suitable for integration in a flywheel energy storage system within a large HEV. The operating requirements of the application include wide power and speed ranges combined with high total system efficiency. The machine described in this paper has been designed to meet these requirements together with a number of additional constrains that include restricted dimensions, voltage and current limits. Along with presenting the design, essential issues upon PMSM design including cogging torque, iron losses and total harmonic distortion (THD) are investigated, and certain strategies as solutions to those issues have been introduced and compared.

Energy savings, process and other benefits can often be achieved with Adjustable Speed Drives (ASDs). Process availability is of primary concern since production losses can potentially negate the benefits of ASDs. It is essential to ensure that SMs ride through ASD and system faults, disturbances and supply transfers. SM and excitation system models suitable for both on-line and ASD ride-through simulations are discussed. Case studies, simulation and test results are presented for the first 11 kV Voltage Source Inverter for 17 MW synchronous motors. Further case studies are presented for a 55 MW synchronous motor. It is shown that line fed and ASD fed SMs can survive system faults and voltage dips without additional compensation or energy storage. ASD fed SMs have far better survivability characteristics than line fed SMs and can survive faults cleared by system back-up protection. It is shown how SMs can ride through ASD faults associated with fault tolerant schemes. Boundary parameters are investigated to eliminate unacceptable transient torques associated with ride- through operation.

However, the typical power profile of an automobile motor consisting of transients is not suitable for the use of a sole FC system for vehicle propulsion. This shortcoming could be partly overcome by hybridization. Two potential benefits of combining an FC system with an energy storage unit, ultra-capacitor (UC) has been presented in this study. Firstly, the durability of the FC system could be improved because the additional energy source can fulfill the transient power demand fluctuations. Secondly, the ability of the energy storage source to recover braking energy enhances the fuel economy greatly. An important aspect in designing a hybrid power structure is to find a suitable control strategy that can manage the active power sharing and take advantage of the inherent scalability and robustness benefits of the hybrid system. An integrated procedure for mathematical modeling and power control strategy design for an FC/UC hybrid vehicle is presented in this paper. A fuzzy logic supervisory controller based power management strategy that secures the power balance in hybrid structure, enhances the FC performance and minimizes the power losses is proposed. The main contribution of this paper apart from the previous studies of the authors is the modeling of the complete FC power system with air supply compressor and the integration of the control of the FC system internal dynamics (especially the oxygen excess ratio) into the overall supervisory control structure to maximize the efficiency and durability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power management scheme, simulation studies were performed using MATLAB®, Simulink® and SimPowerSystems® environments by integrating the detailed mathematical and electrical models of the hybrid vehicular system.

Adult strategies to reduce energetic stress include changes in activity patterns, reduced basal metabolic rates, and storage of energy prior to a reproductive attempt. I quantified patterns of behavior in five groups of wild siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus) to detect periods of high energetic investment by adults and to examine the relationships between infant care and adult activity patterns. For females, the estimated costs of lactation peaked at around infant age 4-6 months and were low by infant age 1 year, whereas the estimated costs of infant-carrying peaked between ages 7 and 12 months, and approached zero by age 16 months. There was a transition from primarily female to male care in the second year of life in some groups. Females spent significantly less time feeding during lactation than during the later stages of infant care, suggesting that female siamangs do not use increased food intake to offset the costs of lactation. Female feeding time was highest between infant ages 16 and 21 months, a period of relatively low female investment in the current offspring that coincided with the period of highest male investment in infant care. This suggests that male care may reduce the costs of infant care for females in the later stages of a reproductive attempt. The female energy gain resulting from male care was likely invested in somatic maintenance and future reproduction, rather than the current offspring. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Infant-carrying; Lactation; Parental care; Siamang; Symphalangus syndactylus","animal behavior; ape; article; energy conservation; energy consumption; female; food intake; lactation; male; nonhuman; parental behavior; Symphalangus syndactylus; weaning; Age Factors; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Female; Hylobates; Lactation; Male; Maternal Behavior; Paternal Behavior; Reproduction; Sex Factors; Sleep; Time Factors; Weaning; Mammalia; Sia; Symphalangus syndactylus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349144579

H3A2B2, Canada","The effect of grain clustering on the intergranular crack-propagation behaviour of polycrystalline materials has been simulated using a novel integrated modeling approach combining Voronoi microstructure, Markov Chain theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The model takes into account the size, number, and spatial positions of clusters as well as the grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) of the cluster and non-cluster areas. Besides, the effect of grain boundary alignment with respect to the applied stress direction is considered. It has been found that the overall GBCD, often used as the input parameter to assess the crack-propagation extent is not a suitable mean for this purpose when the microstructures to be evaluated contain clustered regions. For the same overall GBCD, the crack-length, percolation frequency and percolation threshold have been found to be significantly different for the grain boundary network containing clustered zones than those of the non-clustered microstructure. In addition, the overall GBCD method was not found to be appropriate even when two clustered microstructures were compared. It was observed that, once the low-energy boundary frequency in the clustered areas reaches a value that can effectively blunt all the cracks that enter into them, the GBCD in the non-cluster region controls the cracking behaviour and percolation frequency. Besides, the spatial distribution of clusters has been found to have momentous effect on the crack-propagation and arrest behaviour. The percolation thresholds obtained for different cluster containing microstructures clearly demonstrate that this parameter strongly depends on the descriptions of the clusters present in the microstructure. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, this paper focuses on the methods that can be used to determine the ability of a storage to promote and maintain stratification during charging, storing and discharging, and represent this ability with a single numerical value in terms of a stratification efficiency for a given experiment or under given boundary conditions. Existing methods for calculating stratification efficiencies have been applied to hypothetical storage processes of charging, discharging and storing, and compared with the rate of entropy production caused by mixing calculated for the same experiments. The results depict that only one of the applied methods is in qualitative agreement with the rate of entropy production, however, none of the applied methods is in agreement with the rate of entropy production and also able to distinguish between the entropy production caused by mixing and the entropy changes due to heat losses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The surface morphology, particle size and particle size distribution (PSD) were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical characterization of PMMA/octacosane microcapsules was made by FT-IR spectroscopy method. Thermal properties and thermal stability of microencapsulated octacosane were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The melting and freezing temperatures and the latent heats of the microencapsulated octacosane as PCM were measured as 50.6 and 53.2 °C, 86.4 and -88.5 J/g, respectively, by DSC analysis. TGA analysis indicated that the microencapsulated octacosane degrade in two steps and had good chemical stability. Thermal cycling test shows that the microcapsules have good thermal reliability with respect to the accelerated thermal cycling. Based on the results, it can be considered that the microencapsulated octacosane have good energy storage potential. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of 'solar cogeneration' by means of PV/t hybrid collectors enables the simultaneous production of electricity and heat, which can be directly used by desiccant air handling units, thereby making it possible to achieve very energy savings. The present work shows the results of detailed simulations conducted for a set of desiccant cooling systems operating without any heat storage. System performance was investigated through hourly simulations for different systems and load combinations. Three configurations of DEC systems were considered: standard DEC, DEC with an integrated heat pump and DEC with an enthalpy wheel. Two kinds of building occupations were considered: office and lecture room. Moreover, three configurations of solar-assisted air handling units (AHU) equipped with desiccant wheels were considered and compared with standard AHUs, focusing on achievable primary energy savings. The relationship between the solar collector's area and the specific primary energy consumption for different system configurations and building occupation patterns is described. For both occupation patterns, sensitivity analysis on system performance was performed for different solar collector areas. Also, this work presents an economic assessment of the systems. The cost of conserved energy and the payback time were calculated, with and without public incentives for solar cooling systems. It is worth noting that the use of photovoltaics, and thus the exploitation of related available incentives in many European countries, could positively influence the spread of solar air cooling technologies (SAC). An outcome of this work is that SAC systems equipped with PV/t collectors are shown to have better performance in terms of primary energy saving than conventional systems fed by vapour compression chillers and coupled with PV cells. All SAC systems present good figures for primary energy consumption. The best performances are seen in systems with integrated heat pumps and small solar collector areas. The economics of these SAC systems at current equipment costs and energy prices are acceptable. They become more interesting in the case of public incentives of up to 30% of the investment cost (Simple Payback Time from 5 to 10 years) and doubled energy prices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the aging-associated mtDNA mutations have been shown to result in not only inefficient generation of ATP but also increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions (O2{radical dot}-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the mitochondria of aging tissues. Extensive studies have revealed that such an increase of oxidative stress is a contributory factor for alterations in the expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids in tissues and cultured cells from elderly subjects. Recently, we observed that gene expression of several proteins and enzymes related to iron metabolism is altered and that aconitase is extremely susceptible to oxidative damage in senescent skin fibroblasts and in cybrids harboring aging-associated A8344G mutation of mtDNA. Of great importance is the perturbation at the protein and activity levels of several enzymes containing iron-sulfur clusters in skin fibroblasts of elderly subjects. Taken together, these findings suggest that cellular response to oxidative stress and oxidative damage elicited by mitochondrial dysfunction and/or mtDNA mutations plays an important role in human aging. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As the instruction windows get larger with each generation of processors, register files and other structures that hold intermediate data become larger and dissipate more power. Therefore it is important to find new ways to reduce the energy dissipation of data holding components. Many values written to and read from these storage components are known to require fewer bits than is provided by the storage space. Upper order bits of these values are unnecessary and energy savings can be achieved by not writing and reading these bits. Floating value data has different characteristics and offer special energy savings opportunities. In this paper we analyze the bit-level statistics of data values and propose simple modifications to data holding components that save significant energy inside the processors. Our results show that by using simple modifications on the storage components it is possible to achieve 40% reduction in the integer register file energy dissipation and up to 60% reduction in the immediate field of the issue queue. We also show that energy dissipation can be reduced by half for some floating point benchmarks by identifying values that indicate a zero operand. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Computer architecture; Energy management; Integrated circuit design; Microprocessors; Registers","Data values; Energy saving; Floating points; Instruction windows; Integer register files; Integrated circuit design; Issue queue; Level statistics; Microprocessors; Register files; Registers; Simple modifications; Source of energy; Special energy; Storage component; Storage spaces; Superscalar micro-processors; Value data; Architectural design; Computer architecture; Computers; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electronics packaging; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Energy dissipators; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Integrated circuit manufacture; Integrated circuits; Microprocessor chips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69749090488

This paper is a study on the production costs of 24 process routes utilizing these primary energy sources. A wide range of projected energy prices in 2030-2050 found in the open literature is used. The basis for comparison is the production cost per t of high value chemicals (HVCs or light olefin-value equivalent). A Monte Carlo method was used to estimate the ranking of production costs of all 24 routes with 10,000 trials of varying energy prices and CO2 emissions costs (assumed to be within $0-100/t CO2; the total CO2 emissions, or cradle-to-grave CO2 emissions, were considered). High energy prices in the first three quarter of 2008 were tested separately. The main findings are:•Production costs: while the production costs of crude oil- and natural gas-based routes are within $500-900/t HVCs, those of coal- and biomass-based routes are mostly within $400-800/t HVCs. Production costs of coal- and biomass-based routes are in general quite similar while in some cases the difference is significant. Among the top seven most expensive routes, six are oil- and gas-based routes. Among the top seven least expensive routes, six are coal and biomass routes.•CO2 emissions costs: the effect of CO2 emissions costs was found to be strong on the coal-based routes and also quite significant on the biomass-based routes. However, the effect on oil- and gas-based routes is found to be small or relatively moderate.•Energy prices in 2008: most of the coal-based routes and biomass-based routes (particularly sugar cane) still have much lower production costs than the oil- and gas-based routes (even if international freight costs are included). To ensure the reduction of CO2 emissions in the long-term, we suggest that policies for the petrochemicals industry focus on stimulating the use of biomass as well as carbon capture and storage features for coal-based routes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Oxygen consumption (VO2) and body temperature (Tb) were recorded at rest, during exercise, and after 30 min of recovery. DA induced a marked increase in workload (~ 45%, p &lt; 0.05). At fatigue point, DA-injected rats attained ~29% higher maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) and ~0.75 °C higher Tb than SAL-injected rats. Despite the higher VO2max and Tb attained during exercise, DA-treated rats reached VO2 basal values within the same recovery period and dissipated heat ~33% faster than SAL-treated rats (p &lt; 0.05). The mechanical efficiency loss rate was ~40% lower in DA than in SAL-treated rats (p &lt; 0.05), however, the heat storage was ~35% higher in the DA group (p &lt; 0.05). Our results demonstrate that increased DA availability in the brain has a performance-enhancing effect, which is mediated by improvements in the tolerance to heat storage and increases in the metabolic rate induced by graded exercise.

The effect of fibers content, sand-bitumen ratio and the combination of fillers and fibers on the resistivity of asphalt mortar was investigated. It was found that the percolation threshold happened sooner by adding electrically conductive fibers than by adding fillers. Percolation threshold was also found to be function of the sand-bitumen ratio and of the volume of fibers content. There is an optimum content of fibers for each sand-bitumen ratio, above which it is difficult to make the mixture and the electrical resistivity increases exponentially. Besides, in case of adding conductive fillers or a mixture of conductive fibers and fillers to the mastic, once the maximum conductivity is reached, it remains constant, independently of the volume of conductive filler added. Nano CT-scan (computed axial tomography) reconstructions were also used to visualize the fibers connected inside the mixture.

The wind energy systems may not be technically viable at all sites because of low wind speeds and being more unpredictable than solar energy. The combined utilization of these renewable energy sources are therefore becoming increasingly attractive and are being widely used as alternative of oil-produced energy. Economic aspects of these renewable energy technologies are sufficiently promising to include them for rising power generation capability in developing countries. A renewable hybrid energy system consists of two or more energy sources, a power conditioning equipment, a controller and an optional energy storage system. These hybrid energy systems are becoming popular in remote area power generation applications due to advancements in renewable energy technologies and substantial rise in prices of petroleum products. Research and development efforts in solar, wind, and other renewable energy technologies are required to continue for, improving their performance, establishing techniques for accurately predicting their output and reliably integrating them with other conventional generating sources. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of the design, operation and control requirement of the stand-alone PV solar-wind hybrid energy systems with conventional backup source i.e. diesel or grid. This Paper also highlights the future developments, which have the potential to increase the economic attractiveness of such systems and their acceptance by the user.

The most usual systems are PV-Wind-Battery and PV-Diesel-Battery. Energy storage is usually in batteries (normally of the lead-acid type). Another possible storage alternative, such as hydrogen, is not currently economically viable, given the high cost of the electrolyzers and fuel cells and the low efficiency in the electricity-hydrogen-electricity conversion. When the design of these systems is carried out, it is usually done resolve an optimization problem in which the Net Present Cost (NPC) is minimized or, in some cases, in relation to the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCE). The correct resolution of this optimization problem is a complex task because of the high number of variables and the non-linearity in the performance of some of the system components.

However, the interaction between silicon thin-film electrodes and various electrolytes (both liquid and solid) is, up until now, not well understood. The interface between the electrode and electrolyte plays a crucial role in the Li-(de)insertion reaction as here the actual charge transfer reaction takes places. To this end, some important issues on the activation of the electrode/electrolyte interface will be addressed in this paper.

However, due to the distributed and unattended nature of WSNs, several attacks aiming at compromising the authenticity of the collected data could be perpetrated. For example, an adversary could capture a node to create clones of the captured one. These clones disseminated through the network could provide malicious data to the aggregating node, thus poisoning/disrupting the aggregation process. In this paper we address the problem of detecting cloned nodes; a requirement to be fulfilled to provide authenticity of the data fusion process. First, we analyze the desirable properties a distributed clone detection protocol should meet. Specifically: It should avoid having a single point of failure; the load should be totally distributed across the nodes in the network; the position of the clones in the network should not influence the detection probability. We then show that current solutions do not meet the exposed requirements. Next, we propose the Information Fusion Based Clone Detection Protocol (ICD). ICD is a probabilistic, completely distributed protocol that efficiently detects clones. ICD combines two cryptographic mechanisms: The pseudo-random key pre-distribution, usually employed to secure node pairwise communications, with a sparing use of asymmetric crypto primitives. We show that ICD matches all the requirements above mentioned and compare its performance with current solutions in the literature; experimental results show that ICD has better performance than existing solutions for all the cost parameters considered: Number of messages sent, per sensor storage requirement, and signature verification. These savings allow to increase the network operating lifetime. Finally, note that ICD protocol could be used as an independent layer by any data aggregation mechanism. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The kinetic energy barrier depends on the nature of the substituent X, generally increasing with decreasing electronegativity and increasing π-donor ability of the substituent: F (ΔG298 = 0 kJ mol-1) &lt; Cl (72) &lt; Br (90) &lt; CH3 (104) &lt; CN (114) (MR-AQCC(2,2)//UB3LYP/cc-pVTZ). Following initial C-C bond formation, three possible dinitrosoethylene diradical pathways are explored. Two of them are new, and one of them is a low-energy three-step path with implications for cycloreversion, tautomerism and detection of dinitrosoethylene intermediates. Alternative one-step, concerted [3 + 2] and [3 + 3] cyclodimerisation processes leading to 1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxides and 1,4,2,5-dioxadiazines have kinetic energy barriers around 100-240 kJ mol -1 (CCSD//B3LYP), some 1.6 to 2.5 times higher than those leading to furoxans, supporting the experimental observations of furoxan formation as nitrile oxide loss channels during storage, trapping/re-vaporisation and reactions of nitrile oxides. Potential polymerisation initiation processes for NCCNO, involving the 1,2-dipolar NC substituent are also explored. © 2009 the Owner Societies.",,"1,2,5 oxadiazole 2 oxide; 1,2,5-oxadiazole 2-oxide; nitrile; oxadiazole derivative; oxide; article; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; quantum theory; thermodynamics; Computer Simulation; Molecular Structure; Nitriles; Oxadiazoles; Oxides; Quantum Theory; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349237300

The same characteristics that make cobalt-based NPs so attractive raise serious questions about their safety. In this context, we investigated Co3O4-NPs. Believing that the characterization of NPs is relevant for understanding their biological activity, we analyzed them by atomic force and electron microscopy to define size, shape, and aggregation. To clarify whether their biological effects could be due to a potential release of cobalt ions, we evaluated spontaneous dissolution in different media. To determine their potential toxicity to human cells, we measured cell viability and ROS formation in two human cell lines using CoCl2 for comparison. Co3O4-NPs induced a concentration- and time-dependent impairment of cellular viability, although cobalt ions were more toxic. We also demonstrated that cobalt causes a rapid induction of ROS if supplied in the form of Co3O4-NPs rather than as ions. Moreover, we evaluated the cellular uptake of NPs. Interestingly, Co3O4-NPs are able to enter the cell very rapidly, remaining confined in vesicles inside the cytoplasm. They were found also inside the cell nuclei, though less frequently. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A wireless transmission system over Bluetooth and 3G is analyzed for its application to the real-time transmission of neural signals captured by implanted micro-electrode array sensors. Average compression rate of 75% of the neural signal is achieved through detection using nonlinear energy operator preprocessing and automatic threshold adaptation.

For making better use of those green powers but without system instability, an autonomous control basing on multiple energystorage devices (ESDs) is proposed. Where, each ESD only respects to a simple rule as well as its individual controller to determine charging or discharging. Through such an autonomous control to ESDs, the change of total injection power of an area can be minimized. That is, system stability can be enhanced. In addition to extend the ESD control to interconnected systems where are with multiple machines and tie lines, the considerations about area control error (ACE) and automatic generation control (AGC) are also combined into this control.

Wind power generation system (WPGS) is widely being introduced in the worldwide power utilities. The WPGS output power fluctuates due to wind speed variations. Hence, if a large number of wind power generators are connected to the grid system, their output can cause serious power quality problems, that is, frequency and voltage fluctuations may happen. In order to solve these problems, the smoothing control of wind power generator output is very important. In addition, Superconducting Magnet Energy Storage (SMES) is surely one of the key technologies to overcome these fluctuations. The SMES can compensate even small disturbances.

Kalymnos, one of the Greek Dodecanese islands, was selected as the site for the design exercise. The solar irradiation data for this location were used to design the PV-RO plant that is simulated in this paper. The PV power production varies with insolation, and therefore the plant operates under variable flow conditions. This variability, as well as that induced by cloudy weather, is reduced by means of suitable electrical storage (a Pb-acid battery array). The influence of some relevant process parameters is studied by means of a numerical process simulation of the plant, and a pseudo-optimal operating point was found that minimizes the energy consumption per unit mass of distillate, within the World Health Organization standards of salt concentration. An economic analysis is also performed to calculate the product cost: the results indicate that the PV-RO plant is much more cost effective than the present ship-based water delivery system.

The power generated in electronic chips is dissipated in phase change material (PCM n-ecosane with melting temperature Tm 36°C) that filled a rectangular enclosure. The advantage of using this cooling strategy is that the PCMs are able to absorb a high amount of heat generated by electronic component (EC) without acting the fan, during the charging process (melting of the PCM). A (2D) mathematical model was developed in order to analyze and optimize a heat sink. The governing equations for masse, momentum and energy transport were developed and discretised by using the volume control approach. The resulting algebraic equations were next solved iteratively by using TDMA algorithm. Numerical investigations were conducted in order to optimize the thermal performance of the heat sink. The optimization involves determination of the key parameters of the heat sink that maximize the time required by the base of the electronic component to reach a critical temperature.

One of the main challenges facing this technology today is plant availability. Due to the specific characteristics of this technology, current practices cannot sufficiently address plant availability. A different approach is needed. This paper proposes the use of Bayesian Networks as an extension of existing methods. Ultimately, the approach described in this paper is directed towards scenario-informed decision making to improve plant availability. This includes the prioritization of potential scenarios of unavailability and allocation of resources to prevent or mitigate the most serious scenarios, as well as operator training and identification of indicators of potential unavailability. A case study that demonstrates the application of the initial steps of the proposed approach has been conducted within a Dutch IGCC plant. A Bayesian Network was constructed for the syngas treatment unit of the plant, in which identified unavailability scenarios were modeled. Results from the case study indicate that our approach can help a company to identify, quantify, and prioritize scenarios, which can act as an input to improve availability management. © 2009 IEEE.","Availability management; Bayesian networks; Energy conversion","Availability management; Current practices; Existing method; Informed decision; Integrated gasification combined cycle technology; Operator training; Plant availability; Prioritization; Syn-gas; Treatment units; Coal deposits; Distributed parameter networks; Energy conversion; Inference engines; Intelligent networks; Maintainability; Network management; Personnel training; Random access storage; Research; Resource allocation; Speech recognition; Bayesian networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349125034

UGS has been used effectively for nearly a century to balance the mismatch in gas supply and demand. Its use continues to grow and with the advent of gas market liberalization, additional uses of UGS have been introduced. In several countries some 20-30% of the annual gas consumption is supplied through the use of UGS. This paper provides an overview of the most common use of UGS, the current status of UGS in the world and the main characteristics of the various types of facility: such as gas fields, aquifers and salt caverns.

On the other hand in the warm season or regions, it needs to remove some extra heat from air conditioner radiator (condenser). This subject effects directly on global warming. Changing some part of this waste energy to shaft work (or electricity) not only has benefit in the way to find a source for hybrid automobiles but also, it has effect on global warming, fuel economy, saving natural resources and if the fuel produce CO2, less greenhouse effect and less air pollution defect could be remarkable. In this work, a new cooling system is offered that is the same as a core of boiling water (nuclear) reactors (BWR), it means a subcooled working fluid could enter to engine shell then during the heat removes from engine and exhaust gas, it will be a boiling generator (boiling heat exchange) for a smart thermodynamic cycle. In this way not only could change some parts of unused energy to work, but also it has more capability with environment. Here, it is offered this idea by using the typical engines data. The Results confirm that it can recover at least about 20% of waste heat. This new cooling system is suitable for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) which combines a conventional propulsion system with an on-board rechargeable energy storage system. However, it can use this idea for almost the entire internal ignition engines in automobiles or somewhere that needs to remove some heat from a device, same as condensers of modified power plants or engine of ships.

The concentration profiles of indium and the components of CdS films (Cd and S) in In/nCdS/pSi structures were studied using the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis.

The temperature dependences of the storage modulus E′ and the internal friction Q-1 of HPNs, investigated by mechanical waves of frequencies ranging between 0.3 and 30 Hz, reveal anelastic behaviors which are mainly governed by the secondary β- and primary α-relaxations. The addition of cross-links in an apparently linear polymer network was accompanied by the shift of the glass transition to higher temperatures. Differently from the α-relaxation whose strength decreases with cross-linking, the β-relaxation strength increases. This observation implies the lack of any dynamical hierarchy between the local and cooperative segmental dynamics in these systems. The β-relaxation follows the Arrhenius law with values of the characteristic frequency ω0 and the activation energy Eact ranging between 1015 and 1016 s-1 and 43.7 and 48.7 kJ/mole, respectively.

An ester-amine-functionalized silsesquioxane and a PDMS macromer were synthesized, and the macromer (10 wt %) was crosslinked with the PU prepolymer to obtain PU networks. The synthesized macromers and hybrids were characterized with. Fourier transform infrared, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and 29Si-NMR spectroscopy techniques. The influence of POSS cubes on the thermal and mechanical properties of the polymer network films was studied comparatively with the similarly functionalized PDMS linear chain via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements. The degradation pattern of the POSS-incorporated PU nanocomposites was almost the same as that of the PU network synthesized from the linear PDMS macromer. The differences in the char yields and activation energies of the hybrids reflected the enhancement of the thermal properties of the nanohybrids. The TGA and DSC curves of the macromers suggested that the thermal properties of the macromers not only depended on either the PDMS or POSS inorganic core but also depended on the organic peripheral attached to the inorganic core. The glass-transition temperatures of the nanohybrids were higher than those of the linear-PDMS-incorporated hybrids. The storage modulus values increased 3-fold upon the incorporation of POSS rigid groups into the PU hybrids in comparison with the flexible PDMS-chain-incorporated PU hybrids.

Two independent physical methods, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and thermoluminescence (TL) detection were employed for detection of irradiation treatment on Basmati rice. EPR investigation of 0.5-2.0 kGy irradiated rice samples showed a short lived, asymmetric, dose dependent spectrum (g = 2.005), characterised by the radicals of irradiated starch. However, this signal disappears with time. The present work explores the possibility to identify irradiated rice by the relaxation characteristics and thermal behaviour of the radicals. This study reports for the first time that the different microwave saturation behaviours of the signal (g = 2.004) in irradiated and non-irradiated rice samples provide an important clue to identify radiation treatment beyond the period when the radiation specific EPR spectral lines have disappeared.

This allows the implementation into existing commercial finite elements codes, preserving their program structure. As customary, the Hertzian law and the Newmark implicit time integration scheme are used for solving the contact problem. The contact radius and the force are computed within each time step by an iterative algorithm which forces the impacted top surface to conform, in the least-squares sense, to the shape of the impactor. Nonlinear strains of von Karman type are used. As appearing by the comparison with experimental results, the present model is able to accurately predict the impact force, the core damage and the damage of face sheets in sandwich composites with foam and or honeycomb core. Moreover, this paper also assesses the accuracy and the range of application of stress based criteria in predicting the onset and evolution of delamination in service. These criteria are widespread by virtue of their low run time and storage costs, although no exhaustive proofs are known weather they are accurate enough for a reasonably wide range of applications. Since where highly iterative solutions are involved (e.g., impact and geometric, or material nonlinear problems) they are the only currently affordable failure models, it appears of primary importance to fill this gap. Aimed to contribute to the knowledge advancement in this field, a comparison is presented with more sophisticate fracture mechanics and progressive delamination models.

The extent of ion fragmentation was studied as a function of both vaporization energy and ionization wavelength. Low CO2 laser energies in the vaporization stage and near-threshold single photon ionization resulted in the least fragmented mass spectra. For DHB, only the molecular ion was observed, but for oleic acid fragmentation could not be eliminated. Tandem MS of the main fragment peak from oleic acid was carried out and provided a tool for compound identification. Photoionization efficiency curves were also collected for both DHB and oleic acid and the appearance energies of both parent and fragment ions were measured. Evidence for fragmentation occurring post-ionization is given by the similar appearance energies for both the parent and fragment ions. The results from this study were compared with those from similar experiments undertaken with time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers. The degree of fragmentation in the ion trap was considerably higher than that seen with TOF systems, particularly for oleic acid. This was attributed to the long storage interval in the ion trap which allows time for metastable ions to decay. Differences in the degree of fragmentation between the ion trap and TOF studies also provided further evidence for fragmentation occurring post-ionization. For 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, the long delay prior to mass analysis also allowed time for reactions with background gases, in this case water, to occur. © the Owner Societies 2009.",,"2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone; benzophenone derivative; benzoresorcinol; oleic acid; aerosol; article; atmosphere; chemistry; electrospray mass spectrometry; environmental monitoring; evaluation; gas; methodology; particle size; particulate matter; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Aerosols; Atmosphere; Benzophenones; Environmental Monitoring; Gases; Oleic Acid; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949150094

Rainwater samples were collected from an underground storage tank in 2 L polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and SODIS efficiency was evaluated at different weather conditions. For optimizing SODIS, PET bottles with different backing surfaces to enhance the optical and thermal effects of SODIS were used and different physicochemical parameters were selected and evaluated along with microbial re-growth observations and calculating microbial decay constants. Total and fecal conforms were used along with Escherichia Coli and Heterotrophic Plate Counts (HPC) as basic microbial and indicator organisms of water quality. For irradiance less than 600 W/m 2, reflective type PET bottles were best types while for radiations greater than 700 W/m2, absorptive type PET bottles offered best solution due to the synergistic effects of both thermal and UV radiations. Microbial inactivation did not improve significantly by changing the initial pH and turbidity values but optimum SODIS efficiency is achieved for rainwater with acidic pH and low initial turbidity values by keeping air-spaced PET bottles in undisturbed conditions. Microbial re-growth occurred after one day only at higher turbidity values and with basic pH values. First-order reaction rate constant was in accordance with recent findings for TC but contradicted with previous researches for E. coli. No microbial parameter met drinking water guidelines even under strong experimental weather conditions rendering SODIS ineffective for complete disinfection and hence needed more exposure time or stronger sunlight radiations. With maximum possible storage of rainwater, however, and by using some means for accelerating SODIS process, rainwater can be disinfected and used for potable purposes. © IWA Publishing 2009.","Coliform; PET; Potability; Rainwater; SODIS","Coliform; PET; Potability; Rainwater; SODIS; Beverages; Bottles; Developing countries; Disinfection; Energy policy; Escherichia coli; Meteorology; Polyethylene terephthalates; Potable water; Rate constants; Solar energy; Thermoplastics; Turbidity; Ultraviolet radiation; Water pollution; Water quality; pH; drinking water; polyethylene terephthalate; rain; bioindicator; coliform bacterium; developing world; disinfection; drinking water; feces; pH; physicochemical property; rainwater; roof; storage; water quality; weather; acidity; article; calculation; controlled study; disinfection; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; heterotrophy; microbial growth; physical chemistry; sunlight; thermal exposure; turbidity; ultraviolet radiation; water quality; water sampling; Developing Countries; Disinfection; Equipment Design; Escherichia coli; Facility Design and Construction; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Rain; Sunlight; Temperature; Ultraviolet Rays; Water; Water Microbiology; Water Purification; Water Supply; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69749087374

The images are stable at room temperature and are readily observable using fluorescence microscopy. For a constant energy dose, the images are stronger and better resolved at the shorter laser wavelengths and cannot be recorded with continuous wavelength (CW) light sources. Images are easier to obtain with high Tg films, while polymers with Tg below room temperature image only when the laser also causes polymer cross-linking. It is proposed that laser excitation generates excited singlet pyrene and simultaneously causes a temperature change that facilitates diffusion and thus excimer formation. Following excited state (monomer and excimer) decay, the polymer matrix cools down and prevents the separation of the pyrene pairs, that are preserved by the rigid polymer matrix.

By harvesting energy from the local environment, these devices can achieve greater run-times without the need for battery recharging or replacement. Harvesting energy could also achieve a reduction in the weight and volume of the personal devices - as batteries often make up more than half the weight/volume of these devices. Motion energy harvesting is one such approach where energy from mechanical motion can be converted into electrical energy. This can be achieved through the use of flexible piezoelectric transducer materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). A problem with these transducer materials it that their behaviour is non-linear due to operating and environmental conditions. Hence, for this reason researchers have found it has been difficult to measure the harvesting performance i.e. mechanical-to- electrical conversion efficiency.

Objective: To evaluate body composition and insulin sensitivity (IS) modifications throughout puberty in a large group of obese Caucasian subjects. Methods: Five hundred and nineteen obese subjects (4-19 years), grouped according to gender and Tanner stage (T), underwent oral glucose tolerance test. Quantitative insulin check index (QUICKI) and ISI were calculated as indexes of IS. In 309 subjects, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, IGF1, adiponectin, and leptin were also evaluated. Results: Body composition modifications were sexually dimorphic, with girls not modifying fat and lean percentage and fat distribution (P>0.15), and boys decreasing fat percentage and increasing lean percentage and central fat depot (P<0.001) across Ts. IS decreased during mid-puberty and returned to prepubertal levels by the end of puberty. Girls showed lower IS than boys (P<0.01 and =0.03 for QUICKI and ISI respectively). In multivariate analysis factors that negatively influenced IS, independently from T or age, were total fat mass and central fat depot in girls (P<0.05 and <0.01, respectively), total fat and lean mass in boys (P<0.01). IGF1, adiponectin, and leptin were not related to pubertal IS. Conclusions: In obese Caucasian subjects, further decrease of IS observed during puberty is a transient phenomenon. Factors that independently from T or age influence IS are central fat depot in girls, lean amount in boys, and total fat mass in both sexes. © 2009 European Society of Endocrinology.",,"adiponectin; leptin; somatomedin C; adiponectin; adiponectin, human; leptin; somatomedin C; adolescent; adult; article; body composition; body fat distribution; body mass; Caucasian; child; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; insulin sensitivity; lean body weight; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; prepuberty; priority journal; puberty; sex difference; adolescent development; blood; Caucasian; child development; comparative study; cross-sectional study; ethnology; insulin resistance; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; sexual development; Adiponectin; Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Body Composition; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Leptin; Male; Obesity; Puberty; Sex Characteristics; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549091789

In this paper, we analyse and compare the morphologies and sustainability potential of residential suburbs and their gardens in two case studies: Traditional-suburban and Modern-suburban in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Spatial distributions of land-cover patterns were estimated using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS). The four sustainability parameters measured were: roof rain water collection; local food (vegetable) production; energy and CO2 emission savings from clothes lines; and carbon benefits of onsite tree canopy cover. Outcomes suggest that land cover such as tree canopy cover and other permeable and impermeable surfaces in garden spaces can significantly impact on sustainability. Impermeable surface cover is higher in the Modern-suburban compared to the Traditional-suburban development. Traditional-suburban is more capable of supporting environmental and ecological functions through better connectivity of green spaces and availability of onsite land areas for local food production. Modern-suburban has more capacity for roof rainwater collection due to larger building roof sizes, provided there is planning for sufficient tank spaces in the design phases. These results identify specific characteristics of two suburban forms which could make positive contributions to suburban sustainability. However, changes in behaviour would be essential to utilise these capabilities of suburban environments. © 2009 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.","Carbon storage; Food production; New South Wales; Rainwater harvesting; Residential gardens; Suburban morphologies; Suburbs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78951469317

If the number of control messages can be reduced, the network lifetime can be increased because transmitting unnecessary control messages requires extra energy consumption. A local storage method with a small control overhead is proposed for an object-tracking application in wireless sensor networks. The main idea is to store the detected events in a local storage and maintain the relation of the sensed data through a low-cost implicit linked list among sensor nodes. When an object moves across the sensing field, the detecting sensor can automatically construct a linked list along the moving path of the object. The stored event records can be extracted by tracing the linked list from head to tail to obtain the complete information. When the memory space in a sensor node is full, a link reconstruction mechanism is proposed to distribute the heavy loads of sensor nodes to nearby nodes. Finally, performance analysis and simulation have been conducted to verify that the proposed method can reduce the amount of control messages and increase the network lifetime. © 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Complete information; Control messages; Control overhead; Detecting sensors; Energy consumption; Heavy loads; Memory space; Moving path; Moving targets; Network lifetime; Object Tracking; Performance analysis and simulation; Sensing fields; Storage policies; Computer simulation; Energy utilization; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956514073

It is a major source of commercial energy in the present scenario. Coal currently supplies over one third of the world's electricity and 23% of global primary energy needs. Conventional power generation system, though one of the cheapest means of production of electricity in the world, have energy efficiency only 30-35%. However, it has enormous environmental impact which includes emission of large amount of gases like CO 2, SO 2, NO x, and Hg, particulate matter which primarily includes fly ash. This is responsible for global warming and air and water pollution. To reduce this environmental impact due to emissions from thermal power plant and to meet the quality requirements of the coal consumers, it is imperative to adopt clean coal technologies. ""Clean coal"" is a term used in the promotion of the use of coal as an energy source by emphasizing methods being developed to reduce its environmental impact. This paper addresses advanced power generation systems like integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system and underground coal gasification (UCG) which claim to have energy efficiency in the range of 45-50%. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for capturing emitted CO 2 and storing it in geological formation appears to be one of the efficient means to reduce CO 2 in the atmosphere.

Molecular calculations of the optical properties of DAET interpret intriguing experimental observations and predict photochemical or photophysical properties. In particular, stabilization of HOMO in the BTFOn (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) increases the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO, which leads to the blue-shift of absorption and emission bands as the number of oxygen attached to sulfur (n) increases. Various devices and application studies have been designed as photon-mode systems based on photochemical control of the fluorescence energy.

Hereby, we constructed two recombinant E. coli ABLE C strains to over-express either γ-GCS or GS and found that γ-GCS over-expression resulted in inclusion body formation and impaired cell physiology, whereas GS over-expression yielded abundant soluble proteins and barely impeded cell growth. Upon exposure of the recombinant cells to cadmium chloride and sodium sulfide, GS over-expression augmented GSH synthesis and ameliorated CdS nanoparticles formation. The resultant CdS nanoparticles resembled those from the wild-type cells in size (2-5 nm) and wurtzite structures, yet differed in dispersibility and elemental composition. The maximum particle yield attained in the recombinant E. coli was ≈2.5 times that attained in the wild-type cells and considerably exceeded that achieved in yeasts. These data implicated the potential of genetic engineering approach to enhancing CdS nanoparticle biosynthesis in bacteria. Additionally, E. coli-based biosynthesis offers a more energy-efficient and ecofriendly method as opposed to chemical processes requiring high temperature and toxic solvents. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

The MECC combines four data words to form a 128 bit composite ECC word, two of which are interleaved in a row to mitigate cosmic neutron-induced multi-bit errors. The use of a composite word reduces the number of check-bits by 68%, however, requires a unique write operation that updates the check-bits by writing one data word while reading the other three data words. The ground potential of the composite word is raised to a nonzero value during retention in order to limit the leakage power consumption. A critical charge-based soft error rate (SER) model is proposed to estimate the resulting increase in the SER. Both the MECC scheme and the SER model are verified by implementing a 64-kb SRAM macro in 90 nm CMOS technology. The SRAM consumes 5.34 pJ energy with a data latency of 3.3 ns, thus showing up to 82% per-bit energy saving and 8x speed improvement over previously reported multiword ECC schemes. Accelerated neutron radiation test of the SRAM confirms 85% soft error correction by the MECC and 90% accuracy of the SER model. © 2006 IEEE.","Error correction; Leakage current; Multiword; Soft error; SRAM chips","90nm CMOS; Bit energy; Critical charge; Data latencies; Design and analysis; ECC scheme; Ground potential; Leakage power consumption; Leakage reduction; Multi-bit error; Multiword; Neutron radiations; Nonzero values; Soft error; Soft error rate; Speed improvement; SRAM chips; SRAM macro; Write operations; CMOS integrated circuits; Cosmology; Energy conservation; Leakage currents; Static random access storage; Error correction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70249128051

Together, these findings indicate that PII has evolved from a central metabolic role in prokaryotes towards a more specialized role in eukaryotes.

The Gibbs energies of the different phases have been modeled, and optimized model parameters that reproduce all the experimental data simultaneously within experimental error limits have been obtained. For the liquid phases, the modified quasichemical model is applied. A sublattice model within the compound-energy formalism is used to take proper account of the structures of the binary intermediate solid solutions.

The R&amp;D efforts, at the Hydrogen Energy Center, Banaras Hindu University have been described and discussed to elucidate that hydrogen is the best option for taking care of the environmental/climate changes. All three important ingredients for hydrogen economy, i.e., production, storage and application of hydrogen have been dealt with. As regards hydrogen production, solar routes consisting of photoelectrochemical electrolysis of water have been described and discussed. Nanostructured TiO2 films used as photoanodes have been synthesized through hydrolysis of Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4. Modular designs of TiO2 photoelectrode-based PEC cells have been fabricated to get high hydrogen production rate (∼10.35 lh-1 m-2). However, hydrogen storage is a key issue in the success and realization of hydrogen technology and economy. Metal hydrides are the promising candidates due to their safety advantage with high volume efficient storage capacity for on-board applications. As regards storage, we have discussed the storage of hydrogen in intermetallics as well as lightweight complex hydride systems. For intermetallic systems, we have dealt with material tailoring of LaNi5 through Fe substitution. The La(Nil - xFex)5 (x = 0.16) has been found to yield a high storage capacity of ∼2.40 wt%. We have also discussed how CNT admixing helps to improve the hydrogen desorption rate of NaAlH4. CNT (8 mol%) admixed NaAlH4 is found to be optimum for faster desorption (∼3.3 wt% H2 within 2 h). From an applications point of view, we have focused on the use of hydrogen (stored in intermetallic La-Ni-Fe system) as fuel for Internal Combustion (IC) engine-based vehicular transport, particularly two and three-wheelers. It is shown that hydrogen used as a fuel is the most effective alternative fuel for circumventing climate change. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Climate change; Complex hydrides; Hydrogen fueled vehicles; Hydrogen production rate; Intermetallic hydrides; Modular PEC solar cells; Nanostructured TiO2","Complex hydrides; Hydrogen fueled vehicles; Hydrogen production rate; Intermetallic hydrides; Modular PEC solar cells; Nanostructured TiO2; Alternative fuels; Climate change; Desorption; Gas producers; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Intermetallics; Lanthanum; Photovoltaic cells; Sodium compounds; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Storage (materials); Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349148336

The results showed slight support for CCS development in Canada, and a belief that CCS is less risky than normal oil and gas industry operations, nuclear power, or coal-burning power plants.

This large increase in nuclear power will inevitably accelerate the accumulation of spent fuel; if the direct disposal option is pursued, spent fuel arisings in Korea are expected to exceed 100,000 tHM in 2100. It is estimated that the country will require between 10-22 disposal sites, each with an area equal to the Gyeongju low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste (LILW) disposal site, to accommodate this amount of spent fuel. However, considering Korea's geographic profile, securing this number of sites will be almost impossible, and will ultimately create a serious problem for the sustainability of nuclear energy in the country. In view of this dilemma, this paper recommends that the volume of Korean nuclear waste for disposal be significantly reduced, and offers sodium fast reactor (SFR)-based recycling as a potentially viable solution. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Jaume II 69, 25197 Lleida, Spain","In recent years, LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors have been widely used to measure environmental parameters such as the structural characteristics of trees, crops and forests. Knowledge of the structural characteristics of plants has a high scientific value due to their influence in many biophysical processes including, photosynthesis, growth, CO2-sequestration and evapotranspiration, playing a key role in the exchange of matter and energy between plants and the atmosphere, and affecting terrestrial, above-ground, carbon storage. In this work, we report the use of a 2D LIDAR scanner in agriculture to obtain three-dimensional (3D) structural characteristics of plants. LIDAR allows fast, non-destructive measurement of the 3D structure of vegetation (geometry, size, height, cross-section, etc.). LIDAR provides a 3D cloud of points, which is easily visualized with Computer Aided Design software. Three-dimensional, high density data are uniquely valuable for the qualitative and quantitative study of the geometric parameters of plants. Results are demonstrated in fruit and citrus orchards and vineyards, leading to the conclusion that the LIDAR system is able to measure the geometric characteristics of plants with sufficient precision for most agriculture applications. The developed system made it possible to obtain 3D digitalized images of crops, from which a large amount of plant information - such as height, width, volume, leaf area index and leaf area density - could be obtained. There was a great degree of concordance between the physical dimensions, shape and global appearance of the 3D digital plant structure and the real plants, revealing the coherence of the 3D tree model obtained from the developed system with respect to the real structure. For some selected trees, the correlation coefficient obtained between manually measured volumes and those obtained from the 3D LIDAR models was as high as 0.976. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

With their lower airflow resistance, large cross-sectional area ETAHEs have been found to be more energy efficient than the conventional small ones, especially when integrated in hybrid ventilation systems. However, the lack of available methods for determining the heat convection at the duct surfaces has made accurate energy simulation and proper system design overly difficult. In this study, numerical experiments using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were conducted to investigate the airflow and thermal behavior in the large ducts. A two-layer turbulence model was used to ensure accuracy in resolving the flow information in the near-wall region, which is critical for predicting accurate heat convection. The modeling method was verified by comparing its results with measurements from literature. Parametric studies were conducted to identify the influential design and operation variables for the heat convection. Thirty numerical experimental setups designed with the Latin Hypercube Sampling method were simulated to prepare a database with six design parameters as the simulation inputs and average Nusselt numbers over the duct ceiling, wall, and floor as the outputs. Based on the database an artificial neural network (ANN) model was trained to build a mathematical relation between the design variables and the Nusselt numbers. The developed ANN model showed very accurate prediction when compared with test data. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The devices are attractive for energy storage particularly in applications involving high-power requirements. Electrochemical capacitors employ two electrodes and an aqueous or a non-aqueous electrolyte, either in liquid or solid form; the latter provides the advantages of compactness, reliability, freedom from leakage of any liquid component and a large operating potential-window. One of the classes of solid electrolytes used in capacitors is polymer-based and they generally consist of dry solid-polymer electrolytes or gel-polymer electrolyte or composite-polymer electrolytes. Dry solid-polymer electrolytes suffer from poor ionic-conductivity values, between 10-8 and 10-7 S cm-1 under ambient conditions, but are safer than gel-polymer electrolytes that exhibit high conductivity of ca. 10-3 S cm-1 under ambient conditions. The aforesaid polymer-based electrolytes have the advantages of a wide potential window of ca. 4 V and hence can provide high energy-density. Gel-polymer electrolytes are generally prepared using organic solvents that are environmentally malignant. Hence, replacement of organic solvents with water in gel-polymer electrolytes is desirable which also minimizes the device cost substantially. The water containing gel-polymer electrolytes, called hydrogel-polymer electrolytes, are, however, limited by a low operating potential-window of only about 1.23 V.

First, resource depletion will increasingly limit annual availability of oil, and later natural gas and even coal. Second, the European Union is calling for a 2 °C cap on allowable temperature increases compared with the pre-industrial era, in order to avert dangerous anthropogenic climate change. Keeping within this 2 °C limit will mean cutting present world emissions of greenhouse gases to as little as 15 % of their 2000 value. Some researchers also argue that other solutions, such as nuclear energy and carbon sequestration and storage, will merely solve some problems but introduce others. This leaves RE, which can be conveniently divided into non-intermittent and intermittent sources. The first category includes hydro, biomass, and geothermal. Using an earth system science approach, we analyse each of these in turn, and demonstrate that their likely future potential is small, because of limited availability, competition for scarce inputs (especially biomass), or because their potential will be adversely affected by unavoidable climate change. The second category includes solar and wind energy, each with much higher global technical potential, and the various forms of ocean energy. However, the technical potential for both wind and solar - particularly solar thermal electricity with its need for direct insolation - are unevenly distributed among the earth's regions. For this reason, large-scale very long-distance energy transmission will be increasingly needed as RE penetration rises. Further, these intermittent sources will require conversion of electricity to some other energy carrier, possibly hydrogen, and storage. The need for international transmission of energy, for example from the North African Sahara to the countries of Western Europe, raises security issues similar to those for oil. The energy losses and capital expenditure associated with energy conversion, storage and transmission will both raise costs of delivered energy and delay their implementation. Overall, energy security, together with economic and environmental cost considerations, point to a lower energy future than most energy analysts forecast. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"alternative energy; carbon sequestration; coal; energy policy; European Union; fossil fuel; global warming; natural gas; nuclear power; policy implementation; renewable resource; resource availability; resource depletion; solar power; Africa; Eurasia; Europe; North Africa; Sahara; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69149099246

The uptake ability of the CDs to accommodate the small molecules inside the cavity is examined by the sequential addition of 10 molecules of water or ammonia using the semiempirical (PM3) method. In the case of benzene, this was done up to six molecules. PM3 calculations indicate that α-, β-, and γ-CD can accommodate three, seven, and nine water molecules, respectively. In the case of NH 3 as guest molecule, α-, β-, and γ-CDs can accommodate up to two, five, and six molecules, respectively. Semiempirical calculations indicate that two benzene molecules can be accommodated in the a-CD cavity, whereas β-, and γ-CD cavities adopt three and four benzene molecules, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for 1.0 ns on benzene and bisimidazolyl complexes of CDs in explicit solvent (TIP3P water model). The interaction energies calculated by the MM/PBSA method reveal that ligand l,6-bis(imidazol-l-lyl) hexane (B) and l,4-bis(imidazol-l-lylmethyl) benzene (C) molecules prefer to form 1:1 complexes with α-,β-, and γ-CDs. However, C preferentially forms 1:2 complexes with a-CDs.

The stability of inclusion compounds depends on the type of CD and the physicochemical properties of the involved guest. Both of these methods (semiempirical and MD simulations) reveal that β-CDs form more stable complexes compared with α- and γ-CDs with C, D, NH4+, and C6H6, whereas α-CD forms more stable complexes with A and B. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Benzene molecules; CdS; Explicit solvents; Guest molecules; Host-guest inclusion complexes; Imidazol; Inclusion complex; Inclusion compounds; Interaction energies; MD simulation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Physicochemical property; PM3 calculation; Quantum chemical calculations; Semi-empirical; Semi-empirical calculation; Sequential addition; Small molecules; Stable complexes; Theoretical study; Uptake ability; Water models; Water molecule; Benzene; Cyclodextrins; Hexane; Ligands; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Paraffins; Quantum chemistry; Data storage equipment; cyclodextrin; article; chemical structure; chemistry; molecular dynamics; quantum theory; Cyclodextrins; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Molecular Structure; Quantum Theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949211799

This suggests that the immune response in bees is subdued in favor of social immunity, yet some specific immune factors are up-regulated in response to infection. To explore the response to infection more broadly, we employ mass spectrometry-based proteomics in a quantitative analysis of honey bee larvae infected with the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. Newly-eclosed bee larvae, in the second stage of their life cycle, are susceptible to this infection, but become progressively more resistant with age. We used this host-pathogen system to probe not only the role of the immune system in responding to a highly evolved infection, but also what other mechanisms might be employed in response to infection. Results: Using quantitative proteomics, we compared the hemolymph (insect blood) of five-day old healthy and infected honey bee larvae and found a strong up-regulation of some metabolic enzymes and chaperones, while royal jelly (food) and energy storage proteins were down-regulated. We also observed increased levels of the immune factors prophenoloxidase (proPO), lysozyme and the antimicrobial peptide hymenoptaecin. Furthermore, mass spectrometry evidence suggests that healthy larvae have significant levels of catalytically inactive proPO in the hemolymph that is proteolytically activated upon infection. Phenoloxidase (PO) enzyme activity was undetectable in one or two-day-old larvae and increased dramatically thereafter, paralleling very closely the age-related ability of larvae to resist infection. Conclusion: We propose a model for the host response to infection where energy stores and metabolic enzymes are regulated in concert with direct defensive measures, such as the massive enhancement of PO activity. © 2009 Chan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"acetyl coenzyme A acyltransferase; aldehyde dehydrogenase; antibody; antimicrobial cationic peptide; apolipophorin 3; aspartate aminotransferase; carrier proteins and binding proteins; chaperone; defensin; enoyl coenzyme A hydratase; fatty acid binding protein; glycoprotein gp 93; Gram negative binding protein 1; heat shock protein 1; heat shock protein 60; heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein 8; heat shock protein 90; hexamerin 70b; hexamerin 70c; hymenoptaecin; lysozyme; major royal jelly protein 1; major royal jelly protein 2; malate dehydrogenase; monophenol monooxygenase; neuropeptide Y receptor; prophenol oxidase; retinoid binding protein; unclassified drug; insect protein; monophenol monooxygenase; article; bacterial virulence; controlled study; disease predisposition; down regulation; enzyme activity; hemolymph; honeybee; immune response; infection; innate immunity; larva; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Paenibacillus; protein degradation; protein expression; protein folding; proteomics; quantitative analysis; upregulation; animal; bacterial infection; bacterium; bee; enzymology; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; proteomics; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hexapoda; Paenibacillus larvae; Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Bees; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Insect Proteins; Larva; Mass Spectrometry; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Proteomics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549114509

However, most existing DBMSs are designed to run on hard disk drives. The unique characteristics of flash memory make the direct application of these existing DBMSs to flash memory very energy inefficient and slow. The relatively few DBMSs that are designed for flash suffer from two major short-comings. First, they do not take full advantage of the fact that updates to tuples usually only involve a small percentage of the attributes. A tuple refers to a row of a table in a database. Second, they do not cater for the asymmetry of write versus read costs of flash memory when designing the buffer replacement algorithm. In this paper, we have developed algorithms that address both of these short-comings. We overcome the first short-coming by partitioning tables into columns and then group the columns based on which columns are read or updated together. To this end, we developed an algorithm that uses a cost-based approach, which produces optimal column groupings for a given workload. We also propose a heuristic solution to the partitioning problem. The second short-coming is overcome by the design of the buffer replacement algorithm that automatically determines which page to evict from buffer based on a cost model that minimizes the expected read and write energy usage. Experiments using the TPC-C benchmark [S.T. Leutenegger, D. Dias, A modeling study of the TPC-C benchmark, in: Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD, 1993, pp. 22-31] show that our approach produces up to 40-fold in energy usage savings compared to the state-of-the-art in-page logging approach. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Buffer replacement; Caching; Database; Database optimization; Flash memory; Vertical partitioning","Buffer replacement; Caching; Database; Database optimization; Vertical partitioning; Algorithms; Database systems; Hard disk storage; Management; Management information systems; Mobile devices; Optimization; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649814649

Because comparison of species life-history strategies states that a long life span (i.e. high annual survival) generally goes with lower fecundity, we hypothesise that reproductive output would be lower in M. arenaria than in C. edule. In the present paper, we studied the reproductive strategies of these two species in an intertidal and a subtidal area of the western Dutch Wadden Sea, by following seasonal changes in absolute and relative weights of somatic and gonadal tissues in these bivalves. Starting of spawning was similar in the two species, around May, except for intertidal M. arenaria, which initiated spawning in August. Individual energy investment in reproduction was similar for the two species but, unlike M. arenaria, C. edule spawned completely, releasing all energy of gonadal mass in the form of gametes. Mya arenaria used the gonad not only for reproduction but also for storage. In the intertidal area, we found a trade-off between longevity and reproduction, i.e. maximum reproductive output (expressed as a proportion of body mass) was higher in C. edule than in M. arenaria. However, since body size is larger and life span longer in M. arenaria than in C. edule, mean lifetime reproductive output per individual must be higher in the first than in the latter. Based on the differences in reproductive strategies of these two species, we hypothesise that the negative effects of warming climate on bivalve population dynamics in the Wadden Sea will be stronger in C. edule than in M. arenaria. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Many jurisdictions around the world have set high wind penetration targets in their energy generation mix. Wind speed is variable in nature, and power output from a wind farm is not readily controllable. High wind penetration can lead to high-risk levels in power system reliability and stability. In order to maintain the system stability, wind energy dispatch is usually restricted and energy storage is considered to smooth out the fluctuations and improve supply continuity. The benefits from using energy storage are highly dependent on the operating strategies associated with wind and storage in the power system.

In semiconductor QDs, the electron spins can be coherently oriented by photoexcitation using circularly polarized light, creating optical orientation. The optically induced spin orientation could serve as a unit for data storage and processing. Carrier spin orientation is also envisioned to be a key component in a related, though parallel, field of semiconductor spintronics. However, the oriented spin population rapidly loses its coherence by interaction with the environment, thereby erasing the prepared information. Since long-lasting spin orientation is desirable in both areas of investigation, spin relaxation is the central focus of investigation for optimization of device performance. In this Account, we discuss a topic peripherally related to these emerging areas of investigation: exciton fine structure relaxation (EFSR). The radiationless transition occurring in the exciton fine structure not only highlights a novel aspect of QD exciton relaxation but also has implications for carrier spin relaxation in QDs. We focus on examining the EFSR in connection with optical spin orientation and subsequent ultrafast relaxation of electron and hole spin densities in the framework of the exciton fine structure basis. Despite its significance, the study of exciton fine structure in colloidal QDs has been hampered by the experimental challenge arising from inhomogeneous line broadening that obscures the details of closely spaced fine structure states in the frequency domain. In this Account, we show that spin relaxation occurring in the fine structure of CdSe QDs can be probed by a timedomain nonlinear polarization spectroscopy, circumventing the obstacles confronted in the frequency-domain spectroscopy. In particular, by combining polarization sequences of multiple optical pulses with the unique optical selection rules of semiconductors, fast energy relaxation among the QD exciton fine structure states is selectively measured. The measured exciton fine structure relaxation, which is a nanoscale analogue of molecular radiationless transitions, contains direct information on the relaxation of spin densities of electron and hole carriers, that is, spin relaxation in QDs. From the exciton fine structure relaxation rates measured for CdSe nanorods and complex-shaped nanocrystals using nonlinear polarization spectroscopy, we elucidated the implications of QD size and shape on the QD exciton properties as well, for example, size- and shape-scaling laws governing exciton spin flips and how an exciton is delocalized in a QD. We envision that the experimental development and the discoveries of QD exciton properties presented in this Account will inspire further studies toward revealing the characteristics of QD excitons and spin relaxation therein, for example, spin relaxation in QDs made of various materials with different electronic structures, spin relaxation under an external perturbation of QD electronic states using magnetic fields, and spin relaxation of separated electrons and holes in type-ll QD heterostructures. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949186624

The amount of hydrogen desorption/absorption of MgH2 catalyzed with TiC was slightly decreased, but MgH2 with 1 mol% TiC showed considerable catalytic effects on both the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation kinetics of MgH2. MgH2 with 50 nm TiC had the best absorption/desorption kinetics of MgH2 and the highest cyclic performance, desorbing about 6.2 wt.% H2 within about 20 min and absorbing more than 90% of hydrogen capacity within 5 min at 300 °C. The size of TiC was the important factor in inducing the catalytic effect, but the change of TiC composition was not as important as the particle size.

The number of enzyme deficiencies known is endless. The most frequent glycolysis abnormality is pyruvate kinase deficiency, since around 500 cases are known, the first of which was reported in 1961. However, only approximately 200 cases were due to mutations. In contrast, only one case of phosphoglycerate mutase BB type mutation, described in 2003, has been detected. Most mutations are located in the coding sequences of genes, while others, missense, deletions, insertions, splice defects, premature stop codons and promoter mutations, are also frequent.

Two sets of CdS thin film samples, differing in their microstructures, prepared using thermal evaporation and spray pyrolysis, are irradiated with 100 MeV Ag ions using Pelletron accelerator. It is observed that the effects produced differ significantly in the two films. For the evaporated films, defect annealing dominates for lower irradiation fluences but at higher fluences the effects due to defect creation and their migration are dominant. A transformation from the metastable cubic to hexagonal phase together with the creation of a significant amount of compressive strain is seen in these films for irradiation at the highest fluence. The optical absorption of the samples shows an increase in band gap from 2.34 eV for the as grown film to 2.43 eV for the sample irradiated at the highest fluence that is further confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) studies. In contrast, the spray deposited samples undergo a significant improvement of crystalline quality for all fluences as shown by an increase in x-ray diffraction peak intensity, sharper optical absorption edge, reduction in defect PL intensity, and removal of asymmetry in the line shape of the longitudinal optical phonon on its lower wavenumber side in Raman spectra. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",,"As-grown films; CdS; CdS thin films; Comparative studies; Compressive strain; Crystalline quality; Defect annealing; Defect creation; Energy relaxation process; Evaporated films; Fluences; Hexagonal phase; In-band; Line shape; Longitudinal optical phonons; Optical absorption; Optical absorption edge; Pelletron; PL intensity; Polycrystalline thin film; Raman spectra; Spray-deposited; Structural change; Swift heavy ions; Thin film microstructures; Wave numbers; X- Ray diffraction; Absorption; Cadmium compounds; Data storage equipment; Defects; Heavy ions; Irradiation; Light absorption; Light transmission; Microstructure; Raman spectroscopy; Spray pyrolysis; Thermal evaporation; Thin film devices; Thin films; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68249155009

The volume of data generated in surveys necessitates automated call detection, either in real time via a triggering function or offline, yet researchers are hesitant to replace traditional hand analysis without a thorough understanding of the accuracy and costs of automated detection. We compared detection accuracy and computational cost of the underlying algorithms used in commercial detectors (a zero-crossing detector, a spectral peak detector, and a high-band energy detector) with a model-based analysis method called the links detector. We predicted that the links detector would be more accurate than the other detectors, producing a larger effective detection range, because the links detector uses more information to make detection decisions. We also predicted that the links detector would be the most computationally expensive algorithm because of the processing needed for the extra information. We quantified the performance of the detectors using a synthetic recording environment, which provided an absolute ground truth for the experiments and allowed us to measure the effective detection range of each algorithm. The zero-crossing and high-band energy detectors, the fastest, were about 40 times faster than the links detector. Most of the computational cost was attributed to the filter used to remove low-frequency noise. The links detector, the most accurate, increased effective detection range by 6-12 m compared to the other detectors depending on species. The results will allow bat researchers to better understand the costs and benefits of automated detection methods. © Museum and Institute of Zoology pas.","Automated detection; Chiroptera; Links detector; Synthetic recording environment","acoustic survey; advanced technology; algorithm; bat; detection method; environmental modeling; frequency analysis; hardware; information processing; real time; Chiroptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149165531

The study finds the lowest radiative forcing categories to be feasible under full participation, certainly if overshoot of targets is allowed and when bio-energy and carbon-capture-and-storage is added to the mitigation portfolio. In cases with severe delay in participation, the lowest targets become infeasible.

Among noteworthy algorithms is the embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) algorithm, which has been adopted by the JPEG2000 standard. EBCOT is a two-tier algorithm. Tier-1 is composed of bit-plane coding followed by entropy coding. Tier-2 performs the so-called post compression rate distortion optimization (PCRD), which requires a large memory space for storing all the code streams of code blocks; however, some code blocks of less importance might not be needed for the optimal decoded image at a bit rate. To avoid waste of computational power and memory space, a simple context based rate distortion estimation (CBRDE) is thus proposed to arrange the scanning order of code blocks in an adaptive manner. The CBRDE algorithm is based on the MQ table of JPEG2000, which is available at both encoder and decoder.

The system is modeled using a novel approach underpinned by surface potential energies developed from Lennard-Jones parameters. Impregnation of MOF pores with magnesium-decorated Mg 10C60 fullerenes, denoted as Mg-C60@MOF, places exposed metal sites with high heats of gas adsorption into intimate contact with large surface area MOF structures. Perhaps surprisingly, given the void space occupied by C60, this impregnation delivers remarkable gas uptake, according to our modeling, which predicts exceptional performance for the Mg-C60@MOF family of materials. These predictions include a volumetric methane uptake of 265 v/v, the highest reported value for any material, which significantly exceeds the U.S. Department of Energy target of 180 v/v.

The objective of this study was to assess formation of lipid droplets in cells treated with CdTe nanoparticles and relate their status to cell function (mitochondrial activity and cell viability). Multicolor labeling of cellular organelles (lipid droplets and lysosomes) showed that lipid droplets formed in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells following nanoparticle or oleic acid treatment. Some lipid droplets were found closely apposed to lysosomes suggesting possible communication between these organelles during severe oxidative stress. Combination of microscopy of living cells with cell viability assays showed that oleic acid-induced lipid droplets not only serve as intracellular lipid storage sites but also play a protective role in starving stressed cells.

Cylindrical and slab capsules are compared with spherical capsules when subjected to a flowing heat transfer fluid (HTF). The effect of inlet HTF temperature and flow rate as well as the reference temperatures are investigated, and the resulting solidification and melting times, energy efficiencies, and exergy efficiencies are documented. Using ANSYS GAMBIT and FLUENT 6.0 softwares, all geometries are created, and the appropriate boundary and initial conditions are selected for the finite volume solver to proceed. Sufficient flow parameters are monitored during transient solutions to enable the calculation of all energy and exergy efficiencies. The energetically most efficient geometric scenario is obtained for the slab geometry, while the spherical geometry exergetically achieves the highest efficiencies. The difference between the two results is mainly through the accounting of entropy generation and exergy destroyed, and the largest mode of thermal exergy loss is found to be through entropy generation resulting from heat transfer accompanying phase change, although viscous dissipation is included in the analysis. All efficiency values tend to increase with decreasing HTF flow rate, but exergetically the best scenario appears to be for the spherical capsules with low inlet HTF temperature. Energy efficiency values are all well over 99%, while the exergy efficiency values range from around 72% to 84%, respectively. The results indicate that energy analyses, while able to predict viscous dissipation losses effectively, cannot correctly quantify losses inherent in cold TES systems, and in some instances predict higher than normal efficiencies and inaccurate optimal parameters when compared with exergy analyses.

The capsules considered are filled with de-ionized water, so that a network of spheres can be thought of as being the storage medium for an encapsulated ice storage module. ANSYS GAMBIT and FLUENT 6.0 packages are used to employ the present model for heat transfer fluid (HTF) past a row of such capsules, while varying the HTF inlet temperature and flow rate, as well as the reference temperatures. The present model agrees well with experimental data taken from literature and was also put through rigorous time and grid independence tests. Sufficient flow parameters are studied so that the resulting solidification and melting times, exergy and energy efficiencies, and exergy destruction could be calculated. All energy efficiencies are found to be over 99%, though viscous dissipation was included. Using exergy analysis, the exergetic efficiencies are determined to be about 75% to over 92%, depending on the HTF scenario. When the HTF flow rate is increased, all efficiencies decrease, due mainly to increasing heat losses and exergy dissipation. The HTF temperatures, which stray farther from the solidification temperature of water, are found to be most optimal exergetically, but least optimal energetically. The main reason for this, as well as the main mode of loss exergetically, is due to entropy generation accompanying heat transfer, which is responsible for over 99.5% of exergy destroyed in all cases. The results indicate that viewing the heat transfer and fluidflow phenomena in a bed of encapsulated spheres, it is of utmost importance to assess the major modes of entropy generation; in this case from heat transfer accompanying phase change. © 2009 by ASME.","Charging; Discharging; Efficiency; Energy; Exergy; Heat transfer; Latent heat storage; PCM; Sphere; Temperature","Charging; Discharging; Entropy generation; Exergetic efficiency; Exergy Analysis; Exergy and energy; Exergy destructions; Experimental data; Flow parameters; Fluent 6.0; Heat transfer fluids; Ice storage; Independence tests; Inlet temperature; Main mode; Melting process; Phase Change; Reference temperature; Solidification and melting; Solidification temperature; Sphere temperature; Spherical geometries; Storage medium; Thermo dynamic analysis; Viscous dissipation; Crystallization; Energy efficiency; Entropy; Exergy; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Inlet flow; Latent heat; Metal melting; Optimization; Solidification; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Spheres",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955210556

In forward direction of former measurement, three distinct voltage regions designated different transport mechanisms: recombination, tunneling and space charge limited current. In the reverse direction, current seemed to be roughly proportional to the square root of bias at low region. Activation energy (EA) as 0.56 eV together with the ideality factor around 1.5 confirmed that generation-recombination current was the actual current transport mechanism. Increase in applied bias resulted in the appearance of other mechanisms: tunneling and space charge limited current, deduced by temperature-independent current flow and power of bias (greater than 2) in both forward and reverse directions, respectively.

White adipose tissue (WAT) depots behave differently under starvation, postprandial state and pharmacologically induced lipolysis. Aim of the study: To understand the mechanism of massive lipid loss from WAT elicited by OE treatment. Methods: We used overweight male rats. Rats receiving OE (10 nmol/g) gavages were compared with controls and a pair-fed group. Whole fat pads from the mesenteric, retroperitoneal, epididymal and inguinal subcutaneous sites were excised and analyzed for lipid, DNA, mRNA and the expression of lipogenic, fatty acid transporters and lipase genes. Results: In OE and pair-fed rats, WAT weights decreased, with the limited loss of cells. Patterns of gene expression in most WAT sites were similar for OE and PF, suggesting a shared mechanism of fat mobilization, but in mesenteric WAT, PF increased lipogenic and fatty acid transporter gene expressions. However, OE inhibited lipogenic expressions more deeply than PF. Conclusions: White adipose tissue sites showed different expression patterns, hinting at relatively specialized functions in fat storage; thus, single site analyses cannot be extrapolated to whole WAT. Differences between mesenteric and the other sites suggest that 'visceral fat' should be reserved for this site only, and not applied to other abdominal fat depots (epididymal, retroperitoneal). © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Lipogenesis; Obesity; Oleoyl-estrone; Visceral fat; White adipose tissue","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; antiobesity agent; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; CD36 antigen; DNA; estrone oleate; fatty acid binding protein 4; fatty acid synthase; fatty acid transporter; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase; hormone sensitive lipase; lipid; lipoprotein lipase; messenger RNA; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; antiobesity agent; drug derivative; estrone; estrone oleate; oleic acid; oleoyl-estrone; abdominal subcutaneous fat; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; cell count; cell loss; cell volume; controlled study; DNA content; DNA determination; drug effect; epididymis; food intake; gene expression; inguinal region; intraabdominal fat; lipid analysis; lipid storage; lipid transport; lipoatrophy; lipogenesis; lipolysis; male; mesentery; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; rat; retroperitoneum; RNA analysis; white adipose tissue; adipose tissue; animal; body composition; caloric intake; cytology; lipid metabolism; metabolism; randomization; Wistar rat; Rattus; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Composition; Energy Intake; Estrone; Gene Expression; Lipid Metabolism; Lipid Mobilization; Male; Oleic Acids; Overweight; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349581479

It can be produced by anaerobic digestion of agricultural organic waste or manure in rural areas, where it can be used to generate electric, thermal or mechanical energy. It can also be generated in landfills from the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and used as an alternative energy source in urban areas. Industrialized and urbanized areas are afflicted by serious environmental problems associated with the generation of organic residues. Anaerobic microorganisms can degrade pollutants resulting in two kinds of products, i.e., digested sludge and biogas, which can be exploited as a soil fertilizer and a renewable energy source, respectively. The correct management of residual waste involves high costs, and inadequate treatment and storage can compromise its quality. Environmental agencies have been encouraging the dissemination of anaerobic digesters to produce biogas from organic residues and the use of the resulting sludge as fertilizer since it is able to destroy pathogenic agents and reduce the humidity level.

The drying process was carried out at temperatures of 50, 55 and 60C, air velocity of 2.4 m/s and relative humidity between 10-25%. Drying time decreased considerably with increased air temperature. Drying process took place in the falling rate period. Twelve mathematical models available in the literature were fitted to the experimental data. The models were compared by four statistical parameters; i.e., determination of coefficient, mean relative percent error, reduced chi-square and root mean square error, and the best-fit model was selected. The modified Henderson and Pabis and Verma et al. models were given the best results in describing thin-layer drying of kiwifruits. The effective diffusivity of water during air-drying varied from 1.743 to 2.241 × 10-10 m2/s over the temperature range investigated, with activation energy equal to 22.48 kJ/mol. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Drying can be described as an industrial preservation method in which water content and activity of agricultural products are decreased by heated air to minimize biochemical, chemical and microbiological deterioration. Kiwifruit has a very short life because of softening and vitamin loss during cold storage. The use of drying prolongs the shelf-life of the kiwifruit, as the water content reduction slows down deterioration reactions. In this study, drying characteristics of kiwifruits were studied in a convectional hot-air dryer. The objectives of the present study were to determine experimentally the thin-layer drying characteristics and rehydration capacity of samples, and to fit the experimental data to 12 mathematical models available from the literature. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Actinidia deliciosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69149106175

The crystal structure, maximum hydrogen absorption capacity, kinetics and hydrogen desorption properties have been studied in detail. While TiCrV crystallizes in body centered cubic (BCC) structure, ZrCrV is a C15 cubic Laves phase compound and the intermediate compositions with 5 and 10 at% Zr substitutions for Ti (x = 0.05 and 0.1) show the presence of a small amount of ZrCr2 Laves phase along with the main BCC phase. The pressure-composition isotherms have been studied at room temperature. TiCrV shows separation of TiH2 phase on cycling. A small amount of Zr substitution for Ti is found to have advantageous effects on the hydrogen absorption properties of TiCrV as it suppresses TiH2 phase separation and decreases hysteresis. It is found that the hydrogen absorption capacity of Ti1-xZrxCrV decreases as the Zr content increases due to the increased fraction of Laves phase. Temperature-programmed desorption studies have been carried out on the saturated hydrides in order to find the relative desorption temperatures. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen storage; Pressure-composition isotherm; Thermal desorption; XRD; Zr-Ti-Cr-V alloys","BCC phase; Body-centered cubic (bcc) structure; Desorption temperatures; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen absorption properties; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen storage properties; Laves-phase; Laves-phase compound; Pressure composition isotherms; Pressure-composition isotherm; Room temperature; Saturated hydrides; Ti-Cr-V alloy; XRD; Zr substitution; Zr-Ti-Cr-V alloys; Absorption; Atmospheric temperature; Chemical analysis; Chromium; Crystal structure; Fiber optic sensors; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage alloys; Intermetallics; Isotherms; Phase separation; Surface chemistry; Temperature programmed desorption; Thermal desorption; Titanium alloys; X ray diffraction; X ray diffraction analysis; Zirconium; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949194538

It is found that at the preliminary stages of energy planning, heating value and moisture content of the feedstock are the most important factors. In addition, the effects of harvesting, transportation and storage are found to be significant even though they are often overlooked. Using the gathered information a biomass module for energy planning is created and integrated to H2RES, a renewable energy planning program. Using this excel based software, a case study for a wood processing factory is performed, using the waste wood as feedstock.

X-ray diffraction analysis shows the presence of an extended N⋯I-I⋯N assembly in which each I2 molecule links a Q2S2 molecule at both ends through a nitrogen atom to form a polymeric species; the d(I-I) and d(N-I) bond lengths confirm a very weak nitrogen-iodine interaction at the base of the N⋯I-I⋯N assembly. DFT calculations provide optimised distances for the N⋯I and I-I bonds and explanation for the zigzag chain formation: the mPW1PW functional and the B3LYP hybrid functional with a variety of basis sets for the I atomic species [CRENBL, LANL2DZ, LANL2DZ(d,p), LANL08(d), SBKJC, SBKJC polarised-LFK and Stuttgart RLC] have been tested. Compound 1 proved stable up to nearly 100°C, and the stability is to be mainly attributed to the lattice energy of its polymeric structure then to donor-acceptor stabilisation.

The pearl millet grains were reconstituted by adding water to raise the moisture level to 30%, followed by storage in sealed plastic buckets with or without feed enzymes (0.5 g/kg) for 21 days at room temperature (25°C). Subsequently, the grains were sun-dried to reduce the moisture content up to 10% to avoid mould growth. Nine dietary treatments were formulated incorporating pearl millet either raw with or without enzymes or reconstituted with or without enzymes in maize-soya based control diet replacing maize at 50 and 75% levels. The birds fed on diets containing enzyme reconstituted pearl millet accrued higher body weight than maize based control diet. Addition of enzymes to raw pearl-millet based diet improved the body weight gain significantly. The reconstitution of pearl millet with or without enzymes increased (P < 0.01) the dietary nitrogen corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) values and the highest improvement (6.11%) was recorded in diets containing pearl millet reconstituted with enzymes at 75% level of maize replacement.

Herein, we utilized whole body knockout mice to address the importance of ATGL and HSL for metabolic function and exercise performance. ATGL deletion severely disrupts whole-body substrate partitioning at rest; reducing plasma free fatty acid (FFA) availability (WT: 0.49 ± 0.06 vs. ATGL-/- 0.34 ± 0.03 mM), which in turn enhances carbohydrate oxidation during fasting (mean RER, WT: 0.86 ± 0.02, ATGL-/- 0.90 ± 0.01) and is associated with depleted muscle and liver glycogen stores. While plasma FFA was modestly reduced (23%) and whole body carbohydrate metabolism increased in HSL-/- mice, resting glycogen storage was not compromised. Studies in isolated muscles revealed that the capacity of ATGL and HSL-/- muscle to transport exogenous fatty acids is not compromised and the capacity to oxidize fatty acids is actually increased (3.7- and 1.3-fold above WT for ATGL and HSL). The exercise-induced increase in plasma FFA and glycerol was blunted with ATGL or HSL deletion, demonstrating an impaired capacity for exercise-induced lipolysis in these mice. Carbohydrate oxidation was increased concomitantly during exercise in ATGL-/- and HSL-/- mice, resulting in more muscle and liver glycogen depletion. Maximal running velocity and endurance capacity were reduced by 42% and 46% in ATGL-/- mice, but not in HSL-/- mice. The reduction in performance in ATGL -/- mice was not due to defective muscle contractile performance. These results demonstrate an essential role for both ATGL and HSL in maintaining adequate FFA supply to sustain normal substrate metabolism at rest and during exercise.

Body condition and, more specifically, energy stores thus constitute key variables in the life history of many species. Several indices exist to quantify body condition but none can provide the amount of stored energy. To estimate energy stores in mammals, we propose a body composition model that differentiates between structure and storage of an animal. We develop and parameterize the model specifically for polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps) but all concepts are general and the model could be easily adapted to other mammals. The model provides predictive equations to estimate structural mass, storage mass and storage energy from an appropriately chosen measure of body length and total body mass. The model also provides a means to estimate basal metabolic rates from body length and consecutive measurements of total body mass. Model estimates of body composition, structural mass, storage mass and energy density of 970 polar bears from Hudson Bay were consistent with the life history and physiology of polar bears. Metabolic rate estimates of fasting adult males derived from the body composition model corresponded closely to theoretically expected and experimentally measured metabolic rates. Our method is simple, non- invasive and provides considerably more information on the energetic status of individuals than currently available methods.","Bioelectrical impedance analysis; Body condition index; Body fat; Dynamic energy budgets; Energy reserve; Isotopic water dilution; Lean body mass; Nutritional status; Storage; Structure; Ursus maritimus","animal; article; basal metabolic rate; bear; biological model; body composition; body size; energy metabolism; histology; metabolism; validation study; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Body Composition; Body Size; Energy Metabolism; Models, Biological; Ursidae; Animalia; Mammalia; Ursus maritimus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651008672

Spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity causes fluctuations in small scale advection, whose effect can be represented by a dispersion term. However, the use of this term is still subject to controversy among modelers. The effect of heterogeneity on the heat plume generated by a groundwater heat exchanger (GHE) in a three-dimensional aquifer under steady state conditions is examined. Transverse dispersion is estimated using a stochastic approach in which a distinction between effective and ensemble dispersion coefficients is made. The former quantifies the typical width of the heat plume and the latter takes into account the uncertainty of the lateral plume position. Simulations show that transverse dispersion is proportional to the variance and correlation length of the log-conductivity field. On the one hand, the ensemble transverse dispersion coefficient, which can be used for risk analysis to find the mean temperature and the potential plume spread, is high near the heat source and then decreases. On the other hand, the effective transverse dispersion coefficient, the one required to simulate actual temperature values and plume width, displays a less marked dependence on the distance from the source. For modeling purposes it can be approximated as αT ≈ 0.02 σln K2 Lx, where σln K2 is the variance of the log-conductivity field and Lx its correlation length in the mean flow direction. However, a zero dispersion should be used to compute the energy dissipated by the GHE. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

All materials were characterized by XRD, nitrogen adsorption, and XPS where appropriate. The surface area of HMS silica was optimized by varying silica-to-surfactant molar ratio, and also by tuning the pore size by varying the surfactant's carbon chain length (C6, C8, C10, C12). Then Ti fragments originating from either benzyl, allyl, or methyl Ti precursors were grafted onto the optimal HMS surface at different loading levels to arrive at Ti grafted HMS materials with H2 storage capacities and binding properties superior to those previously reported by our group for benzyl Ti (III) species on silica. HMS prepared with dodecylamine using a silica:surfactant ratio of 3:1 and subsequently grafted with 0.2 M equiv. of TiBz4 had the highest H2 adsorption at 2.45 wt% at 77 k and 60 atm, which equates to an average of 3.98 H2 molecule per Ti metal center, just one H2 molecule short of the theoretical saturation limit of 5 H2/Ti predicted by the 18-electron rule. The H2 adsorption capacities of Me3Ti-HMS and Allyl3Ti-HMS prepared using the same optimized sample of C12-HMS silica at a 3:1 Si:surfactant ratio possessed H2 adsorption values corresponding to 2.4 and 2.27 H2 per Ti center, respectively, at 60 atm and 77 K. This performance level is significantly lower than that of the benzyl Ti (III) system. The binding enthalpies of the benzyl Ti (III) material increase with H2 coverage to 23 kJ/mol, while the enthalpies for the newly synthesized Me3Ti-HMS and Allyl3Ti-HMS materials increase with H2 coverage to a maximum of 2.66 and 4.17 kJ/mol, respectively. XPS studies on these materials suggested a trend in π-back donating ability on the Ti (III) centers of methyl &gt; allyl &gt; benzyl, opposite that observed experimentally. The reason for the diminished performance of the allyl and methyl Ti (III) systems may thus be related to the presence of THF ligands blocking coordination sites in the allyl and methyl systems. THF is not present in the benzyl system because this solvent is not required for synthesis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It was a further aim to correlate the measured values with previously reported data on degree of conversion and glass transition temperature for the same polymer and curing protocols. Methods: Different light-curing protocols were used in order to investigate the influence of energy density, power density, and mode of cure on the properties of a model polymer. The modes of cure were continuous, pulse-delay, and stepped irradiation of the specimens. Wallace hardness was used to determine the softening of the polymer after storage in ethanol for 24 h. Elution of monomers from the polymer was assessed after 7 days in ethanol by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data were submitted to two- and three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Newman-Keuls' multiple comparison test, and linear regression analysis. Results: Energy density, power density, and mode of cure of the polymer influenced the softening and elution of monomers in ethanol. As energy density increased, softening and elution in ethanol decreased. At same energy density, the influence of power density varied with the mode of cure. When compared to the continuous mode of cure, and at same energy density, pulse-delay irradiation resulted in polymers that in general were more susceptible to softening, but eluted monomers to a lower extent. Less elution was also found with step-cured polymers. Significant, negative correlations were detected between softening and elution in ethanol, respectively, and degree of conversion and between softening and elution in ethanol, respectively, and glass transition temperature. Significance: A complex relationship exists between curing protocol and the properties selected for investigation. The effect of different combinations of exposure periods and power densities are important to understanding how the curing protocol affects the properties of polymer-based materials. © 2009 Academy of Dental Materials.","Degree of conversion; Dental materials; Dental polymers; Glass transition temperature; Hardness; High-pressure liquid chromatography; Photocuring; Resin composite","Degree of conversion; Dental polymers; Glass transition temperature; Photocuring; Resin composite; Chromatographic analysis; Chromatography; Curing; Dental composites; Dental prostheses; Ethanol; Glass; Glass transition; Hardness; High performance liquid chromatography; High pressure liquid chromatography; Irradiation; Liquids; Monomers; Polymers; Regression analysis; Resins; Superconducting transition temperature; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); alcohol; resin; solvent; article; chemical structure; chemistry; dental bonding; drug storage; energy transfer; hardness; methodology; phase transition; radiation exposure; transition temperature; Composite Resins; Dental Bonding, Light-Cured; Drug Storage; Energy Transfer; Ethanol; Hardness; Molecular Structure; Phase Transition; Solvents; Transition Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649366090

These systems do not migrate spontaneously to a thermodynamically stable condition because an energy barrier separates the metastable and stable states. However, any heat input they receive, for example through isothermal treatment or through prolonged exposure to a voltaic arc in the welding process, cause them to reach a condition of stable equilibrium which, for super duplex stainless steels, means precipitation of intermetallic and carbide phases. These phases include the sigma phase, which is easily identified from its morphology, and its influence on the material's impact strength. The purpose of this work was to ascertain how 2-hour isothermal heat treatments at 920 °C and 980 °C affect the microstructure of ASTM A890/A890M GR 6A super duplex stainless steel.

The activation was performed at a temperature of 850 °C by using different metal hydroxides as the activating agents. Pore structures of the CNFs were analyzed using N2/77 K adsorption isotherms. The presence of oxygen groups was analyzed by means of acid-base titration. The structural order (crystallinity) of the materials was studied by XRD and TGA analysis and the morphology and diameter distributions by means of TEM. The use of hydroxide of alkaline metals of low melting and boiling points (K, Rb, and Cs) led to the best results of porosity development. On the contrary, the pore opening was lower if the alkaline metal had a high boiling point (Na) or when alkali earth cations were used as activating agents. After the activation, the porous CNFs showed a decrease in diameter and scratches on their surfaces, as a consequence of the surface oxidation and opening of the graphitic layers, respectively.

In order to generalize the problem, this work exploits the ""energy hub"" formulation previously presented in the literature, defining an energy hub as an interface among energy producers, consumers and the transportation infrastructure. The resulting optimization minimizes an objective function which is based on costs and efficiencies of the system elements, while taking into account the hub model, energy and power constraints and estimated operational conditions, such as energy prices, input power flow availability and output energy demand. The resulting optimal architecture also constitutes a framework for further real-time control designs. Moreover, an example of a hybrid storage system is considered. In particular, the architecture of a hybrid plant incorporating a wind generator, batteries and intermediate hydrogen storage is optimized, based on real wind data and averaged residential demands, also taking into account possible estimation errors. The hydrogen system integrates an electrolyzer, a fuel cell stack and hydrogen tanks. The resulting optimal cost of such hybrid power plant is compared with the equivalent hydrogen-only and battery-only systems, showing improvements in investment costs of almost 30% in the worst case. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The compound examined in this work was selected as reference material for light metal hydrides, because of its high hydrogen content (10.5 wt.%) and interesting desorption kinetic properties at moderate temperatures. Thermal dynamic and kinetic of hydrogen release from this hydride were investigated using a fixed bed reactor to evaluate the effect of heating procedure, carrier gas flow rate and sample form. The aim of this study was to characterize the lithium alanate decomposition through the reaction steps leading to the formation of Li3AlH6 and LiH. A hydrogen tank was designed and realized to contain pellets of lithium alanate as feeding for a fuel cell propulsion system based on a 2-kW Polymeric Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) stack. The fuel cell system was integrated into the power train comprising DC-DC converter, energy storage systems and electric drive for moped applications (3 kW). The experiments on the power train were conducted on a test bench able to simulate the vehicle behaviour and road characteristics on specific driving cycles.

Alike, understanding root size and distribution may provide new insights into the knowledge of mechanisms involved in soil water uptake. The present research was performed in North Italy, Po Valley (32 m a.s.l., 44°33′N, 11°21′E). The assessment of root distribution and biomass of Panicum virgatum (switchgrass = S), Miscanthus x giganteus (miscanthus = M), Arundo donax (giant reed = G) and Sorghum bicolor (fibre sorghum = FS), in a soil profile of 1.2 m depth, aimed at providing new insights into carbon storage and water capture capacity. Despite a similar above ground biomass production, perennial crops exhibited different total root biomass, root shape and water uptake. G accumulated considerably higher total root biomass (13.6 Mg ha-1, d.w. basis), while FS, being annual, produced clearly the lowest root biomass (2.1 Mg ha-1). Root biomass distribution was described using the β model, through the relationships between root length density (RLD) and soil depth. In summary, M had a very superficial root shape (β = 0.931) with almost 90% of total root biomass concentrated in the top 0.35 m soil, while G and S exhibited a relative even root distribution (β = 0.979 and 0.984, respectively). RLD and root weight showed diverse patterns among crops and along the soil profile due to different root diameters and root bulk densities of the crops. Root water capture capacity (φ{symbol}) was determined according to the King model through the relationship between soil moisture and RLD in vertically succeeding soil layers. Differences in φ{symbol} among crops were expressed through the constant k, which resumes many physiological and environmental details driving water uptake. Briefly, high k means a faster water uptake for a given RLD. M showed the highest k (2.50) followed by FS (1.02), G (0.54) and S (0.31). Importantly, k and β were closely and negatively related which would mean that top-rooted crops, though being more subjected to drought risks, have significant higher abilities in recovering soil water. This is an assertion which is consistent with the previous studies that showed M being highly productive under wet environment, but very sensitive to water shortage. This study shows that energy crops can greatly differ in terms of water capture and root distribution, a fact that should be taken into great account in optimizing the land use change. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, these losses can be used as a new source of energy for water heating and storage in domestic hot water storage tanks (DHWST). For this reason, the construction of an experimental apparatus with a cylindrical thermal storage tank is proposed, in which the objective of the study will be a survey of the coefficient of performance concerning conventional and modified refrigerators, as well as to perform an analysis of hot water, through the thermal stratification technique using a refrigerator with a modified condenser. The collected thermal loss, as per the thermosyphon principle, will be stored as thermal energy. The results showed the full operation of the modified refrigeration system, which did not reveal significant alterations in thermodynamic behavior after the modifications made on the condenser. The dynamic behavior of the thermal distribution was observed through the thermal stratification effect and temperature evolution in terms of time, showing greater variability of the modified refrigerator generating more thermal comfort to users in addition to providing domestic hot water.

With the purpose of integrating kinetic studies on the MgH2-Mg phase transformation with the analysis of the local microstructure, we have developed an experimental method for the metallographic examination by Scanning Electron Microscopy of partially desorbed MgH2 powders. The setting of the microscope and the sample preparation procedure have been optimized for highest contrast between Mg and MgH2, based on different electron emissions. In these experimental conditions the two phases can be clearly detected even in critical condition when strongly scattering catalyst particles are present. The method has been tested on a set of ball milled MgH2 samples either pure or containing Fe as catalyzing agent. A complete information on the spatial distribution of all the phases constituting the sample can be obtained by integrating observations carried out at different primary beam energies with different signals. As far as the desorption behavior is concerned, SEM analysis shows that the MgH2-Mg phase transition is strongly affected by catalyst particles which, in the present case, appear to support the nucleation step in the phase transformation sequence. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

HPWHs are a promising technology in both residential and commercial applications due to both improved efficiency and air conditioning benefits. Residential HPWH units have been available for more than 20 years, but have experienced limited success in the marketplace. Commercial-scale HPWHs are also a very promising technology, while their present market share is extremely low. This study dealt with reviewing HPWH systems in terms of energetic and exergetic aspects. In this context, HPWH technology along with its historical development was briefly given first. Next, a comprehensive review of studies conducted on them were classified and presented in tables. HPWHs were then modeled for performance evaluation purposes by using energy and exergy analysis methods. Finally, the results obtained were discussed. It is expected that this comprehensive review will be very beneficial to everyone involved or interested in the energetic and exergetic design, simulation, analysis, performance assessment and applications of various types of HPWH systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Under optical illumination by photons with above-bandgap energy Eph (&gt; Eg,Si), ISub,photo is abruptly increased at the gate voltage VG = VFB due to a sudden increase of the excess minority-carrier diffusion current. As expected in this principle, while the single-step feature of the ISub,photo-VG curve is observed in the case of N-MOSFETs, a multistep response is clearly observed in nitride-based CTF memories. The mechanism of steplike ISub, photo spectroscopy is analyzed, supported by analytical models, and verified by comparison with TCAD simulation results. The results show that the height of the step corresponds to the lateral length LTC of the region, over which localized trapped charges are distributed, and its width to the density Qnit(χ) = qNnit (χ) [C/cm2] in the nitride storage layer. Based on the proposed ISub, photo spectroscopy, lateral charge profiling is demonstrated in a programmed NROM cell. The validity of the proposed ISub, photo spectroscopy is confirmed by comparing the measured ID-VG characteristics with TCAD simulation incorporating the extracted Nnit(χ) by ISub, photo spectroscopy. The proposed lateral charge-profiling technique is expected to be a useful technique for extracting the trapped-charge distribution in NROM and/or multibit CTF memories. This extraction technique has advantages of electrical stress free, exclusion of the effect from interface traps, and the applicability to devices with large gate leakage current. © 2009 IEEE.","Above-bandgap photon; Channel hot-electron injection; Charge-trap Flash (CTF) memory; Flatband voltage; Lateral charge profile; MOSFET; Nonuniform charge trapping; Opticalsubstrate-current spectroscopy; Simulation","Above-bandgap photon; Channel hot-electron injection; Charge-trap Flash (CTF) memory; Flatband voltage; Lateral charge profile; MOSFET; Nonuniform charge trapping; Opticalsubstrate-current spectroscopy; Simulation; Cell membranes; Electric potential; Electron injection; Energy gap; Flash memory; Floating breakwaters; Light transmission; Lithium batteries; MOSFET devices; Nitrides; Photons; Simulators; Substrates; Charge trapping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549095718

The presence of nanometer-sized CaCO3 particles led to a slight decrease in the tensile strength but improved the impact energy, the storage modulus and the fracture toughness. Fracture surface examination by scanning electron microscopy indicated that the enhanced fracture properties in the nanocomposites were caused by the assisted void formation at the particles.

WAT sites response under energy-related stress is not uniform. In the present study we have analyzed how different WAT sites respond to limited food restriction as a way to better understand the role of WAT in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. Methods: Overweight male rats had their food intake reduced a 40% compared with free-feeding controls. On day ten, the rats were killed; circulating glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, triacylglycerols and other parameters were measured. The main WAT sites were dissected: mesenteric, retroperitoneal, epididymal and subcutaneous inguinal, which were weighed and frozen. Later all subcutaneous WAT was also dissected and weighed. Samples were used for DNA (cellularity) analysis and mRNA extraction and semiquantitarive RT-PCR analysis of specific cytokine gene expressions. Results: There was a good correlation between serum leptin and cumulative WAT leptin gene mRNA, but not for adiponectin. Food restriction reduced WAT size, but not its DNA content (except for epididymal WAT). Most cytokines were correlated to WAT site weight, but not to DNA. There was WAT site specialization in the differential expression (and probably secretion) of adipokines: subcutaneous WAT showed the highest concentration for leptin, CD68 and MCP-1, mesenteric WAT for TNFα (and both tissues for the interleukins 1β and 6); resistin was highly expressed in subcutaneous and retroperitoneal WAT. Conclusion: Food restriction induced different patterns for mesenteric and the other WAT sites, which may be directly related to both the response to intestine-derived energy availability, and an inflammatory-related response. However, retroperitoneal WAT, and to a lower extent, subcutaneous and epididymal, reacted decreasing the expression of inflammatory markers and the signaling of decreased energy availability in their stores. The varying cytokine expression patterns highlight the fact that WAT sites show different inflammatory and signaling responses to energy availability; they are too much different to simply extend to the whole-body WAT the findings of one or even a couple of sites. © 2009 Romero et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adipocytokine; adiponectin; CD68 antigen; cyclophilin A; glucose; insulin; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; leptin; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; perilipin; resistin; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; vasculotropin A; adipocytokine; adiponectin; CD68 protein, rat; cytokine; differentiation antigen; insulin; leptin; leukocyte antigen; messenger RNA; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, rat; perilipin; phosphoprotein; resistin; Retn protein, rat; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; diet restriction; DNA content; epididymis; food intake; inguinal region; male; mesentery; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein blood level; protein expression; rat; retroperitoneum; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; white adipose tissue; Wistar rat; animal; antibody specificity; biosynthesis; blood; comparative study; diet therapy; food deprivation; gene expression regulation; genetics; glucose blood level; inflammation; metabolism; obesity; randomization; Adipokines; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Antigens, CD; Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic; Blood Glucose; Cytokines; Food Deprivation; Gene Expression Regulation; Inflammation; Insulin; Leptin; Male; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase; Organ Specificity; Overweight; Phosphoproteins; Random Allocation; Rats; Resistin; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549105965

Yet, little is known about the molecular mechanisms occurring upon aging that affect energy metabolism. Although visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) is known for its key impact on metabolism, recent studies have indicated it could also be a key regulator of lifespan, suggesting that it can serve as a node for age-associated fat accretion. Here we show that aging triggers changes in the transcriptional milieu of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in vWAT, which leads to a modified potential for transactivation of target genes upon ligand treatment. We found that in vWAT of mice, rats and men, aging induced a specific decrease in the expression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), whose recruitment to PPARγ is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and low adipogenic activity. In contrast, aging and oxidative stress did not impact on PPARγ expression and PPARγ ligand production. Age-induced loss of PPARγ/SRC-1 interactions increased the binding of PPARγ to the promoter of the adipogenic gene aP2. These findings suggest that strategies aimed at increasing SRC-1 expression and recruitment to PPARγ upon aging might help improve age-associated metabolic disorders. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/The Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Adipose tissue; Aging; Humans; Mice; PPAR-gamma; SRC-1","carrier proteins and binding proteins; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein aP2; reactive oxygen metabolite; steroid receptor coactivator 1; unclassified drug; histone acetyltransferase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; steroid receptor coactivator 1; transcription factor; adipogenesis; adult; age; aged; aging; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; promoter region; protein DNA binding; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; rat; transactivation; transcription regulation; white adipose tissue; adipose tissue; animal; C57BL mouse; cell line; cell nucleus; Fischer 344 rat; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; physiology; protein binding; Sprague Dawley rat; Mus; Rattus; Rodentia; Adipose Tissue; Aging; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Nucleus; Gene Expression; Histone Acetyltransferases; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oxidative Stress; PPAR gamma; Protein Binding; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651148136

Chem. C 2008, 112, 6764). In the present work, we report a study on a hybrid gold nanoparticles/amphiphilic CD supramolecular system assembled onto a surface by both field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. Amphiphilic CDs bearing respectively thioalkyl chains with different length in the primary site (thiohexyl in SC6NH2 and thiohexadecyl in SC16NH2) and oligoethylene amino groups in the secondary ones were drop-cast onto glass and silicon surfaces. FE-SEM pointed out on the mesoscopic scale the presence of CDs aggregates with sizes of about 100-300 nm, mostly displaying the known vesicular aspect. Both CDs can interact closely with gold nanoparticles of 10-20 nm. The binding mode was investigated in detail by XPS pointing to the coordination of CD amino groups with the external thin shell of gold nanoparticles. In the present case, the anchorage of the CDs to the noble metal occurs via the amino groups, which are unexpectedly favored with respect to the less accessible thioether groups. This investigation can potentially open perspectives in the design and control of devices engineered onto surface for biosensing or drug delivery. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino group; Amphiphilic cyclodextrin; Amphiphilics; Binding modes; Biosensing; Capping agent; CdS; Colloidal system; Design and control; Drop-cast; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Functionalized; Gold colloid; Gold Nanoparticles; Mesoscopic scale; Noble metals; Oligoethylene; SEM; Silicon surfaces; Solid surface; Supramolecular systems; Thin shells; Thioethers; XPS; Amination; Amines; Binding energy; Cyclodextrins; Data storage equipment; Drug delivery; Emission spectroscopy; Field emission; Field emission microscopes; Gold; Nanoparticles; Precious metals; Scanning electron microscopy; Silanes; Supramolecular chemistry; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149125716

Results from MD for empty sequences lead to a quite stable arrangement formed by three mutually perpendicular cyclodextrin (CD) units named here as 3P. In such a spatial arrangement, the van der Waals term in the force field is pronounced, accounting for almost 40% of the association energy, which ensures the noticeable stability of the 3P association even in aqueous media. In addition, it can be stated that only the presence of the oligomer forces the CD units to acquire an almost linear association. Mutually perpendicular-based arrangements are the most favorable spatial disposition in aqueous media. We believe this work is the first step toward a more ambitious study including very large CD sequences, aiming to understand the association process in aqueous solution at a molecular level. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Molecular dynamics; Van der Waals forces; Aqueous media; Aqueous solutions; Association energies; Association process; Force fields; Molecular dynamics simulations; Molecular levels; Pseudorotaxanes; Spatial arrangements; Van der waals; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650819136

This paper describes the technique used for programmable power management, and describes the experimental evaluation that led to the choice of regions in these architectures. The memory architecture is also explored by adding heterogeneous memory mapping to the FPGA Modeling Toolkit, and used to explore LUT based memory structures. The ALM structure provides more inputs than required for a simple 6 LUT, which can be used with simple modifications to efficiently support simple dual-ported LUT based RAM.

Recent results have however shown that the conventional approach to their design, which consists in continuous wireless streaming of the sensed data to a central data collector, is unsustainable in terms of network lifetime and autonomy. Furthermore, it was established that wireless data communica?tion is responsible for most of the energy consumption. To address the energy inefficiency of conventional WBSNs, we advocate an advanced WBSN concept where sensor nodes exploit their available, yet limited processing and storage resources to deploy advanced embedded intelligence and processing, to reduce the amount of wireless data communication and consequently energy consumption. More specifically, this paper addresses the design and optimization of an automated real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis and cardiovascular arrhythmia diagnosis application for a prototype sensor node called Wireless 25 EEG/ECG sys?tem. The satifactory accuracy of this on-line automated ECG-based analysis and diagnosis system is assessed and compared to the salient off-line automated ECG analysis algorithms. More importantly, our results show an energy consumption reduction of 80% to 100% with respect to conventional WBSNs, when our analysis and diagnosis algorithm is used to process the sensed ECG data to extract its relevant features, which are then wirelessly reported to the WBSN central data collector, after the node can automatically determine the potential cardiovascular pathology without human monitoring.","Biomedical signal processing; Electrocardiogram; Wireless body sensor networks","Biomedical signal processing; Conventional approach; Data collectors; Design and optimization; Diagnosis algorithms; Diagnosis systems; ECG analysis; ECG data; Electrocardiogram; Electrocardiogram signal; Embedded intelligence; Enabling technologies; Energy consumption; Human monitoring; Network lifetime; Pervasive healthcare; Prototype sensor; Sensor platform; Storage resources; TEM; Wireless body sensor networks; Wireless data; Wireless data communication; Automation; Electric load forecasting; Electrocardiography; Electrochromic devices; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal analysis; Signal processing; Software prototyping; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650541118

The objective of this work is to find the optimal arm configuration that maximizes the arm bending stiffness subject to the constraint imposed on the moment of inertia of the arm. Herein, the problem of finding the optimal arm configuration maximizing the arm bending stiffness is formulated as a topology optimization for eigenvalue maximization problem. By applying this method, an arm configuration having two balance holes instead of a single balance hole was obtained.

Automation at home has already started catering to this growing need. Another major motivating factor for this is the prospect of higher energy efficiency, greater control on home from remote locations and the decreasing cost of network-controlled home appliances. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for accessing home appliances over the Internet using secure communication channel offered by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with mandatory certificate verification, perform user authentication using Iris image, and then hash the biometric data to provide an impregnable three-factor security to the biometric data as well as user instructions while in transit between the user terminal and the home appliance. Additionally, we propose the use of a single Authentication Server for multiple residences, that would store users' sensitive biometric data, perform authentication, access control and quality of service, thereby reducing cost, effort, user dependability and improve security, acceptability and userfriendliness of home automation universally, together with SIP and UPnP protocols. The proposed approach proves to be more effective because of its well integrated three levels of security, less equal error, very small hash code used for authentication, lower computational complexity while matching, and thus, very fast response. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Authentication servers; Biometric data; Fast response; Home appliances; Home automation; Iris images; Iris recognition; Network-controlled; Reducing costs; Remote location; Secure communications; Secure socket layers; User authentication; User terminals; Artificial intelligence; Biometrics; Buffer storage; Computational complexity; Cost reduction; Domestic appliances; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Network security; Quality control; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Authentication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650376987

Here we quantitatively determined the effect of secondary structure on the hybridization activation energy using structurally defined oligonucleotides. It turned out that activation energy is linearly proportional to the length of a single-stranded region flanking a nucleation site, generating a 0.18 kcal/mol energy barrier per nucleotide. Based on this result, we propose that the presence of single-stranded segments available for non-productive base pairing with a nucleation counterpart extends the searching process for nucleation sites to find a perfect match.

The entire memory cells can be discretely categorized by two groups: leaky cells or normal cells, and the main distribution representing the normal cells shows longer than 40 s of the mean retention time. The leaky cells are mainly originated by trap-assisted gate-induced drain leakage currents depending on trap energy dispersion. Through analyses of full chip retention failure curves and interface trap density (Dit*) measurements, we propose that the tail distribution will be diminished and separated from the main distribution as the cell size shrinks into a true nanoscale.

Among the several projects investigating the fate of CO2 stored at depth, the EnCana's CO2 injection EOR (Enhancing Oil Recovery) project at Weyburn (Saskatchewan, Canada) is the most important oil production development that hosts an international monitoring project. In the Weyburn EOR Project CO2 is used to increase recovery of heavy oil from the Midale Beds, a Mississippian reservoir consisting of shallow marine carbonate, where about 3 billions standard m3 of supercritical CO2 have been injected since 2000 with an injection rate of 5000 ton/day. In this work the available dataset (bulk mineralogy of the reservoir, gas-cap composition and selected pre- and post-CO2 injection water samples) provided by the International Energy Agency Weyburn CO2 Monitoring &amp; Storage Project has been used in order to:i)reconstruct the pre-injection reservoir chemical composition (including pH and the boundary conditions at 62 °C and 15 MPa);ii)assess the evolution of the reservoir subjected to CO2 injection and predict dissolution/precipitation processes of the Weyburn brines over 100 years after injection;iii)validate the short-term (September 2000-2003) evolution of the in situ reservoir fluids due to the CO2 injection, by comparing the surface analytical data with the composition of the computed depressurized brines. To achieve these goals the PRHEEQC (V2.14) Software Package was used with both modified thermodynamic database and correction for supercritical CO2 fugacity. The oil-gas-water interaction and the non-ideality of the gas phase (with exception of CO2) were not considered in the numerical simulations. Despite intrinsic limitations and uncertainties of geochemical modeling, the main results can be summarized, as follows: 1) the calculated pre-injection chemical composition of the Midale Beds brine is consistent with the analytical data of the waters collected in 2000 (baseline survey), 2) the main reservoir reactions (CO2 and carbonate dissolution) take place within the first year of simulation, 3) the temporal evolution of the chemical features of the fluids in the Weyburn reservoir suggests that CO2 can safely be stored by solubility (as CO2(aq)) and mineral trapping (via dawsonite precipitation). The short-term validation performed by calculating chemical composition of the reservoir fluids (corrected for surface conditions) after the simulation of 3 years of CO2 injection is consistent (error ≤ 5%) with the analytical data of the wellhead water samples collected in 2003, with the exception of Ca and Mg (error &gt; 90%), likely due to complexation effect of carboxilic acid. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Uniform dispersion of FMWNT in the composites is evident from TEM study. π-π and CH-π interactions are evident from FTIR spectra in the low molecular weight (Mw = 8 × 104) and high regiorandom (head-tail= 69 mol %) P3DDT (ILM) composites; however, such interactions are not so prominent for other P3DDTs. Wide-angle X-ray scattering patterns indicate intact interchain lamellar structure of P3DDT in the composites. DSC study shows decrease of main chain melting peak of P3DDT (ILM) with increasing F-MWNT content but the decrease is lower with higher molecular weight and higher regioregular samples. Dynamic mechanical analyzer study indicates that there is no significant change in the Tg, Tβ, and T γ transition temperature with FMWNT concentration indicating almost ideal mixing of the components. The percent increase of G' increases with increasing FMWNT loading and also with temperature showing an 84% increase in storage modulus at -20 °C for ILM12 samples. The UV-vis spectrum indicates a decrease in band gap with FMWNT concentration for ILM composites, however, it is negligible with other P3DDTs. Photoluminescence quenching and multiple emission peaks occur in the composites. dc-Conductivity of the composites increases by two orders and current-voltage (I-V) curves show memory effect only in ILM-MWNT composites. The I-V curves of other P3DDT nanocomposites exhibit rectification property. Quantitative explanation of electronic properties has been afforded from the band energy and work function values. So, the electronic properties of the nanocomposite can be tuned by changing the molecular weight, regioregularity, and concentration of FMWNT. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Once captured inside the optical resonator, the energy can be released with an arbitrary delay and pulse shape by again controlling the resonator coupling coefficient. In addition, the wavelength of the output pulse can be shifted through the use of an internal cavity-phase modulator.

The key environmental components of these ecosystems consist of vegetation and the underlying permafrost. The surface energy balance and, consequently, the ground surface temperature (GST) and ground thermal regime (GTR) can be influenced by vegetation, as is well known in Arctic areas. The interactions between vegetation, GST, GTR and their potential ecological implications in Antarctica have only recently begun to develop. This paper aims to contribute towards closing the gap of knowledge of these interactions. It does so by considering different spatial (intra-site and inter-site variability) and temporal (seasonal versus annual) scales with reference to dry and wet Antarctic cryptogamic tundra. For this reason, two sites and seven plots (bare ground versus vegetated ground) were instrumented and monitored in Victoria Land (continental Antarctica) to measure the ground temperature at different depths during the summer, as well as during one complete year. Our results demonstrate for the first time for continental Antarctica that vegetation provides an insulating effect with a net cooling effect on the GST, varying with the vegetation type, structure, coverage and thickness. Independently of the GST, the soil thermal characteristics constitute the driving factor in determining the thickness of the active layer.

The TiN nanopowder has an average particle size of 6 nm and is introduced into sodium alanate (NaAlH4) as a catalyst. During hydrogen sorption cycles, TiN-catalyzed NaAlH4 exhibits a greater hydrogen desorption rate and higher hydrogen capacity than TiCl3-catalyzed NaAlH4. Contradicting thermodynamic predictions, in situ X-ray diffraction results reveal that TiN nanopowder remains stable and produces no by-products (e.g., Ti-Al compounds) in the reaction with NaAlH4 during hydrogen desorption. In situ Raman spectroscopy also confirms the stability of TiN nanopowder in NaAlH4. This implies that the sustained hydrogen sorption kinetics and hydrogen capacity of TiN-catalyzed NaAlH4 originate from the structural and chemical stability of TiN nanopowder in NaAlH4 for the given conditions of the hydrogen cycle test. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It was confirmed that the DCA- anions, instead of the bigger BMP+ cations, were the working species that compensate the Mn valent state variation upon charging and discharging in the IL electrolyte. During oxidation of the Mn oxide electrode, to keep the charges balanced, the quasi-linear DCA- anions were inserted into the tunnels between the MnO6 octahedral units, expanding the structural framework.

However, the quantification of evapotranspiration is difficult in a complex urban setting, given the heterogeneity of the terrain and its various dry and wet elements. Here an open-air scaled urban surface (OASUS) is employed to quantify latent heat flux as a function of the surface area available for evaporation and the three-dimensional (3-D) urban geometry. The OASUS model consists of an extensive urban-like building/street array located in an arid Negev region of southern Israel (30.8 °N, 480 m above sea level). Measurements were carried out during the summer month of August, and flux partitioning was analysed using evaporation pans of varying surface areas embedded in arrays of varying height. Results indicated that the increase in latent heat removal with respect to equivalent 'vegetative' surface area was nearly linear. Increasing latent heat flux with 'vegetated fraction' was offset in approximately equal measure by decreases in storage and turbulent sensible heat flux. The proportion of the radiant energy budget represented by evaporative heat loss was also linked to the 3-D geometry of the array, increasing linearly with the ratio between vegetative cover and the 'complete' urban surface area.

This study presents the results of four distinct trials conducted on the Italian Alps with a truck-mounted bundler, and compares them with the figures obtained by the Austrian and German colleagues on the other side of the Alps. Average productivity varied between 14 and 22 bundles per productive machine hour (PMH), or between 10 and 15 bundles per scheduled machine hour (SMH). Mass production ranged from 3.1 to 4.3 oven-dry tonnes SMH-1.

Although bundling may represent an additional cost in the slash-to-chip chain, it offers the important benefit of efficient outdoor winter storage, which is crucial in a region where the supply and demand of fuel biomass are often diachronic. The truck-mounted bundler used on the Alps adopts the same mechanism and achieves the same performance of the Nordic forwarder-mounted application.

Co0.85(SiO2) 0.15,with conductivity well above the percolation threshold has a frequency and temperature behavior according to what it is find in conducting metal oxides. The electron scattering rate displays a unique relaxation time characteristic of single type of carriers experiencing strong electron-phonon interactions. Using small polaron fits we identify those phonons as glass vibrational modes. Ni0.61(SiO2)0.39, with a metal fraction closer to the percolation threshold, undergoes a metal-nonmetal transition at ∼77 K. Here, as it is suggested by the scattering rate nearly quadratic dependence, we broadly identify two relaxation times (two carrier contributions) associated to a Drude mode and a midinfrared overdamped band, respectively. Disorder induced, the midinfrared contribution drives the phase transition by thermal electron localization. Co0.51(SiO 2)0.49 has the reflectivity of an insulator with a distinctive band at ∼1450 cm-1 originating in electron promotion, localization, and defect induced polaron formation. Angle dependent oblique reflectivity of globally insulating Co0.38(SiO2) 0.62, Fe0.34(SiO2)0.66, and Ni 0.28(SiO2)0.72, reveals a remarkable resonance at that band threshold. We understand this as due to the excitation by normal to the film electric fields of defect localized electrons in the metallic nanoparticles. At higher oblique angles, this localized nanoplasma couples to SiO2 longitudinal optical Berreman phonons resulting in band peak softening reminiscent to the phonon behavior undergoing strong electron-phonon interactions.

The cure kinetics of these systems were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry using an isothermal approach, and the kinetic parameters of all systems were reported in generalized kinetic equations with diffusion effects. Both the epoxy resin systems with microencapsulated latent catalysts showed lower cure conversion rate and higher critical cure reaction conversion than those with TPP. These different cure conversion rates could be explained by the decrease of crystallinity of the biphenyl epoxy resin and the activation energy of these epoxy resin systems. The cure conversion rates of the epoxy resin systems with the microencapsulated latent catalyst would be dependent on the activation energy of these systems.

Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is the most widely used in situ recovery technique in Athabasca reservoirs. Steam generation is done on surface and consequently, because of heat losses, the energy efficiency of SAGD can never be ideal with respect to the energy delivered to the sandface. An alternative to surface steam generation is in situ combustion (ISC) where heat is generated within the formation through injection of oxygen at a sufficiently high pressure to initiate combustion of bitumen. In this manner, the heat from the combustion reactions can be used directly to mobilize the bitumen. As an alternative, the heat can be used to generate steam within the formation which then is the agent to move heat in the reservoir. In this research, alternative hybrid techniques with simultaneous and sequential steam-oxygen injection processes are examined to maximize the thermal efficiency of the recovery process. These hybrid processes have the advantage that during ISC, steam is generated within the reservoir from injected and formation water and as a product of oxidation. This implies that ex situ steam generation requirements are reduced and if there is in situ storage of combustion gases, that overall gas emissions are reduced. In this research, detailed reservoir simulations are done to examine the dynamics of hybrid processes to enable design of these processes. The results reveal that hybrid processes can lower emitted carbon dioxide-to-oil ratio by about 46%, decrease the consumed natural gas-to-oil ratio by about 73%, reduce the cumulative energy-to-oil ratio by between 40% and 70% compared to conventional SAGD, and drop water consumption per unit oil produced. However, oil recovery is between 25% and 40% below that of SAGD. Design of successful hybrid steam-oxygen processes must take into account the balance between injected steam and amount of injected oxygen and combustion gas products that dilute injected and in situ-generated steam in the depletion chamber by lowering its partial pressure, and thus its saturation temperature which in turn impacts production rates and recovery. © 2009 International Association for Mathematical Geology.","Athabasca bitumen; Combustion kinetics; Enhanced oil recovery; Hybrid steam-combustion; In situ combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449519156

Developments and opportunities involving gene manipulation for starch and protein quality, as well as non-starch polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and micronutrients will also be discussed.

Two materials are discussed. Both are used or intended for use in power sources. One is nickel hydroxide, Ni(OH) 2, which converts to oxyhydroxide in the positive Ni electrode of rechargeable metal hydride batteries. The other is a complex hydride, Mg(AIH 4) 2, intended for use in reversible, solid- state hydrogen storage for fuel cells. The feature shared by these unlikely materials (hydroxide and hydride) is a sheet-like hexagonal crystal structure. The mechanical activation was conducted in high-energy ball mills. We discuss and demonstrate that the mechanical excitation of atoms and ions imparted on these powders stems from the same class of phenomena. These are (i) proliferation of structural defects, in particular stacking faults in a sheet-like structure of hexagonal crystals, and (ii) possible fragmentation of a faulted structure into a mosaic of layered nanocrystals. The hydrogen atoms bonded in such nanocrystals may be inserted and abstracted more easily from OH - hydroxyl group in Ni(OH) 2 and AIH4 4 hydride complex in Mg(AIH 4) 2 during hydrogen charge and discharge reactions. However, the effects of mechanical excitation imparted on these powders are different. While the Ni(OH) 2 powder is greatly activated for cycling in batteries, the Mg(AIH 4) 2 complex hydride phase is greatly destabilized for use in reversible hydrogen storage. Such a ""synchronic"" view of the structure-property relationship in respect to materials involved in hydrogen energy storage and conversion is supported in experiments employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and direct imaging of the structure with a high-resolution transmission-electron microscope (HREM), as well as in property characterization.

Very little is reported on the effects these developments may have on technologist productivity. This study aims to determine whether advances have created a workplace where more patient studies can be performed with fewer technologists. The level of change in automation or time taken to perform a routine task by the nuclear medicine technologist as a result of technological development over the past decade is reported. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using Embase.com, Medline, INSPEC, and Cinahl. Two authors reviewed each article for eligibility. Technological developments in routine areas over the past decade were reviewed. The resultant automation or time effects on data acquisition, data processing, and image processing were summarized. Results: Sixteen articles were included in the areas of myocardial perfusion, information technology, and positron emission tomography (PET). Gamma camera design has halved the acquisition time for myocardial perfusion studies, automated analysis requires little manual intervention and information technologies and filmless departments are more efficient. Developments in PET have reduced acquisition to almost one-fifth of the time. Conclusions: Substantial efficiencies have occurred over the decade thereby increasing productivity, but whether staffing levels are appropriate for safe, high quality practice is unclear. Future staffing adequacy is of concern given the anticipated increasing service needs. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.","Gamma camera; Nuclear medicine; Nuclear medicine technologist; Positron emission tomography","Acquisition time; Automated analysis; Filmless; Gamma camera; Gamma cameras; High quality; Level of change; Manual intervention; Medline; Myocardial perfusion; Staffing level; Systematic Review; Technological development; Technologist productivity; Time effect; Automation; Cameras; Data acquisition; Digital image storage; Enterprise resource management; Human resource management; Image processing; Information technology; Nuclear energy; Nuclear medicine; Personnel selection; Positrons; Productivity; Technological forecasting; Positron emission tomography; automation; CINAHL; clinical practice; EMBASE; heart muscle perfusion; human; image processing; information processing; information technology; intervention study; medical technology; MEDLINE; nuclear medicine; nuclear medicine technician; positron emission tomography; review; scintillation camera; systematic review; task performance; time; workplace; instrumentation; productivity; Biomedical Technology; Efficiency; Gamma Cameras; Nuclear Medicine; Positron-Emission Tomography",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350464611

Moreover, it is equally important to determine these properties under conditions similar to those observed in the natural movement of facial tissues. This study evaluates the dynamic mechanical properties of silicone maxillo-facial prosthetic material using the classical Torsional pendulum method and high precision laser based measurement system. Materials and Methods : Five commercially available silicone maxillofacial prosthetic materials A-2002, A-2186, A-VST-50, A-588V-1and MDX4-4210 were taken as sample in the form of cylinders measuring 8X80 mm. A custom-made dynamic visco-elastometer was used to determine the Storage modulus, Loss modulus and Loss tangent over a frequency range of 0.5 to 1.0 Hertz at 37Celsius. Results : A-VST-50, A-588V-1 had low loss tangent (P less than 0.05), further they had lower storage modulus than other tested material, which is an added advantage over MDX4-4210 and A-2186. At all test frequencies A-2002 was found to have the highest loss modulus as well as the highest loss tangent (damping factor) among all the five kinds of material tested (P less than 0.05) which indicates its slow response to load but large capacity to absorb energy. Conclusion : Custom-made dynamic visco-elastometer has proved to be reliable, low cost and a convenient instrument to evaluate silicone maxillo-facial prosthetic material. No single material was found to have all the desirable dynamic mechanical properties necessary for maxillo-facial prosthesis applications. Therefore, layering of two or more such kind of materials is recommended to achieve desirable properties.","Dynamic mechanical properties; Dynamic visco-elastometer; Silicone maxillofacial prosthetic materials",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350319144

Several spatial studies have been carried out for biomass surveys, and many linear programming models have been developed to model the logistics of bio-energy chains. These models can assist in determining the best alternatives for bio-energy chains. Most of these models use network structures built up from nodes with one or more depots, with arcs connecting the depots. Each depot is a source of a certain biomass type. Nodes can also be biomass storage points or production facilities (e.g., power plants) where biomass is used. The arcs in the networks represent transport between depots. In order to combine GIS spatial studies with linear programming models, it is necessary to build a network from a digital map of biomass production centers, such as orchards. Biomass collection points should therefore be defined as sources in the delivery network model. In this work, a mathematical calculation method is developed to select the actual biomass collection points on a map. The database for this model is composed of area surveys of forest and agricultural biomass storage points given in GIS maps (shape files). The limits of the area studied and different types of biomass are defined and located in different layers of the GIS maps. These energy-biomass production maps are overlaid with a 1 km × 1 km grid of the area studied. The result is a grid in which the different types of total available biomass in each quadrant are known. Harvesting and collection costs are also defined. The connections between all n × m quadrants of the area studied are defined by the available road network. Every quadrant is associated with a point on the road network. The selection criteria for sources of biomass (sub-areas) are the following: firstly, a minimum production of available biomass type is required; and secondly, harvesting and collection costs should be minimal. The algorithm provides the location of points where biomass from the associated area can be concentrated. These biomass collection points are then taken as source nodes in the network during the implementation of the logistics models. In the next step, the network is analyzed by linear programming techniques to supply the optimal position of energy plants or factories, given the available biomass sources. ©2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Bioenergy; Biomass supply; Borvemar model; Logistics","Agricultural biomass; Bioenergy; Biomass productions; Biomass source; Biomass storage; Biomass supply; Borvemar model; Digital map; Energy plant; GIS application; GIS maps; Linear programming models; Linear programming techniques; Logistics model; Mathematical calculations; Network models; Network structures; Optimal position; Production facility; Road network; Selection criteria; Source nodes; Sub-areas; Computer systems programming; Conformal mapping; Dynamic programming; Geographic information systems; Harvesting; Linear programming; Linearization; Logistics; Motor transportation; Optimization; Orchards; Roads and streets; Structures (built objects); Surveys; Biomass; agroforestry; bioenergy; biomass; database; digital map; GIS; linear programing; mathematical analysis; spatial analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549133446

The overreaching goal of that standard is to develop farm enterprises that are ''sustainable and harmonious with the environment''. However, empirical evidence to shed light on claims of environmental benefits from organic agriculture is particularly scarce in Canada and North America generally, and has not been comprehensively summarized. This review examines the literature of Canadian and US studies which relate to environmental impacts of organic agriculture within the selected indicators of: (i) soil organic matter storage and soil quality/soil health; (ii) plant and wildlife biodiversity; (iii) energy use; (iv) nutrient loading and off-farm nutrient losses; and (v) climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. The empirical evidence presented suggests organic farming system attributes regarding cropping, floral, and habitat diversity, nutrient intensity, soil management, energy and pesticide use, etc., are sufficiently distinct as to impart potentially important environmental benefits across the indicator categories examined. However, on average, crop yields under organic management regimes continue to lag behind those obtained by conventional management systems. More research is needed to validate these results, for the benefit of producers, consumers and policy makers as they decide the relative importance and contribution of organic farming systems to the Canadian food marketplace and agrifood sector.","Biodiversity; Energy; Farming system; Greenhouse gases; Organic agriculture; Soil","agricultural production; biodiversity; crop yield; environmental impact; farming system; greenhouse gas; organic farming; sustainability; Canada; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049146005

Submicrometre particles of manganese oxide were obtained by reduction of KMnO4solutions with ethanol. As prepared particles were amorphous and crystallised in a birnessite structure after annealing at 400u°C during 1 h. The use of sodium alginate as a dispersant, enabled electrosteric stabilisation of the nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions. It was shown that binding properties and pH dependent charge of alginate enabled electrophoretic deposition of crack free films. The thickness of the films prepared from stable suspensions, containing 1-10 g L21manganese oxide, was varied in the range of 2- 100 mm by variation in deposition time and applied voltage. The composition of the films can be varied by the variation in suspension composition.

Nevertheless, the development of such a technology requires appropriate infrastructures for production, storage and refuelling stages in a refuelling station. This one presents safety challenges due to the hydrogen chemicophysical characteristics. So, to avoid hazards, it is necessary to implement safety practices that, if early adopted in the development of a fuelling station project, can allow very low impact, safety being incorporated in the project itself. However, a drawback is the not sufficient experience and the scarcity of the relevant data collection. To deepen studies about the risk in the above mentioned field, in this paper, for the moment, safety analyses of a high-pressure storage equipment in hydrogen gas refuelling station have been carried out by the integrated use of FMEA, HAZOP and FTA techniques. The work is intended to assess if the refuelling station design taken into consideration is safe enough, at least from the occurrence frequency point of view, as well to constitute a basis for further more refined studies which also consider the consequences aspects, allowing the plant risk assessment. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Fault tree analyses; FMEA; HAZOP; Hydrogen refuelling station; Risk analysis","Data collection; FMEA; HAZOP; High-pressure storage; Hydrogen gas; Hydrogen vehicles; Safety analysis; Safety practices; Safety studies; Fault tree analysis; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Leakage (fluid); Petroleum refining; Reliability; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety factor; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650751612

X-ray diffraction studies showed that the Ni particles formed on the alloy surface during the electroless coating resulted in the formation of two new broad Ni peaks. The application of the Ni coating improved the capacity retention rates of all the alloys. This improvement was attributed to the hydrogen diffusion pathways provided by the external Ni particles. The capacity retention of the coated Mg2Ni alloy was relatively lower than those of the coated Al and Zr including alloys. This observation was assumed to arise from the contribution of the underlying electrocatalytically active Ni sites formed as a result of the dissolution of the disseminated Al and Zr oxides throughout the Mg(OH)2 layer to the alloy capacity retention rate. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments indicated that the Ni crystals nucleated during the electroless coating make the alloy surface more catalytic for the electrochemical charge transfer reactions. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Electroless Ni coating; Hydrogen storage; Impedance spectroscopy; Magnesium alloys; Mechanical alloying","Alloy surfaces; Capacity retention; Electrochemical charge; Electrochemical hydrogen storage; Electroless coating; Electroless Ni; Electroless Ni coating; Electroless nickel coatings; Hydrogen diffusion; Impedance spectroscopy; Mg-based alloy; Ni alloys; Ni coating; NI particles; X-ray diffraction studies; Aluminum; Amorphous alloys; Cerium alloys; Charge transfer; Coatings; Dissolution; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Ion exchange; Magnesium; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium printing plates; Mechanical alloying; Metallurgy; Nickel; Zirconium; Hydrogen storage alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649595801

Although hydrogen and its application in fuel cell is considered as a high-cost energy system, some cost-efficient solutions have been found for their use in stand-alone applications, which usually depend on the variability of renewable sources that have to be oversized in order to reduce their dependence on external energy sources. This paper shows the results from the simulation of several alternatives of introducing hydrogen technologies to increase the independence of a remote-telecom application fed by photovoltaic panels. Hydrogen is obtained by electrolysis and it is used in a fuel cell when the renewable energy source is not enough to maintain the stand-alone application. TRNSYS simulation environment has been used for evaluating the proposed alternatives.

Backscattered power, attenuation coefficient and phase velocity of ultrasonic waves propagating through suspensions of PVA contrast agents were measured at temperature values ranging between 24°C and 37°C in a frequency range from 3 MHz to 13 MHz. Enhancement of the backscattered power higher than 20 dB and displaying a weak dependence on temperature was observed. Attenuation and phase velocity, on the other hand, showed higher sensitivity to temperature variations. A modified version of the Church model, which accounts for the dispersion of the dynamic modulus of the PVA shells, was developed to simultaneously fit the attenuation and phase velocity data at 24°C. The frequency dependence of the storage modulus was found to be that of semiflexible polymeric networks. On the other hand, the frequency dependence of the dynamic loss modulus suggests that additional mechanisms, which may be related to the finite dimensions of the shell and/or to its inhomogeneity, may play a significant role in the dissipation of the acoustic energy. For the microbubbles of interest, this model predicts frequency dependent resonance frequency higher than 100 MHz.

This flux is difficult to measure but one approach is to parameterize it using relations between the net all-wave radiation and the heat flux conducted into and out of the typical materials that form the surface of cities and combine them into a weighted average to give the bulk storage. Urban heat storage parameterization could be improved if there were more and better estimates of the net radiation vs. storage relation for typical urban and suburban roofs. This paper presents the results of a study of the heat storage characteristics of 6 different roof assemblies (typical of many North American commercial/industrial and residential buildings) in Vancouver, Canada, observed across a range of wind and moisture conditions. Further, these observations are used to verify the Simplified Transient Analysis of Roofs (STAR) model, which is then used to estimate the heat storage parameterization for other roof types, thereby extending the usefulness of the scheme to a wider range of urban areas. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the antidiabetic effect of kochujang, the fermented product of red pepper plus soybeans, has not been studied. We examined whether kochujang affected insulin secretion from β-cells and/or peripheral insulin resistance in 90% pancreatectomized diabetic rats fed high-fat diets. Methods: Diabetic rats consumed a high-fat diet containing two different kinds of 5% kochujang powder or the equivalent amount of nutrients for 8 wk. Two types of kochujang were made through the fermentation of two different kinds of meju (soybeans), red peppers, glutinous rice, and malts. Meju was produced by fermenting soybeans in a traditional method (TMK) or in a more modern method in which soybeans are inoculated with Bacillus subtilus and Aspergillus sojae (MMK). Results: TMK and MMK decreased body weight, visceral fat, and serum leptin levels without modulating caloric intake in diabetic rats compared with the control. TMK and MMK also improved glucose tolerance by enhancing insulin sensitivity but did not potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity caused by TMK and MMK was explained by the potentiated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 → adenosine monophosphate kinase → acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression. Kochujang diets reduced hepatic glucose output and triacylglycerol accumulation and increased glycogen storage. Conclusion: The combination of red pepper and fermented soybeans in kochujang improves glucose homeostasis by reducing insulin resistance, not by enhancing β-cell function, in diabetic rats. The improvement is associated with decreased hepatic fat storage by the activation of adenosine monophosphate kinase. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The authors' aimed to determine the prevalence and population attributable risk (PAR%) of the MetS among men according to demographic, physical, and lifestyle risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1195 men in the Florey Adelaide Male Ageing Study, a regionally representative cohort of Australian men aged 35 to 81 years conducted in 2002-2005 (response rate, 45.1%). Prevalent MetS was determined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) classifications; and an extensive list of demographic, physical (including muscle strength, body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, sex hormones), and lifestyle factors was accounted for. Prevalence estimates were 37.7% and 41.8% for ATPIII and IDF classifications. Odds ratios for present MetS were determined using multiple-adjusted logistic regression. Odds for present ATPIII MetS decreased (in order of importance) for lower insulin and increased for lower muscle mass, lower strength, and 3+ medical conditions. Odds for present IDF MetS decreased for lower insulin and increased for lower muscle mass, strength, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels; older age; and being married. Significant PAR% due to lowest insulin, muscle mass, and strength quarters were -44%, 27%, and 17% for the ATPIII Met, and -48%, 31%, and 20% for the IDF MetS. A substantial proportion of MetS cases would have been theoretically prevented if prior exposure to low muscle mass and strength were eradicated (PAR% ranged from 14% to 24%).

These nanocomposites (Fe3O4-PEDOT) were subsequently characterized for morphological, crystalline, structural, electrical and magnetic properties by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), four-probe meter and superconductor quantum interference device (SQUID), respectively. Results show that the nanocomposites have a spherical core-shell shape, are ∼10 nm in size and are superparamagnetic with good magnetic saturation and good electrical conductivities. Existence of Fe3O4in the nanocomposites was confirmed by using Energy dispersive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EDAX) and X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS). We also investigated a possible formation mechanism of the core-shell nanocomposites, and the effect of Fe3O4nanoparticles on the electro-magnetic properties of the nanocomposites.

The ERGO business model creates a market for co-ordinated production and consumption of renewable energy. The innovative contribution of the model rests in its ability to combine two problems and thereby solve them in a fresh way. One problem derives from utilizing power grids with a substantial increase in renewable electric energy production (as witnessed in the Danish case with wind energy) and managing the resulting fluctuating supply efficiently. The other problem concerns finding ways to reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. The ERGO business model effectively solves both problems, by transforming EVs into distributed storage devices for electricity, thus enabling a fresh approach to evening out of fluctuating and unpredictable energy sources, while drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This integrated solution carries many other associated benefits, amongst which are the possibility of introducing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) distributed power generation; introducing IT intelligence to the grid, and creating virtual power plants from distributed sources; and providing new applications for carbon credits in the decarbonisation of the economy.

In the first anaerobic stage OME were fermented in a packed bed biofilm reactor into volatile fatty acids (VFAs). This VFA-rich effluent was fed to the second stage, operated in an aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR), to enrich mixed cultures able to store PHAs. Finally, the storage response of the selected consortia was exploited in the third aerobic stage, operated in batch conditions. Results: The anaerobic stage increased the VFA percentage in the OME from 18% to ∼32% of the overall chemical oxygen demand (COD). A biomass with high storage response was successfully enriched in the SBR fed with the fermented OME at an organic load rate of 8.5 gCOD L-1 d-1, with maximum storage rate and yield (146 mgCOD gCOD-1 h-1 and 0.36 COD COD-1, respectively) very similar to those obtained with a synthetic VFAmixture. Bymeans of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, different bacterial strains were identified during the two SBR runs: Lampropedia hyalina and Candidatus Meganema perideroedes,with the synthetic feed or the fermented OMEs, respectively. In the third stage, operated at increasing loads, themaximum concentration of the PHA produced increased linearly with the substrate fed. Moreover, about half of the stored PHAs were produced from substrates other than VFAs, mostly alcohols. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate that the proces sis effective for simultaneous treatment of OME and their valorization as a renewable resource for PHA production. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.","DGGE; Olive mill effluents (OME); Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs); Storage; VFA production","DGGE; Olive mill effluents (OME); Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs); Storage; VFA production; Batch reactors; Biodegradable polymers; Biomass; Chemical oxygen demand; Effluents; Electrophoresis; Fatty acids; Gelation; Oxygen; Packed beds; Substrates; Vegetable oils; Wastewater treatment; alcohol; olive oil; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polymer; volatile fatty acid; aerobic fermentation; aerobic reactor; anaerobic reactor; article; bacterial strain; bacterium identification; biodegradability; biofilm reactor; biomass production; biotechnology; Candidatus meganema perideroedes; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; effluent; fermentation technique; Lampropedia hyalina; mixed cell culture; nonhuman; packed bed reactor; Proteobacteria; renewable energy; sequencing batch reactor; storage; Bacteria (microorganisms); Candidatus Meganema perideroedes; Lampropedia hyalina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649209214

The Ca atom is bound to the hydroxyl group with a binding energy comparable to the cohesive energy of bulk Ca, and we find that each Ca atom binds up to seven H2 molecules in the molecular form. Binding of an unexpectedly large number of H2 molecules is attributed to the fact that d orbitals of Ca positive ions are downshifted and partially occupied, thereby validating the empirical 18-electron rule as in the transition metal atoms. The binding energy turns out to be ∼0.1eV/ H2, somewhat smaller than the requirement (0.2eV/ H2) of the room-temperature application. We also show that an important bonding mechanism of H2 molecules on Ca is the polarization, namely, the electric dipole moment of H2 induced by the partially ionized Ca.

Thermally induced structural changes occurring on the surfaces of the TiO2Zy-Al2O3 and BaOZ TiO 2Zy-Al2O3 systems were studied in a comparative manner within 300-1273 K via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and BET surface area analysis. The surface acidity of the studied oxide systems was also investigated via pyridine adsorption monitored by in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. BaO/TiO2γ-Al 2O3 ternary oxide was synthesized by incorporating different loadings of (8-20 wt %) BaO onto the TiO2/γ Al 2O3 support material, which was originally prepared using the sol-gel method. In the TiO2Zy-Al2O3 binary oxide support material, anatase phase exhibited a relatively high thermal stability at T &lt; 1073 K. The presence of TiO2 domains on the surface of the alumina particles was found to alter the surface acidity of alumina by providing new medium-strength Lewis acid sites. SEMZEDX results indicate that in the BaO/TiO2γ-Al2O3 system, TiO2 domains present a significant affinity toward BaO and/or Ba(NO3) 2 resulting in a strong Ti-Ba interaction and the formation of overlapping domains on the surface. The presence of TiO2 also leads to a decrease in the decomposition temperature of the Ba(N03) 2 phase with respect to the Ti-free Ba(N03) 2ZyAl2O3 system.

Parametric studies performed for the EAHE coupled with the evaporative cooler illustrate the effects of buried pipe length, pipe diameter, volumetric flow rate of air, number of pipes and surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio on the outlet temperature of the EAHE. An analytical solution has been derived by considering the fundamental equation of energy, heat transfer and psychrometry, for predicting the temperature at the outlet of EAHE. The results of the EAHE coupled with evaporative cooling are compared with that of EAHE without evaporative cooling for different S/V ratio and bypass factor. It is observed that the length of the EAHE pipe is reduced significantly as much as 93.5% for obtaining desired temperature at the outlet of the EAHE by the integration of evaporative cooling with EAHE.

The reported discharge capacities of LNCO are scattered and these cathodes are prone to capacity fading upon repeated charge-discharge cycling. Although, inert cation modified LNCO imparts better structural stability and partially circumvent the fading problem; the role played by such dopant in improving the electrochemical characteristics remains unclear. In the present work, we have demonstrated Zr4+ modified LNCO yields decent discharge capacity and excellent cycleability. X-ray Rietveld analyses in conjunction with micro-Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed to understand the role of Zr4+ cation to improve the cycleability of LNCO cathode. Based on the analyses of XRD refinement and spectroscopy data we have argued that the positive role of Zr4+ dopant are realized through its preferential occupancy in lithium site (of hexagonal layered LNCO) to impart structural stability during charge-discharge cycling. Additionally, with repeated charge-discharge cycles probably part of Zr migrates to the electrode surface to form a passive layer to inhibit Ni3+ → Ni2+ reduction to improve the cycleability. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

There is increasing evidence that, in addition to total energy intake, the macronutrient composition of the diet may influence the development of obesity. The present study aimed to examine the impact of high dietary fat content, under both isocaloric and hypercaloric conditions, compared with a low fat diet, on adiposity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and brain appetite regulators in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to one of three diets: control (14% fat), ad lib high-fat palatable (HFD, 35% fat) or high-fat palatable restricted (HFD-R, matched to the energy intake of control) and were killed in the fasting state 11 weeks later. Body weight was increased by 28% in unrestricted HFD fed rats, with an almost tripling of caloric intake and fat mass (P < 0.001) and double the plasma triglycerides of controls. Glucose intolerance and increased insulin levels were observed. HFD-R animals calorie matched to control had double their fat mass, plasma insulin and triglycerides (P < 0.05). Only ad lib consumption of the HFD increased the hypothalamic mRNA expression of the appetite-regulating peptides, neuropeptide Y and pro-opiomelanocortin. Although restricted consumption of palatable HFD had no significant impact on hypothalamic appetite regulators or body weight, it increased adiposity and circulating triglycerides, suggesting that the proportion of dietary fat, independent of caloric intake, affects fat deposition and the metabolic profile. © Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.","Adiposity; High fat diet; Hypothalamus; Isocaloric; Neuropeptide Y","carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; glucose; insulin; leptin; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; neuropeptide Y1 receptor; neuropeptide Y2 receptor; proopiomelanocortin; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipocyte; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; caloric intake; cell size; controlled study; diet restriction; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; hormone blood level; hypothalamus; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; low fat diet; male; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; triacylglycerol blood level; Adiposity; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diet; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Fasting; Glucose; Hormones; Hypothalamus; Insulin; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Neuropeptide Y; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Messenger; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67149113429

For samples heat-treated at 773 K, however, the surface area increased by 50% and the hysteresis was lower, compared to untreated samples. These results demonstrate that volatile hydrocarbons at pore mouths are the cause of energy barriers that prevent adsorbing molecules from passing through.

The molecular basis of how females keep non-own cells alive is largely unknown, but since sperm cells are reported to be transcriptionally silenced and, therefore, limited in their ability to maintain their own function, it is likely that females actively participate in sperm maintenance. Because female contributions are likely to be of central importance for sperm survival, molecular insights into the process offer opportunities to observe mechanisms through which females manipulate sperm. Results: We used the honeybee, Apis mellifera, in which queens are highly polyandrous and able to maintain sperm viable for several years. We identified over a hundred proteins representing the major constituents of the spermathecal fluid, which females contribute to sperm in storage. We found that the gel profile of proteins from spermathecal fluid is very similar to the secretions of the spermathecal gland and concluded that the spermathecal glands are the main contributors to the spermathecal fluid proteome. A detailed analysis of the spermathecal fluid proteins indicate that they fall into a range of different functional groups, most notably enzymes of energy metabolism and antioxidant defense. A metabolic network analysis comparing the proteins detected in seminal fluid and spermathecal fluid showed a more integrated network is present in the spermathecal fluid that could facilitate long-term storage of sperm. Conclusions: We present a large-scale identification of proteins in the spermathecal fluid of honeybee queens and provide insights into the molecular regulation of female sperm storage. © 2009 Baer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"aconitate hydratase; acyltransferase; alanine aminotransferase; aldehyde dehydrogenase; arginine kinase; aspartate aminotransferase isoenzyme 2; carbonate dehydratase; citrate synthase; enolase; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; isocitrate dehydrogenase; melittin; peroxiredoxin; peroxiredoxin 2; proline dehydrogenase; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; pyruvate kinase; superoxide dismutase; thioredoxin 2; thioredoxin reductase; insect protein; proteome; antioxidant activity; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; female; honeybee; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein function; proteomics; seminal plasma; sperm preservation; animal; bee; body fluid; male; metabolism; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; sexual behavior; spermatozoon; Animalia; Apis mellifera; Animals; Bees; Body Fluids; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Female; Insect Proteins; Male; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Proteome; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Spermatozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650588722

The risk of leakage arises from the buoyancy of free-phase mobile CO2 (gas or supercritical fluid). When CO2 dissolves into formation brine, or is trapped as residual phase, buoyancy forces are negligible and the CO2 may be retained with minimal risk of leakage. Solubility trapping may therefore enable more secure storage in aquifer systems than is possible in dry systems (e.g., depleted gas fields) with comparable geological seals. A crucial question for an aquifer system is, what is the rate of dissolution? In this paper, we address that question by presenting a method for accelerating CO2 dissolution in saline aquifers by injecting brine on top of the injected CO 2. We investigate the effects of different aquifer properties and determine the rate of solubility trapping in an idealized aquifer geometry. The acceleration of dissolution by brine injection increases the rate of solubility trapping in saline aquifers and therefore increases the security of storage. We show that, without brine injection, only a small fraction (less than 8%) of the injected CO2 would be trapped by dissolving in formation brine within 200 years. For the particular cases studied, however, more than 50% of the injected CO2 dissolves in the aquifer as induced by brine injection. Since the energy cost for brine injection can be small (&lt; 20%) compared to the energy required for CO2 compression for a 5-fold increase in dissolution, such reservoir engineering techniques might be viable and practical for accelerating dissolution of CO2. The environmental benefit would be to decrease the risk of CO2 leakage at reasonably low cost. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Abandoned wells; Aquifer properties; Aquifer systems; Brine injection; Buoyancy forces; Energy cost; Environmental benefits; Gas fields; Geological storage; Low costs; Reservoir engineering; Residual phase; Saline aquifers; Secure storage; Sensitivity studies; Aquifers; Buoyancy; Effluent treatment; Gas industry; Hydrogeology; Solubility; Supercritical fluids; Ternary systems; Water injection; Dissolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649622809

X-ray diffraction analysis confirms composite formation as evidenced by: (i) intercalation of PEO8-LiClO4 into the clay channels for clay loading ≥7.5 wt.% and (ii) partial intercalation/exfoliation for a lower clay loading (≤5 wt.%). Transmission electron microscopy analysis corroborates these findings as indicated by an enhancement in clay gallery width from 6 to 9 Å for 20 wt.% clay providing evidence for intercalation at higher clay loadings. Energy dispersive X-ray dot-mapping images confirm the homogeneous distribution of clay in nanocomposites. Thermal analysis indicates a strong dependence of thermodynamic parameters, e.g., glass transition (Tg), crystalline melting (Tm), melting enthalpy, glass transition width (ΔTg), and thermal relaxation strength (ΔCp), on clay concentration. These observations agree well with changes in electrical properties on nanocomposite formation. Substantial enhancement in ambient conductivity (∼208 times) occurs in a nanocomposite film (2 wt.% clay) relative to a clay-free film. The temperature dependence of conductivity obeys Arrhenius behaviour below Tm and the VTF (Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher) relationship above Tm. The ionic transport number (∼99.9%) confirms ionic charge transport with a cation contribution (tL i+) ∼ 0.5 for 2 wt.% clay. It represents an increase by ∼65% in comparison with PEO8-LiClO4.

To deal with communication challenges in deep space, an architecture called Interplanetary Ad hoc Network (IPAN) is envisioned to establish a communication infrastructure among planets, natural and artificial satellites, and various mission elements such as spacecrafts and rovers. Some of these classes of nodes in such networks may be resource constrained in terms of storage, energy and processing power. This work proposes a probabilistic routing protocol called ""Buffer Aware Routing Protocol in Interplanetary Ad hoc Network (BARPIN)"" for routing best-effort network traffic based on the store and forward principle of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN). IPAN is modeled as the network of two kinds of nodes, one with deterministic mobility patterns having greater resources and the others having random movement patterns with limited buffer space. Further we estimate the minimum required buffer size of nodes as a function of network traffic for optimal performance of the protocol.","Buffer management; Interplanetary network; Mobile ad hoc network; Routing","Artificial satellites; Best effort networks; Buffer management; Buffer sizes; Communication infrastructure; Deep space; Delay Tolerant Networking; Interplanetary network; Limited buffers; Mobility pattern; Movement pattern; Network traffic; Optimal performance; Poor performance; Probabilistic routing; Processing power; Resource-constrained; Routing; Space communication network; Store and forward; TCP/IP protocol; Ad hoc networks; Communication satellites; Communication systems; Internet; Interplanetary spacecraft; Mobile ad hoc networks; Routing protocols; Wireless telecommunication systems; Network management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66549113301

In addition, we also use the search enable technique to eliminate the unnecessary search-line switching activity in the quiet pattern. By reducing both the search-line switching activity and average switching power, the proposed design can minimize the TCAM search-line power consumption. For a 128 × 32 TCAM, the best configuration we examined shows that when the first-level and second-level gating granularities are 16 and 8, respectively, with a 9% search performance improvement, the two-level DCG scheme can achieve 70% search-line energy reduction. © 2009 IEEE.","Forwarding table; Low-power design; Router; Search line (SL); Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Address lookup; Energy efficient; Energy reduction; Forwarding table; Low-power design; Power Consumption; Search line (SL); Search lines; Search performance; Second-level; Switching power; Ternary content addressable memories; Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM); Associative storage; Design; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Routers; Switching; Table lookup; Wireless telecommunication systems; Logic gates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650108533

Powder XRD of all samples reveals orientation along the 002 plane, confirmed by HRTEM. Nonactivated CdS gives a blue band edge emission at 455 nm in the PL spectrum getting quenched on Mn2+ addition. The PL spectra of Mn2+ added CdS exhibit first an emission at 367.7 nm, which later gets subjected to Davydov splitting with a separation of ̃0.045 eV, the singlet intensity decreasing and the doublet intensity increasing with Mn2+ input. This PL property is manifested in EPR as due to two different Mn2+ environments: (i) individual tetrahedrally coordinated uncoupled Mn2+ ions; (ii) Mn2+-Mn2+ physical dimer moieties. These are interpreted to arise from (i) the formation of a first layer of MnS on a CdS surface and (ii) the latter due to a second layer of MnS on top of the first to form MnS-MnS dimers. Mn2+ is present as metastable β-MnS. The vydov splitting is accompanied by a small energy shift. The double layer formation is confirmed by a bleaching experiment.

The reason for this is twofold. First of all, the efficiency of a diesel generator is dependent on the ratio determined by the average power divided by the peak power of the generator. The smaller this ratio is, the lower the efficiency. Furthermore, some loads can regenerate energy. In small grids, this energy is mostly not needed elsewhere and should be dissipated. A solution solving both problems previously mentioned is using an energy storage device in the system. This storage can be used for peak shaving and storing regenerated energy. This paper focuses on a generator-set with energy storage. Six different power management strategies are discussed. Calculation of the costs shows that adding an energy storage device lowers the cost for all methods.

In such applications, energy is a primary concern because sensor nodes have to regularly report data to the sink and need to continuously work for a very long time so that users may periodically request a rough overview of the monitored environment. On the other hand, users may occasionally query more in-depth data of certain areas to analyze abnormal events. These requirements motivate us to propose a multiresolution compression and query (MRCQ) framework to support in-network data compression and data storage in WSNs from both space and time domains. Our MRCQ framework can organize sensor nodes hierarchically and establish multiresolution summaries of sensing data inside the network, through spatial and temporal compressions. In the space domain, only lower resolution summaries are sent to the sink; the other higher resolution summaries are stored in the network and can be obtained via queries. In the time domain, historical data stored in sensor nodes exhibit a finer resolution for more recent data, and a coarser resolution for older data. Our methods consider the hardware limitations of sensor nodes. So, the result is expected to save sensors' energy significantly, and thus, can support long-term monitoring WSN applications. A prototyping system is developed to verify its feasibility. Simulation results also show the efficiency of MRCQ compared to existing work. © 2009 IEEE.","Coding; Data compression; Sensor data aggregation; Sensor data management; Wireless sensor networks","Coarser resolution; Coding; Data storage; Higher resolution; Historical data; Long term monitoring; Lower resolution; Multi-resolution; Prototyping; Sensing data; Sensor data aggregation; Sensor data management; Simulation result; Space and time; Space domain; Temporal coding; Temporal compressions; Time domain; WSN (wireless sensor network); Compaction; Data compression; Multiresolution analysis; Network management; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Time domain analysis; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66049156129

To fulfill the basic needs of house hold including food (cereal, pulses, oilseeds, milk, fruit, honey, meat, etc.), feed, fodder, fiber, etc. warrant an attention about Integrated Farming System (IFS). Undoubtedly, majority of the farmers are doing farming since long back but their main focus was individual components but not in a integrated manner. At the ICAR and State Agricultural Universities level, lot of efforts have been made aiming at increasing the productivity of different components of farming system like crop, dairy, livestock, poultry, piggery, goat keeping, duckery, apiculture, sericulture, horticulture, mushroom cultivation etc. individually but lacking in their integration by following farming system approach. The integration is made in such a way that product of one component should be the input for other enterprises with high degree of complimentary effects on each other. The fodder fed to the cattle produces milk. The dung, urine and litter produce farmyard manure and energy used for crops and fish pond. The siltation of fish pond is utilized as manure to crops. The farmyard manure can substitute about 25% of recommended N P and K for crops, besides improving the physical and biological properties of soil. The fish pond water can be used by gravity method while there is breakdown in electricity supply. Oilseeds provide nectar for honeybee, edible oils for human and oilseed-cake for animal feed. Integrated nutrient management can enhance the productivity of cereals by 0.5 to 1.0 t/ha. Processing of different products enhances the value addition to the extent of 25 to 50% besides generating 50-75-man days/family/year of employment. The fish pond embankment comprising 20-30% can be used for growing cucurbits and fruit trees which provide effective soil cover to checks the soil erosion and also make the system economically viable.

An additional pressure switch model is presented to visualize the hydrogen storage dynamics under a constant outflow condition. Validation of the wind hydrogen model system is evaluated according to the data from the manufacturer's data.

In this study, water spray cooling was simulated to apply to a cooling system instead of compressed air cooling in order to shorten the cycle time and reduce the cost of compressed air used in the cooling process. At first, cooling time using compressed air was predicted in order to check the state of mass production. In the following step, the ratio of removed energy by air cooling or water spray cooling among the total removed energy was found by using 1-D analysis code of the cooling system under the condition of checking the possibility of conversion from 2-D to 1-D problem. The analysis results using water spray cooling show that cycle time can be reduced because of high cooling efficiency of water spray, and cost of production caused by using compressed air can be reduced by decreasing the amount of the used compressed air. The 1-D analysis code can be widely used in the design of a thermoforming cooling system, and parameters of the thermoforming process can be modified based on the recommended data suitable for a cooling system of thermoforming. © KSME & Springer 2009.","Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Thermoforming; Water spray cooling","Air cooling; Analysis results; Competitive power; Cooling efficiency; Cooling process; Cooling time; Cost of productions; Cycle time; Mass production; Polymer products; Production cost; Water spray cooling; Water sprays; Caissons; Cold storage; Compressed air; Cooling systems; Cooling water; Cost benefit analysis; Finite difference method; Heat exchangers; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Spray steelmaking; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoforming; Water analysis; Cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349625819

It combines the advantages of carbon nanotube, together with the thermal stability of BN nanotube. The local structural unit of BN3 and NB3 linked with B-N bonds are responsible for the extra stability of BC-4N nanotube as compared with CNT. While the host carbon nanotube is metallic, the substitutional doping of B and N with a large enough concentration (33%) turns it to semiconducting. Endohedral decoration, although energetically favourable, encounters a rather high barrier height of ∼4 eV, as obtained from our nudge elastic band calculation of the minimum energy path. Exohedral Ti@BC 4N can bind up to four H2 molecules. For full Ti coverage, the system can absorb up to 56 wt% of hydrogen.

A so-called double-evaporator thermosiphon was designed, fabricated and tested using nitrogen as the working fluid under sub-atmospheric pressure conditions. The operating target temperature was approximately 65 K. To confirm the feasibility of the double-evaporator thermosiphon, experiments during the cool down process and steady state operation were extensively conducted on the double-evaporator thermosiphon (Ltot = 1075 mm, d0 = 160 mm). The double-evaporator thermosiphon worked successfully at steady state operation. The results showed that it had a maximum total temperature difference between the condenser and the evaporator of 1.3 K and a temperature difference between the two evaporators of 0.6 K at a heat flow of 87 W.

It has been employed in polymerization for producing phenol and dicumyl peroxide (DCPO). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to analyze the thermal hazard of CHP in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sulfuric acid (H2SO 4), and sodium bisulfite (Na2SO3). Thermokinetic parameters for decomposition, such as exothermic onset temperature (T 0 ), maximum temperature (T max ), and enthalpy (ΔH), were obtained from the thermal curves. Isothermal microcalorimetry (thermal activity monitor, TAM) was employed to investigate the thermal hazards during CHP storage and CHP mixed with NaOH, H2SO4, and Na2SO3 under isothermal conditions in a reactor or container. Tests by TAM indicated that from 70 to 90 °C an autocatalytic reaction was apparent in the thermal curves. According to the results from the TAM test, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was, in turn, adopted to analyze the result of concentration versus time. By the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy (E a ) and rate constant (k) were calculated. Depending on the process conditions, NaOH was one of the incompatible chemicals or catalysts for CHP. When CHP is mixed with NaOH, the T 0 is induced earlier and the reactions become more complex than for pure CHP, and the E a is lower than for pure CHP. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Cumene hydroperoxide; Differential scanning calorimetry; High performance liquid chromatography; Thermal activity monitor; Thermokinetic parameters","Arrhenius equation; Autocatalytic reactions; Chemical contamination; Cumene hydroperoxide; Dicumyl peroxide; Isothermal conditions; Isothermal microcalorimetry; Maximum temperature; Mechanical shock; Onset temperature; Process condition; Sodium bisulfite; Sodium hydroxides; Thermal activity monitor; Thermal curves; Thermal decompositions; Thermal hazards; Thermal instabilities; Thermokinetic parameters; Activation energy; Calorimeters; Chromatographic analysis; Chromatography; Differential scanning calorimetry; High pressure liquid chromatography; Liquids; Lithium batteries; Magnesium printing plates; Phenols; Pyrolysis; Rate constants; Scanning; Self assembly; Sodium; Sulfur compounds; Sulfuric acid; High performance liquid chromatography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349090368

As tempera-ture decreases and availability of insect prey declines, bats must deposit nutrient stores for hibernation. The use of torpor allows bats to limit energy expenditures resulting in a net energy gain despite decreased energy intake. However, subadult bats have lower initial fat stores than adults and may have greater difficulty depositing sufficient nutrient stores to survive the winter. We used plasma metabolite analysis to determine the fueling performance of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (LeConte, 1831)) during swarming to see if subadults compensated for the increased challenges by increased feeding throughout the swarming period. During the period of our study (August and September), adult bats gained mass, while subadults lost mass. There was, however, no difference in nutrient intake of the age groups as indicated by plasma metabo-lite concentrations. The number of bats using torpor while roosting in the hibernaculum by day increased exponentially co-incident with the onset of mating and a decrease in nutrient intake. The results are consistent with wild bats using torpor to minimize energy expenditure and compensate for lower nutrient intake. The difference in mass change for adults and subadults despite the same nutrient intake indicates that subadults incur greater energetic costs.",,"bat; bioenergetics; concentration (composition); fat reserve; hibernation; insectivore; metabolite; nutrient uptake; nutritional requirement; physiology; roosting; swarming; Hexapoda; Myotis lucifugus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650082857

Recent work, focused on lithium niobate, offers conclusive evidence that at high ion energy and moderate mass (A ≥ 15) electronic excitation may induce a giant enhancement over the damage rate due to nuclear collisions. As a consequence the material becomes amorphized at irradiation fluences far below those required for nuclear collisions alone. These results are expected to have a deep impact on many technologies including storage of radioactive waste, radiation-resistant materials for fusion reactors, lifetime of components and devices in space missions, nanopatterning in electronics and photonics, and possibly heavyion therapy in medicine. The role of electronic excitation for the generation of point defects by swift ion irradiation on LiNbO 3 has been assessed and compared to the effect of elastic nuclear collisions. For sufficiently high stopping powers S e the electronic generation rate is overwhelmingly dominant over the collision generation rate and leads to lattice amorphization at much lower irradiation fluences. as illustrated in the figure for F ions at 22 MeV. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

A chemical-wet impregnation was used to deposit different TiO2 particle densities onto the CNT surface, which was chemically oxidized by nitric acid. Transmission electron microscopy showed that each TiO2 nanoparticle has an average size of 30-50 nm. Nitrogen physisorption measurement indicated that the porosity of CNTs is partially hindered by some titania aggregations at high surface coverage. Cyclic voltammetry measurements in 1 M H2SO4 showed that (i) an obvious redox peak can be found after the introduction of TiO2 and (ii) the specific peak current is proportional to the TiO2 loading. This enhancement of electrochemical activity was attributed to the fact that TiO2 particles act as a redox site for the improvement of energy storage. According to our calculation, the electrochemical capacitance of TiO2 nanocatalysts in acid electrolyte was estimated to be 180 F/g.

Interest for plasmon resonance phenomena in photovoltaics is graving, for applications in very thin film-based devices. We discuss in this paper d-c open circuit voltages of nominally undoped mesoporous films of TiO 2 of the type used in dye-sensitized cells, under exposure to visible and ambient electromagnetic radiation. In non-sensitized films we interpret these as arising from absorption of electromagnetic energy at plasmon resonances determined by the morphology of the films and subsequent electronic diffusion through the nanocrystals of TiO 2. Typical order of magnitude of voltages V$$ = 1 mV indicates an equivalent temperature T $$ 3 K of the radiation involved, which suggests ambient microwave background as responsabiie of the effect. The order of magnitude of short-circuit current / $$ 10 -9 A is consistent with experimental data of the diffusion coefficient of the oxide. We find from these data the efficiency of the process is of typical order 1 % for nanocrystals of 10 nm typical size. Confirmation of these results are obtained by a Montecarlo simulation of transport taking into account the overall mechanisms of scattering, including phonons, imperfections and doping centres, and traps. We find that TiO 2 is a n-type self doped material, with typical doping concentrations N $$ 10 18 cm -3. The same route is applied to dye-sensitized cells under exposure to solar light for which we find a maximum efficiency of 10% in agreement with certified results on Graetzel's cells, independent of the nanocrystal size. We conclude that the enhancement of the efficiency of these electrochemical cells may be obtained by optimizing the charge current within the mesoporous films, which can be obtained by maximizing the diffusion coefficient.

The vacancies reconstruct by forming B-B and N-N bonds across the defect site, which are not as favorable as heteronuclear B-N bonds. Our total energy and structure optimization results indicate that the hydrogen cleaves these reconstructing bonds to form more stable atomic structures. The hydrogenated defects offer smaller charge densities that allow hydrogen molecule to pass through the nanotube wall for storing hydrogen inside the nanotubes. Our optimum reaction pathway search revealed that hydrogen molecules could indeed go through a hydrogenated defect site with relatively small energy barriers compared to the pristine nanotube wall. The calculated activation energies for different diameters suggest a preferential diameter range for optimum hydrogen storage in defective boron nitride nanotubes. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Boron nitride nanotubes; Density functional calculations; Hydrogen storage; Vacancy defects","Ab initio; Atomic structure; Boron nitride nanotubes; Defect engineering; Defect sites; Density functional calculations; Density functional theory calculations; Heteronuclear; Hydrogen molecule; Hydrogen storage capacities; Nanotube walls; Optimum reaction; Pristine nanotubes; Structure optimization; Total energy; Vacancy defects; Activation energy; Boron; Boron nitride; Defect density; Defects; Density functional theory; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogenation; Nanotubes; Nitrides; Structural optimization; Vacancies; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349279308

This exploratory paper investigates if open innovation practices are also applied by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on a database collected from 605 innovative SMEs in the Netherlands, we explore the incidence of and apparent trend towards open innovation. The survey furthermore focuses on the motives and perceived challenges when SMEs adopt open innovation practices. Within the survey, open innovation is measured with eight innovation practices reflecting technology exploration and exploitation in SMEs. We find that the responding SMEs engage in many open innovation practices and have increasingly adopted such practices during the past 7 years. In addition, we find no major differences between manufacturing and services industries, but medium-sized firms are on average more heavily involved in open innovation than their smaller counterparts. We furthermore find that SMEs pursue open innovation primarily for market-related motives such as meeting customer demands, or keeping up with competitors. Their most important challenges relate to organizational and cultural issues as a consequence of dealing with increased external contacts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The broadening of the Ag surface plasmon was found to be related to 5sp-5sp transitions, for which a critical wave vector of 0.2 Å-1 exists. Moreover, we provide a direct evidence of the occurrence of chemical interface damping in thin films, upon doping the Ag/Ni(1 1 1) system with K adatoms.

All calculations were performed by using Gaussian03 program. For the optimization of the clusters 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was employed. We have chosen global minimum of B6 cluster as the starting point and replaced the boron atoms one at a time, in a stepwise manner, with Li atoms. For these new structures we have searched for the stable configurations, and calculated their energies, HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, Raman and infrared data, average boron, and lithium charge distribution, and vibrational frequencies. Our results show that as the number of Li atoms increases, stability of the clusters decreases and they become more reactive. In addition to that, there are significant charge transfers from boron atoms to lithium atoms on average. The hydrogen storage capabilities of the most stable isomers of LinBm and B6 clusters have also been investigated by the same methods, and the results are compared. The Li3B3 has the highest hydrogen storage capacity among the clusters investigated in this study. Furthermore, formation of hydrogen molecules is observed in the vicinity of the clusters, some of which are attached to the Li atoms. In addition, as the number of hydrogen atoms increases, the boron atoms are separated from the other boron atoms, and they form satellite BHx (x = 3,4) clusters around the center. These are attached to the system by a bridging bond of a hydrogen or a Li atom. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Boron; Cluster; DFT; Gaussian03; H; Hydrogen energy; Hydrogen storage; Li; LiB","Cluster; DFT; Gaussian03; H; Hydrogen energy; Li; LiB; Atoms; Boron; Boron compounds; Charge transfer; Density functional theory; Hydrogen; Ion exchange; Isomers; Lithium; Probability density function; Reaction kinetics; Sulfur compounds; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349198897

The HTS SMES consists of 22 double pancake coils wound on each aluminum alloy bobbin. It is cooled by two GM cryocoolers down to around 6 K and current is charged through HTS current leads up to 275 A. Beside the heat penetration from room temperature structures, heat generation in the HTS coil is inevitable because of the joint resistances and the intrinsic property of the HTS tape such as index loss. Moreover, during the charging and discharging operation, AC loss of the HTS conductor and eddy current loss in the coil bobbin and metallic structures are generated. Therefore, the heat generation should be effectively removed by the cryocooler to ensure the stable operation of the coil. In the HTS SMES, aluminum alloy conduction plates outside the each coil are used as thermal paths to the cryocoolers.

The calculation and results are presented for the NTs diameter, length, bond length, bond angle, surface area, volume, heat of formation, interfrontier molecular energy gap, dipole moment, electric charge distribution and electrostatic potential surface. Both CdS and ZnO make nanotubes of uniform diameter across the length in armchair model only. The interfrontier energy gap in case of CdS is found to be almost identical in both the configurations (zigzag and armchair), whereas in ZnO, it is more in the armchair model as compared to the zigzag model. We have also established some linear equations that can predict binding energy and heat of formation for longer nanotubes for a given number of rings.

CSCs, obtained from human myocardial bioptic specimens and grown as cardiospheres (CSps) and cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), can engraft and partially regenerate the infarcted myocardium, as previously described. In this paper we assessed the hypothesis that exposure of CSps and CDCs to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs), tuned at Ca 2+ ion cyclotron energy resonance (Ca2+-ICR), may drive their differentiation towards a cardiac-specific phenotype.Methods and resultsA significant increase in the expression of cardiac markers was observed after 5 days of exposure to Ca2+-ICR in both human CSps and CDCs, as evidenced at transcriptional, translational, and phenotypical levels. Ca 2+ mobilization among intracellular storages was observed and confirmed by compartmentalized analysis of Ca2+ fluorescent probes.ConclusionsThese results suggest that ELF-EMFs tuned at Ca 2+-ICR could be used to drive cardiac-specific differentiation in adult cardiac progenitor cells without any pharmacological or genetic manipulation of the cells that will be used for therapeutic purposes.","Ca2+ ion cyclotron resonance; Cardiac regenerative medicine; Clinical translation protocols; ELF-EMF","calcium; calcium ion; adult; aged; amino acid sequence; article; calcium cell level; calcium mobilization; cell differentiation; cell function; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; electromagnetic field; female; heart muscle cell; human; human cell; male; phenotype; priority journal; stem cell; Adult Stem Cells; Calcium; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Electromagnetic Fields; Humans; Myocardium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66249112518

Since the last decade, the main obstacle has remained the same: energy storage. In recent years, lithium batteries have been vastly explored, but have not yet met the energy requirements for PHEVs. The main issues are: cost, cycle life, calendar life, energy density, power density, and more recently, safety. These grave issues can be easily addressed using an extremely practical approach: a suitable battery cell voltage equalizer. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the role of an appropriate cell equalizer to reach the cost breakpoint of a PHEV. Lithium rechargeable cells have been studied thoughtfully, but they do not include the cost benefit analysis of using advanced electronics to protect and equalize the cells. The paper will also introduce lithium battery degradation effects, in order to demonstrate the practicality of battery cell voltage equalizers.

In olive oil, maturation plays a key role in the kinetics of biosynthetic pathways of the secondary metabolism. One of the most relevant pathways is that catalysed by β-glucosidases, which are involved in olive oil debittering. Therefore, the knowledge of this influence can be of particular interest for olive oil industry. Objective - To monitor the profile of O-glucoside phenols and their aglycone forms in olive oil, alperujo (the semisolid residue resulting in the production of olive oil), stones, leaves and branches in order to interpret its evolution according to the sample and the period of the season (October, when olive drupes are green; December, when these drupes are green-purple; and February, when they are mostly black). Methodology - Targeted phenols were extracted by previously optimised methods assisted by auxiliary energies (i.e. ultrasound, microwaves or superheated liquids) according to the characteristics of the sample. The analysis was carried out by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole mass detector. Highly selective identification and sensitive determination of metabolites was performed in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. Statistical analysis to evaluate differences in the profile of the target compounds was based on principal compounds analysis. Results - The evolution of the analytes concentration is strongly related to the role of β-glucosidases. An explanation for this evolution in olive oil, alperujo and stones is given by relation to the industrial process for olive oil production. For leaves and small branches, the concentration was practically constant over the season, which was foreseeable because of the perennial character of olive trees. Leaves and branches were found to be highly concentrated in O-glucoside derivatives, demonstrating their capacity for phenolic compounds storage. Conclusions - Targeted metabolomic profiling has proved a useful tool to monitor O-glucoside phenolic compounds and their aglycone forms in olive materials. The profile of target compounds enables interpretion of their evolution according to the olive material and the period of the season.

Once ponding has been initiated on the soil matrix, surface runoff may be generated at rainfall intensities less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil. The amount of runoff will depend on detention storage and how efficiently the surface flow is captured by soil macropores. The efficiency of surface water removal by macropores is diminished if surface vents become clogged sealed by washed-in sediment during the runoff event. Post-event opening of surface vents by the animals that created them can remove evidence of the sealing process and so it is particularly important to examine the temporal stability of the soil surface during rainfall events. In this paper evidence of macropore clogging and post-event clearing of the surface vents is presented. A fine sandy loam passed through a 2 mm diameter sieve was packed into two boxes, each with a surface area of 0.5 m2. The boxes were irrigated at 28 mm h-1 using a low energy rainfall sprinkler. This application rate exceeded the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix. After measuring runoff and infiltration from the boxes, one box was held as a control and the second was inoculated with earthworms. After four weeks the inoculated box had a burrow density at the soil surface of 380 m-2, with an average diameter of 5 mm. Macropore sealing occurred immediately after ponding and runoff from the macroporous soil was only 10.7% less than a control with no macropores. Within 24 h after cessation of simulated rainfall the earthworms had cleared washed in material from over 95% of burrow vents. Time to matrix ponding was well predicted using hydraulic parameters characteristic of the soil matrix, indicating that matrix sealing was not significant under the experimental conditions. © 2009 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Earthworms; Macropores; Runoff; Surface sealing","Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549102508

These organizations do not have enough infrastructures and resources to implement an austere quality plan. Software inspection is a fundamental component of the software quality assurance process. Formal review methods are rigorous and their implementation is cumbersome for small and medium enterprises. In this paper, we have presented a new simplified inspection process which is easy to implement, requires fewer resource and almost no documentation. Also, people who are conducting this inspection need not be present at the same place during most stages of the inspection process. We have also compared this process with IEEE and NASA standards for software inspection and found that it meets almost 99% of both standards. While there has been much research on inspection, little attention is paid towards compliance with international standards. These results could be used as a basis for further research in software inspection and process towards aligning with international standards. This process has been successfully implemented in a CMM level 3 software development organization which is striving to accomplish higher maturity levels to establish at the international level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Ablation was carried out at the laser wavelengths of 1064, 532, 355, and 266 nm in order to scan the interaction regimes below and above the energy band gap of the material. In all cases, the mass spectra showed stoichiometric Cd n S n + and nonstoichiometric Cd n S n-1 + , Cd n S n+1 + , and Cd n S n+2 + clusters up to 4900 amu. Cluster size distributions were well represented by a log-normal function, although larger relative abundance for clusters with n=13, 16, 19, 34 was observed (magic numbers). The laser threshold fluence for cluster observation was strongly dependent on wavelength, ranging from around 16 mJ/cm2 at 266 nm to more than 300 mJ/cm2 at 532 and 1064 nm. According to the behavior of the detected species as a function of fluence, two distinct families were identified: the ""light"" family containing S 2 + and Cd + and the ""heavy"" clusterized family grouping Cd 2 + and Cd n S m + . In terms of fluence, it has been determined that the best ratio for clusterization is achieved close to the threshold of appearance of clusters at all wavelengths. At 1064, 532, and 355 nm, the production of ""heavy"" cations as a function of fluence showed a maximum, indicating the participation of competitive effects, whereas saturation is observed at 266 nm. In terms of relative production, the contribution of the ""heavy"" family to the total cation signal was significantly lower for 266 nm than for the longer wavelengths. Irradiation at 355 nm in the fluence region of 200 mJ/cm 2 has been identified as the optimum for the generation of large clusters in CdS. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Cationic clusters; Cds; Cluster observations; Cluster-size distributions; Clusterization; Competitive effects; Energy band gaps; Fluence; Large clusters; Laser thresholds; Laser wavelengths; Log-normal functions; Magic numbers; Mass spectrometric analysis; Mass spectrum; Nonstoichiometric; Relative abundances; Cadmium compounds; Data storage equipment; Laser ablation; Laser applications; Lasers; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Positive ions; Pulsed laser deposition; Wavelength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63949083323

The major focus has been given to the implementation of holonic control into the small to medium size manufacturing enterprises (SMEs). The 'virtual holonic factory' concept has been introduced, as a test bed for integration of a holonic control into a virtual factory, i.e. three-dimensional VR model of a factory in order to visually realize the effects of holonic control, when implemented to a real manufacturing system. A case study has been carried out in a medium size die-casting manufacturing plant. Through the virtual factory, a holonic control architecture for flow-line manufacturing system has been implemented for dynamic scheduling of machines in the medium size factory in order to achieve robustness necessary to handle the disturbances. The system performance and key attributes of the holonic control, such as re-configurability and robustness, have been tested and validated by using VR technology and analysis results have been presented. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The measurements were carried out using a stress-controlled rheometer with stainless steel plate-plate geometry and smooth or grooved surfaces. In the tests performed with smooth surface geometry, the slip effect was shown at low shear rates under steady and dynamic shear conditions, while the use of grooved surface geometry minimized this effect. At any given temperature, the açai pulp showed shear thinning behavior with yield stress in the steady shear measurements. However, an increase in temperature led to an increase in thixotropy and a decrease in yield stress. In addition, the açai pulp viscosity at 100 s-1 showed Arrhenius type temperature dependence, with activation energies of 4.18 and 6.21 kJ/mol for smooth and grooved surfaces, respectively. With respect to the dynamic shear measurements, the açai pulp showed weak gel-like behavior, and the storage and loss moduli decreased with increasing temperatures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of power requirements for CO2 compression could be as much as 100 kWe per tonne CO2, the minimization of energy requirements has received little attention in the literature. Although intercooling compression reduces power requirements, it introduces important cooling necessities that could be minimized. The aim of this paper is the integration of intercooling compression into the low-pressure part of a steam cycle to take advantage of the intercooling heat and analyse the energetic and economical results under different assumptions. Simulation and optimization have been performed in order to evaluate the intercooling configuration, energy requirements and the most cost-effective integration. Results have shown reduction in compression power requirement around 40% and reduction of the incremental COE around 23%. Proposed integration could be used to increase the efficiency of CO2 capture processes and, therefore, to reduce the CO2 capture cost. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal properties of the esters were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method. DSC results indicated that the melting temperatures and latent heats of the synthesized PCMs are in the range of 23-63 °C and 121-149 J/g, respectively. The thermal cycling test including 1000 cycling was conducted to determine the thermal reliability of the synthesized PCMs. The thermal conductivities of the PCMs were also increased by adding 5 wt.% EG into the esters.

The resilience strongly depends on vital infrastructure and the physical protection of people. The protection buildings provide in case of an external explosion is one of the important elements in safety assessment. Besides the aspect of protection, buildings facilitate and enable many functions, e.g., offices, data storage, -handling and -transfer, energy supply, banks, shopping malls etc. When a building is damaged, the loss of functions is directly related to the location, amount of damage and the damage level. At TNO Defence, Security and Safety methods are developed to quantify the resilience of city infrastructure systems (Weerheijm et al. 2007b). In this framework, the dynamic response, damage levels and residual bearing capacity of multi-storey RC buildings is studied. The current paper addresses the aspects of dynamic response and progressive collapse, as well as the proposed method to relate the structural damage to a volume-damage parameter, which can be linked to the loss of functionality. After a general introduction to the research programme and progressive collapse, the study of the dynamic response and damage due to blast loading for a single RC element is described. Shock tube experiments on plates are used as a reference to study the possibilities of engineering methods and an explicit finite element code to quantify the response and residual bearing capacity. Next the dynamic response and progressive collapse of a multi storey RC building is studied numerically, using a number of models. Conclusions are drawn on the ability to predict initial blast damage and progressive collapse. Finally the link between the structural damage of a building and its loss of functionality is described, which is essential input for the envisaged method to quantify the resilience of city infrastructure.","Buildings; Concrete; Damage assessment; Experiments; Explosions; Finite elements; Rate dependency; Resilience of infrastructure; Safety; Structural dynamics","Accident prevention; Bearing capacity; Bearings (machine parts); Buildings; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Data handling; Digital storage; Dynamic response; Experiments; Explosions; Explosives; Finite element method; Shock tubes; Structural dynamics; Terrorism; Damage assessments; Explicit finite element codes; Infrastructure systems; Rate dependency; Residual bearing capacities; Resilience of infrastructure; Shock tube experiment; Terrorist bomb attacks; Damage detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649525319

However the e-beam energy is high enough to cut off the polymer chain of DUV chemically amplified resist (CAR) and thus in this paper, DUV-assisted e-beam resist process is studied to increase throughput. The C/H critical dimension (CD) with e-beam exposure only increases for larger dose. E-beam dose-to-size of C/H is found to be independent on pattern density. The smallest CD resolved is 30.2 nm for 30 nm designed CD. DUV pre-exposed resist resolves the same C/H CD size with lower e-beam dose. Largest e-beam dose reduction with DUV-assistance is ∼40% for 50 and 70 nm designed CD of C/Hs.

Both CB and αCD form a 1:1 inclusion complex with SF 6. In a 0.2 M D2SO4-D2O solution, the affinity of CB for SF6 is 2.9 × 105 L mol -1 at 298 K; it is the largest value ever found for the inclusion of a neutral guest into the CB cavity. It is one order of magnitude larger than in a 0.2 M Na2SO4-D2O solution, and the role of the cation is evidenced. In D2O, the affinity of aCD for SF 6 is about 25 L mol-1. With CB, the kinetics is slow on both the 1H and 19F chemical shift time scales, while with aCD fast exchange is observed. The 19F chemical shift of SF 6 is much less sensitive to medium effects than the chemical shift of 129Xe. This might be a limitation if minute structural changes are to be investigated but, in the present study, turned out to be an advantage for determining the affinity of aCD for SF6. With CB, the 19F chemical shift of included SF6 is found to be sensitive to the nature of the cation bound at the portals. The 19F relaxation time of SF6 dissolved in deuterated solvents is dominated by the spin-rotation mechanism and is orders of magnitude shorter that the 129Xe relaxation time. It is found to be rather sensitive to the environment and was used to determine the affinity of αCD for SF 6. The detection limit of SF6 by 19F NMR is lower than the NMR detection limit of thermally polarized 129Xe by more than three orders of magnitude. It lies in the micromolar range, and SF6 concentrations of the order of 10 μM were determined by 19F NMR signal integral measurements and used to quantify the affinity of CB for SF6. Integrals, which are usually not reliable for quantitative measurements in 129Xe NMR, were proven to be highly valuable for determining the affinity of αCD for SF6 as well. Most interestingly, heteronuclear Overhauser effect measurements allow to selectively highlight the 1H of a SF6 binding site according to the 19F - 1H proximity and were used to characterize the inclusion complex formed with αCD. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Binding sites; Chemical shift; Data storage equipment; Deuterium; Dissolution; Electric circuit breakers; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Positive ions; Relaxation processes; Spin dynamics; Spin-lattice relaxation; Sulfur; Sulfur hexafluoride; Xenon; Aqueous solutions; Cucurbit[6]uril; Detection limits; Deuterated solvents; Heteronuclear; Inclusion complex; Longitudinal relaxation time; Medium effect; Micromolar range; NMR signals; Nuclear overhauser effects; Order of magnitude; Orders of magnitude; Overhauser effect; Probing system; Quantitative measurement; Shift time; Spin-rotation; Structural change; Three orders of magnitude; Nuclear magnetic resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66749171766

The middle layer consists of the soil manager, the location manager, the motion manager, the information storage, and the web server.

Between 1/4-1/3 of population in the developed countries can be classified as obese. Four major etiological factors for development of obesity are genetic determinants, environmental factors, food intake and exercise. Obesity increases the risk of the development of various pathologic conditions including: insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, endocrine problems, and certain forms of cancer. Thus, obesity is a negative determinant for longevity. In this review we provide broad overview of pathophysiology of obesity. We also discuss various available, and experimental therapeutic methods. We highlight functions of adipocytes including fat storing capacity and secretory activity resulting in numerous endocrine effects like leptin, IL-6, adiponectin, and resistin. The anti-obesity drugs are classified according to their primary action on energy balance. Major classes of these drugs are: appetite suppressants, inhibitors of fat absorption (i.e. orlistat), stimulators of thermogenesis and stimulators of fat mobilization. The appetite suppressants are further divided into noradrenergic agents, (i.e. phentermine, phendimetrazine, benzphetamine, diethylpropion), serotoninergic agents (i.e. dexfenfluramine), and mixed noradrenergic-serotoninergic agents (i.e. sibutramine). Thus, we highlight recent advances in the understanding of the central neural control of energy balance, current treatment strategies for obesity and the most promising targets for the development of novel anti-obesity drugs. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","BMI; BVT.933; Growth hormone; PRDM16; TNF","adiponectin; alpha adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; amfepramone; anorexigenic agent; antiobesity agent; benzphetamine; bvt 933; c 75; cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist; dexfenfluramine; ephedrine; fenfluramine; insulin; interleukin 6; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; phendimetrazine; phentermine; placebo; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor; recombinant ciliary neurotrophic factor; recombinant leptin; resistin; rimonabant; serotonin agonist; sibutramine; SWR 0342SA; taranabant; tetrahydrolipstatin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; anorexigenic agent; antiobesity agent; abnormal feces; adipocyte; caloric restriction; cell function; clinical trial; constipation; defecation disorder; drug contraindication; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug induced headache; drug mechanism; drug structure; drug targeting; energy balance; energy expenditure; environmental factor; euphoria; feces incontinence; flatulence; food intake; gene mutation; genetic analysis; heart palpitation; human; hypertension; injection site induration; injection site pain; insomnia; lipid storage; mood disorder; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; physical activity; protein expression; protein secretion; protein targeting; pulmonary hypertension; review; risk assessment; risk factor; side effect; signal transduction; steatorrhea; structure analysis; tachycardia; thermogenesis; valvular heart disease; white adipose tissue; xerostomia; animal; obesity; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Appetite Depressants; Humans; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63449140956

Although wavelength, polarization and spatial dimensions have all been exploited for multiplexing, these approaches have never been integrated into a single technique that could ultimately increase the information capacity by orders of magnitude. The major hurdle is the lack of a suitable recording medium that is extremely selective in the domains of wavelength and polarization and in the three spatial domains, so as to provide orthogonality in all five dimensions. Here we show true five-dimensional optical recording by exploiting the unique properties of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of gold nanorods. The longitudinal SPR exhibits an excellent wavelength and polarization sensitivity, whereas the distinct energy threshold required for the photothermal recording mechanism provides the axial selectivity. The recordings were detected using longitudinal SPR-mediated two-photon luminescence, which we demonstrate to possess an enhanced wavelength and angular selectivity compared to conventional linear detection mechanisms. Combined with the high cross-section of two-photon luminescence, this enabled non-destructive, cros stalk-free readout. This technique can be immediately applied to optical patterning, encryption and data storage, where higher data densities are pursued. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"gold; nanorod; data acquisition; gold; luminescence; polarization; article; energy; linear system; longitudinal study; optical density; optically stimulated luminescence; polarization; priority journal; spectral sensitivity; surface plasmon resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66249132688

The calculated difference in energy of the addition and abstraction reactions indicates that any Al12X-based hydrogen storage technology that involves predissociation of H2 will be limited by the competing processes. We have also discovered that while there is a modest barrier for dissociation of H2 on a single Al12Mg cluster to give the dihydride, the process occurs spontaneously between two closely spaced Al12Mg clusters, resulting in the formation of two Al12MgH species. Doping of the cluster with an electropositive atom (Mg) enables the transfer of electron density to the Al cage, which enhances H2 dissociation.

The principles of process system engineering along with the concept of design space approach for system design have been employed to optimize a battery integrated diesel generator system. The design space is the set of all feasible design options, generated using time series simulation of the entire system. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to appropriately size a battery integrated diesel generator system incorporating uncertainty associated with the demand. Chance constrained programming approach is combined with the design space approach to incorporate the demand uncertainty at the design stage. With a known distribution of the demand, the proposed methodology helps in identifying a sizing curve on the diesel generator rating versus storage capacity diagram for a specified reliability level. The system reliability values given by the proposed approach are validated using sequential Monte Carlo simulation approach through illustrative examples. Sets of sizing curves may be generated for different confidence levels as required by the designer. However, under the simplified assumption of a constant coefficient of variation for the demand, these sizing curves can be combined into a single curve.

Unlike the conventional works that require special equipments or assumptions on the contents of books or complicated image acquisition steps, we estimate the unfolded book or document surface from the corresponding points between two images. For this purpose, the surface and camera matrices are estimated using structure reconstruction, 3-D projection analysis, and random sample consensus-based curve fitting with the cylindrical surface model. Because we do not need any assumption on the contents of books, the proposed method can be applied not only to optical character recognition (OCR), but also to the high-quality digitization of pictures in documents. In addition to the dewarping for a structurally better image, image mosaic is also performed for further improving the visual quality. By finding better parts of images (with less out of focus blur and/or without specular reflections) from either of views, we compose a better image by stitching and blending them. These processes are formulated as energy minimization problems that can be solved using a graph cut method. Experiments on many kinds of book or document images show that the proposed algorithm robustly works and yields visually pleasing results. Also, the OCR rate of the resulting image is comparable to that of document images from a flatbed scanner. © 2009 IEEE.","Document dewarping; Document image stitching; Robust surface estimation; Specular reflection removal","Cylindrical surface; Dewarping; Document dewarping; Document image stitching; Document images; Energy minimization problem; Flatbed scanners; Graph cut; High quality; Image mosaic; Out-of-focus blur; Projection analysis; Random sample consensus; Robust surface estimation; Specular reflection removal; Specular reflections; Structure reconstruction; Visual qualities; Blending; Cameras; Curve fitting; Digital image storage; Image acquisition; Optical character recognition; Reflection; Three dimensional",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649886163

Adenine serves as an effective matrix for the stabilization of Ag/CdS through interaction of N(1), N(3) and-NH2 with Ag. The amount of Ag in the nanohybrid is observed to influence the organization of the Ag and CdS phase in the composite and also modifies the nature of electronic transition in CdS. For the nanohybrid containing a molar ratio of 0.1 of Ag/ CdS, CdS nanoparticles (2.5nm) surround the Ag (6.5nm) core. The excitation of these particles by 340nm light, where the absorption due to the Ag phase in the nanohybrid is negligibly small, results in the enhancement of fluorescence by a factor of 7 compared to that of bare CdS. For the particles containing a molar ratio of Ag/CdS of unity, bigger clusters (14nm) are produced causing the quenching of emission of CdS. In time resolved emission spectroscopy the spectral shift from 415nm (3.0eV) to 550nm (2.26eV) monitored over a period of 1-220ns is understood by the relaxation of charge within the surface states of varied energy from 180 to 370eV. The observed changes in fluorescence behavior in terms of intensity, lifetime and spectral shift are understood in terms of electronic interaction between Ag and CdS phases.

The highest amount of H2 stored was 2.45 wt% in an ACF with a burn-off of 51% at 0.12 MPa. The measured isotherms were analyzed using an equilibrium model derived by analogy with a multiple-site Langmuir-type adsorption model. The different equilibria correspond to adsorption in pores of different sizes. The experimental results fitted a model with two different adsorption sites satisfactorily, allowing such sites to be related to the microporous structure of the ACFs. Thus, a high-energy adsorbent-adsorbate interaction site, associated with very small micropores, accessible only to very small molecules such as H2, and another lower-energy site associated with larger pores can be proposed. The model also predicts the adsorption behavior under equilibrium conditions at higher pressures, allowing the maximum adsorption capacity of the ACFs to be determined. The results show that the ACFs adsorb most of the H2 molecules at low equilibrium pressures, and that they become almost saturated at pressures around 1.0 MPa.

Our previous work demonstrated for the first time the possibility to crystallize hydrogen clathrate hydrate in structure sH with 1,1- dimethylcyclohexane, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and methylcyclohexane as promoters. In this work, phase equilibrium data (p, T data) are reported for hydrogen clathrate hydrate systems with liquid hydrocarbon promoters, all of them forming the structure sH. Experiments were carried out at pressures up to 100.0 MPa. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Clathrate hydrate; Equilibrium measurements; Liquid hydrocarbons; Mass fraction; Methyl tert butyl ether; Methylcyclohexane; New energy application; Phase equilibrium data; Storage capacity; Technological challenges; Transport sectors; Ethers; Hydrates; Hydration; Hydrogen; Organic compounds; Phase equilibria; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650115238

However, it is now recognized that this tissue is also an active endocrine organ that secretes a variety of signaling molecules termed adipokines. These adipokines have diverse autocrine-, paracrine-, and endocrine-like actions that impact a variety of biological and physiological processes, including adipocyte differentiation, local and systemic inflammation, overall energy balance, blood pressure, and glucose and lipid metabolism. Given the regulatory influence on these critical functions, dysregulation of adipokine secretion is believed to be a major contributor to obesity-related disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Chemerin is a small, secreted protein that has been reported to serve as a chemoattractant for cells of the immune system such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells that express the cognate receptor chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1). Using adenoviral- delivered, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to suppress chemerin or CMKLR1 expression, we have demonstrated a novel role for chemerin/CMKLR1 signaling as a positive regulator of adipocyte differentiation and metabolic function in the 3T3-L1 model of adipogenesis. This experimental approach provides an efficient and powerful means to characterize the functional roles of genes known to be involved in adipocyte formation and metabolism as well as to identify novel roles for genes in this model and/or other cells. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The 6F-2TPA PI films exhibit versatile memory characteristics that depend on the film thickness. All the PI films are initially present in the OFF state. The PI films with a thickness of &gt;15 to &lt;100nm exhibit excellent write-once-read-many-times (WORM) (i.e.fuse-type) memory characteristics with and without polarity depending on the thickness. The WORM memory devices are electrically stable, even in air ambient, for a very long time. The devices' ON/OFF current ratio is high, up to 1010. Therefore, these WORM memory devices can provide an efficient, low-cost means of permanent data storage. On the other hand, the 100nm thick PI films exhibit excellent dynamic random access memory (DRAM) characteristics with polarity. The ON/OFF current ratio of the DRAM devices is as high as 10 11. The observed electrical switching behaviors were found to be governed by trap-limited space-charge-limited conduction and local filament formation and further dependent on the differences between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of the PI film and the work functions of the top and bottom electrodes as well as the PI film thickness. In summary, the excellent memory properties of 6F-2TPA PI make it a promising candidate material for the low-cost mass production of high density and very stable digital nonvolatile WORM and volatile DRAM memory devices. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air ambient; Bottom electrodes; Candidate materials; Data storages; Digital memories; DRAM devices; Dram memories; Dynamic random access memories; Electrical switching; Filament formations; Hexafluoroisopropylidene; High densities; Highest occupied molecular orbitals; Limited spaces; Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels; Mass productions; Memory devices; Nanoscale thin films; Nonvolatile; On/off current ratios; Pi films; Programmable memories; Switching characteristics; Write-once-read-many; Digital devices; Dynamic random access storage; Electron energy levels; Luminescence of organic solids; Magnetic films; Molecular beam epitaxy; Molecular modeling; Molecular orbitals; Polyimides; Polymers; Switching functions; Data storage equipment; nanomaterial; polyimide; ambient air; article; chemical structure; conductance; data storage device; electric potential; electricity; electrode; film; information processing; memory; molecular interaction; polarization; priority journal; semiconductor; thermostability; thickness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65149093194

Infrared reflection spectroscopic (IRRS) studies have been employed to establish its low phonon energy. Ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption and photoluminescence upconversion properties with special emphasis on the spectrochemistry of the 15K2O-15B2O3-70Sb2O 3 (mol%) glass have been studied doping with different concentrations (0.1-1.0 wt%) of Nd2O3. UV-vis-NIR absorption band positions have been justified with quantitative calculation of nephelauxetic parameter and covalent bonding characteristics of the host. NIR to visible upconversion has been investigated by exciting at 805 nm at room temperature. Two upconverted bands originating from the 4G7/2 →4I9/2 and 4G7/2 →4I13/2 transitions are found to be centered at 540 nm (green, medium) and 650 nm (red, strong), respectively. These bands have been explained from the evaluation of the absorption and excitation spectra. The upconversion processes have been explained by the excited state absorption (ESA), energy transfer (ET), cooperative energy transfer (CET) and cross-relaxation (CR) mechanisms involving population of the metastable (storage) energy level (4G7/2) by effects of multiphonon deexcitation and thermal population. It is evident from the IRRS study that the upconversion phenomena are expedited by the low multiphonon relaxation rate in antimony glasses owing to their low phonon energy (602 cm-1, the main and highest intensity Sb-O-Sb stretching band) which is very close to that of fluoride glasses (500-600 cm-1). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These clusters were observed to trap alkali metals and halogens because the ionization energies (IE) of alkali metals are very similar to the electron affinities (EA) of halogens. This opens the possibility of forming molecular solids composed of these fullerene building blocks because the energy released due to the difference between the IE and EA would be very small. Herein we have focused on assembling bare Zn12S12 and endohedral X@Zn 12S12-Y@Zn12S12 dimers (X = Na, K.; Y = Cl, Br) by considering the square-faces-square orientation of every two adjacent clusters, which leads to a fcc cubic crystal structure in the solid. The structures were fully optimized in all cases, and their thermal stability was confirmed by ab initio thermal molecular dynamics calculations. The optimum lattice parameter of the solids was found to be around 13.8 Å, which corresponds to distances of about 2.5 Å between monomers, which is typical of covalent Zn-S bonds. The resulting solids are nanopo-rous materials similar to B12N12.

This work is a direct extension of one recent article where the restraint of constant temperature for HTM in each storage tank is relaxed to magnify the heat recovery potential. The design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) based on proposed superstructures. A novel iterative solution strategy for setting the variable temperatures of HTM in storage is provided by linking the network optimization tool (a GAMS program) and the streams temperature simulation software (a MATLAB program).

The improvement of the storage efficiency results in a higher performance of the whole system, and thermal stratification is commonly used for this purpose. On the other hand, in applications with small temperature changes, phase change materials (PCMs) provide high energy density since the latent heat is much larger than the sensible heat. This is the case of stratified hot water tanks, where the temperature change in the top layer is small as it is held close to the usage temperature. The benefits of using PCMs in a water tank, in terms of energy torage density, have been demonstrated before. The time with available hot water is increased because of the energy stored in the PCMs. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the use of PCMs in the upper part of a water tank holds or improves the benefit of the stratification phenomenon. Two tanks with the same dimensions were compared during charging and discharging processes.

The system represents an alternative solution with respect to nowadays battery packs for the storage of electrical energy with large specific power. The device may find suitable application on board of road vehicles fed by liquid hydrogen with hybrid power-train (internal combustion engine and electric motor/generation), where a cryogenic tank is already present and no additional cryogenic costs are needed. The housing of the SMES inside the tank used for fuel storage, allows the exploitation of the thermal power required for the continuous evaporation of fuel for feeding the engine to remove the AC losses from the magnet, thus avoiding the need of externally supplied cooling power. In this paper both the design of the magnet and its operation in combination with electronic converter and electric motor/generator during charge/discharge cycles are discussed. Moreover the ongoing activity for the development of a laboratory-scale prototype using MgB2 superconductor is presented. © 2009 IEEE.","Cryogenic fuels; Fuel cells; Hybrid vehicles; Superconducting magnetic energy storage","AC generator motors; Cryogenics; Electric energy storage; Electric motors; Energy storage; Engines; Fuel cells; Fuel tanks; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Liquefied gases; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Magnetic storage; Magnets; Superconducting magnets; Tanks (containers); Traction motors; Vehicles; Alternative solutions; Charge/discharge cycle; Cryogenic fuels; Electrical energy; Electronic converters; Energy storage systems; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Vehicle applications; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68649120634

However, like many technology innovations, there is a social risk to the acceptance of CCS. This article presents the findings of an engagement process using facilitated workshops conducted in two communities in rural Queensland, Australia, where a demonstration project for IGCC with CCS has been announced. The findings demonstrate that workshop participants were concerned about climate change and wanted leadership from government and industry to address the issue. After the workshops, participants reported increased knowledge and more positive attitudes towards CCS, expressing support for the demonstration project to continue in their local area.

The hydrogen storage canister comprises a cylindrical metal bed and a void of expansion volume atop the metal. The expansion volume is considered as a domain of pure hydrogen gas. The gas motion in the metal hydride bed is treated as porous medium flow. Concepts of mass and energy conservation are incorporated in the model to depict the thermally coupled hydrogen absorption and desorption reactions. Simulation results show the expansion volume reduces the reaction rates by increasing thermal resistance to the heat transfer from the outside cooling/heating bath. The assumption usually adopted in simulating heat transfer in a metal hydride tank that heat convection in the reaction bed may be ignored is not valid when expansion volume is used because heat convection dominates the heat transfer through the expansion volume as well as the metal bed. The details of the thermal flow pattern are demonstrated. It is found that, due to the action of thermal buoyancy, circulations are likely to happen in the expansion volume. The hydrogen gas accordingly, instead of going directly between the inlet/outlet and the metal bed, tends to move with the circulation along the boundary of the expansion volume. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Heat and mass transfer; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Simulation model","Dehydriding; Desorption process; Desorption reactions; Expansion volumes; Fluid behaviors; Gas motions; Heat and mass transfer; Hydriding; Hydrogen absorptions; Hydrogen gas; Mass and energy conservations; Metal hydride tanks; Metal hydrides; Porous medium flows; Simulation model; Simulation results; Thermal buoyancies; Thermal resistances; Desorption; Energy conservation; Energy management; Expansion; Flow patterns; Gas absorption; Heat convection; Heat exchangers; Heat resistance; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Lithium batteries; Mass transfer; Metals; Porous materials; Reaction rates; Thermal expansion; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349277054

Sign consistency between local functions is exploited to infer the globally consistent orientation. To precisely model the features, we employ the affinity propagation clustering algorithm to identify the local surface patches composing the features by considering orientation consistency between data points. Sharp features can then be accurately reconstructed by performing piecewise smooth surface fitting.

The materials used were different types of commercial carbons: carbon fibers, carbon cloths, nanotubes, superactivated carbons, and synthetic carbons (carbon nanospheres and carbon xerogels). Their textural properties (i.e., surface area, pore size distribution, etc.) were related to their hydrogen adsorption capacities. These H2 storage capacities were evaluated by various methods (i.e., volumetric and gravimetric) at different temperatures and pressures. The differences between both methods at various operating conditions were evaluated and related to the textural properties of the carbon-based adsorbents. The results showed that temperature has a greater influence on the storage capacity of carbons than pressure. Furthermore, hydrogen storage capacity seems to be proportional to surface area, especially at 77 K. The micropore size distribution and the presence of narrow micropores also notably influence the H2 storage capacity of carbons. In contrast, morphological or structural characteristics have no influence on gravimetric storage capacity. If synthetic materials are used, the textural properties of carbon materials can be tailored for hydrogen storage. However, a larger pore volume would be needed in order to increase storage capacity. It seems very difficult approach to attain the DOE and EU targets only by physical adsorption on carbon materials. Chemical modification of carbons would seem to be a promising alternative approach in order to increase the capacities. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Adsorbents; Carbon materials; H2 storage","Alternative approaches; Carbon cloths; Carbon materials; Carbon nanospheres; Carbon xerogels; Carbon-based adsorbents; H2 storage; Hydrogen adsorption capacities; Hydrogen storage capacities; Micro-pores; Micropore-size distributions; Operating conditions; Physical adsorptions; Pore volumes; Storage capacities; Structural characteristics; Super-activated carbons; Surface areas; Synthetic carbons; Synthetic materials; Textural properties; Adsorbents; Carbon fibers; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical modification; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Materials properties; Microporosity; Pore size; Size distribution; Storage (materials); Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349228520

For areas covered with forest, the presence of decomposed or undecomposed forest litier poses a real problem for the monitoring of volumetric water content. Traditional methods such as time domain refl ectometry (TDR) are diffi cult to apply, as the inconsistence of the porous material otien leads to density modifi cations close to the probe wires. The aim of this work was to develop a TDR probe that can be used for loose materials while ensuring optimum working conditions in terms of ease of insertion into the porous medium, contact with the surrounding porous medium, and homogeneity and confi nement of electrical energy storage. The performance of the new probe was tested on three porous media: a sandy soil and decomposed and undecomposed litier taken from four diff erent sources of forest material. A classical TDR three-rod probe and a coaxial probe were used for comparison. Permitivity data were analyzed with parameters related to either mineral or organic media and two physically based models. The comparison of the results necessary for the evaluation of the probe performance was performed using the criterion of mean absolute error and the associated standard deviation, calculated on the diff erence between the water content values measured by the TDR probes and those determined by gravimetric observations. For the sandy soil, the new probe gave results comparable to those of the coaxial probe but more accurate than those obtained with the three-rod probe. For the forest litier samples, the new probe systematically gave the most accurate results. Once calibrated, the new probe allows measuring volumetric water content in forest litier within an error range of 0.02 m 3/m3. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"calibration; electrical power; error analysis; forest cover; forest floor; gravimetry; litter; performance assessment; permittivity; porous medium; probe; sandy soil; time domain reflectometry; water content; water management; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67149097944

The increasing interest in the recovery of historic data and the availability of new hardware resources is leading to projects to digitize photographic archives of astronomical observations. In addition to preservation, solar archives are digitized because the observations stored in such archives have the potential of providing unique information about solar magnetism, which can improve knowledge about long-term solar changes.Aims. The solar tower of the Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory produced synoptic observations of the solar atmosphere from 1926 to 1974. The photographic archive contains about 13 000 plates of full-disk Ca II K and Hα spectroheliograms acquired during about 5000 observing days. The program for the digitization and distribution of the images of this archive was carried out at the Rome Astronomical Observatory and is now complete.Methods. Nearly 13 000 plates were scanned with a commercial device and stored on DVD, as well as in a database accessible online. Image processing was developed for the reduction of the data and their photographic calibration.Results. The obtained digital archive provides the astronomical community with the Arcetri historical solar observations and with measurements of solar features identified in such observations. As an example, we show some preliminary results concerning the temporal variability of facular regions identified in the time-series of Ca II K observations.Conclusions. Existing programs studying solar activity and variability, as well as new scientific projects, will benefit from the Arcetri digital archive, since it extends the temporal baseline of digital full-disk solar observations, and it provides data for the inter-calibration of results obtained from measurements performed in similar observations. © 2009 ESO.","Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous; Sun: activity; Sun: chromosphere; Sun: faculae, plages; Techniques: image processing","Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous; Sun: activity; Sun: chromosphere; Sun: faculae, plages; Techniques: image processing; Astrophysics; Buildings; Calcium; Digital image storage; Disks (structural components); Image processing; Imaging systems; Observatories; Solar energy; Sun; Astronomical satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66349085366

Since mobile devices have limited CPU power, dedicated hardware is essential to provide sufficient virus detection performance. A TCAM-based virus-detection unit provides high throughput, but also challenges for low power and low cost. In this paper, an adaptively dividable dual-port BiTCAM (unifying binary and ternary CAMs) is proposed to achieve a high-throughput, low-power, and low-cost virus-detection processor for mobile devices. The proposed dual-port BiTCAM is realized with the dual-port AND-type match-line scheme which is composed of dual-port dynamic AND gates. The dual-port designs reduce power consumption and increase storage efficiency due to shared storage spaces. In addition, the dividable BiTCAM provides high flexibility for regularly updating the virus-database. The BiTCAM achieves a 48% power reduction and a 40% transistor count reduction compared with the design using a conventional single-port TCAM. The implemented 0.13 μ m processor performs up to 3 Gbps virus detection with an energy consumption of 0.44 fJ/pattern-byte/scan at peak throughput. © 2006 IEEE.","Associative memories; ClamAV; Content-addressable memory; Dual-port match line; High speed; Low power; Pattern matching; PF-CDPD; Pseudo-footless; Snort; Virus detection","Associative memories; ClamAV; Content-addressable memory; Dual-port match line; High speed; Low power; PF-CDPD; Pseudo-footless; Snort; Virus detection; Associative processing; Dynamic random access storage; Internet; Logic gates; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Network security; Pattern matching; Portable equipment; Wireless networks; Computer viruses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66149111778

A sensible performance degradation that reduced the overall storage capacity of about 50% has been noticed after 20 cycles, presumably due to local powder heating, fragmentation and subsequent compaction.

However, an appropriate intermediate step before wide hydrogen introduction will be blending conventional fuels such as natural gas, oil or diesel with hydrogen and follow up combustion through conventional means. Due to changes in the combustion and flame characteristics of the system additional research is needed to access the limits and the impact of the fuel mix on the combustion systems performance. The hybrid system consists of a 5 kWel electrolyzer and a residential 15 kWth high efficiency gas fired furnace. The electrolyzer was integrated with the furnace gas supply and setup to replace 5-25% of the furnace natural gas flow with hydrogen. A mean for proper mixing of hydrogen with natural gas was provided and a control system for safe system operation was developed. Prior to the start of the field trial the hybrid system was investigated in laboratory environment. It was subjected to a variety of steady state and cycling conditions and a detailed performance and optimization analysis was performed with a range of hydrogen/natural gas mixtures. The optimized system was then installed at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technologies (CCHT) Experimental research house.

However, the potential for impact of hydrogen technologies in the transition to a hydrogen economy will vary across the different industrial sectors depending on the source and usage of current energy sources. This paper presents a broad examination of hydrogen economy opportunities and impacts for the minerals industry in Australia. The usage of hydrogen and fuel cell technology in the mining and metals production sub-sectors has differing potential as metallurgical and heavy-duty mobile energy consumption may not be feasibly substituted with hydrogen. This examination indicates a potential of 12-13% reduction in primary energy usage by the minerals industry, with a resulting reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 9-12% without carbon capture and storage (CCS), or 53-60% reduction with CCS. Other impacts on the industry may include an increased demand for minerals to produce fuel cells, catalysts and infrastructure.

A traditional questionnaire was used simultaneously (n = 327) to study uninformed evaluations of these technologies. The results showed that the Dutch public is mostly unaware of CCS and has little knowledge about how current energy use causes global warming. Uninformed respondents are still inclined to give their opinion however, which results in unpredictive, easily changeable opinions. ICQ respondents who processed information on attributes of CCS options were likely to base their option evaluations on this information, though not entirely.

The results show that storability of switchgrass is remarkable, irrespective of harvest time (summer or post-frost harvest) and bale type (rectangular, soft- or hard-core round bales). Bale weight significantly decreased over time, yet it was almost entirely attributed to a decline in moisture content. Microbial processes appeared trivial and this was corroborated by temperature inset and pH trends. In contrast, significant biomass losses were ascertained during the harvest, which accounted from 35% to 45% of potential harvestable biomass. Biomass not picked-up by the baler machine was up to 17%, while the uncut biomass due to the mower swinging averaged 29%, and it was also significantly affected by the field slope. Because of the lower ash content of basal stems, the uncut biomass penalized biofuel quality and quantity, at the same time. Potential harvestable biomass was similar to that achieved with hand-harvested plots thus revealing that the two considered sources of biomass loss (not recovered and uncut biomass) are mostly responsible of the discrepancy between plot and field yields. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, it can make the ICE operate in its optimal state of maximum efficiency; and thus, it can be considered an effective solution to improve greatly the exhaust emissions and increase the overall energy efficiency of the HPPS. However, in this system, the flow energy merger of both high pressure compressed air flow and high temperature exhaust gas flow of the ICE greatly depends on the merging capability of the energy merger pipe. If the compressed air pressure (Pair) at the air inlet is too high, smooth transmission and mixture of the exhaust gas flow are prevented, which will interfere with the operation condition of the ICE. This shortcoming is mostly omitted in the previous studies. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the level of Pair and the contraction of cross-section area (CSA) at the merging position on the flow energy merger and determine their optimum adjustments for a better merging process by using computation fluid dynamics (CFD). In addition, the CFD model was validated on the basis of the experimental data, including the temperature and static pressure of the merger flow at the outlet of the energy merger pipe. It was found that the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data. The simulation results show that exhaust gas recycling efficiency and merger flow energy are significantly dependent on the optimum adjustment of the CSA for changes in Pair. Under these optimum adjustments, the exhaust gas recycling efficiency can reach about 83%. These results will be valuable bases to research and design the energy merger pipe of the HPPS. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy merger pipe; Exhaust gas energy; Flow energy merger; Hybrid pneumatic power system","Aerodynamics; Atmospheric pressure; Caissons; Chemical shift; Cold storage; Compressed air; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Exhaust gases; Flow of gases; Flow simulation; Fluid dynamics; Ice; Internal combustion engines; Magnetic anisotropy; Mergers and acquisitions; Pipe; Pneumatic equipment; Pneumatics; Power transmission; Pressure vessels; Recycling; Air compressors; Air inlets; Cfd models; Cross-section areas; Effective solutions; Energy merger pipe; Exhaust emissions; Exhaust gas energy; Exhaust gas flows; Exhaust gas recycling; Experimental datum; Flow energy merger; High efficiencies; High pressures; High temperatures; Hybrid pneumatic power system; Internal combustions; Maximum efficiencies; Mechanical energies; Merging process; Operation conditions; Optimal state; Optimum adjustments; Overall energy efficiencies; Simulation results; Static pressures; Merging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62649104150

The maximum mass fraction of PA retained in EG was found as 80 wt% without the leakage of PA in melted state even when it is heated over the melting point of PA. Therefore, the PA/EG (80/20 w/w%) composite was characterized as form-stable PCM. From differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of the form-stable PCM were measured as 60.88 and 60.81 °C and 148.36 and 149.66 J/g, respectively. Thermal cycling test showed that the composite PCM has good thermal reliability although it was subjected to 3000 melting/freezing cycles. Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic investigation indicated that it has good chemical stability after thermal cycling. Thermal conductivities of PA/EG composites including different mass fractions of EG (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) were also measured. Thermal conductivity of form-stable PA/EG (80/20 w/w%) composite (0.60 W/mK) was found to be 2.5 times higher than that of pure PA (0.17 W/mK). Moreover, the increase in thermal conductivity of PA was confirmed by comparison of the melting and freezing times of pure PA with that of form-stable composite. Based on all results, it was concluded that the form-stable PA/EG (80/20 w/w%) has considerable latent heat energy storage potential because of its good thermal properties, thermal and chemical reliability and thermal conductivity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A new texture descriptor based on the texton theory is introduced to efficiently represent texture attributes of the given image. Then, the segmentation is formulated in terms of energy minimization with graph cuts, where color and texton features are modelled with a multivariate finite mixture model with an unknown number of components. Contrary to previous supervised graph cut approaches, our method finds minimum cuts using split moves in an unsupervised way. The segmentation result, including the number of segments, is determined during the split moves without user interaction. Thus, our method is called unsupervised graph cuts.

This can be achieved by cooling the module and reducing the heat stored inside the PV cells during operation. In this paper, long-term performance modeling of a proposed solar-water pumping system is carried out. The system, which is used for irrigation purposes, consists of a PV module cooled by water, a submersible water pump, and a water storage tank. Cooling of the PV panel is achieved by introducing water trickling configuration on the upper surface of the panel. An experimental rig is developed to investigate and evaluate PV module performance with the proposed cooling technique. The experimental results indicated that due to the heat loss by convection between water and the PV panel's upper surface, an increase of about 15% in system output is achieved at peak radiation conditions. Long-term performance of the system is estimated by integrating test results in a commercial transient simulation package using site radiation and ambient temperature data. The simulation results of the system's annual performance indicated that an increase of 5% in delivered energy from the PV module can be achieved during dry and warm seasons.",,"Cooling; Energy conversion; Experiments; Military operations; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Solar system; Ambient temperatures; Cooling techniques; Improving efficiencies; Irrigation purposes; Operating temperatures; Performance modeling; PhotoVoltaic modules; Pv modules; PV panels; Radiation conditions; Simulation results; System outputs; Test results; Thermal degradations; Transient simulations; Upper surfaces; Warm seasons; Water cooling; Water pumping systems; Water pumps; Water storage tanks; Cooling water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149259951

It avoids flooding the network with path search and update messages in order to conserve bandwidth and energy by using only parent-child links for packet forwarding. The major drawback of TR is the increased hop-counts as compared with more sophisticated path search protocols. We propose an enhanced tree routing (ETR) strategy for sensor networks which have structured node address assignment schemes. In addition to the parent-child links, ETR also uses links to other one-hop neighbours if it is decided that this will lead to a shorter path. It is shown that such a decision can be made with minimum storage and computing cost by utilizing the address structure. Detailed algorithms for applying ETR to ZigBee networks are also presented. Simulation results reveal that ETR not only outperforms TR in terms of hop-counts, but also is more energy-efficient than TR. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The graft length is same for different times of polymerization but graft density increases with increasing polymerization time. Four graft copolymers are prepared and depending on the time of conversion they are designated as PD-6, PD-12, PD-18, and PD-24, the number indicates time (h) of polymerization. A maximum of 36% (w/w) conversion with respect to monomer is achieved in the PD-24 sample. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and polymerization kinetics study conclude the ATRP nature of the polymerization. The graft copolymer shows induced solubility in water and the effective particle diameter in aqueous medium decreases from PD-6 to PD-24 samples. The enthalpy of fusion values are same in graft copolymers with more than 50% reduction and the melting points reduce by 5-6 °C than that of pure PVDF. WAXS patterns of graft copolymers indicate the formation of mixture of α and β phases in dimethyl formamide cast films and also suggest the existence of self-organized short-range ordering from supramolecular interaction between the &gt;C=O group and the nitrogen atom of the substituted amino group of the grafting component as is evident from the FTIR study. The absence of any lamellar peak than that of pure PVDF in the SAXS data suggests the formation of fringed micelle crystals in the graft copolymers. Storage modulus of graft copolymers decreases more than that of PVDF due to a decrease in crystallinity. The tensile stress-strain experiment of the PD samples indicates 700-750% elongation, which is 45 times higher than that of PVDF. The toughness increases by 1970% in the graft copolymers over that of pure PVDF, and the gluing property is significantly larger. The graft copolymers produce and stabilize gold nanoparticles in aqueous medium; produce amphiphilic membranes and on its modification to trimethyl ammonium ion it shows 2.2 × 10-6 S/cm dc-conductivity.

Configurable - multimode - memories are a promising technology to deal with these problems, but they also introduce new issues that need to be solved.

The BE strategy relies on creating a physiological stress such as nutrient-starvation or high salinity to channel metabolic fluxes to lipid accumulation. The GE strategy exploits our understanding to the lipid metabolic pathway, especially the rate-limiting enzymes, to create a channelling of metabolites to lipid biosynthesis by overexpressing one or more key enzymes in recombinant microalgal strains. The TFE strategy is an emerging technology aiming at enhancing the production of a particular metabolite by means of overexpressing TFs regulating the metabolic pathways involved in the accumulation of target metabolites. Currently, BE approaches are the most established in microalgal lipid production. The TFE is a very promising strategy because it may avoid the inhibitive effects of the BE approaches and the limitation of ""secondary bottlenecks"" as commonly observed in the GE approaches. However, it is still a novel concept to be investigated systematically. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

During feeding conditions, excessive glucose is converted into a preferred storage form of energy sources as triacylglycerol in liver via a collective metabolic pathway termed lipogenesis. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c is a master regulator for this process by activating number of enzyme genes, such as Fasn or Acaca, that are involved in this pathway at the transcriptional level. Here we show that the salt-inducible kinase (SIK) family of proteins regulates the hepatic lipogenesis by modulating SREBP-1c activity. Overexpression of SIK1 inhibits hepatic expression of lipogenic genes, such as Fasn, whereas knockdown of SIK1 in liver greatly enhances their expression. Regulation of the Fasn gene by SIK kinases is mediated at the level of transcription via phosphorylation and inactivation of nuclear SREBP-1c. Among candidate sites for SIK-dependent regulation of SREBP-1c, the serine 329 residue is shown to be a critical regulatory site for SIK-mediated repression of SREBP-1c activity by in vitro kinase assay and reverse transcription-PCR analysis in primary hepatocytes. Finally, reduced hepatic triacylglycerol levels and lipogenic gene expression by adenoviral SIK1 transgenic expression are restored to normal levels by co-infection of mutant SREBP-1c, suggesting that SIK-dependent regulation of hepatic lipogenesis is indeed mediated through the phosphorylation of SREBP-1c in vivo. The process for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver involves de novo lipogenesis via the activation of SREBP-1c. Modulation of SREBP-1c activity by SIK proteins would provide an attractive means for the regulation of such diseases. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Co-infection; Energy homeostasis; Energy source; Feeding conditions; Hepatic expression; Hepatic triacylglycerol; In-vitro; In-vivo; Lipogenesis; Master regulators; Metabolic pathways; Non-alcoholic fatty liver; Over-expression; PCR analysis; Primary hepatocytes; Reverse transcription; Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins; Transcriptional levels; Transgenic expression; Triacylglycerol; Amino acids; Chemical activation; Genes; Glucose; Glycerol; Laws and legislation; Liver; Mammals; Modulation; Phosphorylation; Plants (botany); Proteins; Transcription; adenovirus vector; fatty acid synthase; phosphotransferase; salt inducible kinase; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; protein serine threonine kinase; Snf1lk protein, rat; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; animal cell; article; cell strain HepG2; controlled study; enzyme regulation; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; gene repression; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; human; human cell; in vitro study; lipogenesis; liver cell; liver level; liver metabolism; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; priority journal; protein induction; protein phosphorylation; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; amino acid sequence; animal; cell culture; cytology; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver; metabolism; microarray analysis; molecular genetics; mouse; phosphorylation; physiology; sequence alignment; Sprague Dawley rat; Mammalia; Amino Acid Sequence; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Hepatocytes; Humans; Lipogenesis; Liver; Mice; Microarray Analysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphorylation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sequence Alignment; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67449084097

Hydrogen can be produced out of hydrocarbons, such as natural gas, or renewable resources at stationary facilities, but fuel cells operated with pressurized hydrogen stored on board require advanced hydrogen infrastructure for commercialization. An alternative to on-board storage of hydrogen is on-board processing of a liquid hydrocarbon to hydrogen via steam reforming. However, on-board reforming of hydrogen is less energy-efficient than centralized production of hydrogen. Moreover, on-board reforming, purification, and subsequent oxidation of the reformate in a fuel cell is not more efficient than a hybrid electric vehicle technology assisted internal combustion engine. We propose a fuel cell-heat engine hybrid system, which consists of a membrane reformer, a fuel cell, and a reciprocating internal combustion engine, and estimate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid system. Steam reforming of a hydrocarbon requires additional heat input, which can be recovered from the waste heat of an internal combustion engine. On the other hand, the retentate of the membrane reformer can be used in the internal combustion engine to further increase the system efficiency. Methanol is proposed as the fuel for the membrane reformer because the temperature level required is low enough to recover waste heat of reciprocating internal combustion engines for steam reforming of methanol. The hybrid system proposed is more flexible than a fuel cell with an on-board reformer, because additional fuel can be directly combusted in the internal combustion engine at cold start or rapid load increase. Because fuel cell efficiency decreases with load and internal combustion engine efficiency increases with load, the overall system efficiency is less load-dependent compared to the efficiencies of each of these technologies. The power of an automobile engine is considered as a benchmark for the system proposed. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Cold start; Energy efficient; Fuel cell efficiency; Heat input; Hybrid-electric vehicle technologies; Hydrogen infrastructure; Internal combustion; Liquid hydrocarbons; On-board fuels; On-board processing; Pressurized hydrogen; Production of hydrogen; Reciprocating internal combustion engines; Reformate; Renewable resource; Retentate; Steam reforming; Steam reforming of methanol; Storage of hydrogen; System efficiency; Temperature level; Automobile engines; Cell membranes; Combustion equipment; Electric automobiles; Electric grounding; Electrochemistry; Energy efficiency; Fuel cells; Fuel purification; Gas industry; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Internal oxidation; Methanol; Natural gas deposits; Reforming reactions; Smoke; Steam; Steam engineering; Steam engines; Thermochemistry; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449141423

It can store a high wt% of hydrogen and has a favorable volumetric density. Unfortunately it was found to decompose slowly at room temperature. It is of interest to consider chemically related materials, such as the series of [X H4] [Y H4] ionic solids (X=B, Al,Ga and Y=N, P,As). Even if the wt% of hydrogen in the heavier congeners is necessarily lower, they might offer superior material properties, notably higher (but not too high) stability. We have therefore performed a first-principles investigation of the cohesive energies of the X H4 Y H4 solid-state materials. In addition we have analyzed the bond character and energy within the building blocks of these materials, the X H4- and Y H4+ molecular ions, including a comparison to the A H4 molecules (A=C,Si,Ge). The calculations have been performed within the density functional framework employing plane waves for the bulk materials and Slater-type functions for the molecules. A detailed study of the electronic structure reveals that the hydrides of the light (second period) elements, BH4-, CH4, and NH4+, exhibit the strongest and shortest X-H bonds. This is caused by Pauli repulsion effects of the hydrogen substituents with the larger cores of the heavier (third and fourth period) elements. The important consequence is that in the crystals, where the ionic hydrides retain their identity and charge, the distance between the negative and positive ions is larger in the heavier systems, hence less Madelung stabilization and a smaller cohesive energy. Moving from [NH4] [BH4] to heavier congeners thus does not seem to be a promising route to obtain more suitable materials for hydrogen storage. Other types of chemical variation (different substituents) on the [NH4] [BH4] building blocks may prove more advantageous. © 2009 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650301888

Sedentary bobwhite quails (Colinus virginianus) were used as a model to investigate the mechanisms for this natural doping. Our goal was to characterize the stimulating effects of n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on oxidative capacity. Mechanisms linked to changes in membrane composition and in gene expression for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) were investigated. Dietary n-3 fatty acids stimulated the activities of oxidative enzymes by 58-90% (citrate synthase, cytochrome oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase and hydroxyacyl dehydrogenase), and sedentary quails showed the same changes in membrane composition as sandpipers preparing for migration. EPA and DHA have the same doping effect. The substitution of n-6 arachidonic acid by n-3 EPA in membrane phospholipids plays an important role in mediating the metabolic effects of the diet, but results provide no significant support for the involvement of PPARs (as determined by changes in gene expression). The fatty acid composition of mitochondrial membranes and sarcoplasmic reticulum can be monitored by measuring total muscle phospholipids because all phospholipids are equally affected by diet. Only extreme regimes of endurance training can lead to increments in oxidative capacity matching those induced here by diet. As they prepare for long migrations, semipalmated sandpipers improve their physical fitness by eating! Choosing n-3 fatty acid doping over endurance training strikes us as a better strategy to boost aerobic capacity when rapid storage of energy is critical.","Colinus virginianus; Lipid metabolism; Membrane phospholipid; Mitochondrial enzyme; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gene expression; Sarcoplasmic reticulum","avian protein; membrane lipid; omega 3 fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; phospholipid; animal; article; Charadriiformes; Colinus; drug effect; female; flying; gene expression; genetics; male; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane; muscle; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; population migration; sarcoplasmic reticulum; Animal Migration; Animals; Avian Proteins; Charadriiformes; Colinus; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Female; Flight, Animal; Gene Expression; Male; Membrane Lipids; Mitochondrial Membranes; Muscles; Oxidation-Reduction; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Phospholipids; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum; Calidris pusilla; Colinus; Colinus virginianus; Phasianidae; Scolopacidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849261200

We developed a research model and hypotheses using key variables drawn from previous research, such as Information System Success Model, Contingency Theory, Resource-based Theory and other research on the methodology to evaluate the performance of information service. To empirically test the proposed model, we conducted both an internet-based survey and a paper-based survey on the Korean firms using government information service programs. Statistical methods, based on the structural equation modeling method using the LISREL software program, were used for analyzing 186 valid responses. We found that the influence dimensions on service usage, such as 'quality of information service for SMEs' and 'organizational specific factors', are statistically significant in increasing the degree of usage and that the usage of information service is statistically significant in increasing firm performance, which includes information orientation and business performance. The results of our analysis also showed that information orientation is statistically significant in increasing business performance. In addition, information orientation mediates the link between information service usage and business performance.

The use of energy storage systems can help for a larger integration of DG controlling the power flow in the point of common coupling (PCC). From the economical point of view, the possibility to store the electricity when the price is low to sell when it is high makes energy storage an interesting investment for DG owners.

These are reasons related to our environment, and to economics. In the competitive truck industry fuel consumption is an important sales argument, since customers on an average drive their trucks for distances of 150 000 km per year, which means that fuel becomes a large part of the lifetime cost for a vehicle. Existing braking system design in commercial vehicles are basically air assisted, which utilizes the compressed air from reservoir, which is being replenished based on requirement by a positive displacement compressor, generally driven directly by vehicle power pack. In this paper, an effort has been made to partially use the energy stored in the springs (induced due to road undulations) for compressed air generation through a single acting positive displacement pump. The system design and its interface are done considering the actual measured data on a 16T Goods Vehicle at various road and road traffic conditions, namely, the in-city cycle, highway cycle and off-road cycle for both laden and un- laden applications. The preliminary analysis of the data shows a positive indication of availability of simple harmonic displacements after re-sampling of data. The re- sampling has been done using macros developed in Microsoft Excel® and the system response is developed based on the order of re-sampling.

The Ge-NCs in a SiO2 were formed by irradiation of the electron beam on a tri-layers (SiO2(20 nm)/Ge(5 nm)/SiO2(10 nm)) grown on a Si(001) substrate and followed by annealing. For a sample exposed in the atmosphere by electron beam with energy of 1 MeV and a dose of ~5 × 1016 e/cm2, and then annealed at 700 °C for 10 min, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement revealed the formation of Ge-NCs with average size of ~20 nm in a SiO2 matrix. For a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure synthesized by Al deposition on the top of the sample, the capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements showed the hysteresis loops with a flatband voltage shift (ΔVFB) of ~5.0 V, which would originate mainly from Ge-NCs as the charge storage nodes. In contrast, for a sample annealed at above 900 °C for 10 min without electron beam irradiation, we could obtain a similar hysteresis loop of ~4.0 V. This indicates that the e-beam irradiation process can lead to temperature reduction of ~200 °C for Ge-NCs formation by annealing process. We propose that the temperature reduction would result from crystallity enhancement of Ge layers in the initial stage of Ge-NCs formation due to Ge atomic displacements induced by the high energy electron beam. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

It is necessary to enhance and sustain the production efficiency of livestock species in the changing face of population scenario to feed a large growing population. Therefore, it is important to adopt different strategies to increase productive efficiency of livestock. Leptin is one of the most useful biomolecule to act as a marker for identifying high performing individuals leading to better adaptability and productivity. Leptin has a pleiotropic effect on regulating apetite, energy metabolism, growth, reproduction, body composition and immunity. It is mostly produced in the white adipose tissue and informs the central nervous system (CNS) about the total fat depot of the body. Leptin is also involved in regulation of nutritional status and reproductive function and also regulates fetal development in livestock. Plasma leptin level increases linearly with increases in body fat mass. Leptin reduces feed intake in rodents, ruminant and other livestock species and also plays a role in energy expenditure. The physiological properties support leptin as a strong candidate gene for evaluation of genetic polymorphisms, which has further been associated with growth, milk yield and other economic traits in different livestock. The present review deals with the leptin structure and its implications in regulation of growth, reproduction, immunity and also enhancing livestock productivity.","Genetic polymorphism; Leptin; Livestock; Production performance","biological marker; leptin; leptin receptor; body composition; body fat; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; fetus development; food intake; genetic polymorphism; growth regulation; hormone synthesis; immunity; lipid storage; livestock; milk yield; nonhuman; nutritional status; pleiotropy; review; sustainable agriculture; white adipose tissue; Rodentia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349345799

Only a few coastal communities outside Asia have customarily used seaweeds as components of special dishes. Of late, however, seaweeds have gained importance as foodstuffs in Western countries and most recently as components of functional foods because of their high dietary fiber, mineral, vitamin, and phytochemical content, low energy levels, and high concentrations of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The present paper reviews the available data for some of the components of the major edible algae and studies several factors that can affect their physiochemical properties (e.g., hydration, water and oil-holding capacity, fermentability, binding capacity, etc.) and, in turn, their nutritional importance. The effects of marine alga consumption on growth and body weight, mineral availability, lipid metabolism, blood pressure, and antioxidant properties are reviewed, together with preliminary data on the effects of some functional foods containing seaweeds on lipid metabolism and gene expression of enzymes engaged in antioxidant protection. This review concludes with some remarks regarding the danger of the improper use of seaweeds in herbal medications. In addition, as the properties of algae are highly dependent on their individual composition, any generalization regarding these properties may be considered misleading and scientifically inappropriate. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Antioxidant; Body weight; Composition; Functional foods; Health properties; Lipid metabolism; Mineral availability; Seaweeds","algal protein; alginic acid; amino acid; antihypertensive agent; antiobesity agent; ascorbic acid; beta carotene; carbohydrate; carrageenan; cholesterol; cyanocobalamin; fatty acid; fucoidin; fucoxanthin; hypocholesterolemic agent; mannitol; mineral; omega 3 fatty acid; placebo; polyphenol derivative; proalgazyme; protein; thiamine; trace element; unclassified drug; alga; antioxidant activity; binding kinetics; bioavailability; blood pressure; body growth; body weight; brown alga; cardiovascular function; cation exchange; clinical trial; dietary fiber; digestion; economic aspect; excretion; fermentation; food composition; food intake; food processing; food storage; gastrointestinal tract function; gene expression; glucose metabolism; green alga; herbal medicine; human; hydration; lipid absorption; lipid metabolism; marine species; nomenclature; nonhuman; nutritional health; nutritional value; priority journal; protection; protein content; red alga; review; seaweed; viscosity; water retention; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Nutritive Value; Phytotherapy; Plant Preparations; Seaweed; algae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649560894

Food quality and quantity influences reproductive success in many bivalve species, and the timing and rate of reproductive maturation is a dominant influence on natural population dynamics, whereas understanding and controlling reproduction is vital for the reliable production of juvenile mussels for aquaculture. In this study, adult mussels were fed for six weeks on 1 of 4 diets: (1) raw seawater; and raw seawater plus equivalent dry weights of (2) Chaetoceros calcitrans, (3) Pavlova lutheri, and (4) a 1:1 combination of the 2 species. Chaetoceros calcilrans has a higher proportion of simple sugars and sterols compared with P. lutheri, whereas P. lutheri has greater proportions of DHA. Diet composition had a significant effect on the glycogen concentration and reproductive indicators at the end of six weeks. The combined C. calcitrans and P. lutheri supplement showed no change in glycogen stores after 6 wk, however a greater percentage of animals spawned, and a greater proportion of vitellogenic and atretic mussels were produced. Mussels supplemented with C. calcilrans increased glycogen stores and produced greater proportions of mussels with vitellogenic oocytes. Those supplemented with P. lutheri produced a greater proportion of mussels with atretic oocytes, and a lower proportion of D-veliger larvae produced from the eggs. Mussels fed with raw seawater produced a greater proportion of resting mussels, and a lower percentage of mussels spawned at the end of the conditioning period. Oocyte diameter and fecundity showed no significant difference among diets. These results show that diet quality directly influences the allocation of energy to glycogen storage and gametogenesis, however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Investigation into the allocation of individual biochemical components to each of these processes would further illuminate the process by which diet quality influences the allocation of energy to glycogen storage versus gametogenesis.","Carbohydrate; Diet quality; Energy storage; Lipid; Mussels; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Reproduction","Animalia; Bivalvia; Chaetoceros; Chaetoceros calcitrans; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Pavlova lutheri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65949114636

The silicon-nitride layers for blocking and charge storage were deposited at low temperatures by employing ICP-CVD. The optical band gap energies of the silicon nitride were between 2.8 eV and 5.8 eV. We used silicon nitride with optical band gap energies of 2.8 eV and 5.8 eV for the charge storage layer and the blocking layer, respectively. The thin tunneling layer formed by silicon-oxynitride was only grown via a nitrous-oxide plasma. The characteristics of the NNO stack structure showed a very large memory window. We successfully obtained a memory window of 24 V with a bias voltage swing between -20 V and +20 V. A large capacitance-voltage hysteresis was obtained, which was probably a result of the electrons and the holes trapped at deep trap levels and of the band gap offset. Low temperature fabrication enables the memory device to be applied to poly-Si TFT for display technology.","Capacitance-voltage; Energy band gap; MNNOS; NVM; Silicon nitride",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65649099086

Our results demonstrate that the dominant coefficient of SP dispersion for thin and layer-by-layer Ag films presenting QWS is quadratic even at small q ||, in contrast with previous measurements on Ag semi-infinite media and Ag thin films deposited on Si(111). We suggest that this behavior is due to screening effects enhanced by the presence of QWS shifting the position of the centroid of the induced charge less inside the geometrical surface compared with Ag surfaces and Ag/Si(111). For ultrathin Ag films, i.e. two layers, the dispersion was found to be not positive, as theoretically predicted. Annealing of the Ag film caused an enhancement of the free-electron character of the QWS, thus inducing a negative linear term of the dispersion curve of the SP. Moreover, we report the first experimental evidence of chemical interface damping in thin films for K/Ag/Ni(111). As regards Na/Cu(111), we found a different dispersion curve compared with thick Na films, thus confirming the enhanced screening by Na QWS. Results reported here should shed light on the influence of QWS on dynamical screening phenomena in thin films. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS); Quantum well states; Surface plasmons","Ag films; Chemical interfaces; Dispersion curves; Dominant coefficients; Dynamical screenings; Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS); Electronic excitations; Experimental evidences; Geometrical surfaces; High-resolution electron-energy loss spectroscopies; Induced charges; Layer by layers; Linear terms; Quantum well states; Screening effects; Semi-infinite medias; Si (1 1 1); Surface plasmons; Two layers; Contrast media; Dispersion (waves); Dispersions; Dissociation; Electron emission; Electron scattering; Electrons; Energy dissipation; Nuclear instrumentation; Optical data storage; Plasmons; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Semiconductor quantum wells; Silver; Sodium; Sodium compounds; Ultrathin films; Electron energy loss spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449182016

In this paper, a new method is proposed to minimise such deviations and thereby enhance the performance of Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of an interconnected hydrothermal power system with the coordinated operation of a Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) unit in thermal area and a Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifter (TCPS) in series with the tie-line. Generation Rate Constraints (GRCs) are also considered for the thermal and hydro systems. The integral controller gain settings are obtained by optimising a quadratic performance index using the Integral Squared Error technique. Comparison of the dynamic responses demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the suggested SMES-TCPS combination in suppressing and stabilising the oscillations of frequency and tie-power deviations as well as in reducing the settling time.

Energy systems based on certain renewable sources as wind power, have the drawback of random input making them a non-reliable supplier of energy. Regulation of output energy requires the introduction of new equipment with the capacity to store it. We have chosen the hydrogen as an energy storage system due to its versatility. The advantage of these energy storage systems is that the energy can be used (sold) when the demand for energy rises, and needs (prices) therefore are higher. There are two disadvantages: (a) the cost of the new equipment and (b) energy loss due to inefficiencies in the transformation processes. In this research we develop a simulation model to aid in the economic assessment of this type of energy systems, which also integrates an optimization phase to simulate optimal management policies. Finally we analyze a wind-hydrogen farm in order to determine its economical viability compared to current wind farms. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Computer application; Hydrogen; Optimization; Simulation; Techno-economical analysis; Wind power","Computer applications; Computer software; Electric utilities; Energy dissipation; Flywheels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Economic assessments; Economical feasibilities; Economical viabilities; Energy loss; Energy storage systems; Energy systems; Hydrogen energies; Hydrogen energy systems; Optimal managements; Output energies; Random inputs; Renewable sources; Simulation; Simulation models; Techno-economical analysis; Transformation process; Transformation systems; Wind farms; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63149171081

To ascertain the fact that, the formation of pseudo-colloids of Fe in the size range 1.6 nm and 1.1 nm was assisted by the presence of DOC, experiments have been conducted under similar experimental conditions with uniform Fe concentration and varying the DOC in the range of 10-60 mg L-1.

The samples with the most homogeneous nickel distribution, obtained by pre-oxidising the carbon nanospheres, displayed the highest storage capacity. In addition, storage capacity is influenced by the amount of nickel. It was found a higher storage capacity in samples containing 5 wt.% of Ni.

The first experimental results carried out on a system prototype are described, showing that the extra components, required in order to manage the hybrid system, do not remarkably affect the overall system efficiency, which is always higher than 36% in all the test configurations examined. In fact, the system allows the fuel cell to work most often at quasi-optimal conditions, near its maximum efficiency (i.e. at low/medium loads), because high external loads are met by the combined effort of the fuel cell and the ultracapacitors. For the same reason, the metal hydride storage system can be used also under highly dynamic operating conditions, notwithstanding its usually poor kinetic performance. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Fuel cell; Hybrid system; Metal hydride; Ultracapacitor","Capacitor storage; Capacitors; Cell membranes; Electric grounding; Electrochemistry; Fuel cells; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Land vehicle propulsion; Lithium batteries; Metals; Automotive devices; Battery packs; Cell-based; Energy storage devices; Energy systems; External loads; Hybrid energy systems; Maximum efficiencies; Metal hydride; Metal hydride storages; Mobile applications; Operating conditions; Power sources; Proton exchange membranes; Quasi-optimal; System efficiencies; System prototypes; Test configurations; Ultracapacitor; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62849107736

This paper proposes a technical-economic model for underground storage of CO2 emitted by a fertilizer industry in the Northeast of Brazil, in a hypothetical mature oil reservoir through EOR operation. Simulations based on mass, energy and entropy balances, as well as economic analysis, were assessed for the process of CO2 sequestration combined with EOR. This model takes into account the energy requirements for the whole CO2 sequestration process, as well as the emissions inherent to the process. Additionally, a breakdown cost methodology is proposed to estimate the main financial determinants of the integrated EOR with CO2 sequestration (costs of CO2 purchase, compression, transportation and storage). Project evaluation is derived from a cash flow model, regarding reservoir production profile, price and costs, capital expenditures (CAPEX), operating expenditures (OPEX), carbon credits, depreciation time, fiscal assumptions etc. A sensitivity analysis study is carried out to identify the most critical variables. Project feasibility, as expected, is found to be very sensitive to oil price, oil production, and CAPEX. Moreover, there is the contribution from the mitigation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) by storing a significant amount of CO2 in the reservoir where it can remain for thousands of years. © 2009.","CO2 sequestration; dynamic systems; enhanced oil recovery; mature oil reservoirs","Capital expenditures; Carbon credits; Cash flow models; CO2 sequestration; Critical variables; dynamic systems; Economic models; Energy requirements; enhanced oil recovery; Entropy balances; Fertilizer industries; Green house gas; Mature oil fields; mature oil reservoirs; New opportunities; Oil prices; Oil productions; Production profiles; Project evaluations; Project feasibilities; Sequestration process; Underground storages; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Dynamic programming; Economic analysis; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Oil fields; Operating costs; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Project management; Sensitivity analysis; Enhanced recovery; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; enhanced oil recovery; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil field; oil production; sensitivity analysis; underground storage; Brazil; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61949172143

The analysis is supported by the empirical results of a Delphi survey that we have conducted to investigate storage service provision and regulation in Italy. We argue that the Italian storage sector is at a crossroads. The policy-driven phase of liberalization is ending and the market-driven phase has just begun. The former phase has granted fair access to storage, narrowed the likelihood of strategic behaviour by the incumbent and secured residential users against supply disruptions, but it has proved dynamically inefficient. Cost-reflective tariffs and low penalties for unbalances have both lowered incentives to expand the range of flexibility tools and penalized industrial customers demand. The market-driven phase has just started. The expected increase in working capacity and the entry of newcomers in the authorization process for new facilities are a progress towards the commercial use of storage. To this end, however, a further change in gas market design is needed: the creation of a well functioning spot market. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the possible accidental scenarios when cryogenic gas as liquefied natural gas (LNG) is spilled on water at a very fast rate, the phenomenon of rapid phase transition (RPT) may occur: large amounts of energy are released during phase transition which can generate explosions. The related consequences should be added to the possible consequences of fire in terms of flash fire, fireball, pool fire, and vapour cloud explosion for confined and congested geometry surrounding the release point. In this paper, the analysis of RPT of LNG has been studied from the point of view of blast wave production, through ab initio acoustic analysis for monopole source. Maximum overpressures, as calculated at the source point and along the blast pathway are compared with results of large scale experiments.

The FT plants can use natural gas, coal, biomass or mixtures as feedstock. Technical data, and technological and economic assumptions for developments for 2020 were derived from the literature, recalculating to 2005 euros for (capital) costs. Our best-guess WTW estimates indicate BTL production costs break even when oil prices rise above $75/bbl, CTL above $60/bbl and GTL at $36/bbl. CTL, and GTL without carbon capture and storage (CCS), will emit more CO2 than diesel from conventional oil. Driving on fuel from GTL with CCS may reduce GHG emissions to around 123 g CO2/km. Driving on BTL may cause emissions of 32-63 g CO2/km and these can be made negative by application of CCS. It is possible to have net climate neutral driving by combining fuels produced from fossil resources with around 50% BTL with CCS, if biomass gasification and CCS can be made to work on an industrial scale and the feedstock is obtained in a climate-neutral manner. However, the uncertainties in these numbers are in the order of tens of percents, due to uncertainty in the data for component costs, variability in prices of feedstocks and by-products, and the GHG impact of producing biomass. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis utilised the power load data from three accommodation case studies that had RES/hybrids already installed. The accommodation sites, chosen from diverse locations within Australia, varied in both climatic and geographic characteristics. The assessment criteria for the analysis were net present cost (NPC), renewable factor (RF) and payback time. The specific operational characteristics of the tourism accommodation sector, such as 24-h operation, comfort provision and low tolerance for failure, necessitates a separate assessment of RES viability for this sector, rather than relying on similar assessments from other commercial and domestic sectors, which may not be representative. This study utilised RES assessment software, HOMER (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US) in order to compare the present RES/hybrid configuration to diesel generator-only (genset-only), RES-only and optimised RES/hybrid configurations. Analysis of both actual data and modeling results demonstrated that RES can adequately and reliably meet the power demand for stand-alone small to medium-scale tourist accommodations. Optimisation, achieved by further addition of RES to the existing configurations, reduced NPC in the majority of cases, with the added benefit of increased RF. Furthermore, NPC for these optimised RES/hybrid configurations were comparable to the optimised genset-only configurations. Modeling of conversions to RES-only configurations demonstrated this option as uneconomical unless existing RF was already high. Results indicated that wind energy conversion systems (WECS), rather than photovoltaics, were the most economical RES for sampled hybrid systems. For example, the payback time of the WECS/hybrids was approximately 3-4 years compared to PV/hybrids at 6-7 years. Hydrogen fuel cells and storage systems, whilst technically feasible, were not economically viable for the case studies due to the present high cost of components, especially compared to gensets. Modeling future potential increase in diesel fuel prices and implementation of carbon taxes shows a significant increase in NPC for genset-only configurations compared to RES/hybrid configurations in the sample. Carbon taxes of $50/ton increases NPC by 10% for genset-only systems but increases NPC less than half that amount for RES/hybrid systems. The data and subsequent modeling demonstrate that RES is both technically feasible and economically viable compared to diesel energy supply, for the small to medium-scale tourist operations sampled, dependent on stand-alone power supplies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment criteria comprised net present cost (NPC), renewable fraction (RF) and payback time. The RES software HOMER (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US) was utilised as the assessment tool with modeling performed with hourly load data input from a hotel located in a subtropical coastal area of Queensland, Australia. The results demonstrate that RES, in principle, has the potential to supply significant power for a large-scale tourist accommodation, in conjunction with the grid-electricity supply. Optimisation modeling demonstrated that, at 2004 prices, the NPC of the grid/RES hybrid configuration is comparable with the grid-only supply and resulted in a RF of 73%, a payback time of 14 years and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 65%. Optimisation modeling also showed that whilst a RES-only configuration can potentially supply 100% of power demand, such a configuration is presently uneconomical given current electricity costs. Results indicate that wind energy conversion systems (WECS), rather than photovoltaics, are the most economically viable RES technology for large-scale grid-connected operations. Specifically, large-scale WECS (over 1000 kW) are more efficient and more economical than multiple small-scale WECS (0.1-100 kW). Hydrogen fuel cells and storage are presently uneconomical in grid-connected configurations. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that operations that rely on grid-only supply are more economically susceptible to escalations in electricity costs and the imposition of carbon taxes, in comparison to grid/RES hybrids. Indeed, at present electricity prices, which have nearly quadrupled since 2004, the grid/RES hybrid is more economical over a 20-year span than the grid-only system, with a NPC which is 50% lower, and a payback time of 4.5 years. The analysis demonstrates that RES is both technically feasible and economically viable as an addition to grid-connected supply for large-scale tourist operations, and should become more attractive as costs of conventional supplies increase. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Brain-type CK (CK-B) deficiency is coupled to loss of function in neural cell circuits, altered bone-remodeling by osteoclasts and complement-mediated phagocytotic activity of macrophages, processes sharing dependency on actomyosin dynamics. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we provide evidence for direct coupling between CK-B and actomyosin activities in cortical microdomains of astrocytes and fibroblasts during spreading and migration. CK-B transiently accumulates in membrane ruffles and ablation of CK-B activity affects spreading and migration performance. Complementation experiments in CK-B-deficient fibroblasts, using new strategies to force protein relocalization from cytosol to cortical sites at membranes, confirmed the contribution of compartmentalized CK-B to cell morphogenetic dynamics.

A well-known solution to overcome this problem is caching decoded instructions in a hardware buffer. Fetching already decoded instructions avoids the need for decoding them again, improving processor performance. However, introducing such special-purpose storage in the processor design involves an important increase in the fetch architecture complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel decoding architecture that reduces the fetch engine implementation cost. Instead of using a special-purpose hardware buffer, our proposal stores frequently decoded instructions in the memory hierarchy. The address where the decoded instructions are stored is kept in the branch prediction mechanism, enabling it to guide our decoding architecture. This makes it possible for the processor front end to fetch already decoded instructions from the memory instead of the original nondecoded instructions. Our results show that using our decoding architecture, a state-of-the-art superscalar processor achieves competitive performance improvements, while requiring less chip area and energy consumption in the fetch architecture than a hardware code caching mechanism. © 2009 IEEE.","Branch predictor; CISC instruction decoding; Code caching; Superscalar processor design; Variable-length ISA","Computer architecture; Design; Microprocessor chips; Branch predictor; CISC instruction decoding; Code caching; Superscalar processor design; Variable-length ISA; Decoding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049119074

Amaranth (Amaranthus) is a member of the pseudo-cereal family, whose storage proteins have superior nutritional quality due to their essential amino acid composition. The aim of this project was to study the effects of the incorporated amaranth albumin proteins on the rheological properties of the wheat dough. RESULTS: The mixing time requirements, dough strength and stability of the reconstructed dough increased proportionally with the amount (1, 3 and 5%) of amaranth albumin proteins incorporated. These results were supported by measurements on the non-extractable polymeric protein ratio of the dough indicating the change in polymer size distribution. CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that amaranth albumin proteins are capable of interacting with gluten proteins through disulfide bonds, showing similar effects to the individual glutenin subunits of wheat flour proteins. Improvements in dough strength and stability without a substantial increase in the mixing requirements are of great significance for developing energy saving technologies in the baking industry. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.","Amaranth albumin; Functional properties; Incorporation; Storage proteins; Wheat dough","Amaranthus; Amaranthus caudatus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849308849

Etna over a 12-year period (1994-2006), during which the volcano exhibited different eruptive patterns. Over the two sub-periods when intense gravity decreases occur, centered on the upper southeastern sector of the volcano (late-1996 to mid-1999 and late-2000 to mid-2001), the strain release curve displays neat long-term accelerations, with many hypocenters clustered in the volume containing the gravity source. Various evidences suggest that, since 1994 and until the breakout of the 2001 eruption, the eastern flank of Etna remained peripheral to the lines of rise of the magma from the deep storage to the surface. Accordingly, we hypothesize that, rather than being directly associated to the migration of the magma, the joint anomalies we found image phases of higher tensile stress on the upper southeastern sector, associated to increase in the rate of microfracturing along the NNW-SSE fracture zone. Such an increase implies a local density (gravity) decrease, and an increase in the release of seismic energy, thus explaining the correlation we observe. The second period of gravity decrease/strain release increase culminated in the breakout of the 2001 flank eruption, as a pressurized deeper magma accumulation used the inferred zone of increasing microfracturing as a path to the surface. This eruption marks an important modification in the structure of Etna's plumbing system, as also testified by the absence of post-2001 long-term gravity changes and accelerations in the strain release curve and the neat modification of the seismicity and ground deformation patterns. We prove that joint microgravity and seismic studies can allow zones of the medium experiencing an increase in the rate of microfracturing to be identified months to years before a magma batch is conveyed through them to the surface, setting off a lateral eruption. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the effects of patents on innovations in the Korean biotech SMEs (small and medium-sized entrepreneurs) were examined using survey data and statistical analysis. Results: The survey results of this study provided some evidence that restricted access problems have occurred even though their frequency was not high. Statistical analysis revealed that difficulties in accessing patented research tools were not negatively correlated with the level of innovation performance and attitudes toward the patent system. Conclusion: On the basis of the results of this investigation in combination with those of previous studies, we concluded that although restricted access problems have occurred, this has not yet deterred innovation in Korea. However, potential problems do exist, and the effects of restricted access should be constantly scrutinized. © 2009 Kang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Level of innovation; Patent system; Potential problems; Research tools; South Korea; Statistical analysis; Survey data; Biotechnology; Developing countries; Electric energy storage; Innovation; Surveys; Patents and inventions; access to information; article; biotechnological production; business ethics; developing country; food biotechnology; industrial production; medical research; patent; performance measurement system; research ethics; social marketing; South Korea; statistical analysis; biotechnology; information dissemination; Korea; mass communication; statistics; Biotechnology; Developing Countries; Diffusion of Innovation; Information Dissemination; Korea; Patents as Topic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65849172788

Thermovision is a non-destructive technique used in diverse services of maintenance, having the advantage not to demand the disconnection of the equipment. The methodology uses a digital image processing algorithm based on the Watershed Transform to get the segmentation of the surge arresters. By applying the methodology is possible to classify surge arresters operative condition in: faulty, normal, light, and suspicious. The computational system generated train its neuro-fuzzy network by using a historical thermovision data. During the train phase, a heuristic is proposed in order to set the number of networks in the diagnosis system. This system was validated by a database with a hundreds of different faulty sceneries. The validation error of the set of neuro-fuzzy and the automatic digital thermovision image processing was about 10%t.

During the fabrication process, there are possibilities to cause defects on fabricating a final product. It would be very difficult to repair a memory device fabricated with numerous defects. However, in case of a small number of defects, it is desirable to repair and reuse as a defective die (standard unit measuring a device on a wafer) rather than to discard it, because reusing is an essential element for memory device manufactures to effectively cut costs. To perform the reuse, laser-repair process and redundancy analysis for setting is needed to find an accurate target in the laser-repair process.

Materials and methods: Children who had hypothalamopituitary tumor were divided into two groups. First group included obese-overweight (hypothalamic obese = HOB group, n=23) and second group included non-obese children (hypothalamic non-obese = HNOB group, n=16). Exogenously obese-overweight children (OB group, n=22) were included as controls. Basal and second-hour serum glucose and insulin in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), basal serum leptin, sOb-R, resistin levels, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) indexes were compared between the groups. Results: Age, sex, and pubertal status were similar in study groups. Median and interquartile ranges of body mass index (BMI) z scores were similar in HOB and OB groups (2.0 (1.5-2.1) and 2.1 (1.8-2.3), respectively). Serum leptin levels corrected for BMI were highest and total leptin/sOb-R ratios (free leptin index (FLI)) tended to be higher in HOB than HNOB and OB groups, indicating leptin resistance (leptin/BMI, 4.0 (1.6-5.2), 1.5 (0.8-3.1), and 2.5 (1.8-3.5); FLI, 2.0 (0.8-3.5), 0.6 (0.3-1.2), and 1.5 (1-2.3) in HOB, HNOB, and OB groups; respectively). Serum resistin levels were similar in groups (2.6 (1.9-3.1), 2.8 (1.7-3.4), and 3.0 (2.2-3.5) ng/ml in HOB, HNOB, and OB groups, respectively). Basal serum glucose, basal and second-hour insulin levels in OGTT, and HOMA index were higher in OB group than the HOB and HNOB groups, indicating insulin resistance in simple obesity; however, increment of insulin to same glycemic load in OGTT was highest in the HOB group indicating insulin dysregulation (p<0.05). Conclusion: Hypothalamic obesity seems to be related to both dysregulated afferent (leptin) and efferent (insulin) neural outputs through the autonomic nervous system resulting in energy storage as fat. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Hypothalamic obesity; Insulin; Leptin; Resistin; Soluble insulin receptor","insulin; leptin; leptin receptor; leptin receptor, human; resistin; RETN protein, human; adolescent; article; astrocytoma; blood; body mass; child; craniopharyngioma; dysgerminoma; female; glucose tolerance test; glycemic index; homeostasis; human; hypothalamus; hypothalamus tumor; male; metabolism; obesity; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; Adolescent; Astrocytoma; Body Mass Index; Child; Craniopharyngioma; Dysgerminoma; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Glycemic Index; Homeostasis; Humans; Hypothalamic Neoplasms; Hypothalamus; Insulin; Leptin; Male; Obesity; Receptors, Leptin; Resistin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75549090651

These materials are designed exhibit enhanced properties, and at the same time are endowed with functional groups that control their interactions, and hence self-organization, into a variety of supramolecular architectures. Since most of the multifunctional materials are soluble, lithographic methods suitable for solutions are attracting increasing interest for the manufacturing of the new materials and their applications. The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the recent advances of solution-based fabrication of multifunctional materials. We explain and examine the principles, processes, materials, and limitations of this class of patterning techniques, which we term unconventional wet lithographies (UWLs). We describe their ability to yield patterns and structures whose feature sizes range from nanometers to micrometers.

Aim of the study: The present study was performed to evaluate melanin-concentrating hormone receptor subtype 1 (MCH1) antagonism of the ethanol extract of Morus alba leaves (EMA) and its anti-obesity effect in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Materials and methods: The binding affinity of EMA for the MCH1 receptor with europium-labeled MCH (Eu-MCH), the function of recombinant MCH1 receptors expressed in CHO cells, and the anti-obesity effects in DIO mice were evaluated. Results: MCH1 receptor binding studies showed, EMA exhibited a potent inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 2.3 ± 1.0 μg/ml. EMA (10-100 μg/ml) also inhibited the intracellular calcium mobilization with the recombinant MCH1 receptors expressed in CHO cells. In an anti-obesity study with DIO mice, long-term oral administrations of EMA for 32 consecutive days produced a dose-dependent decrease in body weight and hepatic lipid accumulation. Conclusions: These results suggest that chronic treatment with EMA exerts an anti-obesity effect in DIO mice, and its direct MCH1 receptor antagonism may contribute to decrease body weight.

Evapotranspiration can also be estimated by solving for the residual of the energy balance measurements of net radiation, sensible heat flux density and ground heat flux density. However, the lack of energy balance closure of all components creates uncertainty in using the residual for operational estimates of evapotranspiration. Here, we show that the residual can agree well with the direct eddy covariance measurement after data have been quality-controlled and gap-filled. The technique is tested using energy balance data from three young, post-fire forests in Saskatchewan Canada during both wet and dry years. The seasonal cumulative evapotranspiration agrees within less than 5% and weekly agreement is very good. There is more scatter among the daily data and we do not recommend this method for shorter than daily averages unless all energy storage terms are measured very well. We conclude that forest evapotranspiration can be estimated cost effectively using the energy balance residual technique as daily, weekly and seasonal averages. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose is twofold: to analyze the diffusion of these applications underlining the main adoption barriers and to describe the impact on the corporate environment and the decision-making process leading to the introduction of B2e MI applications. Design/methodology/approach - The diffusion of mobile solutions is gauged through a survey of 646 Italian SMEs in the manufacturing industry. Multiple case studies of 28 Italian SMEs that have adopted 33 B2e MI applications have given insight into the impact and the adoption process of such technologies. Findings - The adoption of MI technologies is still limited in Italian SMEs. Two different kinds of solutions (classified into connectivity-based and application-based) lead to different processes of adoption. Research limitations/implications - The study has been conducted only in an Italian scenario. As for the survey, only firms belonging to the manufacturing industry have been interviewed. Practical implications - The main adoption drivers/constraints have been identified. The paper also provides information and communication technologies vendors with guidelines on how to increase the use of the applications in Italian SMEs. Originality/value - The paper is based on a double methodology in order to provide a full analysis of the adoption of mobile technologies in a business environment: the survey is used to quantify the adoption of the technologies and the case studies are used to investigate the adoption process. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this paper, we observe surface plasmon resonance splitting due to the covalence and π-bonding electrons conjugated effect. When surfactantless Au NPs are linked on the glass substrate by sulfur, the SPR peak is split from one mode (638 nm) into two modes at 615 and 643 nm. The binding energy of 3s electrons for sulfur atoms has a huge red-shift in XPS peaks to confirm the π-bonding electrons conjugated effect. Furthermore, a proposed classical coupling dielectric function model, adding the gold-sulfur covalence bonding effect and conjugated π-bond electrons from sulfur to gold into the Drude model, is achieved to explain the mechanism of the SPR split phenomenon. In the extreme case, when the Au surface atoms are all covered by thiol sulfur atoms, or not covered at all by thiols, the SPR peak will not split. We found 3.28% of the Au atoms are bound by sulfur atoms and 92% of the conjugated electrons of the sulfur atoms transfer to Au electronic gas. The coverage rate of the sulfur atoms bonded to the surface of the Au atoms is about 25%, and this can cause the SPR splitting. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Au surfaces; Bonding electrons; Chemical bondings; Coverage rates; Dielectric functions; Drude models; Electronic gas; Extreme case; First principles; Glass substrates; Gold nanoparticles; Gold surfaces; Red shifts; Self-assembled; Sulfur atoms; Surface plasmons; Surfactantless; Xps; Binding energy; Chemical bonds; Electrons; Gold; Optical data storage; Plasmons; Sulfur; Surface plasmon resonance; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65249120203

Coupled hydrogeological-thermal simulation of the storage system is essential to provide an optimized configuration and operation schedule for wells on the site. This paper presents numerical investigations and thermohydraulic evaluation of two-well models of aquifer thermal energy storage system operating under continuous flow regime. A three-dimensional numerical model for groundwater flow and heat transport is used to analyze the thermal energy storage in the aquifer. The model includes the effects of convection and conduction heat transfer, heat loss to the adjacent confining strata, and hydraulic anisotropy. The operation scenario consists of continuous injection and recovery from two wells and four periods per year to simulate the seasonal temperature conditions. For different parameters of the system, performances were compared in terms of normalized energy storage. The calculated temperatures at the producing well were relatively constant within a certain range through the year and fluctuating quarterly a year. Operation schedules, injection temperature, injection/production rate, and geometrical configuration of the well and aquifer used in the model are shown to impact the predicted temperature profiles at each stage and the recovery water temperature. But aquifer thickness and hydraulic anisotropy have a minimal effect on the performance of aquifer thermal energy storage systems.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Continuous flow; Hydrogeological-thermal simulation; Two-well model","Anisotropy; Aquifers; Flow simulation; Flywheels; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Heat conduction; Heat storage; Hydraulics; Hydrogeology; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Three dimensional; Water injection; Wells; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Aquifer thickness; Continuous flow; Convection and conductions; Geometrical configurations; Heat transports; Hydraulic anisotropies; Hydrogeological-thermal simulation; Injection temperatures; Minimal effects; Numerical investigations; Optimized configurations; Seasonal temperatures; Storage systems; Temperature profiles; Thermal energy storages; Thermo-hydraulic; Three-dimensional numerical models; Two-well model; Vertical boreholes; Water temperatures; Injection (oil wells)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61549101768

Physical activity was measured over two-week periods with doubly labeled water and doubly labeled water validated triaxial accelerometers, and body fat gain was measured with isotope dilution. There was a significant association between the change in physical activity and the change in body fat, where a high initial activity level was predictive for a higher fat gain.

This ensemble is called Family 463; also, these single-sized quantum dots (QDs) are termed as magic-sized quantum dots (MSQDs). A magic-sized quantum dot (MSQD) ensemble is similar to a regular quantum dot (RQD) ensemble but consisting of single-sized nanocrystals; meanwhile, MSQDs do not grow in size any more with longer reaction periods or higher temperature, after their well development during synthesis. The CdSe MSQDs were synthesized via a noninjection one-pot approach with long reaction periods at elevated temperature, with cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(OAc)2 2H 2O) and elemental selenium as Cd and Se sources, respectively, one long-chain fatty acid as ligands, and 1-octadecene (ODE) as a reaction medium. Different carboxylic acids with the carbon-chain length ranging from C2 to C24, the number of which refers to the total number of carbons, were investigated. Deficient acid feed amount with respect to Cd is crucial for the formation of the CdSe MSQDs, leading to the resulting Cd precursor Cd(OAc)x(OOC-(CH2)n-CH3)2- x (with tunable activity). It was also found that the fatty acids of C12-C18, with low acid-to-Cd and high Cd-to-Se feed molar ratios and the growth temperature of 200-240 °C, are optimum for MSQD Family 463, regarding the yield, purity, and their bandgap photoluminescent (PL) efficiency. Interestingly, in the initial stage of the formation at the growth temperature of 140-160 °C, there may be an ""isomer competing"" process. 13C solid-state cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicates that the capping carboxylate groups are firmly attached to the nanocrystals, which allows cross-polarization from 1H of the alkyl chains to 113Cd. Thus 113Cd NMR is able to distinguish surface (422 ppm) bonding to both -COO and Se and bulk (680 ppm) Cd species bonding to Se only. The CdSe MSQD Family 463 possesses long shelf-storage stability. The synthetic approach introduced here is ready and reproducible, featuring large-scale production. The present study on the growth kinetics of CdSe MSQD Family 463 brings insights for rational design strategies toward various MSQD ensembles with different sizes, via the choice of acids and their feed amount affecting the activity of the resulting Cd precursor. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"1-octadecene; Alkyl chains; As-ligands; Band gap absorptions; Band gaps; Cadmium acetates; Carbon-chain lengths; Carboxylate groups; Cdse nanocrystals; Cross polarizations; Different sizes; Elemental seleniums; Elevated temperatures; Emission peaking; Feed molar ratios; Full width at half-maximum; Higher temperatures; Initial stages; Large-scale productions; Long-chain fatty acids; Magic-angle spinnings; Non injections; One pots; Photoluminescent efficiencies; Quantum dots; Rational designs; Reaction mediums; Reaction periods; Storage stabilities; Synthesis and characterizations; Synthetic approaches; Cadmium; Cadmium alloys; Cadmium compounds; Carboxylation; Energy gap; Fatty acids; Growth kinetics; Growth temperature; Nanocrystals; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Optical waveguides; Organic acids; Polarization; Selenium; Synthesis (chemical); Semiconductor quantum dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65249188742

The Mg-Ni phase diagram shows two stable compounds, Mg2Ni and MgNi2, at these temperatures, but only Mg2Ni was observed at the interface after the reaction. The growth of Mg2Ni followed the parabolic kinetics, and the apparent activation energy was determined to be 120 kJ/mol. The dominant diffusing species was identified by using thin W lines as markers. After the reaction, these W markers located near the Mg/Mg2Ni interface, suggesting that Mg was the dominant diffusing species in Mg2Ni. This is consistent with the general trend that in many metal/metal systems the dominant diffusing species are usually the majority elements in the compounds that formed first. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a practical approach of uniform down sampling in image space and yet making the sampling adaptive by spatially varying, directional low-pass prefiltering. The resulting down-sampled prefiltered image remains a conventional square sample grid, and, thus, it can be compressed and transmitted without any change to current image coding standards and systems. The decoder first decompresses the low-resolution image and then upconverts it to the original resolution in a constrained least squares restoration process, using a 2-D piecewise autoregressive model and the knowledge of directional low-pass prefiltering. The proposed compression approach of collaborative adaptive down-sampling and upconversion (CADU) outperforms JPEG 2000 in PSNR measure at low to medium bit rates and achieves superior visual quality, as well. The superior low bit-rate performance of the CADU approach seems to suggest that oversampling not only wastes hardware resources and energy, and it could be counterproductive to image quality given a tight bit budget. © 2009 IEEE.","Autoregressive modeling; Compression standards; Image restoration; Image upconversion; Low bit-rate image compression; Sampling; Subjective image quality","Curve fitting; Digital image storage; Energy conversion; Image compression; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Least squares approximations; Restoration; Standards; Visual communication; Autoregressive modeling; Compression standards; Image restoration; Image upconversion; Low bit-rate image compression; Subjective image quality; Image coding; algorithm; article; computer assisted diagnosis; computer network; image enhancement; information processing; international cooperation; methodology; regression analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; standard; statistical analysis; videorecording; Algorithms; Computer Communication Networks; Data Compression; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Internationality; Least-Squares Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Video Recording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61349100312

The rheological behavior of HEUR/CD inclusion complex solutions can be manipulated by the introduction of an anionic surfactant, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and such behavior is dependent on the characteristics and types of CD. The introduction of SDS partially restores the viscoelastic behavior of the HEUR/methylated Β-CD (m-ΒCD) system, but it completely recovers the viscoelastic behavior of the HEURα-CD system. Such difference is attributed to the different binding affinity of SDS and CDs. Temperature dependence of the viscoelastic behavior revealed that the activation energy and plateau modulus for HEURα-CDSDS system were higher than those of the HEURm-ΒCDSDS system. In excess amounts of SDS, the interaction between SDS and HEUR/CD inclusion complexes was similar to that of SDS and HEUR.

Individuals with hypertension are at an increased risk for stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Essential hypertension results from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. One such lifestyle factor is diet, and its role in the control of blood pressure has come under much scrutiny. Just as increased salt and sugar are known to elevate blood pressure, other dietary factors may have antihypertensive effects. Studies including the Optimal Macronutrient Intake to Prevent Heart Disease (OmniHeart) study, Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), International Study of Salt and Blood Pressure (INTERSALT) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study have demonstrated an inverse relationship between dietary protein and blood pressure. One component of dietary protein that may partially account for its antihypertensive effect is the nonessential amino acid cysteine. Studies in hypertensive humans and animal models of hypertension have shown that N-acetylcysteine, a stable cysteine analogue, lowers blood pressure, which substantiates this idea. Cysteine may exert its antihypertensive effects directly or through its storage form, glutathione, by decreasing oxidative stress, improving insulin resistance and glucose metabolism, lowering advanced glycation end products, and modulating levels of nitric oxide and other vasoactive molecules. Therefore, adopting a balanced diet containing cysteine-rich proteins may be a beneficial lifestyle choice for individuals with hypertension.

In Canada, commercial spent fuel is currently stored In light water pools for about ten years before being transferred to dry storage where storage may extend up to 100 years. Investigations on the fuel structural integrity evolution during dry storage are being performed for spent CANDU fuel bundles. A CANDU nuclear fuel bundle is a cylindrical assembly approximately 0.1 m in diameter and 0.5 m in length made of 28 or 37 fuel elements held together by welding two endplates at both ends. The welds have a circular notch of less than 10 urn diameter. Significant hydraulic, mechanical, and thermal loads during bundle irradiation in the reactor may lead to bundle deformation, which when coupled with the sharp weld notch can result In significant stress enhancement at the notch tip and possibly activate delayed hydride cracking (DHC) during dry storage. To better understand the stress levels In CANDU fuel during dry storage, a finite element model of CANDU fuel bundles is under development. The stress distribution In the bundle and the stress Intensity factor at each weld notch can be evaluated by the model for the spent fuel geometry and dry storage conditions. This paper discusses the agreement between the finite element model and validation experiments using unirradiated 28-element CANDU fuel bundles tested In the elastic and plastic regime.

Effect of microwave disinfectionBackground: Microwave energy has proved to be an effective method for disinfecting acrylic dentures. However, the effect of microwave heating on the porosity of autopolymerising denture reline resins has not been investigated. Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of microwave disinfection on the porosity of autopolymerised denture reline materials (Kooliner-K, New Truliner-NT, Tokuso Rebase Fast-TR and Ufi Gel Hard-UGH) and a conventional heat-polymerised denture base resin (Lucitone 550-L). Material and methods: Specimens (10 mm × 20 mm × 1 mm) were obtained from the impression surface of the palatal mucosa in a single person and divided into four groups (n = 5). The porosity was evaluated after polymerisation (C1), after two cycles of microwave disinfection (MW2), after seven cycles of microwave disinfection (MW7) and after 7 days storage in water at 37°C (C2). Specimens from group MW7 were exposed to microwave disinfection daily being stored in water at 37°C between exposures. All the replicas were sputter coated with gold and micrographs/digital images were taken of each replica using scanning electron microscopy at magnification × 100. The SEM micrographs were then examined using an image analyser to determine the number of pores. Comparison between materials and groups were made using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: MW7 resulted in a significant increase in the number from the pores of material K, but decreased in number in reline material TR and UGH reline resin. The number of pores in materials NT and L remained unaffected following microwave disinfection. Conclusion: Differences in the porosity amongst the materials and for different experimental conditions were observed following microwave disinfection. © 2008 The Gerodontology Association and Blackwell Munksgaard Ltd.","Acrylic resins; Microwave; Porosity; Relining","acrylic acid resin; biomedical and dental materials; kooliner; Lucitone; methacrylic acid derivative; silastic; Tokuso Rebase Fast; truliner; Ufi gel; water; article; chemistry; comparative study; denture; disinfection; human; image processing; materials testing; methodology; microwave radiation; porosity; radiation exposure; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; temperature; time; Acrylic Resins; Dental Materials; Denture Bases; Denture Rebasing; Disinfection; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Materials Testing; Methacrylates; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microwaves; Porosity; Silicone Elastomers; Surface Properties; Temperature; Time Factors; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649205339

The model was used to simulate dynamic characteristics of the driveline motions and the effects of driveline parameters on the PTO rattle noise under the condition that generated the loudest PTO rattle noise. The results of the simulation identified that the PTO rattle noise was caused by collisions between the driving and driven gears in the PTO gearbox due to their velocity variations induced by the torque fluctuations from the engine. It was also found that the PTO rattle noise decreased as the drag torque and the mass moment of inertia of the engine flywheel increased. Smaller backlash and mass moment of inertia of the driven gear also reduced the PTO rattle noise. However, increasing the drag torque and mass moment of inertia of the engine flywheel or decreasing the backlash and mass moment of inertia of the driven gear are not practical due to their detrimental effects on the transmission efficiency, gear strength, and smooth operations of gears. These methods are not suggested as being appropriate for solving the PTO rattle noise problem of the tractor used in this study. Instead, we recommend considering use of a torsional damper as a means of reducing velocity variations of the PTO driveline, which was a primary cause of the PTO rattle noise. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Computer simulation; Direct engine-PTO driveline; PTO rattle noise","Agricultural tractors; Degree of freedom; Detrimental effects; Direct engine-PTO driveline; Drag torque; Driveline; Dynamic characteristics; Gear strength; Mass moment; Noise problems; Non-linear; PTO rattle noise; Torque fluctuation; Torsional damper; Transmission efficiency; Velocity variations; Damping; Drag; Electric energy storage; Flywheels; Noise pollution; Simulators; Tractors (truck); Wheels; Tractors (agricultural); computer simulation; experimental study; noise; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67049159834

This indicated that the speed variation must be reduced to reduce the PTO rattle noise. In this study, a torsional damper was used to reduce the speed variations in the PTO driveline. A torsional damper comprised of two helical coil springs was installed on the engine flywheel to reduce the torque fluctuations causing the speed variations and gear collisions in the PTO gearbox during idling. The effects of design parameters of the torsional damper on the speed variation were investigated, and their optimum values were found by using an 11-degree of freedom, non-linear model of the damped PTO driveline. Under a constant hysteresis torque, the speed variation increased with the torsional stiffness of the damper. When the optimum values of the first spring were used, the sound pressure level of the rattle noise was reduced, resulting in a reduction of 15 dBA. The optimum torsional damper also reduced the velocity variation of the driving gear in the PTO gearbox, resulting in a noise reduction of 15 dBA.

To alleviate the impact of these accesses and reduce the memory footprint, high-level memory exploration and optimization techniques have been proposed. These techniques try to more efficiently utilize the memory hierarchy. An important step in these optimization techniques are loop transformations (LT). They have a crucial effect on later data memory footprint optimization steps and code generation. However, the state-of-the-art work has focused only on individual objectives. The main one in literature involves improving the locality of data accesses, and thus reducing the data memory footprint. It does not consider the trade-offs in the LT step in relation to successive optimization steps. Therefore, it is not globally efficient in mapping the application on the target platform. In this article we will discuss several trade-offs during the loop transformations. To our knowledge, we are the first ones considering these global trade-offs. Previous work always gave mostly one solution, having the best locality and thus the optimized memory footprint, even though some research in two-dimensional trade-offs in this area exists as well. We start from this state-of-the-art solution with minimal footprint. We show that by sacrificing the footprint, we can obtain gains in data reuse (crucial for energy reduction) and reduce the control-flow complexity. We demonstrate our approach on a real-life application, namely the QSDPCM video coder. At the end, we show that considering trade-offs for this application leads to 16% energy reduction in a two-layer memory subsystem and 10% cycle reduction on the ARM platform. © 2009 ACM.","Cost components; Data transfer and storage exploration; Loop transformations; Optimization; Trade-offs","Art work; Code Generation; Control-flow; Cost components; Cycle reduction; Data access; Data memory; Data reuse; Energy reduction; Global trade; Loop transformation; Loop transformations; Memory access; Memory footprint; Memory hierarchy; Memory subsystems; Optimization techniques; Real-life applications; Trade-offs; Two layers; Video coders; Commerce; Data transfer; Multimedia systems; Optimization; Data reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65849148709

Fatty acid oxidation defects (FAOD), glycogen storage disease, and mitochondrial myopathies represent the 3 main groups of disorders, and some consider myoadenylate deaminase (AMPD1 deficiency) to be a metabolic myopathy. Clinically, a variety of neuromuscular presentations are seen at different ages of life. Newborns and infants commonly present with hypotonia and multisystem involvement (liver and brain), whereas onset later in life usually presents with exercise intolerance with or without progressive muscle weakness and myoglobinuria. In general, the glycogen storage diseases result in high-intensity exercise intolerance, whereas the FAODs and the mitochondrial myopathies manifest predominately during endurance-type activity or under fasted or other metabolically stressful conditions. The clinical examination is often normal, and testing requires various combinations of exercise stress testing, serum creatine kinase activity and lactate concentration determination, urine organic acids, muscle biopsy, neuroimaging, and specific genetic testing for the diagnosis of a specific metabolic myopathy. Prenatal screening is available in many countries for several of the FAODs through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Early identification of these conditions with lifestyle measures, nutritional intervention, and cofactor treatment is important to prevent or delay the onset of muscle weakness and to avoid potential life-threatening complications such as rhabdomyolysis with resultant renal failure or hepatic failure. This article will review the key clinical features, diagnostic tests, and treatment recommendations for the more common metabolic myopathies, with an emphasis on mitochondrial myopathies.

The data are analyzed using the dynamic effective porosity, which is defined as the ratio of the rate of change in total moisture to the rate of change in water table elevation; thus, a reduction in this parameter means that the extent of moisture exchange has been reduced relative to a given water table fluctuation. The data show a clear decrease in the dynamic effective porosity with increasing proximity of the water table to the sand surface, which is consistent with previous research under a steadily rising or falling shallow water table. The observed reduction in moisture exchange due to shallowness of the water table has implications for periodic flow scenarios such as the propagation of water table waves in coastal and beach groundwater systems. That is, as moisture exchange is reduced, less work is being done by the flow, and thus, energy dissipation rates for shallow water tables will be reduced relative to the case of a deeper water table. At present no account of the influence of water table shallowness has been included in theories describing water table wave dispersion. The present experiments, in conjunction with the dynamic effective porosity concept, provide a framework in which this gap in knowledge can be further investigated. Additional experiments were designed such that the free surface transgressed the sand surface for part of the oscillation period to investigate the influence of meniscus formation and deformation at the sand surface on periodic flow dynamics. The observed behavior is consistent with previous observations of steady infiltration above shallow water tables, namely, a rapid drop (rise) in pore pressure with the onset of meniscus formation (deformation). A simple ""wetting and drying"" model is derived, accounting for the variation in effective porosity caused by the free surface transgressing the sand surface, which is shown to accurately capture the observed behavior. A finite element solution of the Richards equation in which the transient upper boundary condition is easily mimicked by means of a surface element with special storage features also shows excellent agreement with the observed data. © 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"Data sets; Effective porosities; Energy dissipation rates; Finite element solutions; Free surfaces; Groundwater systems; Influence of waters; Meniscus formations; Moisture exchanges; Observed datum; Oscillation periods; Periodic flows; Periodic forcing; Rate of changes; Richards equations; Sand columns; Shallow water tables; Surface elements; Water table elevations; Water table fluctuations; Water tables; Wave dispersions; Deformation; Energy dissipation; Forestry; Groundwater resources; Heat transfer; Hydrogeology; Laboratories; Moisture; Porosity; Sand; Aquifers; aquifer; elevation; groundwater flow; laboratory method; porosity; shallow water; storage; water table",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65349181894

Rat epididymal adipocytes were incubated with 5′-aminoimidasole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR;0.5 mM) for 15 h. Also, epididymal adipocytes were isolated 15 h after AICAR was injected (i.p. 0.7 g/kg body weight) in rats. Adipocytes were utilized for various metabolic assays and for determination of gene expression and protein content. Timedependent in vivo plasma NEFA concentrations were determined. AICAR treatment significantly increased AMPK activation, inhibited lipogenesis, and increased FA oxidation. This was accompanied by upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α, PPARδ, and PPARγ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) mRNA levels. Lipolysis was first suppressed, but then increased, both in vitro and in vivo, with prolonged AICAR treatment. Exposure to AICAR increased adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) content and FA release, despite inhibition of basal and epinephrine-stimulated hormonesensitive lipase (HSL) activity. Here, we provide evidence that prolonged AICAR-induced AMPK activation can remodel adipocyte metabolism by upregulating pathways that favor energy dissipation versus lipid storage in WAT. Additionally, we show novel time-dependent effects of AICAR-induced AMPK activation on lipolysis, which involves antagonistic modulation of HSL and ATGL.

Among triiodothyronine derivatives, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2) has been shown to exert marked effects on energy metabolism by acting mainly at the mitochondrial level. Here we investigated the capacity of T2 to affect both skeletal muscle mitochondrial substrate oxidation and thermogenesis within 1 h after its injection into hypothyroid rats. Administration of T 2 induced an increase in mitochondrial oxidation when palmitoyl-CoA (+104%), palmitoylcarnitine (+80%), or succinate (+30%) was used as substrate, but it had no effect when pyruvate was used. T2 was able to 1) activate the AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoA metabolic signaling pathway known to direct lipid partitioning toward oxidation and 2) increase the importing of fatty acids into the mitochondrion. These results suggest that T2 stimulates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by activating several metabolic pathways, such as the fatty acid import/β-oxidation cycle/FADH2-linked respiratory pathways, where fatty acids are imported. T2 also enhanced skeletal muscle mitochondrial thermogenesis by activating pathways involved in the dissipation of the proton-motive force not associated with ATP synthesis (""proton leak""), the effect being dependent on the presence of free fatty acids inside mitochondria. We conclude that skeletal muscle is a target for T2, and we propose that, by activating processes able to enhance mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis, T2 could play a role in protecting skeletal muscle against excessive intramyocellular lipid storage, possibly allowing it to avoid functional disorders.

Unique mechanisms explaining their amazing capacity for endurance exercise have now been uncovered, particularly with respect to energy storage, mobilization, transport and utilization. Birds are champions of migration because flying offers a key compromise: it allows more rapid movement than swimming, but has a lower cost of transport than running. High efficiency for muscle contraction, pointed wings, low wingloading, travelling in V-formations, storing fuel as energy-dense lipids and atrophy of non-essential organs are some of their strategies to decrease the cost of transport. The ability to process lipids rapidly also emerges as a crucial component of the migrant phenotype. High lipid fluxes are made possible by lipoprotein shuttles and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) that accelerate lipid transport and by upgrading the metabolic machinery for lipolysis and lipid oxidation. Preparation for long flights can include natural doping on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) from unique invertebrate diets. Muscle performance is improved by restructuring membrane phospholipids and by activating key genes of lipid metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The physiological secret to long migrations does not depend on a single 'magic' adaptation but on the integration of multiple adjustments in morphology, biomechanics, behavior, nutrition and metabolism. Research on the physiology of migrants improves the fundamental knowledge of exercise biology, but it also has important implications for wildlife conservation, treating obesity and improving the performance of human athletes.","Animal energetics; Cost of transport; Endurance exercise; Lipid metabolism; Lipoprotein; Membrane phospholipid; Natural doping","adaptation; animal; biomechanics; bird; endurance; energy metabolism; fish; flying; lipid metabolism; metabolism; note; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; population migration; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Migration; Animals; Biomechanics; Birds; Energy Metabolism; Fishes; Flight, Animal; Lipid Metabolism; Oxidation-Reduction; Physical Endurance; Animalia; Aves; Invertebrata",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62849106685

Different levels of feed moisture (12%, 14%, and 16%) and extrusion temperatures (140, 150, 160, 170, 180, and 190 °C) were used for extrusion. The physical properties - bulk density, true density, porosity, and expansion ratio; functional properties such as water absorption index, water solubility index, oil absorption index, pasting, rheological, and textural properties; and in vitro enzyme digestibility of the extrudates were determined. The expansion ratio of the extrudates ranged from 3.22 to 6.09. The water absorption index (6.52 to 8.85 g gel/g dry sample), water solubility index (15.92% to 41.31%), and oil absorption index (0.50 to 1.70 g/g) were higher for the extrudates in comparison to native starch (1.81 g gel/g dry sample, 1.16% and 0.60 g/g, respectively). The rheological properties, storage modulus, and loss modulus of the gelatinized powdered extrudates were significantly lower (P < 0.05) and these behaved like solutions rather than a paste or a gel. Hardness and toughness were more for the samples extruded at higher feed moisture and lower extrusion temperature, whereas snap force and energy were higher at lower feed moisture and temperature. There was a significant decrease in the percentage digestibility of arrowroot starch (30.07% after 30 min of incubation with the enzyme) after extrusion (25.27% to 30.56%).

The basic task of the harvester is to convert vibrational into electrical energy. As these energy harvesting devices shrink in dimensions, while still providing sufficient energy, they will be key enablers for wireless autonomous sensor networks. For such a purpose, vibration harvesters are being investigated which feature a footprint of 1 cm2 and an average power harvesting level of 100 μW. A detailed description of the design and fabrication for the piezoelectric, electrostatic and electromagnetic harvester is given. Furthermore, the interaction between a piezoelectric vibration energy harvester, the power converter and the energy storage system is investigated. A system level approach, including mechanical and electrical domains, is pursued for impedance matching between both domains in order to investigate the physical design aspects of the energy harvester on the electrical domain. Two matching methods, such as complex and real matching, are presented and compared to each other. Finally, several energy storage systems are briefly presented in order to store the irregular available scavenged energy and supply the functional circuitry in the system like sensor(s), signal processing and transceiver. In order to reduce power consumption, the transceiver operates in pulsed load condition which makes the energy storage system crucial. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Electromagnetic; Electrostatic; Energy harvester; Energy storage; Impedance matching; Piezoelectric; Power management","Electric power measurement; Electromagnetism; Electrostatics; Energy storage; Flywheels; Harvesting; Impedance matching (electric); Piezoelectric transducers; Piezoelectricity; Sensor networks; Signal processing; Transceivers; Wireless sensor networks; Electromagnetic; Energy harvester; Impedance matching; Piezoelectric; Power management; Harvesters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62449107160

Hydrogen is a flexible storage medium and can be generated by the electrolysis of water. It is particularly advantageous if an electrolyser may be simply and efficiently coupled to a source of renewable electrical energy. This paper examines direct coupling of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser to a matched solar photovoltaic (PV) source for hydrogen generation and storage. Such direct coupling with minimum interfacing electronics would lead to substantial cost reduction and thereby enhance the economic viability of solar-hydrogen systems. The electrolyser is designed for fail-safe operation with multiple levels of safety and operational redundancy. A control system in the electrolyser unit provides for disconnection when required and for auto-start in the morning and auto shut-down at night, simultaneously addressing the goals of minimum energy loss and maximum safety. The PV system is a 2.4 kW array (20.4 m2 total area) comprising 30, 12 V, 80 W, Solarex polycrystalline modules in a series-parallel configuration. The integrated system has been operated for approximately 60 days over a 4-month period from September 2007 to January 2008 with many periods of unattended operation for multiple days, experiencing weather ranging from hot and sunny (above 40 °C) to cool and cloudy. The principle and practicality of direct coupling of a suitably matched PV array and PEM electrolyser have been successfully demonstrated. Details of electrolyser operation coupled to a PV array along with modelling work to match current-voltage characteristics of the electrolyser and PV system are described.

X-ray diffraction studies showed that Zr facilitated the amorphization of Mg2Ni phase, while Al retarded the amorphization of this phase. The increase in the Zr content was observed to bring about significant improvement in the discharge capacities at all the ball milling durations. The stepwise replacement of Al with Zr, however, caused considerable reduction in the initial discharge capacities of the alloys. Despite the adverse effect of Al on the initial discharge capacity, it prevented the rapid degradation of Mg2Ni phase with the charge/discharge cycles. When the beneficial effects of Zr and Al were combined by designing Mg1.5Al0.5-xZrxNi type alloys, Mg1.5Al0.2Zr0.3Ni alloy was found to have the highest discharge capacity at almost all the charge/discharge cycle steps. Among the obtained capacity retaining rates, Mg1.5Al0.4Zr0.1Ni alloy had the best performance. This alloy has kept at least 50% of its initial discharge capacity at 20th cycle. The analysis by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the charge transfer resistances of Al-rich alloys were low at high depth of discharges. This observation was attributed to the formation of the porous unstable Mg(OH)2 layer due to the intercalation of Al2O3 layers, which have the high rate of solubility in strongly basic solutions, and thus the exposition of the underlying electrocatalytically active Ni sites. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Electrochemical characteristics; Impedance spectroscopy; Mechanical alloying; Mg2Ni-type alloys","Aluminum; Amorphization; Ball milling; Charge transfer; Electric discharges; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemical corrosion; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Ion exchange; Lithium batteries; Mechanical alloying; Metallurgy; Nickel; Photodegradation; Zirconium; Adverse effects; Basic solutions; Beneficial effects; Charge transfer resistances; Charge/discharge cycles; Depth of discharges; Discharge capacities; Electro-chemical impedances; Electrochemical characteristics; Electrochemical hydrogen storages; High rates; Impedance spectroscopy; Initial discharge capacities; Mg2Ni-type alloys; Ni alloys; Rapid degradations; X-ray diffraction studies; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62249097668

Contaminated soil water can influence the soil's behavior seriously. Mineralogical alterations play a vital role in such circumstances. This paper describes the impact of varying concentrations of sulfuric acid solutions on the swell behavior of expansive soil containing predominantly montmorillonite. Using the conventional oedometer tests, the swell behavior of soil compacted with water inundated with acid solutions was studied. The soil swell, which is about 2% in water, increases to about 9% with 1N and to 50% with 4N acid solutions. The induced swell in acid solutions is attributable to mineralogical changes. The formation of new minerals and their associated fabric changes are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive analysis of X-ray on soil samples treated with sulfuric acid. While minerals like gypsum and kornelite are formed in the presence of 1N sulfuric acid, aluminite and chloritoid are formed in the presence of 4N sulfuric acid.

Transcriptomics analysis of this bacterium grown in toluene-containing chemostats revealed the differential expression of 253 genes. As expected, the genes encoding one of the major solvent tolerance mechanisms, the solvent efflux pump SrpABC and its regulatory genes srpRS were heavily up-regulated. The increased energy demand brought about by toluene stress was also reflected in transcriptional changes: genes involved in sugar storage were down-regulated whereas genes involved in energy generation such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and NADH dehydrogenases, were up-regulated in the presence of toluene. Several flagella-related genes were up-regulated and a large group of transport genes were down-regulated. In addition, a novel Pseudomonas-specific gene was identified to be involved in toluene tolerance of P. putida S12. This toluene-repressed gene, trgI, was heavily down-regulated immediately upon toluene exposure in batch cultures. The relationship of trgI with solvent tolerance was confirmed by the increased resistance to toluene shock and toluene induced lysis of trgI knock-out mutants. We propose that down-regulation of trgI plays a role in the first line of defence against solvents. © 2008 Springer.","Pseudomonas putida S12; Solvent-tolerance; Toluene; Transcriptomics; TrgI","bacterial protein; solvent; toluene; article; bacterial gene; biosynthesis; chemistry; DNA microarray; drug effect; flagellum; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; polymerase chain reaction; principal component analysis; Pseudomonas putida; time; Bacterial Proteins; Flagella; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Principal Component Analysis; Pseudomonas putida; Solvents; Time Factors; Toluene; Transcription, Genetic; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas putida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449261065

Under stress bias testing, OAO triple stacks exhibit a larger shift of threshold voltage than do ONO type devices. The trap energy levels of the bulk electron traps in high k AAO materials were determined. The initial trapping charges are produced during the fabrication process and are changed into centroids of neutral charge trapping sites after PDA treatment, which are responsible for charge trapping/de-trapping during programming/erasing.

However, the causal relationship is complicated. Some forms of obesity are associated with low-level systemic inflammation, which is linked to disease. But lifestyle behaviours that may not necessarily cause obesity (poor diet, inadequate sleep, smoking, etc.) can independently cause inflammation and consequent disease. It is proposed here that it is the environment driving modern lifestyles, which is the true cause of much chronic disease, rather than obesity per se, and that obesity may be a marker of environmental derangement, rather than the primary cause of the problem. Attempts to clinically manage obesity alone on a large scale are therefore unlikely to be successful at the population level without significant lifestyle or environmental change. Environmental factors influencing obesity and health have now also been implicated in ecological perturbations such as climate change, through the shift to positive energy balance in humans caused by the exponential use of fossil fuels in such areas as transport, and consequent rises in carbon emissions into the atmosphere. It is proposed therefore that a more policy-based approach to dealing with obesity, which attacks the common causes of both biological and ecological 'dis-ease', could have positive effects on both chronic disease and environmental problems. A plea is thus made for a greater health input into discussions on environmental regulation for chronic disease control, as well as climate change. © 2008 International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Environment; Inflammation; Obesity","carbon; fossil fuel; anxiety; body fat; chronic disease; climate change; depression; environmental factor; environmental health; evolutionary adaptation; human; industrialization; inflammation; lifestyle; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; overnutrition; physical activity; review; sleep pattern; smoking; stress; Adipose Tissue; Adiposity; Biological Markers; Carbon; Chronic Disease; Environment; Humans; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Life Style; Obesity; Weight Gain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61349180773

The dynamics of lipid oxidation and fine tuning with fatty acid uptake and intramyocellular triacylglycerol turnover may be very important to limit the accumulation of lipid intermediates. The use of metabolic inflexibility, defined as the impaired capacity to increase fat oxidation upon increased fatty acid availability and to switch between fat and glucose as the primary fuel source after a meal, does more justice to the complexity of changes in fuel oxidation during the day. Fatty acid availability, uptake and oxidation all play a role in metabolic flexibility and insulin resistance. During high fatty acid availability, fatty acid transporters may limit cellular and mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and thus limit fat oxidation. After a meal, when the demand for fatty acids as fuel is low, an increased fractional extraction of lipids from plasma may promote intramyocellular lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. Furthermore, defects in fuel switching cluster together with impaired mitochondrial content and/or function. Lifestyle changes in dietary fat intake, physical activity and weight loss may improve metabolic flexibility in skeletal muscle, and thereby contribute to the prevention of type 2 diabetes. © 2009 International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Fat oxidation; Insulin resistance; Lifestyle; Metabolic flexibility","fatty acid; insulin; long chain fatty acid; messenger RNA; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; diet; exercise; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; human; insulin resistance; lifestyle modification; lipid storage; muscle metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; physical activity; review; weight reduction; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Fatty Acids; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Life Style; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidation-Reduction; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61349153606

The first half of pregnancy is also a stage of body fat gain in women. From an energy balance point, there is no explanation why women should be fatter than men, as the latter consume more calories proportionately. Moreover, women store fat in early pregnancy when caloric intake does not significantly change. The aim of this review is to focus on evidence supporting one mechanism that may account for these findings. That is, oestrogen reduces postprandial fatty acid oxidation leading to an increase in body fat which may account for the greater fat mass observed in women compared with men and the fat gain in early pregnancy. Therefore, female puberty and early pregnancy could be seen as states of efficient fat storage of energy in preparation for fertility, foetal development and lactation providing an obvious biological advantage. Further research into this mechanism of fat storage may provide further insights into the regulation of body fat. © 2008 International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Adipose tissue; Body composition; Fatty acid oxidation; Oestrogen","androgen; estrogen; prasterone; testosterone; adipose tissue; basal metabolic rate; body fat; fatty acid oxidation; female; female fertility; fetus development; human; lipid storage; postprandial state; pregnancy; review; sex difference; Adipose Tissue; Estrogens; Fatty Acids; Female; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Postprandial Period; Pregnancy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61349100167

An effective water control technique is, therefore, highly desirable. One potential solution for reducing excessive water production is the injection of ""Relative Permeability Modifier"" (RPM) chemicals into producing wells. The work described in this paper is concerned with finding a highly selective chemical to reduce water production without affecting oil production. Presented herein are results of laboratory tests using relative permeability modifiers in conjunction with core samples from the Wanaea field. The oil producing Wanaea field is operated by Woodside Energy. This field is in offshore Western Australian waters. Some of the wells suffer from high water cut, therefore the introduction of a relative permeability modifier (RPM) has been considered. Four RPM chemicals were tested with core plugs taken from Unit II of well Wanaea-3 (core depth 2832.00 to 2844.50 m). Laboratory experiments were conducted on 4 reservoir core plugs, with air permeabilities ranging from 158 to 334 md and porosities from 16.4 to 19.9%. The objective of the tests was to assess the effectiveness of selected RPM's in selectively reducing water production. The experimental results demonstrated that the chemicals were variably effective in reducing the relative permeability to the water phase, but they also variably affected the relative permeability to the oil phase. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, capric acid (CA)-myristic acid (MA) eutectic mixture/vermiculite (VMT) composite was prepared as a novel form-stable PCM using vacuum impregnation method. The composite PCM was characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) analysis technique. Thermal properties and thermal reliability of the composite PCM were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The CA-MA eutectic mixture could be retained by 20 wt% into pores of the VMT without melted PCM seepage from the composite and therefore, this mixture was described as form-stable composite PCM. Thermal cycling test showed that the form-stable composite PCM has good thermal reliability and chemical stability although it was subjected to 3000 melting/freezing cycling. Thermal conductivity of the form-stable CA-MA/VMT composite PCM was increased by about 85% by introducing 2 wt% expanded graphite (EG) into the composite. The increase in thermal conductivity was confirmed by comparison of the melting and freezing times of the CA-MA/VMT composite with that of CA-MA/VMT/EG composite.

The flow behaviours of the acorn starch dispersions at different temperatures (25, 40, 55 and 70 °C) were determined from the rheological parameters provided by the power law model. The acorn starch dispersions at 25 °C exhibited high shear-thinning fluid characteristics (n = 0.23-0.36). Consistency index (K) and apparent viscosity (ηa,100) increased with an increase in starch concentration, and were also reduced with increasing temperature. Within the temperature range of 25-70 °C, the ηa,100 obeyed the Arrhenius temperature relationship with a high determination coefficient (R2 = 0.97-0.99), with activation energies (Ea) ranging between 16.5 and 19.0 kJ mol-1. Both the power law and exponential type models were employed in order to establish the relationship between concentration and apparent viscosity (η a,100) in the temperature range of 25-70 °C. Magnitudes of storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli increased with an increase in the starch concentration and frequency (ω). The magnitudes of G′ were higher than those of G″ over most of the frequency range (0.63-62.8 rad s-1).

The main feature of the model is to predict (1) the overall thermal behavior of the system and (2) the phase front position without recurring to the full solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The model rests entirely on the conduction equation for both the solid and liquid phases. The effect of convection in the melt is mimicked via an enhanced thermal conductivity that depends on the dimensionless numbers and the geometry of the flow. The model is tested and confronted to full CFD solutions for a freezing duct flow problem and for buoyancy driven melting in an enclosure. In both cases, the predictions of the enhanced thermal conduction model show excellent agreement with that of the CFD model. Not only is the enhanced thermal conduction model simpler to implement but its simulations run at least ten times as fast as those of the CFD model. Consequently, the enhanced thermal conduction model is well suited for controlling real-time solid-liquid phase change processes that occur in industrial applications as well as in latent heat thermal energy storage systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional floating gate flash memories, no matter in NOR or NAND architecture, however, face steep challenges. For NOR flash, the junction breakdown and short channel effects have essentially squeezed out the device design space below 45 nm node. For NAND flash, the tight spacing, floating gate interference and the need for sufficient gate control (gate coupling ratio) have also ruled out the continuation of the conventional floating gate device below approximately 32 nm node. Charge trapping devices, exploiting high-K inter-poly dielectric (IPD) or by innovative tunneling barrier engineering, are proposed to continue scaling flash memories.

This paper presents two new novel general methods for computing optimal motions of an industrial robot manipulator (STANFORD robot) in presence of obstacles. The problem has a multi-criterion character in which three objective functions, a maximum of 72 variables and 103 constraints are considered. The objective functions for optimal trajectory planning are minimum traveling time, minimum mechanical energy of the actuators and minimum penalty for obstacle avoidance. By far, there has been no planning algorithm designed to treat the objective functions simultaneously. When existing optimization algorithms of trajectory planning tackle the complex instances (obstacles environment), they have some notable drawbacks viz.: (1) they may fail to find the optimal path (or spend much time and memory storage to find one) and (2) they have limited capabilities when handling constraints. In order to overcome the above drawbacks, two evolutionary algorithms (Elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm) are used for the optimization. Two methods (normalized weighting objective functions method and average fitness factor method) are combinedly used to select best optimal solution from Pareto optimal front. Two multi-objective performance measures (solution spread measure and ratio of non-dominated individuals) are used to evaluate strength of the Pareto optimal fronts. Two more multi-objective performance measures namely optimizer overhead and algorithm effort are used to find computational effort of NSGA-II and MODE algorithms. The Pareto optimal fronts and results obtained from various techniques are compared and analyzed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the thermal properties of PCM vary with temperature, a PCM-heat exchanger works as a transitory system and therefore, its design must be based on transitory analysis.

China's food security is challenged by several anthropogenic, sociopolitical and policy factors, including: population growth; urbanization and industrialization; land use changes and water scarcity; income growth and nutritional transition; and turbulence in global energy and food markets. Sustained growth in agricultural productivity and stable relations with global food suppliers are the twin anchors of food security. Shortfalls in domestic food production can take their toll on international food markets. Turbulence in global energy markets can affect food prices and supply costs, affecting food security and poverty. Policy safeguards are needed to shield food supply against such forces. China must make unremitting policy responses to address the loss of its fertile land for true progress towards the goal of national food security, by investing in infrastructure such as irrigation, drainage, storage, transport, and agricultural research and institutional reforms such as tenure security and land market liberalization. The links between water and other development-related sectors such as population, energy, food, and environment, and the interactions among them require reckoning, as they together will determine future food security and poverty reduction in China.

The tailored MWCNTs with obvious morphological modification could be further cut into short tubular structures through ultrasonic processing in ethanol. Various analytical techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were used to probe the morphological and structural evolution of MWCNTs during the treatments. The length of the shortened tubular structures ranged from a hundred to a few hundred nanometers, depending on the electrochemical procedures applied. The deformed and shortened MWCNTs displayed a graphitic crystalline structure. These results suggest that repeated electrochemical oxidation and reduction processing of MWCNTs opens up a new route to controlling surface modification and cutting of MWCNTs, which will facilitate their application in areas such as energy storage, catalytic support, and biosensing. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

CCS may play a significant role in decarbonising the Dutch energy and industrial sector, which currently emits nearly 100 Mt CO2/year. We found that 15 Mt CO2 could be avoided annually by 2020, provided some of the larger gas fields that become available the coming decade could be used for CO2 storage. Halfway this century, the mitigation potential of CCS in the power sector, industry and transport fuel production is estimated at maximally 80-110 Mt CO2/year, of which 60-80 Mt CO2/year may be avoided at costs between 15 and 40 €/t CO2, including transport and storage. Avoiding 30-60 Mt CO2/year by means of CCS is considered realistic given the storage potential represented by Dutch gas fields, although it requires planning to assure that domestic storage capacity could be used for CO2 storage. In an aggressive climate policy, avoiding another 50 Mt CO2/year may be possible provided that nearly all capture opportunities that occur are taken.

The CdS films were deposited on glass substrate by thermal evaporation, and the films studied in the present work are polycrystalline with crystallites preferentially oriented along (002)-H direction. It is shown that swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation leads to grain agglomeration and hence an increase in the grain size at low ion fluences. The observed lattice compaction was related to irradiation induced polygonization. The optical band gap energy decreased after irradiation, possibly due to the combined effect of change in the grain size and in the creation of intermediate energy levels. Enhanced nonradiative recombination via additional deep levels, introduced by SHI irradiation was noticed from photoluminescence (PL) analysis. A shift in the core levels associated with the change in Fermi level position was realized from XPS analysis. The chemistry of CdS film surface was studied which showed profound chemisorption of oxygen on the surface of CdS. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Agglomeration; Cadmium; Chemical modification; Chemical properties; Chemisorption; Data storage equipment; Electronic structure; Grain size and shape; Heavy ions; Ions; Irradiation; Light emission; Luminescence; Optical properties; Oxygen; Semiconducting cadmium compounds; Silver; Surface chemistry; Surface structure; Surface topography; Thermal evaporation; Thin films; Cadmium sulfide thin films; Cadmium sulfides; Combined effects; Core levels; Deep levels; Electronic energy depositions; Film surfaces; Glass substrates; Grain sizes; Intermediate energies; Ion fluences; Nonradiative recombinations; Optical bands; Polycrystal lines; Polygonization; Shi irradiations; Swift heavy ions; Xps analyses; Cadmium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58349090212

The accumulated dry active waste (DAW) amounts to around 36,600 drums. There are around 19,000 drums with evaporator bottoms, 9700 drums of spent resin, and 1600 drums of spent filters. This study proposes four mandatory items with regard to the radioactive characterization of LILW: namely, the total activity, surface dose, individual activity, and surface contamination. The required contents of the physical characterization include the weight (density), voidage, free liquid, and homogeneity. For the chemical characterization, the required contents include leachability, corrosiveness, explosiveness, and chelation. Finally, the compressive strength and integrity of drums are requested for the mechanical characterization. To determine the disposal priority of LILW in the Republic of Korea, the authors considered two main factors, namely, the waste management situation in Korea and overseas case studies. After considering those factors, the authors established a disposal priority for the LILW: (1) concentrated waste solidified with the cement and low radioactive DAW, the characterization of which can be readily identified in detail; (2) spent resin solidified with cement; (3) spent filters; (4) highly radioactive DAW, the characterization of which is well documented; and (5) waste that needs to be researched further, including spent resin in PE-HIC, evaporator bottoms and concentrated waste solidified with paraffin, and DAW that contains some harmful materials.

The storage system accumulates solar energy during sunny days and releases it later at night or during cloudy days and, simultaneously, it stores electric energy during off-peak periods and releases it later during on-peak periods. The control of the system rests on an anticipatory strategy and on a regulation strategy. The anticipatory strategy is based on a fuzzy logic and feedforward controller (FLFFC) that can handle simultaneously the storage and retrieval of both electricity and solar energy. It takes into account the weather forecasts for solar radiation and outside air temperature, and optimizes the off and the on-peak periods for electrical heating. The regulation strategy depends on a PID controller which regulates the air flow from an electric fan in order to maintain the room temperature at the set point. Numerical simulations were conducted over one to three-month winter periods to test the response of the controller. Results indicate that the proposed control system is far superior to traditional control systems. It remains robust and reliable even for cases in which the weather forecasts are of poor reliability and accuracy (5-day horizon weather forecasts with reliability of 50%, -10 K temperature accurate and -50% solar radiation accurate). The performance of the HTESS as well as the thermal comfort of the room is maintained in all situations and at all times. Moreover, the electricity consumption for space heating is minimized and 95% of this electricity is consumed during off-peak hours. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

L1H 7K4, Canada","The process of charging of an encapsulated ice thermal energy storage device (ITES) is thermally modeled here through heat transfer and thermodynamic analyses. In heat transfer analysis, two different temperature profile cases, with negligible radial and/or stream-wise conduction are investigated for comparison, and the temperature profiles for each case are analyzed in an illustrative example. After obtaining temperature profiles through heat transfer analysis, a comprehensive thermodynamic study of the system is conducted. In this regard, energy, thermal exergy and flow exergy efficiencies, internal and external irreversibilities corresponding to flow exergy, as well as charging times are investigated. The energy efficiencies are found to be more than 99%, whereas the thermal exergy efficiencies are found to vary between 40% and 93% for viable charging times. The flow exergy efficiency varies between 48% and 88% for the flows and inlet temperatures selected. For a flow rate of 0.00164 m3/s, the maximum flow exergy efficiency occurs with an inlet temperature of 269.7 K, corresponding to an efficiency of 84.3%. For the case where the flow rate is 0.0033 m3/s, the maximum flow exergy efficiency becomes 87.9% at an inlet temperature of 270.7 K. The results confirm the fact that energy analyses, and even thermal exergy analyses, may lead to some unrealistic efficiency values. This could prove troublesome for designers wishing to optimize performance. For this reason, the flow exergy model provides the most useful information for those wishing to improve performance and reduce losses in such ITES systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Inx(OOH,S)y is porous, and the interface between the Inx(OOH,S)y and CdS layers overlaps to a large extent.

PEMFC systems are zero-emissions power technologies when they are fed with pure hydrogen (at concentration higher than 97%); also, being the only results of system operation the produced electricity and some pure water, when produced by renewable sources hydrogen can be considered an attractive alternative to fossil fuels and may concur to the reduction of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions deriving by combustion processes. A miniaturized, few watts capacity system may represent a safe and unexpensive solution to perform analysis and predict the on-site performance of larger FC applications. The micro-model used for the experimental characterization is a module of a flexible, larger scale system, which is briefly described in the paper; the entire system is equipped with Nafion 112 membranes, two electrolysers, hydrogen storage devices and a Photovoltaic (PV) panel. The results presented in this paper are only a first set of results; others are expected to be obtained in the future by an outdoor monitoring campaign of the entire system, needed to allow an effective prediction of the on-site performance for stand-alone PEMFC systems fed by solar energy. After having simplified the analysis by excluding the parameters that the experimental data revealed to be less influent, at the end of this paper the characterization of the PEMFC system is completed by introducing a semi-empirical model, derived by graphic analyses and data regressions. © 2008.","External conditions; Micro-power Performance; PEM fuel cells","Cell membranes; Cells; Concentration (process); Cytology; Data storage equipment; Electric batteries; Electrochemistry; Experiments; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel manufacture; Gas fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Leakage (fluid); Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Solar system; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Applications.; Combustion processes; Data regressions; Electrolysers; Empirical models; Entire systems; Environmental parameters; Experimental analyses; Experimental characterizations; Experimental datum; External conditions; External temperatures; Flexible; Graphic analysis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hydrogen storage devices; Micro-power Performance; Nafion 112 membranes; On-site; Outdoor monitoring; PEM fuel cells; PEMFC systems; Photovoltaic panels; Power technologies; Pure waters; Renewable sources; SCALE systems; System operations; Hydrogen production; combustion; concentration (composition); cost-benefit analysis; electrokinesis; experimental study; fuel cell; humidity; modeling; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; prediction; solar power; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54149101288

We measured organic C storage (above- and below-ground biomass C, forest floor C, and soil C at 50 cm depth), soil environmental factors (soil CO2 efflux, soil temperature, soil water content, soil pH, and soil organic C concentration), and organic C input and output (litterfall and litter decomposition rates) for one year in FTW and non-FTW (control) stands of approximately 40-year-old red pine (Pinus densiflora S. et Z.) forests in the Hwangmaesan Soopkakkugi model forest in Sancheonggun, Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea. This forest was thinned in 2005 as a representative FTW practice. The total C stored in tree biomass was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the FTW stand (40.17 Mg C ha-1) than in the control stand (64.52 Mg C ha-1). However, C storage of forest floor and soil layers measured at four different depths was not changed by FTW, except for that at the surface soil depth (0-10 cm). The organic C input due to litterfall and output due to needle litter decomposition were both significantly lower in the FTW stand than in the control stand (2.02 Mg C ha-1 year-1 vs. 2.80 Mg C ha-1 year-1 and 308 g C kg-1 year-1 vs. 364 g C kg-1 year-1, respectively, both P &lt; 0.05). Soil environmental factors were significantly affected (P &lt; 0.05) by FTW, except for soil CO2 efflux rates and organic C concentration at soil depth of 0-20 cm. The mean annual soil CO2 efflux rates were the same in the FTW (0.24 g CO2 m-2 h-1) and control (0.24 g CO2 m-2 h-1) stands despite monthly variations of soil CO2 efflux over the one-year study period. The mean soil organic C concentration at a soil depth of 0-20 cm was lower in the FTW stand (81.3 g kg-1) than in the control stand (86.4 g kg-1) but the difference was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). In contrast, the mean soil temperature was significantly higher, the mean soil water content was significantly lower, and the soil pH was significantly higher in the FTW stand than in the control stand (10.34 °C vs. 8.98 °C, 48.2% vs. 56.4%, and pH 4.83 vs. pH 4.60, respectively, all P &lt; 0.05). These results indicated that FTW can influence tree biomass C dynamics, organic C input and output, and soil environmental factors such as soil temperature, soil water content and soil pH, while soil C dynamics such as soil CO2 efflux rates and soil organic C concentration were little affected by FTW in a red pine stand. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The power conditioning is achieved via a dc-dc converter and a dc-ac inverter stages to produce the desired ac source. This is also the case even when the load is of dc type, such as the typical portable electronic devices that require ac adaptors to be powered from the ac mains. The letter presents a hybrid PV-battery-powered dc bus system that eliminates the dc-ac conversion stage, resulting in lower cost and improved overall energy conversion efficiency. It is also shown experimentally that the switching ac adaptors associated with the various commonly used portable electronic devices can be reused with the proposed dc bus system. A novel high-gain hybrid boost-flyback converter is also introduced with several times higher voltage conversion ratio than the conventional boost converter topology. This arrangement results in higher dc bus levels and lower cable conduction losses. Moreover, the voltage stress on the hybrid boost-flyback converter power switch is within half the output voltage. Experimental results taken from a laboratory prototype are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter/ system. © 2009 IEEE.","DC bus; dc-dc converter; Hybrid boost-flyback converter; Photovoltaic (PV) power system","Ac adaptors; Ac sources; Boost converters; Bus systems; Conduction loss; DC bus; DC-AC inverters; Electrical grids; High gains; Hybrid boost-flyback converter; Lower costs; Output voltages; Photovoltaic (PV) power system; Portable electronic devices; Power conditioning; Power switches; Renewable energy sources; Voltage conversion ratios; Voltage stress; Control system stability; Conversion efficiency; DC-DC converters; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; HVDC power transmission; Portable equipment; Power transmission; Thermoelectric equipment; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349253052

The fluid-induced grid-to-rod fretting wear occurs with a certain fuel assembly design and/or in certain nuclear power plants, which may be strongly correlated with external and internal vibration causes acting on the fuel assembly. The external vibration causes may include reactor coolant flow velocity, nonuniform radial flow profiles caused by reactor internals, and interfuel assembly gap and fuel assembly-shroud gap, whereas the internal vibration causes may include asymmetric mixing vane pattern across the spacer grid assembly and inadequate spacer grid design. In this study, the external and internal vibration causes are described including three internal vibration mechanisms acting on the fuel assembly. The impact of internal vibration on the grid-to-rod fretting wear was investigated, based on out-of-pile vibration and grid-to-rod fretting wear test results for two kinds of fuel assembly designs as well as their operating experiences in commercial reactors.

We report the interaction of a potent synthetic derivative of curcumin, isoxazolcurcumin (IOC)with human serum albumin (HSA) using various bioyphysical methods. The observed fluorescence quenching of HSA by IOC is due to a complex formation by a static quenching process with a quenching constant of the order of 105 M-1. The binding affinity and the number of binding sites were obtained from a Scatchard analysis. Thermodynamics reveals that the interaction is entropy driven with predominantly hydrophobic forces. From the observed Förster-type fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), the donor (Trp 214 in HSA) to acceptor (IOC) distance is calculated to be 3.2 nm. The conformational changes of HSA due to the interaction were investigated qualitatively from synchronous fluorescence spectra along with a quantitative estimation of the secondary structure from Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. Molecular docking studies were performed to obtain information on the possible residues involved in the interaction process, and changes in accessible surface area of the interacting residues were calculated.

Using different amplitude solar forcing it was found that the resulting global atmospheric moisture content exhibited a high power in its wavelet spectrum at the 11-year frequency. To identify long term climatic trends, the Earth's atmosphere was conceptualized as a storage reservoir filling and depleting the atmospheric moisture with time. A high required storage implied that the climate ofthat region exhibits larger climate variations leading to a larger moisture scarcity or drought. It was found that regions that had relatively small storage requirements experienced an increase in storage required due to the 11-year solar cycle, while regions with relatively large storage requirements experiencing a decrease in storage.

The power law was applied to the growth rates of the four faces and the activation energies were calculated to be between 9.5 and 13.7 kcal/mol.

The data indicate that the porphyrin deposits are formed by a mixture of cobalt hydroxides, β-Co(OH)2 and α-Co(OH)2, and the porphyrin ring as radical. Moreover, the porphyrin electrodeposits absorb molecular oxygen as peroxo species (O22-), which has been detected in the films by IR spectroscopy, and which acts as a bridge between Co atoms (Co-O-O-Co). Also, monolayers containing a viologen derivative have been transferred onto the porphyrin-MIE (MIE, modified ITO electrode) by using the LB technique, and its redox process has been investigated. The results show an excellent mediator character of both cobalt electrodeposits throughout the viologen redox processes. Furthermore, the Co-porphyrin electrodeposits store atmospheric oxygen in a ratio proportional to the deposited porphyrin amount. This oxygen can be totally released from the porphyrin film via the electrocatalytic action of the viologen monolayer on top. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem imposed by the traditional voltage source inverter to develop the relatively high dc voltage from the relatively low ac voltages of an ac machine in the ISA system has been addressed in this paper. The proposed converter achieved boost mode dc-ac inversion and buck mode ac-dc rectification, hence allowing the peak voltage of the ac motor to exceed the dc source voltage substantially. In the rectification mode, it can achieve the regulated output dc voltage with variable-voltage-variable-frequency ac source without extra close-loop control or large energy-storage devices.

The nanodosimeter consists of a wall-less sensitive volume (SV), a series of collection electrodes and a single-electron detector, i.e. a drift column and a multi-step avalanche chamber (MSAC). To resolve temporally all the electrons collected from the SV, the possible replacement of the MSAC with a position sensitive gas counter has been investigated. In order to test if the leak microstructure (LM) counter can be used to detect single-electron in STARTRACK nanodosimeter, single-electron pulse-height spectra were measured in propane gas at low pressure (3 mbar). Experimental data show good prospects for this single step detector: LM detects single-electrons operating in proportional mode also at low pressure, the pulse-height spectra are well fitted by the theoretical Polya distribution, allowing to calculate the single-electron multiplication efficiency, which can reach a value of about 96%, quite similar to that of the MSAC detector. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Following a recent suggestion in the pages of this journal (Ross, J. J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 6987-6990), we have carried out a simple quantitative analysis of a direct molecular mechanism of energy transfer from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The simulation provides new insights into the mechanistic events following terminal phosphorus-oxygen bond cleavage during ATP hydrolysis. This approach also allows for the division of the energy-transfer process into elementary steps and for the prediction of the distribution of the standard-state Gibbs free energy of the overall ATP hydrolysis process among the various steps of substrate binding, bond cleavage, and product release in the enzymatic cycle, which had proved very difficult to specify previously. These predictions are consistent with available experimental data on ATP hydrolysis by protein biomolecular machines. The fundamental biological implications arising from our results are also discussed in detail. The aspects considered in this work enable us to look at the entire process of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and energy transduction and storage in various biological molecular machines in a logically consistent and unified way. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Adenosinetriphosphate; Bacteriophages; Energy transfer; Hydrolysis; Oxygen; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Phosphorylation; Thermodynamic properties; ATP hydrolysis; Biological energies; Biological implications; Biological molecular machines; Biomolecular machines; Bond cleavages; Elementary steps; Energy exchanges; Energy transductions; Enzymatic cycles; Experimental datum; Fundamental modes; Intracellular transports; Molecular mechanisms; Molecular motors; Muscle contractions; Oxidative phosphorylations; Oxygen bonds; Photophosphorylation; Product release; Quantitative analysis; Substrate bindings; Thermodynamic cycles; Transfer process; Enzymatic hydrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61949368396

The compound LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, quenched quickly from its calcination temperature contained Mn3+ together with NiO-like impurity phase and exhibited non-negligible 4 V plateau in the electrochemical test. The crystal structure of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 calcined at low temperature was observed to be normal spinel, the same with the quenched, and the cyclic performance of this compound was much better than the annealed possibly due to its higher electrical conductivity. Raman spectra for Al- and Zr-doped materials indicated that the structure of these materials was ordered spinel, whereas that of Cr-doped material normal spinel.

Our results reveal that the simple van der Waals surfaces of pure organic molecules are not good enough for hydrogen adsorption due to the weak interaction between hydrogen molecules and the organic molecular surface. However, doping of alkali-metal atoms in the above organic molecular systems increases their hydrogen adsorption ability significantly, mainly due to electron transfer from the metal atom to the carbon surface. This charged surface created around the metal atom is found to enhance the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the complex considerably, both in terms of interaction energy and the number of adsorbed hydrogen molecules, with a hydrogen adsorption capacity ranging from 10 to 12 wt%.

Further, the emissions from these processes are highly concentrated in CO2 compared to the emissions from power generation. It is not clear if these higher concentrated gases may provide low cost options for demonstrating CO2 capture or if this benefit will be lost due to the smaller total volume of CO2 emissions of most industrial processes. Nevertheless, this sector of the economy requires further analysis. This paper will provide an overview of the emissions from Australian cement sector including both the emissions from the chemical process itself, as well as the associated emissions from energy use within those processes. Specific attention will be focused on the Australian cement industry. While CCS involves the integrated part of capture, transport and storage, the focus of this paper is on the capture side and will illustrate CCS options for the cement industry. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Near surface monitoring is particularly important, as it is possible to conduct sensitive and direct measurements at the boundary between the subsurface and the biosphere (i.e. surface water or atmosphere). While discontinuous surface monitoring is often performed, continuous monitoring is preferable if one hopes to observe a leak in its early stages to allow for rapid remedial action. The geochemical signal that may result from a near-surface CO2 leak might take the form of increased soil gas concentrations (on land) or changing pH, Eh, and aqueous chemistry (in groundwater or surface water), and thus continuous monitoring stations capable of analyzing for these parameters have great potential for early leak detection. In the framework of the EC-funded CO2GeoNet and CO2ReMoVe projects innovative monitoring systems have been designed and constructed for autonomous deployment in marine environments above geological CO2 storage sites. The system developed within CO2GeoNet was tested at a site in the Gulf of Trieste where there is no gas release; this site was chosen due to easy access and the presence of an existing oceanographic buoy onto which the monitoring station was mounted. Tests on this early prototype highlighted the various difficulties of working in marine environments, and this experience formed the basis for a new system developed for deployment at the Panarea test site within CO2ReMoVe. This second site is located off the coast of Panarea Island, to the north of Sicily, where naturally-produced CO2 leaks from the seabed into the water column. The advantage of this site is that the leaks occur in a relatively near-shore environment (&lt;300 m) and in water that is not too deep (&lt;25 m), thereby allowing for easy access by SCUBA divers for system testing and maintenance. This location allowed the unit to be connected via cable, rather than a buoy, which makes power supply and data transfer simpler. The system developed for this site consists of three monitoring points that are connected to a land-based control unit. Each point, located 100, 200, and 300 m from shore in different CO2 flux regimes, is able to measure dissolved CO2 and CH4, conductivity, pH, and temperature using low cost but sensitive sensors. The complete system consists of flexible solar panels, a central control unit and three monitoring points, and data download is conducted using a GPRS connection and a web server. Difficulties with the initial deployment in early April of 2008 has necessitated further development work, with the second deployment planned for early November. The following paper discussed the experience gained with these stations, and presents data analysis and anomaly recognition from a land-based monitoring station that has been collecting dissolved CO2 data for over 18 months. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

K1A 1M1, Canada","The forecasted energy production of oil sands operations in Alberta in the year 2030 were optimised under CO2 emissions constraints, using a mixed integer linear optimisation model. The model features a variety of technologies (with and without CO2 capture), including coal and natural gas power plants, IGCC, and oxyfuel plants. Hydrogen production technologies are steam methane reforming and coal gasification. The optimization is executed at increasing CO2 emissions reduction levels, yielding unique infrastructures that satisfy the energy demands of the oil sands industry at minimal cost. The economic and environmental impacts of the optimally chosen technologies on the forecasted operations of the oil sands industry in 2030 are thus determined. The maximum CO2 emissions reduction attainable by using CCS in the oil sands industry in 2030 is 39% with respect to a business-as-usual baseline. This CO2 reduction results in an energy cost increase of roughly 20% for synthetic crude and 2% for bitumen production. CO2 reductions ranging from 0-35% can be attained by optimising the energy infrastructures, yielding energy production cost reductions between 9%-18%. The maximum CO2 intensity reduction is 46% for synthetic crude and less than 3% for bitumen. Energy conversion and CO2 capture account for the bulk of the energy costs for synthetic crude whereas transport and storage combined contribute between 2.6% and 5% over the entire range of CO2 reductions. The optimal energy production technologies are strongly dependent on the CO2 reduction targets. Power production without capture, predominantly NGCC and supercritical coal technology, is optimal at CO2 reduction levels of up to 30%. At higher CO2 reductions, only NGCC with capture and Oxyfuel plants are optimal. H2 production via coal gasification is optimal for CO2 reduction levels of 35% and lower. Above 35% reduction, steam methane reforming with capture is the dominant technology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Penn West Pembina-Cardium CO2 EOR Monitoring research program focused on well integrity, local/ regional geology and hydrology, extensive monitoring of CO2 and short and long predictive modeling. The geochemical modelling program of the Penn West Monitoring Project quantified the chemical reactions that occur between the gas -oil-water-rock within the reservoir prior to, during, and following CO2 injection. An equilibrium speciation geochemical model was used to examine the field produced water compositions. Many of the produced waters are undersaturated with respect to calcite. This is most easily explained when mixtures of waters of quite different chemical compositions are produced from a single producing well. This observation has important implications for the interpretation of produced water compositions and demonstrates that flow within the reservoir must be understood to fully interpret the chemistry signatures. A reaction mass transfer model was used to evaluate the chemical processes in the reservoir (short and long term) and to evaluate the thermodyn amic data base. It established that the dominant reaction controlling the short term water composition was ion exchange reactions, coupled with calcite dissolution and CO2 transfer from the oil phase. It was also used as a predictive tool to estimate them ineralogical reactions which will ultimately be responsible for the long term trapping of the injected CO2. GEM-GHG was used to calculate the chemical processes occurring during the various phases of hydrocarbon recovery, including the predicted evolution of produced water compositions, and th e results compared to field measurements. Discrepancies between the modeled and the measured field data can be used to refine the model, improving our understanding of chemical processes in the reservoir. The geochemic al models allow an assessment of the amount of CO2 trapping in each of the major units in the reservoir. There are large uncertainties in the absolute value of the amounts, but they allow a direct comparison between trapping mechanisms and a direct comparison between the trapping in each reservoir unit.

Because of this new paradigm, a group of 20 major oil &amp; gas, power, fertilizer and chemical producers in Canada joined forces in 2005 to form the Integrated CO2 Network (I CO2N) group of companies. This group recognized that developing CO2 capture and storage (CCS) within a vision of a long -term, large-scale integrated system would ensure that the technology is developed as quickly and cost -effectively as possible, and would encourage continued economi c growth decoupled from increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Decisions about a phased and integrated CCS system requires a long -term focus on Canada's energy and environmental policy objectives (2020 and beyond). This paper outlines the efforts to date by I CO2N to move CCS for ward in Canada-through its work on the economics of deploying CCS technology in Canada, what deployment of an integrated CO2 capture, transportation and storage network can look like and the evaluation of public private partnerships to share in the risks of early CCS adoption. Analysis is presented that quantifies the overall potential of the technology and explores the benefits and costs associated with CCS, including the associated benefits of the development of an EOR industry through the deployment o f an integrated CCS system. It also puts forward 5 key elements of deployment that are necessary to enable the widespread deployment of CCS at lowest possible cost.

One of the challenges faced in the implementation of CCS technologies, particularly in developing countries, is the shortage, sometimes absence, of a skilled technical and scientific workforce, but also a lack of knowledge about, and understanding of this technology among decision makers. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) initiated in 2004 the development of a capacity building program that consisted of developing training modules and offering training workshops in developing countries around the Pacific Rim that are major CO2 emitters such as China, South Korea and Mexico. At the same time, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) has established a Task Force on Capacity Building that has similarly developed a program for providing capacity building to the seven CSLF members that are developing economies. A series of capacity building workshops has been offered throughout 2007 and 2008. Based on the experience to date of both initiatives, some of the key learnings for future capacity building workshops are: 1) holding workshops in conjunction with a technical conference or similar event; 2) ensuring participation of key decision makers; 3) ensuring a varied workshop format; 4) ensuring that the workshop material addresses also the specific conditions of the host country; 5) ensuring organization of the material that allows flexible participation; and 6) providing printed material and simultaneous translation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A bottom-up simulation model is used to evaluate different policy scenarios. The results show that CCS plays only a moderate role for gradually rising CO2 prices. By using the scale advantages in CO2 transport already for the first CCS plants comparable to the level of large scale transport, the competitiveness of CCS is improved considerably. Furthermore, our results indicate that different policy options stimulate different types of CCS technologies. Finally, stimulating CCS and renewable energy sources simultaneously is more cost effective in the long run than stimulating solely CCS. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

K1A 1M1, Canada","A multi-period optimal energy planning program for Ontario has been developed in mixed-integer non-linear programming using General Algebraic Modeling System, GAMS. The program applies both time-dependent and time-independent constraints. These include, but not limited to, construction time, fluctuation of fuel prices, and CO2 emission reduction target. It also offer flexibility of fuel balancing and fuel switching of the existing boilers and option purchasing of Carbon credit if the reduction target is not achievable. The objective function incorporates all these constraints as well as minimizes over all the cost of electricity and meets the projected electricity demand over a span of 14 years. Originally it was used for only two study cases which are the base case scenario for Ontario where no CO2 emission reduction target is applied and the 6% reduction case to meet the Kyoto Protocol; to reduce its CO2 emission to 6% below that of 1990. This project utilizes the program for various similar study cases and beyond. The Ontario's study cases include different CO2 emission reduction targets ranging from 6% to 75% below 1990 levels by 2012. The overall cost of the electricity for different CO2 emission reduction targets increases linearly with slope of 1.3. Carbon capture and sequestration, retrofitting of the carbon capture and storage, and fuel switching are the main strategy in order to keep the cost of electricity relative low and satisfy the CO2 emission constraints. These results help us better understand the factors affecting the fleet's structure. It may also help plan the energy direction of Ontario and perhaps serve as an example for other provinces, territories, states, and even countries. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, world wide perceptions on climate change are pressuring energy companies to adopt global best practices to reduce carbon emissions. Developing currently unviable contaminated natural gas fields requires developing new technologies for high CO2 gas treatment. Current technologies available in the market for natural gas treating may not be ideally suitable for treating highly contaminated natural gas where CO2 geo-sequestration is required. Use of physical and chemical absorption solvents have been the most popular method for treating natural gas with high CO2, and to a lesser extent, membranes and adsorption methods. These technologies remove CO2 at near ambient pressures thus requiring substantial amount of compression to levels needed for geo-sequestration. Cryogenic CO2 removal methods can capture CO2 in a liquid form thus making it relatively easy to pump underground for storage or send for enhanced oil recovery. This new cryogenic CO2 removal method has been researched and tested in a demonstration plant and is soon to be implemented in commercial field applications. This paper intends to share recent field experience and test results from Cool Energy's CryoCell® demonstration plant in Western Australia. The CryoCell® process was developed by Cool Energy Ltd and tested in collaboration with other industrial partners including Shell Global Solutions.

In this study we evaluate and compare national approaches towards the development of CCS in the U.S.A, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. The analysis is done by using the functions of innovation systems approach. This approach implicates that new technology is developed, demonstrated and deployed in the context of a technological innovation system. By the assessment made in this study the strengths and weaknesses of the innovation systems are identified, which is vital for the development of a coherent (long-term) policy strategy that enhance the successful implementation of CCS. The performance assessment and comparison of the CCS innovation systems shows that the extensive knowledge base and knowledge networks, which have been accumulated over the past years, has not yet been valorized by entrepreneurs to explore the market for integrated CCS concepts linked to power generation. This indicates that the build-up of the innovation system has entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS in Norway, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and the USA. In order to move the CCS innovation systems through this present difficult episode and deploy more advanced CCS concepts at a larger scale; it is necessary to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions, i.e. entrepreneurial activity, market formation and the mobilization of resources. Moreover, in some specific countries governmental guidance and the creation of legitimacy also needs more attention. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This is understandable as different authors consider different technologies, scenarios, and reference cases, providing circumstances that preclude rigorous comparisons or evaluation of different alternative technologies.

K1A 1M1, Canada","At present, the use of fossil fuels in the current energy mix represents the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, an important greenhouse gas (GHG), which is largely blamed for global warming. It is estimated that roughly 26 to 30 percent of all CO2 emissions due to human activities come from fossil fuels used for generating electricity. Moreover, a variety of other industrial processes such as oil refineries, fertilizer and cement plants also emit large amounts of CO2. The opportunity therefore exists for a significant reduction of CO2 from industrial processes and power plants through CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS). Currently, there are three main pathways to capturing CO2 from fossil fuel energy conversion processes, namely, pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion with CO2 capture. Among these approaches, pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion take advantage of the fact that CO2 capture is further facilitated by increasing the concentration of CO2 in the flue gas stream, or by increasing the flue gas pressure, or both. There are several different processes available for CO2 capture and compression from low-pressure flue gas streams rich in CO2. These processes vary from simple straight or once through low-temperature separation and compression to more complex processes involving some form of recycle and/or auto-refrigeration. Given the economic constraints often placed on the cost of CO2 capture, and based on energy demand of each process, the ultimate success of these processes hinges on further refining the existing ones or developing new processes that can lower the cost of CO2 capture. The CANMET Energy Technology Centre in Ottawa is currently pursuing a leading research and development program in the field of near-zero emission fossil fuel technologies. This program includes the development of next generation oxy-fuel combustion technologies, as well as the design and development of efficient CO2 capture and compression processes to recover CO2 from oxy-fuel and other fossil fuel energy conversion systems. In this paper, we present and discuss the technical challenges, development stages and commissioning of the CANMET's pilot-scale CO2 capture and compression unit (CO2CCU). This pilot-scale CO2 separation and compression unit provides an excellent test platform to study the impact of flue gas impurities on the CO2 capture process. This advanced gas separation system is first-of-a-kind pilot-scale unit that represents an integrated approach to oxy-fuel combustion of coal and other fossil fuels with CO2 capture for storage. © 2009 Crown.","CO2 Capture; CO2CCU; Greenhouse Gas Emission; Low-temperature Gas Separation","CO2 Capture; CO2CCU; Complex Processes; Compression process; Concentration of; Conversion process; Cryogenic separation; Current energy; Design and Development; Development stages; Different process; Economic constraints; Energy demands; Energy technologies; Fossil fuel energy; Fossil fuel technologies; Gas separation systems; Human activities; Industrial processs; Integrated approach; Low temperatures; Low-temperature Gas Separation; Near-zero emissions; New process; Oil refineries; Once through; Oxy-fuel combustion technology; Oxy-fuels; Oxyfuel combustion; Pilot scale; Post-combustion; Pre-combustions; Research and development programs; Technical challenges; Test platforms; Carbon dioxide; Cement plants; Coal combustion; Energy conversion; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Petroleum refineries; Petroleum refining; Separation; Smoke; Thermochemistry; Carbon monoxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650099141

Electricity generation from fossil fuel combustion is a major source of CO2 emissions both internationally (32% of total CO2 emissions) and nationally (50% of total CO2 emissions). To effectively reduce CO2 emissions in the short to medium term requires CO2 capture and storage from these and other point sources as a part of the solution. The CSIRO Division of Energy Technology has undertaken a major CO2 capture research program covering many aspects of the technology. On the laboratory scale, the chemical reactions involved in CO2 capture and release by chemical absorption are being investigated and modelled to identify where and how improvements in efficiency can be made. A large scale screening study in which the CO2 absorption capacity of over 100 30% w/w amine solutions at 40 {ring operator}C and ∼13 kPa CO2 partial pressure has been carried out. This study has identified a number of novel amines as having outstanding CO2 carrying capacity. An apparatus has been developed used a stirred glass batch reactor, capable of withstanding pressures up to 1100 kPa, coupled to a pressure controller and gas delivery system from a high pressure reservoir. The apparatus has been used to collect vapour liquid equilibria (VLE) data by measurement of CO2 consumption from the high pressure reservoir. VLE data has been collected for three amines identified in the screening study at 1 mol L-1 and 40 {ring operator}C over the pressure range ∼0.3 to 900 kPa. The VLE results will be presented along with a comparison with MEA and an interpretation of the behaviour of the amines. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This interest in large part comes from the urgent need to develop anti-obesity and anti-cachexia drugs around target systems (such as the endocannabinoid system), which appears to be genuinely involved in energy balance regulation. When activated, the endocannabinoid system favors energy deposition through increasing energy intake and reducing energy expenditure. This system is activated in obesity and following food deprivation, which further supports its authentic function in energy balance regulation. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), one of the two identified cannabinoid receptors, is expressed in energy-balance brain structures that are also able to readily produce or inactivate N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG), the most abundantly formed and released endocannabinoids. The brain action of endocannabinoid system on energy balance seems crucial and needs to be delineated in the context of the homeostatic and hedonic controls of food intake and energy expenditure. These controls require the coordinated interaction of the hypothalamus, brainstem and limbic system and it appears imperative to unravel those interplays. It is also critical to investigate the metabolic endocannabinoid system while considering the panoply of functions that the endocannabinoid system fulfills in the brain and other tissues. This article aims at reviewing the potential mechanisms whereby the brain endocannabinoid system influences the regulation energy balance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously characterized the adipose tissue secretome and showed that [13C]lysine incorporation into secreted proteins can be used to determine the origin of identified proteins. In the present study we determined the effect of insulin on the secretome by comparing incorporation rates of 13C-labeled lysine in the presence and absence of insulin. Human visceral adipose tissue from one patient was divided over six dishes. After subsequent washes to remove serum proteins, [13C]lysine-containing medium was added. Three dishes also received 60 nm insulin. The other three were controls. After 72 h of culture, media were collected and processed seperately, involving concentration by ultrafiltration and fractionation by SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion of excised bands and LC-MS/MS analyses. The obtained spectra were used for database searching and calculation of heavy/light ratios. The three control data sets shared 342 proteins of which 156 were potentially secreted and contained label. The three insulin-derived data sets shared 361 proteins of which 141 were potentially secreted and contained label. After discarding secreted proteins with very low label incorporation, 121 and 113 proteins remained for control and insulin data sets, respectively. The average coefficient of variation for control triplicates was 10.0% and for insulin triplicates was 18.3%. By comparing heavy/light ratios in the absence and presence of insulin we found 24 up-regulated proteins and four down-regulated proteins, and 58 proteins showed no change.

Not all the effects of endocannabinoids on fat mass can be explained by the regulation of food intake alone. Endocannabinoids and their receptors are located in areas of the central nervous system and multiple peripheral tissues involved in the regulation of intermediary metabolism and energy expenditure. In addition to regulating food intake by both central and peripherally mediated effects, endocannabinoids modify glucose and lipid metabolism so as to promote energy storage via lipogenesis and reduce energy expenditure. The endocannabinoid system appears to be overactive in obesity and may serve to maintain fat mass and underlies some of the metabolic consequences of obesity. Inhibition of the cannabinoid type-1 receptor ameliorates the effects of endocannabinoids on food intake and energy metabolism; lipogenesis is inhibited, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake increase. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

When preparations are purified from microorganisms using classic sterilization techniques, serious degradations may occur, especially in temperature sensitive drugs and drug active components. Sultamicillin is the tosylate salt of the double ester of sulbactam plus ampicillin. Sultamicillin (SULT) tosylate has previously been shown to be clinically and bacteriologically effective in a variety of infections. The use of high-energy radiation, such as gamma rays, for the sterilization of pharmaceuticals offers considerable interest because of the clear advantages this process has compared with other methods of sterilization. However, radiosensitivity of irradiated pharmaceuticals is important in this respect. Thus, radiosensitivity of SULT and its potential use as a dosimetric material were investigated by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in the present work. Samples of SULT powder were irradiated at doses of 3, 6, 10 and 15kGy and ESR spectra were recorded at room and at different temperatures. Variations of different spectroscopic parameters with irradiation dose, temperature and storage time were evaluated using data derived from experimental ESR spectra which exhibited five different resonance peaks. Stabilities of the radiolytic intermediates at high temperatures were also investigated through annealing studies performed at 340, 345 and 350K. Rapid decreases in resonance peak heights above 325K were considered a manifestation of the unstable character of the radiolytical intermediates at high temperature, although they decayed relatively slowly at room temperature. Seven different mathematical functions have been tried to fit the experimental dose-response data, and a power function of the applied dose was found to describe best the dose-response data.","Dosimetry; ESR; Radical; Radiostability; Radiosterilization; Sultamicillin","Dosimeters; Dosimetry; Electrons; Electroslag remelting; Esters; Functions; Gamma rays; Paramagnetic resonance; Photodegradation; Resonance; Spin dynamics; Sterilization (cleaning); ESR; Radical; Radiostability; Radiosterilization; Sultamicillin; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449190890

To test this hypothesis in the field, juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) were collected from three exposure sites along Junction Creek, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, representing cumulative inputs from metal mining and municipal waste water. Overwinter survival potential was determined through measurements of growth (length, weight, muscle RNA/DNA ratio, muscle proteins) and energy stores (whole body triglycerides) in fish collected just prior to and following the overwinter period. We hypothesized that fish collected from exposure sites would exhibit reduced growth and energy storage compared to reference fish in both fall and spring, and that fish from all sites would exhibit reduced energy storage in spring compared to the previous fall. Whole body Se concentrations were elevated (11-42 μg/g dry wt) in juvenile fathead minnows and white sucker collected at two exposure sites in comparison to fish collected from the reference site (3-6 μg/g dry wt). In contrast to our hypothesis, fathead minnows, were larger with greater triglyceride stores at exposure sites compared to the reference site. White suckers were smaller at exposure sites but did not differ in triglycerides among sites. Overall, the results in these fish species exposed to metal mining and municipal wastewaters do not support the winter stress syndrome hypothesis. It is recommended that future studies focus on relating growth and energy storage with other environmental factors such as habitat and food availability in addition to anthropogenic contamination. © 2009 SETAC.","Growth; Juvenile fish; Lipids; Metal mining; Overwinter","Anthropogenic contaminations; Contaminant exposures; Environmental factors; Fathead minnows; Fish species; Food availabilities; Growth; Juvenile fish; Metal mining; Municipal wastes; Municipal wastewaters; Muscle proteins; Ontario , canada; Overwinter; Pimephales promelas; Reduced energies; Reference sites; Stored energies; White suckers; Whole bodies; Winter conditions; Effluents; Energy storage; Flywheels; Food storage; Lipids; Meats; Metals; Mining; Muscle; Online searching; Proteins; Sewage; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Fish; DNA; muscle protein; RNA; selenium; triacylglycerol; bioenergetics; concentration (composition); fish; growth response; hypothesis testing; juvenile; mining; overwintering; survival; wastewater; animal tissue; article; autumn; body growth; catostomus commersoni; controlled study; effluent toxicity; energy metabolism; fish; juvenile; mining; nonhuman; Pimephales promelas; priority journal; Semotilus atromaculatus; spring; survival; waste water; water contamination; winter; Animals; Body Burden; Energy Metabolism; Fishes; Industrial Waste; Metals; Mining; Seasons; Triglycerides; Water Pollutants; Canada; Junction Creek; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Sudbury; Catostomus commersoni; Pimephales promelas; Pisces; Semotilus; Semotilus atromaculatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61349184354

In addition, a new operational mode for the SRAM cell is introduced which allows only the bitlines of the selected columns to be discharged in an operation. The stability of the cells is enhanced in both read and write operation by controlling the cell access time and cell supply voltage, respectively. A 2048$\,\times\,$20 bit eSRAM unit is implemented in a regular 0.13 $\mu\hbox{m} $ CMOS technology to confirm the idea. The unit operates at 100 MHz and consumes less than 1 mW in both read and write operations.

Pesticide residue control is an important task for ensuring food safety. Common chromatographic methods used in the determination of pesticide residues in food require clean-up and concentration steps prior to quantitation. While solid-phase extraction has been widely employed for this purpose, there is a need to improve selectivity. Due to their inherent biomimetic recognition systems, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) allow selectivity to be enhanced while keeping the costs of analysis low. In this work, a MIP that was designed to enable the selective extraction of fenitrothion (FNT) from tomatoes was synthesized using a noncovalent imprinting approach. The polymer was prepared using methacrylic acid as functional monomer and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate as crosslinking monomer in dichloromethane (a porogenic solvent). The polymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nitrogen sorption porosimetry. The pore structure and the surface area were evaluated using the BET adsorption method. To characterize the batch rebinding behavior of the MIP, the adsorption isotherm was measured, allowing the total number of binding sites, the average binding affinity and the heterogeneity index to be established. A voltammetric method of quantifying FNT during the molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) studies was developed. The polymer was placed in extraction cartridges which were then used to clean up and concentrate FNT in tomato samples prior to high-performance liquid chromatographic quantitation. The material presented a medium extraction efficiency of 59% (for analyses performed with three different cartridges on three days and a fortification level of 5.0 μg g-1) and selectivity when used in the preparation of tomato samples, and presented the advantage that the polymer could be reused several times after regeneration.

These microstructual changes caused the decrease in the hydrogen storage capacity and the increase in both the plateau pressure and the hysteresis. The results were contradictory to the general observation that the plateau pressure decreases with the increase in the lattice parameter. The fact that the bond structure between H and Al and that between H and the transition metals differ can account for this discrepancy. This difference also resulted in the decrease in the hydrogen storage capacity.

No CO2 or other greenhouse gases emissions are produced in this route and carbon is obtained as a solid co-product at the end of the reaction (CH4 ⇆ C + 2 H2). This process can be thermally or catalytically conducted and recent studies have demonstrated that the carbon obtained in the reaction can also show catalytic activity. In this work, thermal and autocatalytic decomposition of methane were studied and compared with the steam reforming with and without CO2 capture and storage from an environmental point of view, using life cycle assessment (LCA) tools. As well, different energetic scenarios were included in the study. The selected functional unit was 1 Nm3 of hydrogen and the LCA was focused on material and raw materials acquisition and manufacturing stages. The assessment was carried out with SimaPro 7.1 software by using Eco-indicator 95 method. Results showed that autocatalytic decomposition is the most environmental-friendly process for hydrogen production since presented the lowest total environmental impact and CO2 emissions. Also, steam reforming with CO2 capture and storage led to lower CO2 emissions but higher total environmental impact than conventional steam reforming. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","CO2 capture and storage; Life cycle assessment; Methane; Pyrolysis; Reforming","Catalyst activity; Chemical reactions; Environmental impact; Gas fuel manufacture; Gas industry; Gas producers; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Methane; Pyrolysis; Steam; Steam engineering; Autocatalytic decompositions; Catalytic activities; CO2 capture and storage; Environmental feasibilities; Environmental-friendly; Functional units; Greenhouse gases emissions; Life cycle assessment; Manufacturing stages; Materials acquisitions; Reforming; Steam reforming; Sustainable productions; Using lives; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58949091416

For this purpose, an air-lift pump was designed and tested. Experiments were performed for nine submergence ratios, and three risers of different lengths with different air injection pressures. Moreover, the pump was tested under different two-phase flow patterns. A theoretical model is proposed in this study taking into account the flow patterns at the best efficiency range where the pump is operated. The present results showed that the pump capacity and efficiency are functions of the air mass flow rate, submergence ratio, and riser pipe length. The best efficiency range of the air-lift pumps operation was found to be in the slug and slug-churn flow regimes. The proposed model has been compared with experimental data and the most cited models available. The proposed model is in good agreement with experimental results and found to predict the liquid volumetric flux for different flow patterns including bubbly, slug and churn flow patterns. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Metallic frameworks (diameter: 5 mm, thickness: 4 mm) (N = 96, n = 12 per group) were cast in cpTi and gold alloy, airborne particle abraded with 150 μm aluminum oxide. Low-fusing glassy matrix ceramics and a conventional feldspathic ceramic were fired onto the alloys (thickness: 4 mm). Four experimental groups were formed; Gr1 (control group): Vita Omega 900-Au-Pd alloy; Gr2: Triceram-cpTi; Gr3: Super Porcelain Ti-22-cpTi and G4: Vita Titankeramik-cpTi. While half of the specimens from each ceramic-metal combination were randomly tested without aging (water storage at 37 °C for 24 h only), the other half were first thermocycled (6000 cycles, between 5 and 55 °C, dwell time: 13 s) and then mechanically loaded (20,000 cycles under 50 N load, immersion in distilled water at 37 °C). The ceramic-alloy interfaces were loaded under shear in a universal test machine (crosshead speed: 0.5 mm/min) until failure occurred. Failure types were noted and the interfaces of the representative fractured specimens from each group were examined with stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In an additional study (N = 16, n = 2 per group), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed from ceramic-alloy interfaces. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test. Results: Both ceramic-metal combinations (p &lt; 0.001) and aging conditions (p &lt; 0.001) significantly affected the mean bond strength values. Thermal- and mechanical-cycling decreased the bond strength (MPa) results significantly for Gr3 (33.4 ± 4.2) and Gr4 (32.1 ± 4.8) when compared to the non-aged groups (42.9 ± 8.9, 42.4 ± 5.2, respectively). Gr1 was not affected significantly from aging conditions (61.3 ± 8.4 for control, 60.7 ± 13.7 after aging) (p &gt; 0.05). Stereomicroscope images showed exclusively adhesive failure types at the opaque ceramic-cpTi interfacial zone with no presence of ceramic on the substrate surface but with a visible dark titanium oxide layer in Groups 2-4 except Gr1 where remnants of bonder ceramic was visible. EDS analysis from the interfacial zone for cpTi-ceramic groups showed predominantly 34.5-85.1% O2 followed by 1.1-36.7% Al and 0-36.3% Si except for Super Porcelain Ti-22 where a small quantity of Ba (1.4-8.3%), S (0.7%) and Sn (35.3%) was found. In the Au-Pd alloy-ceramic interface, 56.4-69.9% O2 followed by 15.6-26.2% Si, 3.9-10.9% K, 2.8-6% Na, 4.4-9.6% Al and 0-0.04% Mg was observed. Significance: After thermal-cycling for 6000 times and mechanical-cycling for 20,000 times, Triceram-cpTi combination presented the least decrease among other ceramic-alloy combinations when compared to the mean bond strength results with Au-Pd alloy-Vita Omega 900 combination. © 2008 Academy of Dental Materials.","Ceramic; EDS; Gold alloy; Mechanical aging; Shear bond strength; Thermal aging; Titanium","Adhesion; Alloys; Alumina; Aluminum; Barium; Bond strength (materials); Ceramic materials; Dental materials; Explosive actuated devices; Glass ceramics; Gold; Gold alloys; Metallic compounds; Palladium; Porcelain; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear strength; Silicon alloys; Sodium; Strength of materials; Thermal aging; Tin; Titanium; Titanium oxides; Adhesive failures; Aging conditions; Airborne particles; Alloy interfaces; Aluminum oxides; Bond strengths; Ceramic; Commercial pure titaniums; Commercially Pure titaniums; Control groups; Crosshead speeds; Dental ceramics; Distilled waters; Dwell times; EDS; EDS analysis; Energy dispersive; Experimental groups; Failure types; Feldspathic ceramics; Glassy matrixes; Interface characterizations; Interfacial zones; Mechanical aging; Metal combinations; Opaque ceramics; Pd alloys; Scanning electron microscopes; Shear bond strength; Substrate surfaces; Universal tests; Water storages; Titanium alloys; alloy; aluminum oxide; aluminum silicate; biomedical and dental materials; Glass ceramics; gold alloy; palladium; potassium derivative; silicon; titanium; titanium dioxide; vita omega; water; article; ceramics; chemistry; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dental bonding; dental care; dental etching; electron probe microanalysis; feldspar; human; instrumentation; materials testing; mechanical stress; randomized controlled trial; scanning electron microscopy; shear strength; surface property; temperature; tooth prosthesis; Aluminum Oxide; Aluminum Silicates; Ceramics; Dental Bonding; Dental Etching; Dental Materials; Dental Porcelain; Dental Stress Analysis; Electron Probe Microanalysis; Gold Alloys; Humans; Materials Testing; Metal Ceramic Alloys; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Palladium; Potassium Compounds; Shear Strength; Silicon; Stress, Mechanical; Surface Properties; Temperature; Titanium; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149239912

For AGC loop both thermal unit and hydro unit are individually considered. The thermal unit is considered with either single or double stage reheat turbine, hydro unit is considered with mechanical or electric governor. Integral controller is provided in the AGC loop. It is shown that the CES-based integral controlled AGC loop along with CPSS assists in the best transient performance of the power system in all cases under different operating conditions. Parameters of the CPSS installed in AVR loop, gains of the integral controller in AGC loop are optimized with the help of a novel particle swarm optimization, developed by the authors, called as craziness-based particle swarm optimization (CRPSO).

Tomato crop was grown in both greenhouses and plant growth and fruit yield were measured. Energy costs of the greenhouses (fuel oil for conventional heated and electricity for ATES) were also calculated. Consequently, these two systems were technically and economically compared. Collected data showed that ATES system have a good potential for climatization, both for heating and cooling, of the greenhouses in Mediterranean climatic zone. Between 20 October and 10 April, inside temperature of the ATES system heated greenhouse was never beloved critical level (12°C) and thanks to this performance never uses any fuel oil. On the other hand temperature fluctuations in ATES greenhouse were less than the conventional heated one. Energy cost saving with ATES for heating was about 70% in comparison with the conventional heated (with fuel-oil) greenhouse.

This study investigates three biomass chars produced from rice husk, forest residuals and wood chips under N2 and CO2 atmospheres using a drop tube furnace (DTF) heated at 950 °C. The char constitutes an unburned residue which has been devolatilized under conditions resembling in thermal history those in full scale boilers. Higher weight losses were achieved under N2 than under CO2 for each type of biomass, and the highest weight loss was that of wood chips biomass, followed by forest residuals and then rice husk. The results indicate significant morphological differences between the biomass chars produced. The wood chips yielded thick-walled chars with a cenospheric shape very similar to those of low-rank vitrinite. The forest residual chars were angular in shape and often had a tenuinetwork structure, while the rice husk chars retained their vegetal structure. Overall, the studied biomass chars can be described as microporous solids. However, in the case of the rice husk, the silica associated to the char walls was essentially mesoporous, increasing the adsorption capacity of the rice husk chars. The atmosphere in the DTF affects the development of porosity in the chars. The pore volumes of the rice husk and forest residual chars prepared under a CO2 atmosphere were higher than those of chars prepared under a N2 atmosphere, whereas the opposite was the case with the wood chip chars. The chars that experienced the most drastic devolatilization were those with the lowest intrinsic reactivity. This indicates a more efficient reorganization of the chemical structure that reduces the number of active sites available for oxygen attack. Overall a similar morphology, optical texture, specific surface area and reactivity were found for the biomass chars generated under N2 and CO2, which is a similar result to that obtained for coal chars. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we first develop a new heat transfer coefficient correlation by simulating a series of 120 numerical experiments for different capsule diameters, mass flow rates and temperatures of HTF and second undertake a comprehensive numerical analysis using the temperature based fixed grid solution with control volume approach for studying the heat transfer behavior of an encapsulated ice TES system. Thirdly, we validate the present numerical model and the new correlation with some experimental data obtained from the literature, and hence a good agreement is obtained between the model results and experimental data. The results indicate that the heat transfer coefficient varies greatly during downstream and highly affects the heat transfer taking place during the process. So, the solutions with constant heat transfer coefficient appear to be unreliable for analysis and system optimization. The results also show that the solidification process is chiefly governed by the magnitude of Stefan number, capsule diameter and capsule row number. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Their specific conductivities have been measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and were found ranging from 0.71 to 9.07 mScm-1 at 27.0 °C. In all cases, the conductivity of a given ionic liquid increased with a higher proportion of acid (1:2 ratio) which is explained mainly a smaller viscosity obtained in these conditions. Indeed, in most PILs, the dynamic viscosity (10.3-484 cp at 27.0 °C) is decreased by a higher acid proportion. Both parameters were used to construct a Walden plot in order to evaluate the quality of these protic ionic liquids (PILs) and compare them with common room temperature (RT) molten salts. The physicochemical properties of the PILs were then compared with the specific capacitance values obtained with a thermally prepared RuO2 electrode in these ionic liquid electrolytes. This work brings evidence that pseudocapacitance is involved in the energy storage mechanism of the PILs studied here and shows that PILs could eventually be used as electrolytes in metal oxide-based supercapacitors. &amp;copy; 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Acid ratios; American chemical societies; Dynamic viscosities; Electro-chemical impedances; Heterocyclic amines; Ionic liquid electrolytes; Metal oxides; Molten salts; Physico-chemical properties; Pseudocapacitance; Room temperatures; Specific capacitances; Specific conductivities; Storage mechanisms; Supercapacitors; Trifluoroacetic acids; Acids; Amines; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrolytes; Electrolytic capacitors; Fused salts; Ionization of liquids; Ions; Metallic compounds; Ruthenium alloys; Ruthenium compounds; Viscosity; Ionic liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65249177246

The hydrogen storage capacity of the LAH clusters (diads and triads) is improved with the existence of EE as evidenced by the enhanced weight percent.

The frontend electronics are instrumented with a mixed-signal Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), which incorporates 192 low-noise charge pre-amplifiers, shapers, analog memory cells and digital control blocks. Pulses are continuously stored in memory cells at clock frequency. Channels above a common threshold voltage are readout for digitization by off-chip free-sampling ADCs. The ASIC has a size of 7.3 × 9.8 mm2 and was implemented in a AMS 0.35 μ m CMOS technology. In this paper the experimental characterization of the Clear-PEM frontend ASIC, reading out multi-pixel APDs coupled to LYSO:Ce crystal matrices, is presented. The chips were mounted on a custom test board connected to six APD arrays and to the data acquisition system. Six 32-pixel LYSO:Ce crystal matrices coupled on both sides to APD arrays were readout by two test boards. All 384 channels were operational. The chip power consumption is 660 mW (3.4 mW per channel). A very stable behavior of the chip was observed, with an estimated ENC of 1200 - 1300 e- at APD gain 100. The inter-channel noise dispersion and mean baseline variation is less than 8% and 0.5%, respectively. The spread in the gain between different channels is found to be 1.5%. Energy resolution of 16.5% at 511 keV and 12.8% at 662 keV has been measured. Timing measurements between the two APDs that readout the same crystal is extracted and compared with detailed Monte Carlo simulations.

We monitored the EW response of aqueous solutions of gelatin (2-10 wt%) in ambient oil for various temperatures (8-40 °C) below and above the gel point. Whereas the drops remained approximately spherical cap-shaped under all conditions, the voltage-induced reduction of the contact angle became progressively less pronounced upon entering the gel state at lower temperatures. We modeled the decrease in contact angle by rninimizing the total energy of the drops consisting of interfacial energies, electrostatic energy, and the elastic energy due to the deformation of the drop, which was taken into account in a modified Hertz model. This allowed fitting the data and extracting the elastic modulus G, which were found to agree well with macroscopic storage moduli G' obtained with oscillatory shear rheometry. These results show that EW can be used as a tool for characterizing soft materials with the elastic moduli ranging (at least) from 10 to 1000 Pa.

Here we show that the major yeast TG lipase Tgl4, the functional ortholog of murine adipose TG lipase ATGL, is phosphorylated and activated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1/Cdc28). Phospho-Tgl4-catalyzed lipolysis contributes to early bud formation in late G1 phase of the cell cycle. Conversely, lack of lipolysis delays bud formation and cell-cycle progression. In the absence of β-oxidation, lipolysis-derived metabolites are thus required to support cellular growth. TG homeostasis is the only metabolic process identified as yet that is directly regulated by Cdk1/Cdc28-dependent phosphorylation of key anabolic and catabolic enzymes, highlighting the importance of FA storage and mobilization during the cell cycle.

A total of 360 oysters were grown in one-line baskets on the farm using six replicates that were sampled monthly. A range of environmental parameters were assessed and correlated against biological indicators for oyster condition, metabolism and antimicrobial activity. Food availability by chlorophyll a, was low throughout the study period (0.5-1.5 μg L- 1) and was significantly correlated to phosphorus concentrations. The condition index and shell weight of oysters significantly increased over the year, with the condition index dropping after spawning but then recovering within one month. Significant temporal variation in energy storage and utilization were observed in different tissues over the year. Glycogen in the mantle tissue was influenced by reproduction and correlated to chlorophyll a levels, but not in the gill or adductor muscle. The mantle glycogen and gill protein reached the lowest level in February when spawning occurred and presented evidence for seasonal variation in oyster metabolic activity. However, mantle and adductor muscle proteins did not drop after spawning indicating that these proteins contribute little to gametogenesis. Hemolymph protein was negatively correlated to water temperature and chlorophyll a, reaching the lowest level during summer. Hemolymph antibacterial activity significantly decreased after spawning, implying that the period of post-spawning is critical for oyster health. This study revealed trade-offs in the energy budget between immune resistance, growth, and reproduction. The results indicate that in a lean water environment, spawning events significantly regulate metabolic and immune capacities of oysters and a second year of rearing increased meat and shell weight but not the shell length. These findings are applicable to the management and development of oyster aquaculture within temperate southern hemisphere. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The conventional format of the gas material balance equation is the simple straight line plot of p/Z versus cumulative gas production (Gp) which can be extrapolated to zero p/Z to obtain G. The graphical simplicity of this method makes it very popular. The method was developed for a ""volumetric"" gas reservoir. It assumes a constant pore volume of gas and accounts for the energy of gas expansion, but it ignores other sources of energy such as the effects of formation compressibility, residual fluids expansion and aquifer support. It also does not include other sources of gas storage such as connected reservoirs or adsorption in coal/shale. In the past, researchers have introduced modified gas material balance equations to account for these other sources of energy. However, the simplicity of the p/Z straight line is lost in the resulting complexity of these equations. In this paper, a new format of the gas material balance equation is presented which recaptures the simplicity of the straight line while accounting for all the drive mechanisms. It uses a p/Z∗∗ instead of p/Z. The effect of each of the mentioned drive mechanisms appears as an effective compressibility term in the new gas material balance equation. Also, the physical meaning of the effective compressibilities are explained and compared with the concept of drive indices. Furthermore, the gas material balance is used to derive a generalized rigorous total compressibility in the presence of all the above-mentioned drive mechanisms, which is very important in calculating the pseudo-time used in rate transient analysis of production data. © 2009 Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum.",,"Aquifers; Coal storage; Compressibility; Digital storage; Gasoline; Petroleum reservoirs; Transient analysis; Cumulative gas productions; Material balance; Material balance equation; Original gas in places; Physical meanings; Reservoir engineering; Sources of energy; Total compressibilities; Gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088073188

Efficiency improvements and employment of nonfossil energy will definitely help mitigate the problem but it is generally recognized that 'pure carbon offsets' will have to play a major role if the problem has to be combated in a timely fashion. Discussion on pure offsets employing geological storage, (namely, Carbon Capture and Storage(CCS) is advancing rapidly. However major issues with this approach are its high cost and the long-term post operation liability. The author has previously proposed an alternate approach of pure offset - the charcoal sequestration, which essentially employs conversion of dead plant material into inert solid carbon. Charcoal sequestration promises to be both less expensive and a better option as far as the operational and post-operation liability is concerned. One of the numerous advantages of the charcoal approach is its easier reversibility both in terms of liability and costs. Although implementation of this approach at a scale where it can make a significant impact on global CO2 concentration needs to be preceded by a substantial information dissemination and public preparedness, a practical way to introduce it is through using municipal solid waste (MSW) as the feed biomass for charcoal sequestration. This will not only allow time for public acceptance to evolve, and evaluation of potential associated risks, but already help mitigate the growing problem of space requirement for waste-landfills, waste transport costs, and emission of methane from the rotting municipal waste, associated with the continued urban sprawl. This paper aside from describing the Carbon Sequestration from Waste (CSW) method, estimates the cost of carbon credit with this and other competing approaches such as the use of MSW for conversion to bio-alcohol, and for power generation. It highlights the difference between carbon credits associated with mobile energy needs (pure offsets) and stationary energy needs and makes a case for price duality of carbon credits. It also compares the global potential of CSW in combating GHG problem, making more than 2 wedges of Socolow with use of charcoal for soil enhancement and other purposes amounting to less than 0.04 such wedges. In this work the cost of carbon offset with CSW is estimated to be as low as C$2.6/tCO2e. © 2009 Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum.",,"Carbon capture; Charcoal; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Information dissemination; Public risks; Urban transportation; Alternate approaches; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon sequestration; Dead plant materials; Efficiency improvement; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Non-fossil energies; Space requirements; Municipal solid waste",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086690029

As with other key atmospheric variables, the atmospheric moisture content depends on the extraterrestrial solar radiation, with the large scale transport of water vapour as latent heat one of the main redistribution mechanisms for the uneven radiative input from the sun. This extraterrestrial solar radiation, however, is not constant but changes in a predictable manner with time, varying cyclically with a period of 11 years. To asses the impact of the 11-year solar cycle on drought, rationale was borrowed from the procedures used to estimate the storage capacity of a water supply reservoir. Regions of the Earth's atmosphere were conceptualized as storage reservoirs filling and depleting the atmospheric moisture with time. The amount of moisture in the atmosphere was conceptualised as the supply, and the demand for atmospheric moisture content was equated to 99% of the mean atmospheric moisture content for that region under a case where no cyclic solar radiation forcing exists. The required storage of our atmospheric reservoir is hence the largest volume of atmospheric water that will be needed to supply the demand during a drought period, so that the atmospheric reservoir is never empty. The critical period is the length of time from the reservoir being full to being empty. It is these measures of storage and critical period of atmospheric moisture content that are used to measure the severity of a drought. The larger the storage or critical period, the more severe the drought. Four GCM simulations were subsequently performed with the results being analysed on the basis of atmospheric moisture content storage and critical period. The four scenarios include a “No Forcing” simulation which uses a perpetual mean solar irradiance, and three solar variability scenarios. The first is a scenario where the solar forcing is the result of an 'envelope' curve fitted to the available solar irradiance data. The other two represent amplified versions of the first solar variability case. The results of the analysis of the above scenarios show that very large differences in drought severity exist between different climatic regions. The analysis also indicates that compared to a situation where no solar-variability exists, regions prone to severe drought exhibit a decrease in their drought severity, while regions of low drought severity tend to an increase in the severity of drought due to the 11-year solar cycle. It is noted that it may be plausible to suggest that this trend is exacerbated with higher amplitude solar cyclicity, though the nature of the results being inconclusive is a demonstration of the non-linearity of the Earth's climate. It is hence concluded that it is plausible to suggest, in the absence of all other forcings, and other multi-decadal solar variability, the 11-year cycle acts to increase the severity of droughts in those climatic regions which are not susceptible to significant drought periods.

This can be quantified by taking direct field measurements with wave buoys over time and then manipulating the data to derive typical conditions. However, taking these measurements is only feasible for very limited areas due to logistical constraints, and generating them with numerical wave models can also be expensive to run and may require data inputs that are either lacking or are highly uncertain. Instead, the relative differences in wave exposure between places (relative wave exposure) may be sufficient to distinguish between different community types. It is possible to approximate relative wave exposure using a cartographic approach. Typically this involves measuring the relative shelter or openness of a particular location based on the distances from it to the nearest potential wave blocking obstacle in all directions with provides an approximation of fetch. Given that dominant wind speed and direction data is available for a particular site, these fetch distances can be manipulated to estimate the potential wave climate at that site, with some models going as far as to link this to linear wave theory in order to calculate wave power. This works because the extent to which large waves can form, and to which seas are 'fully developed', is constrained by wind velocity, time and fetch. Mapping relative wave exposure in this relatively simple way could be used to predict the spatial distribution of broad categories of ecological community types, especially where this information is difficult to collect using more direct methods. Despite its relative efficiency and simplicity, running a cartographic-based relative exposure model for more than a local study area quickly becomes computationally intensive, which drives the need to set up the model to run as quickly as possible while minimizing the risk of not detecting potential wave blocking obstacles, and thus underestimating the wave exposure. Yet surprisingly, no studies have tested the sensitivity of the relative wave exposure estimates that these models produce to variation in how key factors, such as the density of points from which fetch distances are measured (point spacing), the angle increment at which the fetch lines are drawn around each point (fetch angle spacing), and the adjustment of fetch line lengths based on bathymetry, are set in the model. This paper presents a preliminary analysis that shows the extent to which estimated relative wave exposure changed when the above model settings were varied for four case study areas within the Great Barrier Reef selected for their characteristic spatial arrangement (number and density) of obstacles. This was done using a new GIS-based generic model for estimating relative wave exposure (GREMO) which integrates many existing techniques into a single modeling platform. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.","GIS; Modeling; Relative wave exposure","Computation theory; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Estimation; Geographic information systems; Sensitivity analysis; Water waves; Wave energy conversion; Wave power; Wind; Ecological structure; Great Barrier Reef; Linear wave theory; Numerical wave models; Preliminary analysis; Relative efficiency; Spatial arrangements; Wind speed and directions; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086278841

Box 330, Newcastle, NSW  2300, Australia","Various economic models have been applied recently to examine Australia's future energy mix based on projected cost and performance characteristics of emerging electricity generation technologies in the context of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. While these models do take into account the reduction in the cost of a new energy technology that occurs due to “learning-by-doing” or “learning-by-experience”, the rates of “learning” used in the one-factor experience curves are based on a small number of international studies. This paper discusses the development of an Australian model for technology uptake. It is also based on the robust one-factor learning curve. However, the difference with this model is that experience curves are placed into a three-region Australian and global economic model of electricity generation where the learning achieved by emerging technologies is a function of both global and local deployment of the technology, so called “compound learning”. Wind energy has been taken as a case example, where an international experience curve was developed for wind turbines and local experience curves were developed for installation costs. When further data is obtained, this compound treatment of learning will be applied to all technologies where a local learning component can be justified. In recent years the price of some electricity generation technologies has been increasing, most notably so for wind turbines and their installation. This price increase was not factored into the experience curves as it is assumed to be the result of market forces such as high demand for some types of power plant, profit-making and materials shortages and therefore separate from the phenomenon of learning. Rather the price increase has been interpreted as a “penalty” or price premium that entered the market once demand for wind turbines and their installation exceeded the capacity of wind turbine manufacturers. This penalty has been represented in the model as an additional payment to energy technology suppliers when investment in wind and other technologies is high relative to the total size of the power plant market. The compound experience curves for wind provided a more realistic outlook for wind plant investment and deployment in Australia and globally. The penalty constraint was successful in preventing large, sudden increases in new capacity additions for wind and other learning technologies. When large additions were made, it increased the capital cost, in line with recent capital cost increases. The resultant global generation mix was varied and increased steadily with demand for low emissions technologies. The effect of the penalty on the Australian electricity generation technology mix is that wind still dominates new low emission electricity generation in the next two decades given its relative maturity to other low emission power sources. However, the higher penalty for rapid expansion of wind power has meant that other low emission source such as concentrating solar thermal power commence their deployment sooner than would otherwise be projected. Another effect of the penalty is that wind is less dominant in the long term where black coal-fired power stations with carbon capture and storage, hot fractured rocks, solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar thermal power plants are the largest sources of electricity generation. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.","Economic model; Electricity generation technology; Experience curve; Learning curve","Bituminous coal; Carbon capture; Coal storage; Commerce; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Learning systems; Photovoltaic effects; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Wind turbines; Australian electricities; Concentrating solar thermal power; Electricity-generation technology; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; International experiences; Learning by experience; New energy technologies; Performance characteristics; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086255794

Graham et al. (2008) assessed the potential contribution of various alternative fuels in Australia under alternative carbon and oil price scenarios. It is apparent that vehicle electrification is an important strategy for reducing emissions in transport and there are two main approaches. The first is use of on-board batteries to store electricity drawn directly from the grid (assuming electricity is steadily decarbonised). A second path to electrification is use of hydrogen fuel cells. In considering these two different paths to electrification of transport vehicles, the major advantage of hydrogen is that it provides a similar travel range to current vehicles. The major disadvantage is that it lacks the equivalent fuel distribution infrastructure of conventional fuel or of the electricity grid if using batteries for storage. This paper focuses on the problem of building distribution infrastructure for hydrogen. Since we already have technologies for converting other energy sources into hydrogen (e.g. electrolysis, gasification and steam reforming) at a competitive cost relative to conventional automotive fuels, and because we also have fuel cell vehicles available in the market (notwithstanding the need to reduce costs), the problem of fuel distribution would seem to be the most pressing issue facing the future of the industry. A number of studies have contributed to the literature on the distribution of hydrogen fuel. Yang and Ogden (2007) studied the relative merits of three alternative delivery systems: compressed gas in trucks, liquid gas in trucks and pipelines. Compressed gas trucks were found to be ideal for low consumption markets at a short distance from the hydrogen production site. However if the consumption at the delivery node was high then pipelines were preferred no matter what the delivery distance was. If the distance was large but the consumption at the delivery site was moderate then liquid gas distribution in trucks was preferred. Mintz et al (2006) came to similar conclusions. These differences in the optimal distribution infrastructure arise from different combinations of fixed and variable costs for the three distribution technologies that may result in economies of scale or distance or both. Pigneri (2005) studied an additional distribution option, which is to supply electricity to an electrolyser directly at the refuelling station, and compared this to compressed gas trucks and pipelines. He found that there were cost advantages in the strategy of using the electricity grid as the main distribution system, since this avoided building a pipeline that would be under-utilised for many years. However, if the market penetration was above 25 percent the other distribution options were more cost effective. In the choice between pipelines and compressed gas in trucks, pipelines were found to be superior. Different hydrogen production and distribution models tend to emphasise different features depending on whether the model developer has a particular resource or delivery mode in mind and which outcomes they want to examine as an assumption or a model output. This paper develops a general model where both the choice of hydrogen distribution methods and networks are model outputs and tests whether such a model can reproduce some of the characteristics of the results in the literature. We use the State of Victoria in Australia as case study. The modelling results generally support past conclusions about the relative competitiveness of gas by truck, and liquid by truck and pipeline delivery modes. However, this modelling approach highlights the capacity inflexibility of pipeline hydrogen delivery in response to rising demand. The modelling indicates that pipeline delivery will not be economic during the early stages of market penetration, will reach a point of dominance when demand is significant but at short distance, but may lose significant share of the hydrogen delivery task when new small scale supply fields must be drawn upon as demand expands further. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.",,"Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Automotive fuels; Automotive industry; Battery storage; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Crude oil price; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Facings; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Liquefied gases; Petroleum transportation; Secondary batteries; Steam reforming; Trucks; Alternative delivery system; Building distribution; Distribution models; Distribution systems; Economies of scale; Hydrogen distribution; Optimal distributions; Vehicle electrifications; Pipelines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086255125

At the moment, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) seems to be the most suitable solution as they match good performances in terms of both consumption and reliability. In a such dynamic market, an interest for small and light city-car is rising, especially in Europe, where urban circulation is getting worst due to huge number of vehicles. Such special characteristics, like smallness and lightness, allow these hybrid vehicles to run 40 km with a litre of fuel only. In this scenario, the Hybrid and Electric Research Group of ENEA planned the realization of an hybrid power train suitable for small city car. The main target of the project, called ""Urb-e"", is to realise a power train able to achieve low fuel consumption (2.5 litre/ 100 km), low emissions (comparable to EURO 5 rules), with simple configuration and low power train cost. To fulfil this target a hybrid series power train has been chosen. In particular, during this phase the goal of project is to realize and to calibrate a power management system able to satisfy the requested performances (power, max speed, acceleration, etc.). The difficulty is due to the use of ultracapacitors (UC) as energy storage system because of the low energy capacity. In order to achieve this goal, different control strategies are tried to manage the auxiliary power unit (APU). The principal aspects of the power management system are shown. Some driving tests results are finally reported to instance the effectiveness of the developed management.

Vehicles, operating with alternative fuels like solar or hydrogen energy are still in the development phase. In this transition period, automotive companies are trying to produce more efficient road vehicles to reduce the negative impacts of the internal combustion engine. Advances in high-efficiency electrical machines (EM), high-specific energy/power units, lower-cost power electronics and embedded systems have promoted the use of EM solely and/or along with the internal combustion engine (ICE) to develop pollution-free vehicles. Due to the high cost of the energy storage units for a pure electric drive the current trend is towards the practice of hybrid electric vehicle (HEVs). This paper presents the design of a novel brake system, namely Auxiliary Pressurized Hybrid Brake System (APHBS), which enables energy recovery and a safe transition from regenerative brake (RB) to hydraulic brake (HB) with minimum intervene to the existing hydraulic brake line of the second generation Ford Transit hybrid electric van. To be able to develop a commercially feasible system, not only energy recovery but also safety is considered during the development phase. Since the vehicle's existing hydraulic brake module is not altered; system functions as a conventional brake system in case of a failure, panic stopping condition and violation of the limits of EM and/or battery. Under normal operating conditions and when the braking deceleration is less than the predetermined value, the proposed system runs the front and rear electrical machines in the generator mode to recover the kinetic energy of the vehicle resulting in fuel savings. If the desired braking force cannot be generated by regenerative braking, a safe transition is provided from RB to HB through the auxiliary pressurized brake line. This proposed system is simulated in MATLAB®/Simulink to demonstrate its successful operation. The simulation results have shown that a continuous braking without compromising the brake performance and energy recovery can be maintained by the implementation of the APHBS to the hybrid van.

The vanadium redox battery (VRB) has already been acknowledged worldwide as one of the most promising new energy storage technologies available for the world's growing market for the storage of renewable energy, backup power, and load-leveling. By 2006, several medium-to-large demonstration projects were completed in Japan, USA, Australia, and Italy. The VRB system has the same element, i.e., vanadium, in sulfuric acid electrolyte in both half-cells, and hence does not have the problem of cross-contamination inherent with other types of redox flow batteries. Although it offers a number of advantages for large-scale energy storage applications compared with other storage technologies, its main drawback has been the low specific energy of between 15 and 25 kW kg -1. In 2001, a second-generation VRB that employed a vanadium bromide electrolyte in each half-cell (G2 V/Br) was proposed. The G2 V/Br system combines the best features of the original generation 1 all-vanadium redox battery (G1 VRB) but with a higher specific energy and a wider temperature capability.

Since large amounts of electricity are required to pump, transport and apply water, the profitability of some business, as irrigation districts or fishfarms, which use the water as production resource, is heavily dependent upon energy costs. Methodologies that can maximize energy cost savings while satisfying system performance criteria should be sought for the design and management of the water distribution systems. Some of these methods can be: (a) to improve the selection and/or operation of pumping stations; and (b) to include a regulating reservoir between the water supply source and the delivery system. The alternative (a), related with the optimal design of pumping stations, refers to the selection of pump type, capacity and number of pump groups that results in minimum design and operating costs for a given water demand. With the alternative (b), if time-ofday energy tariff is available, the reservoir can be used for storing water that is pumped during off-peak hours to be used during peak hours. Also, the inclusion of reservoirs allows an equalization of pumping schemes that is not possible by pumping directly into the water delivery system. This allows pumping stations to operate near optimum energy efficiency. In this chapter, one model that includes both alternatives was presented. To implement this optimization process, two algorithms were developed: (a) Algorithm for selection of least cost or optimum pump combinations in water supply systems and to evaluate the system’s energy costs; and (b) Algorithm to determine the reservoir storage capacity that permits water to be pumped when energy tariffs are lowest and establish an annual pumping schedule in accordance with time-of-use energy tariffs. This model was applied to the water distribution systems of one irrigation district and one fishfarm located in southern Spain. The analysis indicated that the optimal selection of pump groups and/or the addition of a regulating reservoir was/were energy cost effective. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048403153

Some experts assert that this positive and affirmative reaction toward nuclear generation could lead to 'nuclear renaissance' in the near future. Korea, Japan, China located in Northeast Asia has not been affected by nuclear evasion policy (keeping away from nuclear policy) from European countries, their energy policies are still kept focused on nuclear energy. Each country faces lack of storage facility for radioactive waste. This paper explores possibility of building an international radioactive waste disposal and storage facility in the Northeast Asian region. It is considered that Northeast Asian region as one of candidates for international radioactive waste disposal and storage facility and investigated each country's situation and proposed recommendation to make the facility in this region possible. Through this energy cooperation idea, each country in Northeast Asian region can solves radioactive waste disposal and storage problem and strengthens energy security by utilization of more nuclear generation. Northeast Asian countries need to discuss the possibility of the construction of international facilities by increasing mutual understanding among nations. And, in order to prepare for changes of economic and social situation and to promote interests among the international communities, South Korea needs to undertake further researches and develop a cooperative strategy for radioactive waste management in this region. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","North East Asia; Radioactive waste; Regional cooperation; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024083796

The purpose of SAH is to improve the reliability of amorphous silicon films with extremely low thermal budgets to the glass substrate. The crystallization time shortened from that of the conventional solid-phase crystallization method. An isolated thin heater for SAH was fabricated on a quartz substrate with a Pt layer. To investigate the crystalline properties, Raman scattering spectra were used. The crystalline transverse optic phonon peak was at about 519 cm-1, which shows that the films were crystallized. The effect of the crystallization time on the varying thickness of the SiO2 films was investigated. The crystallization area in the 400nm-thick SiO2 film was larger than those of the SiO2 films with other thicknesses after SAH at 16 W for 2 min. The results show that a SiO2 capping layer acts as storage layer for thermal energy. SAH is thus suggested as a new crystallization method for large-area electronic device applications. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Capping layer; Crystallization; Polycrystalline Si; Selective area heating",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024036188

The activation energy for classical hopping is rather high and increases with the substitution of Mn for Cr. In the range of H contents nH investigated (nH=H/Me≤0.03) the chemical diffusion coefficient does not depend on the H concentration. ©2009 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","AB2 laves phase; Hydrogen diffusion; Hydrogen storage","Activation energy; Chromium alloys; Diffusion; Manganese alloys; Temperature; Titanium alloys; Diffusion in solids; Chemical diffusion coefficients; Classical hopping; Classical over barriers; Hydrogen diffusion; Laves-phase; Laves-phase compound; Low temperatures; Phonon assisted; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954496104

There is also evidence that increased intakes of these fatty acids can reduce body fat in humans, but human studies are relatively few and have generally been conducted over short time periods with small sample sizes, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Reported reductions in body fat may result from appetite-suppressing effects, adipocyte apoptosis and changes of gene expression in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, intestine and adipose tissues that suppress fat deposition and increase fat oxidation and energy expenditure.

The thermal energy produced can be used at thermal processes within the industrial plant as well as to the electric energy production thus avoiding the consumption of conventional fuel sources. Addictionally the storage of these residuals is very expensive as they are environmentally harmful, thus needing special storage care to avoid environment contamination. However, the direct burning of this leather-residuals-gas in the chamber is not a straightforward process. The alternative developed consists in to use this residual of leather for an intermediate process of gasification or of pyrolysis and to separate the volatiles, products of partial combustion, for after use as fuel in a boiler. The boiler may be part of a Rankine power generation cycle, or also a cogeneration cycle to produce the water vapor and the hot water to the manufacture process of leather, and the electricity to the manufactory plant. Another problem related to the burning of gas-product of leather-gasification consists in the presence of environment harmful-gases, remainings of the chemical treatment employed at leather manufacture, as cyanide, hydrocarbons as toluene, chrome and other toxic gases, as the carbon monoxide and NOx, that must be either fully consumed in combustion process or have their production minimized, with the purpose of reduce the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere. At this way, aiming a better understanding of the combustion process and in order to obtain an improved design of this kind of furnace, an analysis of the reactive flow in the chamber was done. Different geometries and dimensions were evaluated for new designs of combustion chambers, aiming the improvement of the thermal changes, the chemical reactions rates at the process and also of the flow field.

A normalized model is presented and used to process the seasonal TRNSYS results to investigate the coincidence between the solar-supplied cooling power and cooling load as the relative sizes of the cooling system and storage are varied. The normalized model yields a seasonal solar fraction and seasonal loss fraction (the excess solar-supplied cooling lost to the environment due to insufficient storage). Simulations were run for a zeolite-water adsorbent-refrigerant pair. Hourly weather data for Antalya, Turkey, were used for the transient simulations. Basic trends in performance were investigated as the following parameters were varied: system type (with or without heat recovery); incident radiation; maximum and minimum bed temperatures; condensation temperature; difference between condensation and minimum bed temperatures (bed excess temperature); bed's dead mass; collector type (flat plate vs. evacuated tube); cooling tower type (wet vs. dry); cooling system size; and, storage size. Results for the conditions explored include the following. Steady-periodic simulations show that the system's COP decreases with decreases in radiation and increases with minimum bed and condensation temperatures. Increasing the excess bed temperature increases the system's COP. Systems with an evacuated tube collector and wet cooling tower give higher system COP's than systems with a flat plate collector and dry cooling tower. The increase in system's COP due to decreasing the bed's dead mass and adding heat recovery is quantified. The solar fraction increases and the loss fraction decreases with increases in storage capacity, and both fractions decrease with increases in maximum bed temperature. The required evacuated tube collector area is smaller than the flat plate collector area while the required mass of adsorbent is independent of collector and adsorption cycle types. © 2009 by ABCM.","Adsorption; Air conditioning; Cooling; Simulation; Solar","Adsorption; Air conditioning; Condensation; Cooling; Cooling towers; Digital storage; Dust collectors; Environmental impact; Meteorology; Recovery; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Stream flow; Thermoelectric equipment; Tubes (components); Waste heat; Condensation temperature; Evacuated tube collectors; Flat-plate collector; Incident radiation; Periodic simulation; Simulation; Solar; Transient simulation; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925115369

The exergetic system efficiency is defined, which also takes into account co-generation. Is it shown that the use of waste heat gives the best efficiency. However, the efficiencies are still only around 10%. For well insulated office buildings, heat pumps and energy storage in the ground have the highest efficiency.

The use of a submerged vessel for compressed air accumulation allows to store energy during about 2/3 of the day, and releasing it in a shorter period when the price of electricity is high. During the storage period, energy is accumulated not only as compressed air, but also with sensible heat storage using a low-temperature molten salt reservoir. A dedicated heat transfer network, designed and operated with the aim of minimizing irreversibilities, is used for heat recovery, molten salt heat accumulation, and cooling of the compressed air in order to increase the mass stored in the submerged vessel.

Facilities consist of a 28 kWe natural gas microturbine, a heat recovery steam generator, two 5 RT (17,6 kWt) ammonia-water absorption chiller, fan coils and a cooling storage system. In the proposed cogeneration plant, the absorption chiller combustion chamber was replaced by a water jacket enclosing the generator. The chiller's generator is powered by the heated exhaust gases from the microturbine into the HRSG, through condensation of saturated steam at a pre-specified pressure inside the water jacket. The presented cogeneration plant operates in the Laboratory of Combustion and Thermal Systems Engineering (LabCET), which is located at Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). This work aims to evaluate the improvement potential of the presented small scale cogeneration plant based on exergoeconomic analysis, pointing out irreversibilities and proposing changes to the system in order to achieve enhanced efficiencies. Tests were performed to characterize the system behavior and measure main output variables such as microturbine and cogeneration efficiency, COP and electrical and cooling power. A computational algorithm was developed based on 1st and 2nd laws of Thermodynamic, and fed with data generated from tests. Concerning exergoeconomic analysis, processes that contribute with major irreversibilities in the plant were identified. Preliminary tests showed an efficiency of about 23% for the microturbine, COP of 0.49 and about 31% efficiency for the small scale cogeneration system, producing 25 kW and 10 kW of electrical and cooling power, respectively.

Such growth has obviously needed an equally remarkable growth in energy consumption by data centers, which require huge amounts of power not only for IT devices (servers, network equipment, storage devices), but also for power distribution units (including uninterruptible power sources) and for ventilation and conditioning. It is reasonable to expect that such growth trend will continue in the forthcoming years, given the ever increasingly important role that is being played by IT-related applications and services. It is therefore of the utmost importance to assess the energy consumption of data centers in order to devise possible ways to increase energy efficiency, because in a conventional data center the cooling and power distribution equipment can absorb the same power as the IT equipment itself. An interesting option is the use of distributed generation and combined cooling, heating and power systems (CCHP) designed to meet the whole energy needs of data centers, with absorption chillers used to recover heat discharged by a thermal engine (internal combustion engine or gas micro-turbine) or a fuel cell. Indeed, this would be an almost ideal application of trigeneration, given that electric and cooling power are always required simultaneously, and are not subject to significant daily or seasonal oscillations (with the result of very high utilization factors). Under these circumstances, trigeneration systems can produce relevant benefits for the environment, through reduced primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and for data center managers as well, through cost savings related to ""lighter"" energy bills. In this paper a study is presented offering a comparative analysis of the performance of state-of-the-art trigeneration technologies. In particular, the study compares the energy performance of a conventional data center with the results that can be achieved by generating electric energy by means of CCHP systems based on internal combustion engines and LiBr/H2O absorption chillers. The main results are presented in terms of reduction of primary energy consumption, of greenhouse gas emissions and of annual data center operating costs. © 2009 by ABCM.","Absorption chiller; CCHP; Data center; Energy efficiency; ICE","Absorption cooling; Combustion; Cooling; Cooling systems; Cost reduction; Costs; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Engines; Environmental impact; Equipment; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ice; Internal combustion engines; Operating costs; Refrigerators; Virtual storage; Absorption chillers; CCHP; Comparative analysis; Data centers; Information and Communication Technologies; Power distribution units; Primary energy consumption; Trigeneration systems; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925064099

The steam generator system has been defined with the design target of constant CHP outputs. This is made possible by combining modular parabolic trough solar technology, equipped with concrete thermal storage, and a biomass fed furnace compensates the solar field hot thermal fluid flow (HTF) drop related to the solar radiation changes. The Rankine cycle electric power output is given by a reciprocating steam engine, while the thermal power output is collected at the condenser. The power plant design and its operating behaviour have been modelled and investigated by using transient simulations with an hourly distribution data during a one-year period and climate data have been referred to the latitude of Rome. Furthermore, the assessment of the proposed RES power technology has been carried out by comparing its energy and environmental performance against solar-alone or biomass-alone plants of identical power outputs. The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the solar-biomass combination against the solar-alone and the biomassalone configurations. The combined CHP plant has been designed to supply an output power share of 14% electric and 86% thermal, with the possibility to use the latter either for heating or cooling purposes. When compared to the biomass-alone solution, the combined CHP plant was found to gain 14,1% saving in biomass consumption. While with respect to the solar-alone plant, keeping constant power outputs, it is found that the solar field foot-print was reduced by a factor 1:7.75. The above findings confirm the effectiveness of solar-biomass combination in terms of powerdensity pay-off for small size CHP concepts. © 2009 by ABCM.","Biomass; Cogeneration; CSP; Rankine; TRNSYS","Biomass; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Flow of fluids; Heat storage; Rankine cycle; Renewable energy resources; Steam generators; Sun; Cogeneration; Combined heat and power; CSP; Electric power output; Environmental performance; Rankine; Renewable energy source; TRNSYS; Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925064094

One of the main challenges of environment planning is to identify a model that connects all factors that determine the carbon cycle, that is, ocean-terrestrial ecosystem-anthropogenic emissions-atmosphere. Basic thermodynamic principles can be applied in a statistical modeling with historic time series to obtain atmospheric CO2 concentration, creating the possibility of construction of scenarios that will help decision making. A model that links all carbon cycle factors was developed in this dissertation work, focusing in four thermal of climatic zones (Boreal, Temperate, Tropical, and Polar) for calculations of atmospheric CO2 storage. It was developed with nonparametric models based in carbon dioxide records from station measurement: EIA (Energy Information Administration), CDIAC (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center), FAO (Food and Agriculture /organization), SIO (Scripp Institution Oceanography), etc. Results show that in 2100, the atmospheric CO2 concentration will reach a value four times higher than that of the preindustrial period. The temperate zone already emits almost half of the carbon dioxide to the atmosphere; by 2100, this emission will increase 15 times more than that corresponding to the tropical zone. China will be responsible for emissions in a proportion of 24 to 11 in comparison to that of the United States. Stabilization of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere will be obtained when the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions attain a decrease of at least 34% in 2100 in the temperate zone © 2009 by ABCM.","Carbon capture; Chemisorptions system CO2; Optimization process","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Carbon capture; Decision making; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Atmospheric concentration; Energy Information Administration; Environment planning; Non-parametric model; Terrestrial ecosystems; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925038037

The complex would operate on a year round basis with the 'wastes' of one product being the feedstock for another. The complex could be introduced in stages to an existing sugar mill and is illustrated in block flow diagram and described in the text. The concept is based on existing and developing practice in producing sugar, paper pulp and fertiliser. By integrating operations we believe the sugar industry could effect a major increase in income, profitability and market flexibility. By expanding into new growth areas the concept could minimise Australia's energy and climate change problems. Potential products of an IAIC include; paper pulp, motor fuel ethanol, Ecophos a non-leaching fertiliser, sugar, lignin and electric power. Crops include; high fibre sugarcanes, sweet sorghum and nalgrass. Other raw materials include; phosphatic mine waste, fertiliser grade potash, lime and hydrogen peroxide. The main 'wastes' arise from producing paper pulp and are pith and other fines removed from bagasse to make a strong paper pulp, and potash pulping black liquor. Integration of sugar milling with the processing of other products allows a major saving in capital and operating costs. In particular it avoids the storage and reclaim of bagasse ahead of paper pulp production. Integration also allows the production of ethanol without the need to produce and dilute molasses feedstock. As an indication, the requirement of modifying an 'average size' sugar mill could be of the order of $100 million and the engagement of 30 extra mill employees. The exact numbers would depend on location and product mix. The major capital and operating costs involve addition of an ethanol plant. Potash pulping without reagent recycling is relatively cheap, as is alkali fertiliser manufacture from crandallites (the overburden waste from certain phosphate mines).

WL occupies approximately 4400 hectares of land and employed more than 1000 staff up to the late-1990s, when the closure decision was made. Nuclear facilities at WL included a research reactor, hot cell facilities and radiochemical laboratories. Programs carried out at the WL site included high level nuclear fuel waste management research, reactor safety research, nuclear materials research, accelerator technology, biophysics, and industrial radiation applications. In preparation for decommissioning, a comprehensive environmental assessment was successfully completed [1] and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission issued a six-year decommissioning licence for WL starting in 2003 - the first decommissioning licence issued for a Nuclear Research and Test Establishment in Canada. This paper describes the progress in this first sixyear licence period. A significant development in 2006 was the establishment of the Nuclear Legacy Liabilities Program (NLLP), by the Government of Canada, to safely and cost effectively reduce,and eventually eliminate the nuclear legacy liabilities and associated risks, using sound waste management and environmental principles. The NLLP endorsed an accelerated approach to WL Decommissioning, which meant advancing the full decommissioning of buildings and facilities that had originally been planned to be decontaminated and prepared for storage-with-surveillance. As well the NLLP endorsed the construction of enabling facilities - facilities that employ modern waste handling and storage technology on a scale needed for full decommissioning of the large radiochemical laboratories and other nuclear facilities. The decommissioning work and the design and construction of enabling facilities are fully underway. Several redundant nonnuclear buildings have been removed and redundant nuclear facilities are being decontaminated and prepared for demolition. Along with decommissioning of redundant structures, site utilities are being decommissioned and reconfigured to reduce site operating costs. New waste handling and waste clearance facilities have been commissioned and a large shielded modular above ground storage (SMAGS) structure is in final design in preparation for construction in 2010. The eventual goal is full decommissioning of all facilities and infrastructure and removal of stored wastes from the site. © 2009 by ASME.",,"Accident prevention; Application programs; Chemical laboratories; Environmental management; Industrial research; Nuclear energy; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive wastes; Waste management; Accelerator technology; Canadian nuclear safety commissions; Comprehensive environmental assessment; Design and construction; Management research; Nuclear facilities; Nuclear fuel wastes; Storage technology; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905921408

Unfortunately small & medium enterprises (SMEs), the large majority of firms in a country, generally do not have a high operational energy efficiency, since they are characterized mainly by scarcely standardized operations and cannot afford too expensive energy audits and management programs. This paper aims at introducing an innovative framework that has been developed to achieve the operational energy efficiency of SMEs. Firstly, through an accurate breakdown of the firm into functional units, the main consuming areas are identified so that a criticality index can be defined; secondly, an enhancement index highlights the gap of each unit towards the best available techniques/practices (BAT/Ps) in energy management programs. Finally, a synthetic index (priority index) created by the junction of the two previous indexes, points out the most profitable areas in which energy saving actions should be implemented. The methodology, particularly quick and simple, has been successfully tested in 25 SMEs in Northern Italy.","Best available practices; Best available techniques; Energy efficiency; Small medium enterprises","Competition; Energy efficiency; Industry; Best available practices; Best available techniques; Competitive advantage; Energy management programs; Enhancement index; Management programs; Operational energy; Small medium enterprise; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898493084

The injection is realised in two steps. First, hydrogen is simply metered by an electro-injector (a conventional one for Compressed Natural Gas - CNG application) that feeds a small intermediate chamber. Next, hydrogen enters the cylinder by means of a mechanically-actuated valve which allows higher flow than any electro-injector. Injection must end early enough to allow good charge homogeneity and, in any case, before in-cylinder pressure rise constraints hydrogen admission. Backfire is avoided by starting injection at intake valve closing. A prototype has been realised modifying a single-cylinder 650 cc production engine with three intake valves. The central one has been modified and properly timed to in-cylinder inject hydrogen from the intermediate chamber. Hydrogen injection through different-shape poppet valves in a quiescent, constant volume has been simulated in order to investigate the effects of valve and seat-valve geometries in controlling fuel-air mixing in the cylinder. Additional predictions for the actual engine configuration indicate that an acceptable fuel distribution can be obtained in the combustion chamber at the spark timing, with equivalence ratios in the ignition region that are inside the flammability range of the mixture for all the operating conditions (loads and speeds) that have been considered.

This article focuses on the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as solvent-free electrolytes. A survey of the physical-chemical properties of the most investigated ILs is given to highlight the main requirements for effective use of ILs in supercapacitors. The properties of electrode materials for IL-based supercapacitors, which should be tailored in relation to the nature of the IL, are discussed and particular emphasis is given to double-layer carbon materials.

Since sensor nodes suffer from limited resources, in memory storage, computing power, energy capabilities and transmission rates, available network security protocols are inadequate. Symmetric algorithms cannot provide the same degree of security as public key algorithms, leading us to devise a new algorithm SHESP that uses public keys within the limitations of sensor nodes. This paper presents a way to utilise existing public key algorithms such as RSA, Diffie-Hellmann and elliptic curve in the field of WSN security by dividing the network into clusters. Our algorithm supplies data confidentiality, node authentication and data integrity while remaining within acceptable memory, time and energy constraints. We provide theoretical and experimental evidence to validate our algorithms. Results reveal significant improvement in data availability, data confidentiality and authenticity while reducing the communication and computation overhead.

The extent of the destabilization, as well as the sorption characteristics of the composites, strongly depends on the structural and nanostructural properties of the constituent hydrides, which are in turn affected by the preparation route. The aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of different mechanical activation conditions on the storage properties of NaBH4 - MgH2 composites, up to now scarcely explored in literature. The first results regard composites with 2:1 and 1:2 stoichiometry milled under different atmosphere (Ar or H2). X-ray powders diffraction analysis shows that milling does not lead to the formation of any new phase, but it reduces the average crystallite size of the powders down to nanometric scale. All the mixtures release an H2 amount close to the theoretical value expected for the full dissociation of both the hydrides and much higher than the target fixed by the US Department of Energy for on-board application. The thermal programmed desorption profiles of the mixtures clearly show two steps, with MgH2 dissociating first and with higher rate and NaBH4 gradually dehydrogenating at temperatures close to 400°C. Concerning the 2:1 stoichiometry, when the samples are processed under Ar the two dehydrogenation processes are characterized by a lower starting temperature but also by a lower average rate with respect to the sample milled in H2. The 1:2 sample milled under Ar shows the best kinetic performance. Unfortunately, also for this mixture more than 10 h are required to obtain full desorption at a temperature as high as 450°C. © 2009 WIT Press.","Dehydrogenation enthalpy; High energy mechanical milling; Reactive hydride composites (RHC); Sorption kinetics; Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875783753

An individual sensor node's storage capacity is too small to hold it and may soon overflow. Therefore, we propose an effective caching strategy based on cooperation among various sensor nodes to form a larger cumulative cache. As part of the complete caching scheme, a novel token-based cache admission control scheme is devised, which ensures proximity of cached data closer to sink(s). A cache discovery mechanism to efficiently fetch a copy of data items is developed. A single-copy cache coherency scheme is developed to avoid sink from fetching stale data and also avoids undesired data replication. Further, a least utility based item-replacement policy is developed to evict data items with the least utility in case of desired replacement. Simulation results show significant improvements in network energy savings and data availability when cooperative caching is used.

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a genetically and biochemically manipulable unicellular eukaryote with annotated genome and very simple lipidome, is a valuable model for studying biological functions of various lipid species in multicellular eukaryotes. S. cerevisiae has 10 major classes of lipids with chain lengths mainly of 16 or 18 carbon atoms and either zero or one degree of unsaturation. Existing methods for lipid identification and quantification - such as high performance liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, fluorescence microscopy, and gas chromatography followed by MS - are well established but have low sensitivity, insufficiently separate various molecular forms of lipids, require lipid derivitization prior to analysis, or can be quite time consuming. Here we present a detailed description of our experimental approach to solve these inherent limitations by using survey-scan ESI/MS for the identification and quantification of the entire complement of lipids in yeast cells. The described method does not require chromatographic separation of complex lipid mixtures recovered from yeast cells, thereby greatly accelerating the process of data acquisition. This method enables lipid identification and quantification at the concentrations as low as g/ml and has been successfully applied to assessing lipidomes of whole yeast cells and their purified organelles. Lipids extraction from whole yeast cells for using this method of lipid analysis takes two to three hours. It takes only five to ten minutes to run each sample of extracted and dried lipids on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray source. © JoVE 2006-2011 All Rights Reserved.","Cellular Biology; Issue 30; Lipid identification; Lipid quantification; Lipidomics; Mass spectrometry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80355138506

They are used as energy sources for an absorption machine whose objective is to obtain chilled water for the fan-coil system. All these components are included or excluded from the cooling system by means of switching valves and activating or deactivating signals. The switching among different configuration modes in real time increases the system challenge to be modeled or controlled, due to the mix of both discrete signals and continuous dynamics.

Dynamic storage modulus (E') and Tan δ were measured in a temperature range from 30 °C to 150 °C using DMA. The value of the storage modulus was found to increase initially but then decreased with further addition of the PVC in the matrix. Transition temperature (Tg) of pure PMMA and pure PVC is found to be at 90 °C and 52 °C, respectively. The result shows that the two polymers are miscible upto about 50wt % of PMMA.

Also the mechanical properties like elongation at break and fracture energy of the PMMA/ PVC blends increase with the increasing concentration of PVC in PMMA indicating a high level of compatibility between the two polymers. This partial miscibility and compatibility is due to specific interaction between carbonyl groups (C= O) of PMMA and hydrogen from (CHCl) groups of PVC.","Dynamic mechanical analyzer; Glass transition temperature; Poly (methyl methacrylate); Poly (vinyl chloride); Scanning electron microscopy","Chlorine compounds; Dynamics; Elastic moduli; Esters; Glass transition; Polymer blends; Polymethyl methacrylates; Polyvinyl chlorides; Scanning electron microscopy; Solubility; Temperature; Carbonyl groups; Dynamic mechanical analyzer; Elongation at break; Morphology and mechanical properties; Partial miscibility; Solution-casting method; Specific interaction; Temperature range; C (programming language)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955666795

Pd(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate (Pd(hfa)2) is dissolved in scCO2 as a metal precursor. Electrochemical reduction of the Pd(II) is executed by dimethyl amineborane (DMAB). Owing to the high diffusivity, near-zero surface tension, and low viscosity of the scCO2 fluid, the deposited Pd nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed and tightly anchored on the surface of CNTs. The microstructure, chemical composition, and crystallinity of the prepared Pd/CNTs nano-composites are characterized with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS), and an X-ray diffractometer (XRD), respectively.

The first project is for the heating and cooling of a supermarket using Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) in Mersin. With a 60% higher Coefficient of Performance (COP), the yearly CO2 emissions reduction contribution of this project is 113 tonnes. The second project concerns ATES for the heating and cooling of a greenhouse in Adana. The greenhouse was used as a ‘solar collector’ and source of energy for the ATES system. No fossil fuels were consumed for heating the greenhouse and cooling was made possible with the ATES system. Energy conservation amounted to 68% and CO2 emissions were reduced by 26 tonnes/year. The third one is a pilot project using TES in microencapsulated phase change materials in a test cabin in Adana with a floor area of 4 m2. By using a 3.5 kg Phase Change Material (PCM) together with insulation panels in the test cabin, 7% cooling energy and 28% heating energy can be conserved.

A large debate on sustainable energy has been considering the potential benefits of a hydrogen economy mainly relying on low- or carbon-free primary energy sources. The new energy system would be based on hydrogen, together with electricity, as the fuel and energy carrier, and require significant changes in its major components, from production to end-use technologies, by involving public awareness and acceptance. The attractive potential of hydrogen is countered by uncertainties about the development and the economics of the implied key enabling technologies, such as renewable energy sources, advanced production processes, fuel cells (FCs), novel storage technologies, safety, and a brand new or a substantially modified infrastructure. The implementation process is not fully defined with opinion and discussions about the ways to proceed.

An air accumulator provides pressurized air, which is passed through the expander section of the same microturbine used to charge the accumulator. The air passing through the IBC is cooled due to expansion, simultaneously providing power and cooling the flow. As the microturbine is indirectly fired, the flow passing through the engine or IBC can be directly vented into the household-eliminating the need for additional heat exchangers. The size of the cycle studied is on the order of 10 Kw(e), suitable for a domestic household; however, the system is easily scaled for larger commercial applications. The majority of the components in the system being studied are ""off the shelf"" products. A feasibility study was conducted to ensure that the proposed system is economically competitive with systems currently used, such as individual generation provided by an air conditioner (A/C), a high efficiency natural gas (NG) furnace, and grid power. Simulations were run for a full year based on the actual external temperature and the electrical and thermal loads for a single family detached dwelling located in Winnipeg, Canada. Performance data were generated using MATLAB™ while the economic performance was determined with timebased simulations conducted using SIMULINK™. The system is designed to allow energy islanding by providing for all household energy needs throughout the year; however, integration with a power grid is optional. It was found that the operating costs for the proposed trigeneration system in an energy islanding mode of operation were equivalent to or less than individual generation (A/C unit, NG furnace, and grid power) during heating modes of operation and were more expensive for cooling modes of operation. The yearly energy cost for the trigeneration system exceeded the individual generation costs by 30-40%; however, there remains much room for improvement to the trigeneration concept.

Application of controlled and=or modified atmosphere (CA-MA) storage (low oxygen alone or coupled with carbon dioxide) prevents and=or delays the rate of ripening of fruit, resulting in the maintenance of their commercial life (Kader, 1986). In addition, ultra low oxygen or anaerobic conditions have been recently applied as new postharvest quarantine treatments to confine insect infestations (Shellie, 2002; Shellie et al., 1997). Furthermore, there are a number of standard commercial practices such as wax coatings, packing in plastic liners, etc. in which the supply of oxygen to fruit in general may be limited.

Currently the main additional water source targets are Mulgrave aquifer and Lake Placid (Barron River) water treatment plants (WTP). We present a cost and environmentally superior alternative which is to access the (East) Mulgrave River at the back of Bellenden Ker Mountain via a tunnel from the coastal plane. First we present a stream-flow model for the catchment of the East Mulgrave River above 600 m and show that sufficient water is available at that point for a water intake. This model is based on recent rainfall and cloud-stripping research by Dr David McJannet performed on Mount Bellenden Ker. Second we present a costing model for the construction of a one-lane, 6.5 km vehicular tunnel from the base of the mountain near Bellenden Ker township to the back of the mountain at 600 m, and associated infrastructure. The model incorporates a pipeline that takes water from the intake at 600 m to Gordonvale via the base of the tunnel where a power station generates sufficient electricity to run 1500+ homes. This costing model includes an option where the tunnel is the proof of concept for automated mining thereby attracting significant federal funding opportunities. The construction costs are similar to the WTP options however once in operation the tunnel power plant generates income by producing hydro-electricity while a WTP consumes large amounts of energy and other resources. As with the existing Behana Ck intake, the proposed intake only requires filtering and chlorination. Third we present an environmental impact discussion com-paring our proposal to the WTP.

The low temperature requirement is a suitable characteristic to integrate multi-effect distillation units as bottom system. Obviously, one of the best options is to use low-grade heat from power plants or gas turbines as a cogeneration system. Mitigation of CO2 emissions from power plants will be a priority for most of power companies in a near future, one of the most promising techniques is carbon capture and storage. Nevertheless, energy requirements and efficiency penalties in the overall system are some of their disadvantages. They are largely caused by CO2 compression above both its critical temperature and pressure prior storage. There are a huge low-grade heat coming from condensing water in the CO2 stream and from compressors intercooling that is suitable to reduce energy penalties in CO2 capture process and to produce desalted water. With the aim of analyzing these combined systems (desalination unit, power plant and CO2 capture), five different integration configurations have been proposed and simulated. Three aspects have been analyzed: the energy penalty in the steam cycle, the water costs associated to thermal energy and their environmental impact. Results show that although CO2 capture systems reduce power generation and therefore increases its costs, available heat from those systems could produce distilled water at affordable costs. ©2009 Desalination Publications.","Energy integration; Multi-effect distillation; Residual heat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954206110

Two possible lectin-mediated mechanisms of action have been proposed: (a) inhibition of α-amylase, resulting in a reduced carbohydrate metabolism and absorption; (b) phytohemoagglutinininduced modulation of the activity of cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptides, resulting in a reduced appetite. Preliminary clinical data, as well as reports focusing on the use of several traditional medicines, apparently extend these findings to humans. Should these initial clinical data be confirmed by future surveys, P. vulgaris derivatives might constitute novel remedies for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Many considerations induce to this solution: the efficiency of these vehicles, greater than the conventional ones, the major benefits that they offer in terms of environmental pollution, the increasing costs of the petroleum and its instable market. A key component of each electric and hybrid electric vehicle is the energy storage system. It plays a prominent role on the performances and on the overall drive efficiency of the vehicles, therefore from some years the study of this subsystem has recalled a strong interest among the scientists, the automakers and the manufacturers of energy storage systems. Recently, the main auto industries have found joinventures with the manufacturers of batteries, supercapacitors and flywheels in order to study and to produce advanced energy storage systems for electric and hybrid electric cars and many innovations are introduced in this field (i.e. lead-carbon battery, bi-polar lead acid battery, thin film metal battery, supercabattery, Li-poly and so on).

The second modification is to utilize the movement of the vessels and tissues (identified by means of optical flow analysis) and incorporate it into the external energy of the GVF snake. This will provide the necessary structural information while ignoring static noise prone areas of the image cine. Finally, the incorporation of an iterative priori knowledge process into the proposed solution will retract an expanding curve or correct a caving one when an expected border is occluded by noise.

The difficulty with the conventional unsupervised segmentation lies in finding appropriate features that discriminate a meaningful region from the others. In this paper, the appropriate features are automatically learnt by machine learning with boosting scheme. At the initial step, the image is split into many small regions (blocks at first) and strong classifiers for every region, which discriminate the region from the others, are found by AdaBoosting. Each strong classifier so obtained is the weighted sum of several popular weak classifiers (features), which best describes the coherence of the region and thus well discriminates the region from the others. The output of this classifier is used in designing the energy function for the labeling, in the form of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Minimization of the energy function produces the labeling result which reflects the property learnt by the classifier. For the labeling result, the machine learning is again performed and the process iterates until some conditions are met. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides competitive result compared to the conventional feature based methods. ©2009 IEEE.","AdaBoost; EM-like minimization; Machine learning; Unsupervised image segmentation","Adaptive boosting; Classifiers; Digital image storage; Imaging systems; Labeling; Learning systems; Optimization; AdaBoost; Conditional random field; Energy functions; Feature-based; Feature-based method; Machine-learning; New approaches; Small region; Unsupervised image segmentation; Unsupervised segmentation; Weak classifiers; Weighted Sum; Image segmentation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951952951

The estuarine resident northern mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus macrolepidotus) has been successfully used as a sentinel for effects of pulp and paper mill effluents in Atlantic Canada and has been proposed for monitoring other anthropogenic impacts. This study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the somatic parameters used to describe fish performance, specifically measures of energy use and storage, in estuaries located in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Three sites with varying levels of agricultural input were studied. Fish at all sites depleted their energy reserves over winter, as reflected in depressed condition, liver size, and gonad size, but then quickly replenished them in May. These population parameters were highly variable throughout the reproductive season and within an estuary. Spawning was continuous at all sites without indication of lunar or other periodicity.

Efficient use of energy will help but if we have to reduce atmospheric C02, we are forced to consider methods of carbon sequestration and associated costs. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the most discussed method of sequestration. However, there are two major issues with this approach of sequestration. Firstly, it is the high direct cost associated with capital and operation of capture, transport and subsurface injection. And secondly, it is the undetermined cost of post-operation liability associated with measurement, monitoring, verification and problem-rectification. Committing to the needed large scale sequestration projects without properly considering alternatives can prove costly at both economic and social levels. There are alternatives to CCS, however. Use of biomass derived fuels such as bio-ethanol has been talked about in literature as one of them. But biofuels are shown to be more expensive for carbon abatement than the base alternative. Charcoal sequestration (CS), discussed earlier by the author carries with it the benefit of being a pure sequestration (similar to CCS), is less costly both in terms of its direct costs and lacking any post operation liabilities, and above all is reversible, allowing flexibility of policy and operation, avoiding long term or large scale commitments. In this paper the author outlines how municipal solid waste (MSW) processing into charcoal can be a good way to initiate demo projects for charcoal sequestration approach employing other larger resources of biomass and shows as such use of MSW has to be a major component of our carbon abatement package of actions. This is for reasons of both cost effectiveness as well as to reduce the landfill methane (a more potent GHG) from entering into atmosphere. The over all discounted cost of a suite of proposed measures including improvement of efficiency, conversion of waste to charcoal for use both as fuel as well as sequestration, increased use of nuclear energy, limited application of CS using larger dead-stock biomass pool, and CCS, is assessed to be in the range of US$7.5trillion in this paper, reducing the equivalent CO 2 concentration by 465 ppm (compared to the projected business as usual) by the end of 21st century. The outlined approach, with its prominent use of MSW, promises not only to mitigate the growing urban waste problem but also to help evaluate this novel method of sequestration and enhance public awareness on the subject. This in turn will help the larger society make an informed choice to embark on a right course of action for atmospheric carbon abatement.

The main advantages of the electrolysis process are the zero-emission of greenhouse gases, the use of water as the source of hydrogen, and the high efficiency in energy conversion. Electrolyzers can be fed by the grid or by renewable sources such as solar and wind. In both cases a power converter is necessary to conditioning the electrical energy in order to deliver a clean DC current to the electrolyzer.

The technical evolution of such PV + CHP hybrid systems was developed from the present (near market) technology through four generations, which enable high utilization rates of both PV-generated electricity and CHP-generated heat. A method to determine the maximum percent of PV-generated electricity on the grid without energy storage was derived and applied to an example area.

Consequently, fresh importance is placed on understanding the behaviour and properties of CO2 for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This presents a challenge for modelling, monitoring and verifying CCS projects, since CO2 is a complex fluid, potentially varying in density by almost three orders of magnitude within the reservoir column, and existing in all four fluid states (vapour, gas, liquid and super critical (scCO2). The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) is an equation of state (EoS) which provides an improved mixing model for CO2 with water, brine and hydrocarbons. Unlike other EoSs, SAFT mixing rules allow accurate CO2 modelling close to its critical point, and they account for the deviant behaviour caused by additional chemical species present in the reservoir. Thus, the SAFT mixing model offers a method to accurately predict, monitor and verify the properties of CO2 over the lifetime of a CCS project.

This study uses heat integration to reduce the overall energy penalty and therefore the cost of implementing CCS. An existing pulverised brown coal power plant with a new CCS plant using solvent absorption is used as the basis for this study that shows the energy penalty reduces from 39% for a CCS plant with no heat integration to 24% for a plant with effective heat integration.

However, it is not clear to what extent sap flow dynamics really follow and mimic rapid changes in the actual transpiration rate due to changes in environmental factors such as solar radiation (Rs) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). In this study, we compared short-term measurements (10 min average) of cucumber leaf transpiration, obtained by means of a non-invasive technique (leaf energy balance, LEB), and whole plant transpiration measured by the stem heat balance method (sap flow gauge Dynamax/USA-SHB). The dynamics of transpiration response to environmental factors (Rs and VPD) obtained with the two methods were compared and analyzed under spring greenhouse conditions. It was shown that both methods had similar time response to sudden changes in atmospheric demand, but sap flow was less sensitive than transpiration to those changes. This was because plant internal water storage contributed up to 7-12% of daily plant water use in this species. We concluded therefore that caution should be taken when using sap flow measurements to estimate transpiration rate at shorttime scale (hourly or even shorter), especially in highly fluctuating environmental conditions and when precise estimates of transpiration are required (e.g., soilless culture irrigation management, calibration of transpiration models, etc.).","Cucumber; Energy balance; Greenhouse; Hydraulic conductance; Stem heat balance; Stomatal conductance","Cucumis sativus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75649136932

In this work texture analysis was applied to samples of the hazelnut cultivar 'Tonda Gentile Romana' (Corylus avellana L.), harvested in 2005 and stored for one year in a refrigerating room, in a freezer and under a nitrogen-enriched atmosphere, in order to define the effect of these treatments on textural characteristics of the products. The analyses were performed on the fresh product and after 4, 8 and 12 months of storage. Raw and roasted products were examined. Rupture force (N), rupture energy (mJ) and nut specific deformation (N/mm) were measured by a Universal Testing machine TA.XT2i® Texture Analyser under three compression loading positions (x, y and z axes). In comparison to the fresh samples, the textural parameters showed the highest differences after four months of storage. After 12 months of storage, the values of the force required to break the nuts ranged from 84.8 to 103.1 N for raw hazelnuts and from 80 to 98 N for roasted. The lowest values of force were generally obtained in raw frozen hazelnuts, while in the same storage conditions roasted hazelnuts had the highest values. The lowest values of rupture force were usually noticed along the x-axis (length), the highest along the y-axis (width). The obtained results showed that rupture force and nut specific deformation were the most discriminating parameters for raw hazelnuts, while rupture energy was the most discriminating parameter for roasted hazelnuts. Finally, rupture force was strongly correlated with both rupture energy (R2=0.95) and nut specific deformation (R2=0.94). These results show that texture analysis is a very suitable method for hazelnut analysis and for the study of storage effects on the textural characteristics of this fruit.","Compression loading; Hazelnut quality; Rupture force; Shelf-life; Textural analysis","Corylus; Corylus avellana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75449088446

In particular, these feeders can be used to convey biomass materials that are highly cohesive to prevent plugging or undesirable reaction in the feeding tube. Although feeders of this design have been shown to work very effectively, they have not been studied in detail or optimized for the pyrolysis process. In addition, the operating conditions required to obtain predictable and consistent mass flow rates and slugs of desirable characteristics need to be established. The purpose of this work was to design, build and demonstrate the operation of a horizontal intermittent solid slug feeder and to test it with sawdust as the feed material. Sawdust is an extremely cohesive and difficult biomass to inject, but one that holds great potential as an important renewable feedstock for pyrolysis. The intermittent feeder designed for this work consisted of a pressurized vertical solids storage silo leading to a pneumatic pinch valve. The pinch valve, controlled by solenoid valves connected to a relay timer, released the feed into a horizontal feeding tube at a ninety degree angle. Within the silo, a rotating mixer prevented the bridging of solids. Intermittent pulses of gas from a control volume were fed into the horizontal feeding tube, as well as, in some cases, a continuous gas flow. The timing of the pulses was controlled by solenoid valves with a relay timer. While the pinch valve is opened, solids fall into the horizontal feeding tube forming a plug, which is then propelled by the pulsating gas into the reactor. The solid mass flow rate was experimentally measured by collecting the solids and continuously measuring the mass using a digital balance. Several variables were tested in order to optimize the performance of the feeder and the consistency of the feeding rate. They included the silo pressure, mixing rate, gas pulse pressure and volume, continuous gas mass flow rate, and the open pinch-valve time interval. The goals of this optimization were (a) to maximize the solid-to-gas ratio of mass flow rates, since the gas mass flux must be minimized to avoid wasting energy, and (b) to define operating conditions required to inject consistent biomass mass flow rates suitable for a laboratory scale pyrolysis reactor, and (c) to propose initial design criteria and a calibration procedure for intermittent solid slug feeders. The results demonstrated that the intermittent solid slug feeder system successfully achieved the desired objectives and showed how to efficiently select its optimum operating conditions.","Feeder; Fluidized bed; Intermittent; Optimization; Pyrolysis; Sawdust; Slug","Biomass; Chemical reactors; Flow of gases; Flow rate; Fluidized beds; Gases; Horizontal wells; Mass transfer; Materials handling equipment; Optimization; Pyrolysis; Sawdust; Solenoid valves; Solenoids; Calibration procedure; Feeder; Fluidized bed reactors; Intermittent; Operating condition; Optimum operating conditions; Renewable feedstocks; Slug; Feeding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149140885

The prospect of switching the spin in the metalloporphyrin ring is a particularly interesting one, as this could be used, for example, for spin-dependent electric transport through biomolecular devices. These molecules can be used in various applications like optical switches, information storage and non linear optics. Here, we study the molecular spin state of chloro-hemin, hemin cyanide and hemin carbonyl molecules by ADF code. Chloro-hemin has been studied by analyzing the Fe K-edge X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectra. At first stage of investigation we assume an approximate initial geometry, then we perform the geometry optimization with different molecular spin states and search for configuration with minimal total energy with the use of Density Functional Theory (ADF 2008). The results of geometry optimization of chloro-hemin molecule performed with the GGA OPBE functional showed that configuration with total spin S5/2 has minimal total energy. This configuration corresponds well with the geometry structure obtained via X-Ray diffraction method (Fe-N-N angle is 13.3°). The similar calculations that were carried out for hemin carbonyl and hemin cyanide molecules showed that for these structures minimal energy is found to be for S1/2. The experimental Fe K-XANES spectra of the investigated compound have been collected. The theoretical analysis of the experimental data has been performed on the basis of finite difference method (FDMnes2007 program code). © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449109827

In the composite, paraffin acts as a PCM when PP is operated as supporting material. The composites prepared at different mass fractions of paraffin (50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 w/w%) by solution casting method were subjected to leakage test by heating the composites over the melting temperature of the PCM. The paraffin/PP composite (70/30 w/w%) is found as the maximum paraffin containing composite and was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optic microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. DSC analysis indicated that the form-stable paraffin/PP composite melts at 44.77-45.52 °C and crystallizes at 53.55-54.80 °C. It has latent heats of 136.16 and -136.59 J/g for melting and crystallization, respectively. These thermal properties make it potential PCM for latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) purposes such as solar space heating applications. Accelerated thermal cycling tests indicated that the form-stable PCM had good thermal reliability. TGA also showed that the form-stable PCM degrades in two distinguishable steps and had good chemical stability. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Paraffin; Phase change material; Polypropylene; Thermal energy storage","Characterization; Chemical stability; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gravimetric analysis; Heat storage; Latent heat; Melting; Phase change materials; Polypropylenes; Reliability; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Thermogravimetric analysis; Accelerated thermal cycling test; Form stable phase change material; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Melting and crystallization; Solution-casting method; Supporting material; Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA); Thermal reliability; Paraffins; composite; crystallization; polymer; storage; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73349126991

The proposed control strategy is mainly based on a compromise between Integral Squared Error and Maximum Stability Margin criteria.

The simulation input data are stored in ROOT format, they are classified into two categories: conditions data for describing the detector status when data are recorded, and background triggers data for including the noise signal necessary to obtain a realistic simulation. In order to satisfy these requirements, in the traditional BaBar computing model events are distributed over several sites involved in the collaboration where each site manager centrally manages a private farm dedicated to simulation production.

Solar photons can be considered the ideal green reagents since they are costless and leave no residue in the reaction mixture. In many cases the solar radiation could be successfully used in place of toxic or expensive chemical reagents to overcome the activation energy in organic synthesis.

ESID results suggested strong contribution from DS fragments to the mass spectra. In the 650-1500 eV energy range the relative desorption ion yield curves show maxima at about 700, 1200 and 1400 eV, which may be related to carbon, nitrogen and oxygen containing fragments, respectively, and interpreted in terms of the Auger stimulated ion desorption (ASID) mechanism. For energies greater than 1500 eV, the secondary electrons play an important role in the ion formation. PSID studies were performed at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Source (LNLS) covering the sulphur K-shell photoexcitation during a single-bunch operation mode of the storage ring. Ionic desorption of atomic and molecular fragments were also observed. Relative desorption ion yield curves have been determined as a function of the photon energy, indicating that at the photon energy region covered by the PSID studies the indirect XESD (X-ray induced electron stimulated desorption) process plays an important role in the ionic desorption of PPyDS irradiated by soft X-rays. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the performance of the plant connected to the controller might be improved by simultaneous design of the plant and the controller. In the case of open loop control, expressions that describe the dynamics of a controlled system (a bulk storage room) and its design criteria are deduced. These expressions contain all the physical system parameters, and give insight on how the system performance (in terms of energy usage and temperature uniformity) depends on the physical parameters. This insight gives realistic guidelines for integrated systems design and control, without the need for complex numerical computations. The physical relations that could not be found in the literature are identified experimentally. It is shown that a higher fan capacity reduces energy costs and improves the bulk temperature uniformity considerably, whereas the bulk shape is of very little influence. Furthermore, better wall insulation leads to a substantial energy cost decrease. © 2009 IAgrE.",,"Control theory; Controllers; Bulk temperatures; Design and control; Integrated systems; Numerical computations; Physical parameters; Simultaneous designs; Substantial energy; Temperature uniformity; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350742987

Moreover, they are important substrates for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids and biologically active compounds like eicosanoids and leukotrienes. Because of their low solubility in aqueous solutions such as blood plasma and interstitial fluid, fatty acids are in need of binding proteins to increase their concentration in vascular and interstitial compartments. Albumin acts as main fatty acid binding protein in extracellular fluids. Plasma albumin possesses about 7 binding sites for fatty acids with moderate to high affinity, enhancing the concentration of fatty acids by a several orders of magnitude. Despite the high affinity of albumin for fatty acids, uptake of fatty acids by parenchymal cells such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes seems not to be hampered by albumin. In contrast, experimental findings suggest that albumin may facilitate the uptake of fatty acids by organs in need of these substrates. In the present overview the following issues will be briefly discussed: (i) transport and storage of fatty acids in the mammalian body, (ii) biosynthesis of albumin in the liver, (iii) localization and concentration of albumin in body fluids, (iv) interactions between albumin and fatty acids, (v) albumin structure and fatty acid binding sites, (vi) uptake of fatty acids by organs and roles for plasma albumin and (vii) lessons from patients and experimental animals lacking plasma albumin.","Albumin; Binding kinetics; Fatty acids; Plasma; Transport","albumin; fatty acid transporter; icosanoid; leukotriene; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; binding affinity; binding site; body fluid; bone cell; chromosome 4q; conference paper; energy metabolism; extracellular fluid; fatty acid transport; heart muscle cell; human; interstitial fluid; lipid solubility; liver; mammal; nonhuman; protein binding; protein function; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein structure; protein synthesis; qualitative analysis; storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350457547

Viscoelastic parameters are first extracted from the storage modulus and loss factor normally reported in hand books with the help of Genetic Algorithm and then constitutive relationships are used to obtain the equations of motion of the continuum after discretizing it with finite beam elements. The equations of motion are solved to get the frequency response function and modal damping ratio.

An accurate spectral description of hard x rays emitted from thin targets, irradiated by electron beams circulating in the storage ring, is of primary interest for the design and the characterization of a beamline. This article, Part I, aims at optimizing some of the parameters which are critical for the design of medical applications based on the above compact light source. The goal was to evaluate the dependence of photon fluence and beam monochromaticity on electron-beam energy, target material, and thickness. Methods: The transport of 6 and 20 MeV electrons in a thin molybdenum, rhodium, and tungsten target is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations using MCNPX. Configurations of the x-ray output port, different from the default forward-directed emission of the beam, are also investigated. A comparison with reference spectra for general diagnostic radiology and mammography is carried out. Results: It is shown that the emitted x-ray beams can be far more intense than those generated by conventional x-ray tubes for radiography applications. The profiles of the calculated polychromatic spectra resemble those generated by conventional x-ray tubes, with x-ray energies up to the energy of the incident-electron beam. An appreciable improvement in the monochromaticity of the beams can be obtained by viewing the x-ray emission from an output port antiparallel to the direction of the incident-electron beam. Conclusions: The optimum target thickness for tungsten target spectra is practically constrained by a trade-off between bremsstrahlung efficiency and focal-spot size requirements. A larger margin for optimization of target thickness is probably available for mammographic spectra. The constraint of a backward-directed (or, to a lesser extent, orthogonal) output port is to be considered mandatory for minimizing the high-energy tail of the spectral distribution and keeping the radiation dose to a reasonable level. It is also fundamental to evaluate the impact of the high-energy tail of the emitted spectra in x-ray imaging applications, since the energy range involved is significantly beyond the diagnostic range.

The experiments were performed under the conditions of simulated waste water temperature values of 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C. Inlet and outlet water temperatures of the evaporator and condenser, water flow rates in the evaporator and condenser circuits, pressures at the compressor inlet and outlet and power consumption of the system were measured. The heating coefficients of performance were calculated based on the measurements. It was found that the maximum temperature in the energy storage tank was about 50.6 °C. For the heat source temperatures of 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C, the heating coefficients of the performance of the system became 3.36, 3.43 and 3.69, respectively, 6 min. after the start time of the experiments and then they were decreased to 1.87, 1.83 and 1.77 with increasing water temperature in the condenser tank. The mean uncertainty value of the measurement parameters was found to be about ±2.47%. Finally, for the purpose of meeting hot water need as well as floor heating system requirements, it is seen that energy quality level of a waste low grade temperature heat source can be increased by using a heat pump system. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.","energy enhancement; Waste heat; Water-water heat pump","Evaporators; Flow of water; Pumps; Tanks (containers); Temperature; Uncertainty analysis; Waste heat; Energy enhancement; Evaporator and condensers; Floor heating systems; Heat pumps; Heat source temperatures; Heating coefficients; Measurement parameters; Outlet-water temperatures; Heat pump systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349487509

This crisis has escalated the power disruptions, which have had adverse effects on various sectors. While business owners have resorted to importation of fossil fuel generators that have increased the cost of production, others have resorted to battery energy storage systems to cater for short outages, which are limited in life span, depth of discharge, among others. These interventions have, thus, further increased the cost of goods and services. In addition, the rural populations using solar home systems incur high battery maintenance and replacement costs. In this paper an electromechanical flywheel battery is proposed as a better alternative in mitigating energy storage problems. It is found that by replacing the battery storage systems with the electromechanical flywheel battery, a saving of up to 35% on cost of energy can be made in the solar home systems and for the industry sector, the power disruptions could be reduced.","Cost of energy; Energy storage; Flywheel; Life cost analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349457519

An internationally administrated fund with UN participation will be created and invested exclusively in conservation, renewable energy and social development. The proposal has already received significant support from international institutions, European governments, NGOs and personalities worldwide. Ecuador, a less developed country in South America, remains dependent of petroleum exports, which have not led to economic growth and diversification, did not reduce poverty and inequality, and had strong environmental impacts. Given the limits of petroleum reserves, the Yasuni-ITT initiative opens alternatives towards sustainable development in the country, allowing a transition towards a post-petroleum society, and promoting ways towards human development within the limits of biodiversity conservation. This proposal, which can be replicated by other developing countries with fossil fuel reserves in biodiverse areas, opens new alternatives for post-Kyoto negotiations with binding commitments for several developing countries, and simultaneously addresses global warming, biodiversity loss, and poverty.

Forty disc-shaped specimens were prepared using a split polytetrafuoroethylene matrix (4.0 mm diameter x 8.0 mm hight) in which the materials were inserted incrementally. The curing time of each increment was of 40 s with the QTH and 10 s with the LED. The specimens were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=10), according to the light source and the restorative material. After storage in distilled water at 37°C ± 2°C for 24 h, the specimens was tested in compressive strength in a universal testing machine with load cell of 500 kgf running at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data (in MPa) were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test (p<0.05). For the composite resin, light curing with the QTH source did not produce statistically signifcant difference (p>0.05) in the compressive strength when compared to light curing with the LED source. However, light curing of the compomer with the QTH source resulted in signifcantly higher compressive strength than the use of the LED unit (p>0.05). The composite resin presented signifcantly higher (p>0.05) compressive strength than the compomer, regardless of the light source. In conclusion, the compressive strength of the tested materials photoactivated with a QTH and a LED light source was infuenced by the energy density employed and the chemical composition of the esthetic restorative materials.","Compomers; Composite resin; LED; Light-curing; QTH light","compomer; Dyract; halogen; resin; TPH spectrum; article; comparative study; compressive strength; dental bonding; dental care; dental curing light; evaluation; methodology; radiation exposure; randomization; semiconductor; Compomers; Composite Resins; Compressive Strength; Curing Lights, Dental; Dental Bonding, Light-Cured; Dental Stress Analysis; Halogens; Random Allocation; Semiconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949221701

The effects of hydride orientations, initial crack lengths and storage temperature profiles on cladding failure are discussed in detail. The results show that the initial crack length and the storage temperature profile play an important role in cladding failure during interim dry storage.

Spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture add to its complex behaviour, which undermines the reliability of most current measurement methods. In this paper, two promising evolutionary data-driven techniques, namely (i) Evolutionary Polynomial Regression and (ii) Genetic Programming, are challenged with modelling the soil moisture response to the near surface atmospheric conditions. The utility of the proposed models is demonstrated through the prediction of the soil moisture response of three experimental soil covers, used for the restoration of watersheds that were disturbed by the mining industry. The results showed that the storage effect of the soil moisture response is the major challenging factor; it can be quantified using cumulative inputs better than time-lag inputs, which can be attributed to the effect of the soil layer moisture-holding capacity. This effect increases with the increase in the soil layer thickness. Three different modelling tools are tested to investigate the tool effect in data-driven modelling. Despite the promising results with regard to the prediction accuracy, the study demonstrates the need for adopting multiple data-driven modelling techniques and tools (modelling environments) to obtain reliable predictions. ©IWA Publishing 2009.","Evolutionary polynomial regression; Genetic programming; Prediction; Soil moisture; Tool uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949119695

One of the reasons of great worry for all of us is reducing sources of conventional energies. The rate of fossil fuel consumption is higher than the rate of the fossil fuel production by the nature. The results will be the scarcity of automobile fuel in the world which will create lot of problems in transport sector. The other aspect is pollution added by these sources in our environment which increases with more use of these sources, resulting in the poor quality of life on this planet. There is constant search of alternate fuel to solve energy shortage which can provide us energy without pollution. Hence most frequently discussed source is hydrogen which when burnt in air produces a clean form of energy. In the last one decade hydrogen has attracted worldwide interest as a secondary energy carrier. This has generated comprehensive investigations on the technology involved and how to solve the problems of production, storage and transportation of hydrogen. The interest in hydrogen as energy of the future is due to it being a clean energy, most abundant element in the universe, the lightest fuel, richest in energy per unit mass and unlike electricity, it can be easily stored. Hydrogen gas is now considered to be the most promising fuel of the future. In future it will be used in various applications, e.g. it can generate Electricity, useful in cooking food, fuel for automobiles, hydrogen powered industries, Jet Planes, Hydrogen Village and for all our domestic energy requirements. Hydrogen as a fuel has already found applications in experimental cars and all the major car companies are in competition to build a commercial car and most probably they may market hydrogen fuel automobiles in near future but at a higher cost compared to gasoline cars but it is expected that with time the cost of hydrogen run cars will decrease with time. Long lasting, light and clean metal hydride batteries are already commercial for lap top computers. Larger capacity batteries are being developed for electrical cars. Hydrogen is already being used as the fuel of choice for space programmes around the world. It will be used to power aerospace transports to build the international space station, as well as to provide electricity and portable water for its inhabitants.

Nine future scenarios corresponding to three electrical demands and three options for new capacity: minimum cost of electricity, minimum CO2 emissions and a criterion with a compromise between CO2 and cost (CO2-cost criterion) have been proposed. Calculations show reduction in CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2030, reaching a maximum CO2 emission reduction of 90% in 2050 in an efficiency scenario with CCS and renewables. The contribution of CCS from 2030 is important with percentage values of electricity production around 22-28% in 2050.

Using domestic coal mitigates national energy security risks. However coal use exacerbates global climate change. Under a strict climate change regime, coal use is projected to decline in future. However this would increase imports of energy sources like natural gas (NG) and nuclear and consequent energy security risks for India. The paper shows that carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) can mitigate CO2 emissions from coal-based large point source (LPS) clusters and therefore would play a key role in mitigating both energy security risks for India and global climate change risks. This paper estimates future CO2 emission projections from LPS in India, identifies the potential CO2 storage types at aggregate level and matches the two into the future using Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM/Local model) with a Geographical Information System (GIS) interface. The paper argues that clustering LPS that are close to potential storage sites could provide reasonable economic opportunities for CCS in future if storage sites of different types are further explored and found to have adequate capacity. The paper also indicates possible LPS locations to utilize CCS opportunities economically in future, especially since India is projected to add over 220,000 MW of thermal power generation capacity by 2030. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most sediment eroded on the feeder road was actually stored on slopes and in filter strips before reaching channels. Subsequent soil conservation works rehabilitated the worst-eroded areas and they are still functioning effectively today. There is no direct connection of sand and fine gravel between the general harvest area and downstream channels because of many intervening sediment discontinuities, such as ponds, drainage lines, filter strips and floodouts1. The catastrophic flood of February 1971 was the largest for at least the last 50 y in the Towamba catchment and caused substantial widening of lower Letts Creek and Wog Wog River. It also reorganised channel-spanning boulder steps on upper Letts Creek and a tributary in and immediately downstream of compartment 588/2, and may have caused gully erosion on the tributary of Letts Creek. Bank erosion supplied the sand and fine gravel in the river bed of these headwater channels.

The technical applications, however, have been limited because of the presence of a thick oxygen layer, which must be eliminated prior to introducing hydrogen into a sample. To effectively remove the oxygen barrier and to enhance the capability of hydrogen absorption, we irradiated Ti39.5Zr39.5Ni21 quasicrystal ingots by using a proton beam at energy of 20 MeV, 15 mA for 30 minutes. The proton-beam-treated samples were exposed to a hydrogen pressure of 650 psi at 200 °C and the results were analyzed by monitoring the pressure change of the chamber. The main concerns were a careful measurement of the weight gain after hydrogenation and an estimate of the peak shifts in X-ray diffraction. An absorption of hydrogen was observed for the proton-beam-irradiated samples while little hydrogen loading was noticed for unirradiated ones. Our results demonstrate that proton irradiation may be used as a new technique that can effectively eliminate the oxygen barrier and enhance the rates of hydrogen diffusion. However, more systematic investigations regarding the role of the proton are required before applying the technique for practical applications.","Hydrogen storage; Proton beam; Quasicrystal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049124702

Desizing was performed with an amyloglucosidase/pullanase enzyme (Dextrozyme DX, manufactured by Novozymes) instead of a conventional amylase enzyme in order to hydrolyze starch into single glucose units. Multifect GO 5000L (Genencor) glucose oxidase enzyme was used to yield hydrogen peroxide from the glucose generated during desizing; bleaching was performed by this enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide. Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide after bleaching was done with Terminox Ultra 10L (Novozymes) catalase enzyme. The fabric was dyed in the same bath with the selected monochlortriazine reactive dyes (DyStar). The amount of glucose generated during desizing was 4000 ± 135 mg/l and it yielded 765 ± 15 mg/l hydrogen peroxide during glucose oxidase enzyme treatment. The whiteness index of the enzymatically bleached fabric was 71.0 ± 1.2 stensby degree. The color yields of the enzymatically treated samples were comparable to the conventionally treated samples. All enzymes used in this study were commercial grades having the advantages of easy storage and supply compared to the pure enzymes used in earlier studies. The advantages of the new one-bath process were: less auxiliary demand; lower environmental impact; and energy and water savings compared to the conventional desizing, scouring, bleaching, and dyeing sequence. © 2009, SAGE Publications.

Growth and feed conversion were not affected by CLA, whereas feed intake was reduced (P < 0.05) by feeding 2% CLA. In these fish perivisceral fat was also reduced (P < 0.05), particularly reducing (P < 0.05) monounsaturated fatty acids. CLA has not affected tissue proximal composition, but reduced (P < 0.05) saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and increased (P < 0.05) the n-3 and n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids in muscle and increase (P < 0.05) CLA content in muscle, liver and perivisceral fat. A progressive reduction in lipid vacuolization of hepatocytes cytoplasm and regular-shaped morphology was found in fish fed increased CLA levels, together with a progressive increase in malic enzyme activity (only significant in fish fed 1% CLA).

The method has been applied to female urine samples to assess the metabolism of these compounds. The method implements an enzymatic hydrolysis (β-glucuronidase with sulfatase activity) kinetically enhanced by ultrasonic energy in order to generate the free steroid forms. This enables a drastic shortening of the time required for this step as compared with conventional protocols (from 12-18 hours to 30 min). The reaction kinetics of the ultrasound-enhanced hydrolysis was characterized by comparison to that of the conventional protocol. After hydrolysis, the free steroid hormones were isolated and preconcentrated by automated solid-phase extraction and the eluate was subsequently analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The target analytes were confirmed and quantified by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The detection and quantification limits were within 0.06-0.8 ng mL-1 and 0.19-2.69 ng mL-1, respectively.

The average molecular weight of PLGA decreased to about 60% of the original value after the melt-extrusion process. Type II collagen exhibited sponge-like structure and filled the macroporous FDM scaffolds. An increase of the fiber spacing resulted in an increase of the porosity. The storage modulus of FDM scaffolds with a large fiber spacing was comparable to that of the native porcine articular cartilage. Although the FDM hybrid scaffolds were swollen in various extents after 28 days of in vitro culture, the seeded chondrocytes were well distributed in the interior of the scaffolds with a large fiber spacing and neocartilage was formed around the scaffolds.

In order to fully exploit the data gathering and dissemination capabilities of these networks, energy-efficient and scalable solutions for data storage and information discovery are essential. Traditionally, the communication pattern in WSNs has been assumed to be many-to-one; i.e., numerous sensors gather information which is routed to a central point commonly referred to as the sink. However, many emerging applications for WSNs require dissemination of information to interested clients within the network requiring support for differing traffic patterns. Further, in-network query processing capabilities are required for autonomic information discovery. In this paper, we formulate the information discovery problem as a load-balancing problem, with the combined aim being to maximize network lifetime and minimize query processing delay resulting in quality of service (QoS) improvements. We propose novel methods for data dissemination, information discovery and data aggregation that are designed to provide significant QoS benefits. We make use of affinity propagation to group ""similar"" sensors and have developed efficient mechanisms that can resolve both ALL-type and ANY-type queries in-network with improved energy-efficiency and query resolution time. Simulation and Analytical results prove the proposed method(s) of information discovery offer significant QoS benefits for ALL-type and ANY-type queries in comparison to previous approaches. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, most studies neglect the mediating effect of organizational learning capability in the relationship between intellectual capital and new product development performance. This study uses interviews and the survey method to discuss the relationships governing intellectual capital, organizational learning capability, and new product development performance. Results are based on empirical data from Taiwan's IC design industry, and are generated by the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method. Results show that human capital and relational capital actually improve new product development performance through organizational learning capability. Although structural capital positively affects organizational learning capability, managers should pay attention to possibly negative effects of structural capital on new product development performance. Relational capital is the greatest factor among these three types of intellectual capital in Taiwanese IC design companies, structural capital is second, and human capital is last. Comparing three types of intellectual capital of Taiwan's large enterprises with those of Taiwan's small and medium enterprises (SMEs) reveals that the relational capital of Taiwan's SMEs is marginally less than that of large enterprises. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Maintenance of foraging and food acquisition is dependent on the ability to balance food intake and energy expenditure. This review examines the role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) as a regulator of foraging behaviour, food acquisition, and energy balance. The role of PKG in food-related behaviours is highly conserved among worms, flies, bees, ants, and mammals. A growing body of literature suggests that PKG plays an integral role in the component behaviours and physiologies underlying foraging behaviour. These include energy acquisition, nutrient absorption, nutrient allocation, nutrient storage, and energy use.

This can lead to the changes to the business processes that information system supports. Also user requests for more functionality as they get used to the system. This gives rise to a cycle of changes known as co-evolution. One way to facilitate co-evolution is to empower end-users to make changes to the web application to accommodate the required changes while using that Web application. This can be achieved through meta-design paradigm. A fundamental objective of a meta-design paradigm is to create socio-technical environment that empowers users to engage actively in the continuous development of systems rather than be restricted to the use of existing systems. Meta-design paradigm can be realised: 1) by providing a technical infrastructure to develop open ended systems that allow end-user developers to evolve the systems; 2) by creating a learning environment which supports end-users to learn and involve in activities required to create / maintain Web applications; and 3) by building a socio-technical environment that allows end-users and professional developers to collaborate in development and maintenance of the system. We developed the necessary technical infrastructure to support meta-design paradigm based on a meta-model of Web applications. This Meta-model based meta-design paradigm supports the development of different types of Web applications required by business organisations and was implemented using Components based eApplication development and deployment System (CBEADS). Using this system we studied how meta-model based meta-design paradigm can be used to develop web applications for three Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This study shows that the meta-model based infrastructure can help to establish the infrastructure, learning environment and socio-economic environment to empower end-users to develop Web applications without restricting them to be passive users of the systems. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","End-user development; Meta-design paradigm; Web application development","Design; Education; Electric energy storage; Information systems; Sodium compounds; World Wide Web; Business environments; Business organisations; Business process; Co evolutions; End-user developers; End-user development; End-users; Existing systems; Learning environments; Meta models; Meta-design paradigm; Small to medium enterprise; Socio technicals; Socio-economic environments; Technical infrastructures; Web application development; Web applications; Applications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65349086708

Despite the professional entrepreneurship of those working as part time tissue bankers in such operations, best practices in tissue banking were not always followed due to the lack of regulatory standards, specialised training, adequate facilities and dedicated personnel. The Skin Bank of the Plastic Surgery Department of the Hospital das Clinicas of Sao Paulo, the single skin bank in Brazil, was not an exception. Since 1956, restricted and unpredictable amounts of skin allografts were stored under refrigeration for short periods under very limited quality controls. As in most ""tissue banks"" at that time in Brazil, medical and nursing staff worked on a volunteer and informal basis undergoing no specific training. IAEA supported the implementation of the tissue banking program in Brazil through the regional project RLA/7/ 009 ""Quality system for the production of irradiated sterilised grafts"" (1998-2000) and through two interregional projects INT/6/ 049 ""Interregional Centre of Excellence in Tissue Banking"", during the period 2002-2004 and INT/6/052 ""Improving the Quality of Production and Uses of Radiation Sterilised Tissue Grafts"", during the period 2002-2004. In 2001-2002, the first two years of operation of the HC-Tissue Bank, 53 skin transplants were carried out instead of the previous 4-5 a year. During this period, 75 individuals donated skin tissue, generating approximately 90,000 cm2 of skin graft.

The non-uniform access latency seen by a core to different independent banks of a large cache spread over the chip necessitates active mechanisms for improving data locality. The central proposal of this paper is a fully hardwired coarse-grain data migration mechanism that dynamically monitors the access patterns of the cores at the granularity of a page to reduce the book-keeping overhead and decides when and where to migrate an entire page of data to amortize the performance overhead. The page-grain migration mechanism is compared against two variants of previously proposed cache block-grain dynamic migration mechanisms and two OSassisted static locality management mechanisms. Our detailed execution-driven simulation of an eight-core chip-multiprocessor with a shared 16 MB L2 cache employing a bidirectional ring to connect the cores and the L2 cache banks shows that hardwired dynamic page migration, while using only 4.8% of extra storage out of the total L2 cache and book-keeping budget, delivers the best performance and energy-efficiency across a set of shared memory parallel applications selected from the SPLASH-2, SPEC OMP, DARPA DIS, and FFTW suites and multiprogrammed workloads prepared out of the SPEC 2000 and BioBench suites. It reduces execution time by 18.7% and 12.6% on average (geometric mean) respectively for the shared memory applications and the multiprogrammed workloads compared to a baseline architecture that distributes the pages round-robin across the L2 cache banks. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Dynamics; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Multiprocessing systems; Multiprogramming; Base-line architecture; Bi-directional rings; Chip Multiprocessor; Dynamic page migration; Execution-driven simulation; Management mechanisms; Migration mechanisms; Shared-memory parallels; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64949190009

These materials are used in applications where it is necessary to store energy due to the temporary phase shift between the offer and demand of thermal energy. Thus, possible applications are the solar systems as well as the recovery of residual heat for its posterior use in other processes. In spite of this great potential, the practical feasibility of latent heat storage with PCM is still limited, mainly due to a rather low thermal conductivity. This low conductivity implies small heat transfer coefficients and, consequently, thermal cycles are slow and not suitable for most of the potential applications. This work investigates experimentally the heat transfer process during melting (charge) and solidification (discharge) of five small heat exchangers working as latent heat thermal storage systems. Commercial paraffin RT35 is used as PCM filling one side of the heat exchanger and water circulates through the other side as heat transfer fluid. Average thermal power values are evaluated for various operating conditions and compared among the heat exchangers studied. When the comparison is done for average power per unit area and per average temperature gradient, results show that the double pipe heat exchanger with the PCM embedded in a graphite matrix (DPHX-PCM matrix) is the one with higher values, in the range of 700-800 W/m2-K, which are one order of magnitude higher than the ones presented by the second best. On the other hand, the compact heat exchanger (CompHX-PCM) is by large the one with the highest average thermal power (above 1 kW), as it has the highest ratio of heat transfer area to external volume. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The simulation of energy mixing and merging processes was performed for an innovative energy merger pipe in which the open angle (A) of the air storage tank's throttle valve and the contraction of the cross-sectional area (CSA) at the merging region of the energy merger pipe can be adjusted for changes in Pair. The simulations were carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results showed that the exhaust-gas recycling efficiency and the merger flow energy are significantly dependent on the optimal adjustments of A and CSA for the change in Pair. The optimal conditions for higher exhaust-gas recycling efficiency and the best energy merging process can be achieved at A of around 25-100% and a CSA of around 5-40% for a full range of Pair. Under these conditions, the exhaust-gas recycling efficiency reached approximately 80-88%. Therefore, a vehicle equipped with an HPPS can achieve a level of efficiency that is approximately 40% higher than that of conventional vehicles.

Nano-scale physical and chemical interactions govern the packing of self-assembled amphiphilic molecules, resulting in thermodynamically stable phases of defined geometries. Possible phases include micellar, hexagonal, cubic, lamellar and sponge phases. The internal nano-structure of the amphiphile self-assembly materials plays an important role in the properties of these systems and their application. To date small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) has been the most common technique used to characterise their structure. We explore positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) as an alternative and/or complementary technique for this purpose, using the phytantriol/water system. While PALS is a well established technique for characterising many materials, the coexistence of aqueous and hydrophobic regions in a soft self-assembled amphiphile material poses a challenge to the analysis and interpretation of the results. In order to alleviate these difficulties we developed a computer program for general-purpose PALS data analysis called PAScual. Amongst the most salient features of this new code are the possibility to perform bounded fits and the option of using advanced algorithms to provide a more robust and unbiased fit: on the one hand, it incorporates a global nonlinear optimisation routine based on the Simulated Annealing algorithm and, on the other hand it gives information on the reliability of the results by means of a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo Bayesian Inference method. In this work we present the newly developed PALS data analysis techniques as well as the results for the phytantriol/water system, comparing them with additional data obtained from complementary techniques. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Amphiphile; Annihilation; Bayesian inference; Data analysis; Monte-Carlo; Open source; Optimisation; PALS; Phytantriol; Positron; Self-assembly; Simulated annealing","Amphiphiles; Bayesian networks; Chemical analysis; Data handling; Data reduction; Digital storage; Drug delivery; Electrons; Inference engines; Information analysis; Markov processes; Nanostructures; Nonlinear programming; Positron annihilation spectroscopy; Positrons; Self assembly; Simulated annealing; X ray scattering; Annihilation; Bayesian inference; Open sources; Optimisations; PALS; Phytantriol; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64349111890

A key factor is insulin resistance, defined as a reduced ability of insulin to stimulate glucose utilization and storage. Compelling evidence links insulin resistance with an excess fatty acid supply over energy need, resulting in lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues. The AMPK pathway plays a key role in sensing and regulating tissue energy metabolism, influencing fuel metabolism in tissues including muscle and liver. A number of its actions could improve muscle insulin sensitivity at least partly by increasing fatty acid oxidation and diminishing synthesis of malonyl CoA, glycerolipids, ceramide and other molecules linked to insulin resistance, although the extent of these effects, particularly in the human context, is uncertain. Secondly, its activation could bypass the metabolic block associated with insulin resistance. Thirdly, it is possible that a dysregulation of the AMPK pathway may itself contribute to the metabolic derangement associated with insulin resistance. These issues are important in considering the AMPK pathway as a therapeutic target in insulin resistant states.","AMPK; Fatty acids; Glucose metabolism; In vivo physiology; Insulin resistance; Liver; Muscle; Obesity; Review; Type 2 diabetes","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; lipid; animal; enzyme activation; enzymology; human; insulin resistance; metabolism; physiology; review; skeletal muscle; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Enzyme Activation; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipids; Muscle, Skeletal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849273089

The study adopts particle swarm algorithm to facilitate optimization of ice-storage air-conditioning systems and to develop optimal operating strategies, using minimal life cycle cost as the objective function. Increase in power consumption and CO2 emission triggered by the use of ice-storage air-conditioning system is also examined and analyzed. Case study is based on a typical air-conditioning system in an office building. Results indicate that, with proper parameters, particle swarm algorithm can be effectively applied to the optimization of ice-storage air-conditioning system. In addition, optimal capacity of the ice-storage tank can be obtained. However, the volume of power consumption and CO2 emission rises with the increase in ice-storage tank capacity.

Electrical impedance spectroscopy allowed to determine the room-temperature ionic solids (RTISs) ionic conductivities, which was the highest for carboxylic acid functionalized RTIS 3 [C2O2MIm][Cl]. The toxic manganese dioxide was substituted by benzoquinone. A systematic ionic conductivity optimization of RTIS 3-benzoquinone-ZnSO4-H2O mixtures at room temperature resulted in the identification of the following conditions for the Leclanché battery studies: 50 mg of a 50:50 RTIS:benzoquinone mixture and 96 mg of water. The chronopotentiometric experiments with a constant current of 5 μA showed a remarkable performance for the RTIS 3 based battery. The potential (1.47 V) and stability is comparable to that of the commercial Rayovac® battery filling (model AA).

At this stage, there is still a need for a better understanding of the potential and relevance of EC in developing countries as well as the behaviour of SMEs towards EC adoption. Moreover, there is still a need for a holistic view of how various widely known factors at the organization, industry and national levels affect EC adoption. Therefore, this study proposes a theoretical model of EC technologies adoption by SMEs in developing countries by incorporating various readiness factors identified in the literature that may determine EC technologies adoption by SMEs in developing countries. It then explores the influence of these factors on the adoption of different EC technologies. The environmental pressure is also considered in this study. Through a survey of SMEs within the grocery industry in Malaysia as an example of a developing country, the study demonstrates how various readiness factors influence the adoption of various EC technologies differently. This study provides additional insights into EC adoption by SMEs in developing countries and has important implications for research and practice. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Blood vessel prostheses; Developing countries; Electric energy storage; Electronic commerce; Technology; Environmental pressures; Grocery industries; Holistic views; Malaysia; National levels; Readiness factors; Small to medium-sized enterprise; Theoretical models; Electric conductivity measurement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63349101602

Because of the storage, transmission bandwidth, picture archiving and communication constraints and the limitations of the conventional compression methods, the medical imagery need to be compressed selectively to reduce the transmission time and storage cost along with the preservance of the high diagnostic quality. The other important reason of context based medical image compression is the high spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity requirements. In medical images, contextual region is an area which contains the most useful and important information and must be coded carefully without appreciable distortion. A novel scheme for context based coding is proposed here and yields significantly better compression rates than the general methods of JPEG and JPEG2K. In this proposed method the contextual part of the image is encoded selectively on the high priority basis with a very low compression rate (high bpp) and the background of the image is separately encoded with a low priority and a high compression rate (low bpp) and they are re-combined for the reconstruction of the image. As a result, high over all compression rates, better diagnostic image quality and improved performance parameters (CR, MSE, PSNR and CoC) are obtained. The experimental results have been compared to the scaling, Maxshift, implicit and EBCOT methods on ultrasound medical images and it is found that the proposed algorithm gives better and improved results. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The statistical analysis was performed based on a dominant model. With diet type I (low fat) and diet type II (low carbohydrate) in probands with both wild-type alleles, we observed decreases in BMI, weight, fat mass, systolic blood pressure, leptin levels, and insulin concentrations. In addition, with diet type II, a decrease in diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels was detected. Secondary to diet type I, a decrease in waist circumference and TNF-alpha was observed. Carriers of the T variant experienced decreases in BMI, weight, and fat mass on both diets, without statistical changes in biochemical parameters. In probands with both C alleles, both diets decreased insulin concentrations, blood pressure, and leptin concentrations.

We use net present value (NPV) method for the comparison of autonomous hybrid energy system and extension of transmission line cases. The case study is completed for the satisfaction of the electricity consumption of global system for mobile communication base station (GSM) at Izmir Institute of Technology Campus Area, Urla, Izmir, Turkey. First, we optimize the PV/wind energy system using response surface methodology (RSM) which is a collection of statistical and mathematical methods relying on optimization of response surface with design parameters. As a result of RSM, the optimum PV area, wind turbine rotor swept area, and battery capacity are obtained as 3.95 m2, 29.4 m2, 31.92 kW h, respectively. These results led to $37,033.9 hybrid energy system cost. Second, break-even analysis is done to be able to decide the optimum distance where the hybrid energy system is more economical than the extension of the transmission line.

Various kinetic parameters, including the reaction order, activation energy, and kinetic rate constants, were investigated, and the storage stability of the epoxy-layered silicate nanocomposites was measured. To synthesize the epoxy-layered silicate nanocomposites, the phenolic hardener underwent pre-intercalation by layered silicate. From the cure kinetics analyses, the organically modified layered silicate decreased the activation energy during cure reaction in the epoxy/phenolic hardener system. In addition, the storage stability of the nanocomposite with the pre-intercalated phenolic hardener was significantly increased compared to that of the nanocomposite with direct mixing of epoxy, phenolic hardener, and layered silicate. This was due to the protective effect of the reaction between onium ions and epoxide groups.","Cure kinetics; Layered silicates; Nanocomposites; o-Cresol novolac epoxy; Phenol novolac",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61749091897

In this paper we analyse various integrated configurations of several types of commercially available absorption cooling chillers and MGT cogeneration systems driven by biogas. MGTs are fuelled with biogas and their waste heat is used to drive absorption chillers and other thermal energy users. The chillers considered in this study include single- and double-effect water/LiBr and ammonia/water chillers. The exhaust gas from the MGT can be used directly to drive the chiller or indirectly to produce hot water to drive the chiller. In this paper we conduct a case study for an existing sewage treatment plant. Chilled water is used to reduce humidity in the biogas pre-treatment process and cool the combustion air of the MGT. We identify the most interesting integrated configurations for trigeneration systems that use biogas and micro gas turbines. We analyse these configurations and compare them with conventional configurations using operational data from an existing sewage treatment plant. The best configurations are those that completely replace the existing system with a trigeneration plant that uses all the available biogas and additional natural gas to completely meet the heating demands of the sewage treatment plant. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A case study is done using load data collected from three villages (300 km south of Chennai, India). Simulations carried out for one-year period proved the effectiveness of the developed energy management system by satisfying the load demand, non-linear seasonal variations and equipment constraints. Also, with the proposed energy management, it is found that most of the load demand is satisfied, the dumped energy is low and the state of charge of the battery is reasonably in good level.

Low serum leptin levels, as seen in starvation, are associated with impaired inflammatory T cell responses that can be reversed by exogenous leptin. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections. Several defects in T cell function have also been described, and allergy, autoimmune disease, and lymphomas or other malignancies can be present. Previous studies in Brazilian CVID patients have shown that, in contrast with mononuclear cells from healthy controls, CVID cells cultured with phytohemagglutinin and added leptin increased the proliferative response and decreased activation-induced apoptosis. Interleukin (IL)-2 and especially IL-4 production also increased significantly, although the effects of exposure to leptin were not observed uniformly in CVID patients. The majority, however, responded in some degree, and some exhibited completely restored values of the four parameters.These remarkable results indicate leptin could be used to improve immune function in these patients. On the other hand, we found no specific correlation between serum leptin levels and the number of infectious events over a 24-month period, presence of autoimmunity, allergies, or cancer in these patients. The results suggest that the absolute value of serum leptin does not determine the clinical behavior of patients or responses to leptin in vitro. Of note is the divergence between serum leptin, response to leptin in vitro, and the presence of autoimmunity, indicating the need to identify the cellular and molecular players involved in the regulation of the immune response by leptin in CVID. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Autoimmunity; Common variable immunodeficiency; Leptin; T cell response","interleukin 2; interleukin 4; leptin; allergy; autoimmunity; cell culture; clinical feature; common variable immunodeficiency; conference paper; culture medium; cytokine production; human; immune response; immunoregulation; inflammation; neoplasm; starvation; T lymphocyte",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60349095683

The proposed technique emulates the behaviour of traditional motion target detection algorithms without the need for reliable Doppler information. It also constitutes a powerful non-coherent integration strategy of the target's energy along its specific path on the range-time plot.

Even though the cutting mechanism of the ablation process is different from that of the mechanical cutting process, an identical toolpath of the mechanical cutting process has been applied to the ablation process. An inappropriate toolpath for the ablation process may result in a lower dimensional accuracy of the ablated part. Therefore, a new toolpath planning algorithm considering the characteristics of the energy source is required. In this paper, a toolpath planning algorithm for the ablation process is proposed. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: (1) The generation of a valid toolpath element, (2) the storage of toolpath elements and the creation of sub-groups, (3) the linking of sub-groups. New guidelines on the toolpath demanded by the ablation process are studied. A new idea involving the use of a storage matrix is applied to the storage of toolpath elements and the creation of sub-groups. In order to verify the applicability of the proposed algorithm, the proposed toolpath planning algorithm has been implemented and tested with practical examples. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These compounds (Pc2Lu) are soluble in most common organic solvents and have been fully characterized (elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry). The thermal stabilities of the Pc compounds were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The mesogenic properties of these new materials forming columnar-hexagonal (Colh) mesophases were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The compounds 2-5 exhibit a double clearing point. DC electrical properties of these compounds in different phases were determined by measuring I-V characteristics and dark current of their thin films on interdigital electrodes. The measurements were carried out in ambient air, in vacuum and in high purity nitrogen (N2) flow in the temperature range between 300 and 420 K. Dark current measurements obtained in the crystal, liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic liquid phases were in agreement with the phase transitions of these compounds obtained by DSC and optical microscopy results. The relation between the phase transition and conductivity of the Pc2Lu derivatives were investigated. Also, the influence of the nature of the substituted group (alkylthia and alkoxy) upon the DC electrical properties of the Pc2Lu derivatives was investigated. The DC conductivities and the thermal activation energies depending on alkyl chain lengths of these compounds were found to be in the range of 10-8 to 10-5 S/cm and 0.12-0.38 eV in solid phase.

With the increase of the concentration to 2 M, the density of paste decreased. However, the compressive strength of cement was not necessarily correlated with the density and dependent on the type of saline solution used for storage after setting. One solution led rather porous paste and the strongest specimen from the series was obtained under the maximized amount of apatite within the paste. The other saline solution induced the more dense paste after setting. In this series, the strongest specimen was obtained under the coexistence of low crystalline apatite and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate. The difference between two saline solutions was explained in terms of the solidity of skeleton formed by apatite.","Bone cement; Compressive strength; DBM; Saline solution; Storage","Apatite; Bone cement; Database systems; Energy storage; Setting; Apatite-type; Demineralized bone matrix; Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate; Saline solutions; Setting agents; Compressive strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849101443

Methods: Four restorative materials (Z250, Beautifil, Dyract AP and Fuji II LC) with shade A3.5 were tested in conjunction with three LCUs (Astralis 3, Blue phase and Radii). The specimens were prepared using specially constructed molds, irradiating only the top surface to an equivalent energy density (J/CM). Vickers microhardness measurements were performed for both the top and bottom surfaces of all specimens following dry storage for 15 minutes in the dark. The measurements were repeated after 24 hours and 7 days. Mean VHNs and SD of the top and bottom surfaces of each specimen were calculated. Relative hardness values (RH) were also determined and mean RH was calculated for each group. Results: The top surface of the Z250, Beautifil and Dyract materials were significantly harder than the bottom surface (p<0.05) with all LCUs and at all time intervals. Conversely, a different trend was observed with Fuji II LC, where bottom surface VHNs were significantly higher than top surface values (p<0.05). Blue phase was the only LCU that recorded RH values above 80% for all tested material at all post-irradiation intervals. Conclusions: A highintensity LED LCU used for 10 seconds resulted in RH values greater than 80%, with all four restoratives tested indicating a sufficient degree of monomer conversion with such a short curing cycle.",,"beautifil restorative; biomedical and dental materials; bisphenol A bis(2 hydroxypropyl) ether dimethacrylate; compomer; Dyract; Filtek Z250; Fuji II LC cement; glass ionomer; resin; resin cement; article; chemistry; classification; dental curing light; dental surgery; hardness; human; materials testing; mechanical stress; radiation exposure; surface property; time; Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate; Compomers; Composite Resins; Curing Lights, Dental; Dental Materials; Dental Restoration, Permanent; Glass Ionomer Cements; Hardness; Humans; Materials Testing; Resin Cements; Resins, Synthetic; Stress, Mechanical; Surface Properties; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58649114032

Under hydrothermal synthesis conditions, nanorods (NRs) and nanoparticles (NPs) are found to form either of the two polymorphic phases, i.e., nanorods are formed of predominantly anatase phase while nanoparticles are formed of rutile phase. NRs and NPs are introduced into the CNT matrix via the wetness-impregnation method. These composites store up to 0.40 wt.% of hydrogen at 298 K and 18 atm, which is nearly five times higher the hydrogen uptake of pristine CNTs. The excess amount of hydrogen stored in TiO2-impregnated CNTs is determined from the amount of TiO2 in the sample and the measured hydrogen uptake of TiO2 nanoparticles. Higher hydrogen uptake of NP-impregnated CNTs when compared pristine CNTs is accounted for by considering initial binding of hydrogen on TiO2 and subsequent spillover in CNT-TiO2-NPs. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Adsorption; Anatase; Nanoparticles; Nanotube; Rutile; Sievert's volumetric apparatus; Spillover","Adsorption; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrothermal synthesis; Internet protocols; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Nanorods; Nanotubes; Nonmetals; Oxide minerals; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium dioxide; Titanium oxides; Anatase; Nanotube; Rutile; Sievert's volumetric apparatus; Spillover; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58549100052

Design: Cohort study. Setting: Population-based study in a genetically isolated population in the southwest of the Netherlands. Population: Women after pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (n=45), SGA offspring (n=53) and uncomplicated pregnancies (n=106). Methods: Women were compared for body composition and fat distribution variables, assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and anthropometrics at a mean follow-up time of 10.8 (SD ±5.9) years after pregnancy. Main outcome measures: Total lean and fat mass, android fat mass, gynoid fat mass, android-to-gynoid fat ratio, waist and hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio. Results: Women with previous pre-eclampsia compared with controls had higher mean total fat mass index (11.5 ± 0.6 versus 9.7 ± 0.4 kg/m2; P = 0.03), lean mass index (15.8 ± 0.3 versus 14.5 ± 0.2 kg/m2; P = 0.001) and body mass index ([BMI]; 28.4 ± 0.8 versus 25.4 ± 0.5 kg/m2; P = 0.005).

Mean total fat, lean and BMI was not significantly different between women with previous SGA offspring and controls, yet waist-to-hip ratios (0.83 ± 0.01; P &lt; 0.001) were higher. The observed differences in waist and hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and gynoid fat mass could not be attributed to differences in BMI.

However, magnetic properties are the most important to AFM texturing. In this work, top-configuration exchange-biasing NiFe/IrMn(x Å) systems have been investigated with three different conditions. From the high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (HR X-TEM) and X-ray diffraction results, we conclude that the IrMn (111) texture plays an important role in exchange-biasing field (H ex) and interfacial exchange energy (J k). H ex and J k tend to saturate when the IrMn thickness increases. Moreover, the coercivity (H c) dependence on IrMn thickness is explained based on the coupling or decoupling effect between the spins of the NiFe and IrMn layers near the NiFe/IrMn interface. In this work, the optimal values for H ex and J k are 115 Oe and 0.062 erg/cm 2, respectively.","Coupling or decoupling effect; Exchange biasing; Texture","(111) texture; Antiferromagnetic (AFM); Coercivity; Coupling or decoupling effect; Exchange biasing; Exchange energies; Loop shifting; Random access memories; Spin couplings; Texture; X ray diffraction (XRD); Antiferromagnetism; Atomic force microscopy; Electric resistance; High resolution electron microscopy; Hysteresis; Interfacial energy; Iridium; Iridium compounds; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic materials; Magnetic properties; Magnetoresistance; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Random access storage; Spin dynamics; Textures; Transmission electron microscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58549089683

Crystallite sizes calculated from Scherrer relation are in the range of 173-345 Å. So far, because the optical parameters of the metastable cubic CdS have not been so well known, we apply spectroscopic ellipsometry to determine the thickness, optical constants and energy band gap of CdS thin film deposited by thermal evaporation onto opaque gold substrate, a perfect reflectivity and inert metal. As shown the measured spectral behavior of the optical constants and the band gap value of CdS thin film are in agreement with those obtained by the reflectance and transmittance methods.

Infrared reflection spectroscopic (IRRS) studies have been employed to establish its low phonon energy. Ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption and photoluminescence upconversion properties with special emphasis on the spectrochemistry of the 15K2O-15B2O3-70Sb2O3 (mol%) glass have been studied doping with different concentrations (0.1-1.0 wt%) of Er2O3. UV-vis-NIR absorption band positions have been justified with quantitative calculation of nephelauxetic parameter and covalent bonding characteristics of the host. NIR to visible upconversion has been investigated by exciting at 798 nm at room temperature. Three upconverted bands originating from the 2H11/2 →4I15/2, 4S3/2 →4I15/2 and 4F9/2 →4I15/2 transitions are found to be centered at 522 (green, very weak), 536 (green, medium) and 645 (red, strong) nm, respectively. These bands have been explained from the evaluation of the absorption, normal (down conversion) fluorescence and excitation spectra. The upconversion processes have been explained by the excited state absorption (ESA), energy transfer (ET), cooperative energy transfer (CET) and cross relaxation (CR) mechanisms involving population of the metastable (storage) energy levels (2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2) by effects of multiphonon deexcitation and thermal population. It is evident from the IRRS study that the upconversion phenomena are expedited by the low multiphonon relaxation rate in antimony glasses owing to their high intense low phonon energy (602 cm-1) which is very close to that of fluoride glasses (500-600 cm-1).

It is difficult to discern the effects of maternal obesogenic factors - such as diet and/or thrifty genetic predisposition - from gestational weight gain per se. Methods: For this reason, genetically normal Wistar rats that were fed regular chow were rendered hypothalamically obese by chronic third-cerebral ventricular (i3vt) infusion during pregnancy and lactation with the melanocortin-3,4 receptor blocker SHU9119. This procedure caused significant increases in body weight gain during pregnancy and lactation compared with controls, and the effects thereof on offspring energy balance and fuel homeostasis were investigated. Results: At birth, litter weight and size, but not individual pup weight, of SHU9119-treated mothers were significantly smaller than controls. In litters culled to eight, pup weight gain during lactation was only transiently increased by treatment. After weaning, however, male offspring of SHU9119-treated mothers became increasingly heavier over time relative to controls until killing at 9 months. This effect was only transient in females. Increased body weights of males were not associated with disturbances in glucose homeostasis, but with increased energy expenditure instead. Multiple regression analysis revealed that gestational body weight gain, irrespective of the group, contributed positively to increased visceral fat deposition and carbohydrate oxidation in the male offspring. In contrast, the pre-pregnancy body weight of mothers contributed positively to male offspring daily energy expenditure, subcutaneous fat and eviscerated carcass as well as structural organ weights. In female offspring, gestational body weight gain, but not pre-gestational body weight, contributed both to aspects of weight gain as well as to the shift of fat oxidation toward carbohydrate oxidation. Conclusion: Gestational weight gain induced by low brain melanocortin receptor activity can lead to increased body weight gain in the offspring (particularly in males) independent of obesogenic dietary and/or thrifty genetic predisposition. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Generational effects; Lactation; Maternal obesity; Metabolic imprinting; Pregnancy; SHU9119","carbohydrate; fat; glucose; melanocortin; n acetyl alpha intermedin[4-10]cyclo[4 norleucine 5 aspartic acid 7 [3 (2 naphthyl)alanine] 10 lysinamide]; animal experiment; article; birth; body size; body weight; carcass; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; fatty acid oxidation; female; genetic predisposition; gestation period; glucose homeostasis; hormone action; hypothalamus; intraabdominal fat; lactation; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; obesity; organ weight; pregnancy; priority journal; progeny; rat; subcutaneous fat; weaning; weight gain; Wistar rat; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Brain; Energy Metabolism; Female; Hypothalamus; Male; Melanocortins; Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones; Pregnancy; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptors, Melanocortin; Sex Factors; Weight Gain; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149490977

The median device lifetime is extrapolated and the activation energy of the VCSELs is calculated based on the reliability testing results. In addition, the degradation mechanism of the tested VCSELs is analyzed using the correlation between the current-voltage characteristics (I-V) and the device lifetime.

PHA production is mostly based on pure cultures operated under sterile conditions, which increase the costs of this biopolymer. The use of inexpensive mixed culture biomass, such as activated sludge, to produce biodegradable plastics from renewable waste streams has been proposed as an alternative. The effect of carbon sources (acetate, propionate, butyrate and glucose) on the type and quantity of PHA synthesis obtained with different enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) microbial communities enriched with acetate and propionate are reported in this work. Two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were seeded with biomass withdrawn from a non-EBPR wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The same operational conditions were kept, but using acetate or propionate as the sole carbon source of each reactor. These conditions produced two microbial communities with different P-removal capacity. The results presented in this study show the effect of the carbon source on the PHA composition (amount of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) and polyhydroxy-2-methylvalerate (PH2MV)), which differed not just between substrates but also between the two EBPR communities used. In addition, some monomers not always analysed contribute significantly to the total amount of PHA, especially when using butyrate, showing that if they are not considered this can lead to erroneous calculated yields. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The samples were subjected to X-ray florescence (XRF) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies. The metal hydride electrodes were assembled, and their discharge capacity was determined. These alloys delivered discharge capacity between 118 and 266 mAh/g. CV investigations threw light on charge-transfer reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and hydrogen surface coverage capacity. The CV parameters in general indicate that the battery activity increases with lanthanum/cerium ratio. At low lanthanum/cerium values, the discharge reactions proceed at potentials that are more negative. Furthermore, electrochemical reversibility of the hydrogen absorption-desorption on the alloy surface is enhanced at optimum lanthanum/cerium ratio as revealed by decreasing values of peak separation. The slopes of graphical plots of Ipeak (anodic) vs. ν1/2 for the fully charged samples reverse direction at very high lanthanum/cerium values.

An induction period with negligible rate was observed upon illumination of catalyst. The rate gradually increases and again falls down. The rate has been observed to be proportional to the sulfide ions adsorbed on the surface of CdS. The induction period has been related to the re-establishment of adsorption equilibrium of sulfide ions on the catalyst surface under illumination. The decrease in rate is due to the deactivation of catalyst by hydrogen. A power law type rate expression for hydrogen production has been proposed which takes into account the deactivation of the catalyst. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen; Kinetics; Photocatalysis; Solar energy","Adsorption; Cadmium compounds; Catalysis; Catalyst deactivation; Data storage equipment; Gas fuel manufacture; Gas producers; Hydrogen; Nonmetals; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Platinum; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Adsorption equilibriums; Catalyst surfaces; Induction periods; Power laws; Rate expressions; Sulfide ions; Visible lights; Water to hydrogens; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57949095794

We argue that neither high energy future is probable, because of resource limitations, and rising energy, environmental and money costs per unit of delivered energy as annual energy demand rises far beyond present levels. The low energy/low fossil case is most likely, followed by the low energy/high fossil case, although both require large cuts in energy use, and most probably, lifestyle changes in high energy use countries. Hydrogen production would be best favoured in the low fossil fuel options, with production both greater, and implemented earlier, in the higher energy case. It is thus least likely in the low energy/high fossil fuel case. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Carbon capture and storage; Energy consumption; Global warming; Hydrogen; Renewable energy","Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas fuel manufacture; Global warming; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Military operations; Nonmetals; 21st centuries; Carbon capture and storage; Energy consumption; Energy demands; Energy futures; Energy uses; Fossil fuel energies; Fuel options; Global energy demands; High energies; Renewable energy; Resource limitations; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57949083683

Here, we demonstrate that high-density arrays of nanostructures of a ferroelectric polymer can be easily fabricated by a simple nano-embossing protocol, with integration densities larger than 33 Gbits inch -2. The orientation of the polarization axis, about which the dipole moment rotates, is simultaneously aligned in plane over the whole patterned region. Internal structural defects are significantly eliminated in the nanostructures. The improved crystal orientation and quality enable well-defined uniform switching behaviour from cell to cell. Each nanocell shows a narrow and almost ideal square-shaped hysteresis curve, with low energy losses and a coercive field of ∼10 MV m-1, well below previously reported bulk values. These results pave the way to the fabrication of soft plastic memories compatible with all-organic electronics and low-power information technology. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In mice it is highly expressed in cells characterized by high-energy consumption, while is undetectable in iron storage tissues like liver and spleen. FtMt expression in mammalian cells was shown to cause a shift of iron from cytosol to mitochondria, and in yeast it rescued the defects associated with frataxin deficiency. To study the role of FtMt in oxidative damage, we analyzed the effect of its expression in HeLa cells after incubation with H2O2 and Antimycin A, and after a long-term growth in glucose-free media that enhances mitochondrial respiratory activity. FtMt reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the level of adenosine 5'triphosphate and the activity of mitochondrial Fe-S enzymes, and had a positive effect on cell viability. Furthermore, FtMt expression reduces the size of cytosolic and mitochondrial labile iron pools. In cells grown in glucose-free media, FtMt level was reduced owing to faster degradation rate, however it still protected the activity of mitochondrial Fe-S enzymes without affecting the cytosolic iron status. In addition, FtMt expression in fibroblasts from Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) patients prevented the formation of ROS and partially rescued the impaired activity of mitochondrial Fe-S enzymes, caused by frataxin deficiency. These results indicate that the primary function of FtMt involves the control of ROS formation through the regulation of mitochondrial iron availability. They are consistent with the expression pattern of FtMt observed in mouse tissues, suggesting a FtMt protective role in cells characterized by defective iron homeostasis and respiration, such as in FRDA. © The Author 2008.

In this study, as a safety check, the ABAQUS/Explicit code is adopted to analyse the seismic response of the dry storage facility planned to be installed at Nuclear Power Plant #1 (NPP1) in Taiwan. A 3D coupled finite element (FE) model was established, which consisted of a freestanding cask, a concrete pad, and underneath soils interacting with frictional contact interfaces. The scenario earthquake used in the model included an artificial earthquake compatible to the design spectrum of NPP1, and a strong ground motion modified from the time history recorded during the Chi-Chi earthquake. The results show that the freestanding cask will slide, but not tip over, during strong earthquakes. The scale of the sliding is very small and a collision between casks will not occur. In addition, the differential settlement of the foundation pad that takes place due to the weight of the casks increases the sliding potential of the casks during earthquakes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

For their rheological description in different flow situations (shear and elongational) the eXtended Pom-Pom (XPP) and PTT-XPP models were used. A rotational rheometer (ARES 2000) with the SER Universal Testing Platform was used for the measurement of dynamic data (storage G′ and loss G″ moduli) and uniaxial extensional viscosity. It was shown that both processed (branched) mPPs (with and without peroxide) exhibit distinct behavior in uniaxial extensional viscosity (appearance of strain hardening) in comparison to the virgin (linear) mPP. The XPP and PTT-XPP models proved their usefulness for a branching level quantification based on the measurements of steady shear and elongational viscosities. On the other hand, poorer models' predictions of the transient extensional viscosity indicate absence of an H branching for the processed mPPs. Based on the activation energy data it has been suggested that processed mPPs may have star-branched structure. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To maintain and enhance these advantages and in the meantime to keep the production efficiency and reduce production cost requires SMEs to move to mass customization which is supported by various computer aided engineering, manufacture and management technologies or digital manufacturing technologies, such as computer aided design (CAD), process planning (CAPP), and manufacturing (CAM). However, for efficiently producing one-of-a-kind products by using one-piece flow production methods, accurate and timely information is required in large quantities which need to be processed by an information system. This paper presents the development of such an information system, which enables a medium-sized window and door manufacturer in Calgary, Canada to mass produce customised windows and doors using one-piece flow production methods. This industrial application demonstrates that an information system is a key technology for an SME to realize mass customization in one-of-a-kind production.","Digital manufacturing; Mass customization; One-of-a-kind production; One-piece flow; Product development and management","Competition; Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Computer aided manufacturing; Computer aided process planning; Digital arithmetic; Doors; Electric energy storage; Industrial applications; Information systems; Planning; Process engineering; Product development; Project management; Windows; Calgary; Competitive advantages; Computer-aided designs; Digital manufacturing; Flow productions; High qualities; Key technologies; Lead times; Mass customization; Mass customizations; Medium sized enterprises; One-of-a-kind production; One-piece flow; Production costs; Production efficiencies; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049138869

This study uses the Functions of Innovation Systems approach to identify key policy issues that need to be addressed in order to prolong Norway's international leadership position in the development of CCS. The analysis shows that Norway has been successful in building an innovation system around CCS technology. The key determinants for this achievement are pinpointed in this article. However, the evolution of the innovation system seems to have entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS in Norway. The results provide a clear understanding of the current impediments in the CCS innovation system and stress the need to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions-i.e. entrepreneurial activity and market formation-to improve the performance of the system. We discuss how policymakers can use these insights to develop a coherent set of policy instruments that would foster the deployment of CCS concepts related to power production and enhanced oil recovery in Norway. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The method proposed is analysed technically and economically. Electricity generation in wind farms does not usually coincide with the electrical demand curve. If the wind-power penetration becomes high in the Spanish electrical grid, energy management will become necessary for some wind farms. A method is proposed in this paper to adjust the generation curve to the demand curve by storing electrical energy in batteries during off-peak hours (low demand) and selling stored energy to the grid during peak hours (high demand). With the results obtained and reported in this paper, for a Wind-Batteries system to be economically as profitable as a Wind-Only system, the selling price of the energy provided by the batteries during peak hours should be between 22 and 66 c€/kWh, depending on the technology and cost of the batteries. Comparison with flexible thermal generation has been performed. Additionally, the results are compared with those obtained if using hydrogen (Wind-Hydrogen system, which uses an electrolyser, hydrogen tank, and fuel cell instead of batteries), concluding that the Wind-Batteries system is both economically and energetically far more suitable. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated the effect of Proteocephalus macrocephalus on the accumulation of trace elements in the edible fish, Anguilla anguilla, in a contaminated area in Portugal (Ria de Aveiro). Also, the model P. macrocephalus/A. anguilla was assessed as a bioindicator system in the presence of the highly prevalent nematode Anguillicola crassus. Samples (kidney, liver, muscle, A. crassus and P. macrocephalus) of 20 eels harbouring A. crassus and another 20 harbouring both A. crassus and P. macrocephalus were selected for element analysis by ICP-MS. The highest concentrations of Cr, Ni and Zn were detected in P. macrocephalus. However, there was a higher liver and muscle Cr concentration in eels not infected by P. macrocephalus. Also, the nematode A. crassus presented higher Cr concentrations in those eels harbouring P. macrocephalus. Results suggest that P. macrocephalus individuals accumulate Cr and Ni while levels of Cr in eel livers and Ni levels in eel kidney are reduced. The system P. macrocephalus/A. anguilla yielded bioaccumulation factors for Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn, whereas bioaccumulation of Cu, Cr and Pb in A. crassus varied according to eel co-infection with P. macrocephalus, thus emphasising the possible role of cestode infection in metal metabolization/storage processes in host tissues. Results suggest that heavy metal pollution in Ria de Aveiro has been decreasing although it is still higher than in other contaminated areas in Europe. Nevertheless, eel consumption in Ria de Aveiro represents no risk for humans although they may represent a real contamination risk for wildlife. The system P. macrocephalus/A. anguilla is proposed as another promising bioindicator system to evaluate environmental Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn exposure in estuarine areas where both species co-occur. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Designing and launching mini satellites are becoming a current trend in the space sector since they provide an economic way to perform innovative scientific experiments and in-flight demonstration of novel space technologies. The generation, storage, control, and distribution of the electrical power in a mini satellite represents unique challenges to the power engineer since the mass and volume restrictions are very stringent. Regardless of these problems, every subsystem and payload equipment must be operated within their specified voltage band whenever they required to be turned on. This paper presents the preliminary design of a lightweight, compact, and reliable power system for ESMO that can generate 720 W.

The model is based primarily on fundamental laws, with empirical relations used only when no other approach can be devised or when there is a significant advantage from using an empirical approach. The computational domain is divided into four subdomains: a part of the ambient storage environment; the perforation, allowing gas exchange between the package and the ambient; the commodity layer, inside the package; and the headspace above the commodity, but also contained in the package. The package walls are rigid and impermeable to gases but heat conducting. The commodity is treated as a homogenous porous medium with distributed sinks for oxygen consumption and distributed sources for carbon dioxide production due to commodity respiration. The commodity model also accounts for water vapour production due to transpiration and removal caused by possible condensation. The effects of commodity temperature and headspace gas composition on oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are accounted through a respiration model. The model permits the determination of the gas mixture velocity as the solution of Darcy's law in the commodity layer and the Navier-Stokes equations in the headspace, perforation, and surrounding ambient storage area. Transport of oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapour and nitrogen is modelled based on Maxwell-Stefan equations coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations and Darcy's law. Solubility of carbon dioxide within the commodity has been included in the model. Commodity temperature and gas mixture temperature are modelled as solutions of the energy equation in the appropriate subdomains, coupled through transpiration, condensation, and convective heat transfer at the commodity surface. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The model includes species transport of CO2, H2O, N2, and O2 through the Maxwell-Stefan equations, velocity and pressure through Darcy's law and the Navier-Stokes equations, and temperature of the gas mixture and the commodity through the energy equation. Numerical solutions of the coupled system of equations were obtained using the finite-element method. To illustrate the capabilities of the general approach, simulations of a package of strawberries have been presented, for which experimental results are available in the literature. Comparison of the measurements and the model predictions were fair, considering the uncertainty of the available information. The sensitivities of the solution to the respiration rate model, respiration rates, porosity, package aspect ratio, relative humidity, transpiration coefficients, storage temperature, CO2 solubility and volume of ambient storage area considered were examined. The steady-state concentrations of O2 and CO2 in the package were found to be very sensitive to the value of respiration rate, but much less so to changes of other input parameters within the ranges considered. The steady-state commodity temperature depended on the aspect ratio of the package. Including the CO2 solubility in the commodity did not affect the steady-state gas concentrations, but it increased the time required for the CO2 concentration to reach equilibrium in the package. It was shown that neglecting the ambient space beyond the perforation overpredicted the steady-state O2 concentration. Approximately 80% of the resistance to diffusion was found to occur within the perforation, with the remainder equally divided between the spaces beyond each end of the perforation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of various parameters such as pH, temperature, activation energy, heat and storage stability on immobilized enzyme were investigated. Optimum pH and temperature were determined to be 8.0 and 50 °C, respectively. The immobilized PE exhibited better thermostability than the free one. Kinetic parameters of the immobilized enzyme (Km and Vmax values) were also evaluated. The Km was 0.71 mM and the Vmax was 0.64 μmol min-1 mg-1. No drastic change was observed in the Km and Vmax values. The patterns of heat stability indicated that the immobilization process tends to stabilize the enzyme. Thermal and storage stability experiments were also carried out.

Microencapsulation of docosane has been carried out by emulsion polymerization. The microencapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Thermal properties and thermal stability of MEPCM were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). DSC analysis indicated that the docosane in the microcapsules melts at 41.0 °C and crystallizes at 40.6 °C. It has latent heats of 54.6 and -48.7 J/g for melting and crystallization, respectively. TGA showed that the MEPCM degraded in three distinguishable steps and had good chemical stability. Accelerated thermal cycling tests also indicated that the MEPCM had good thermal reliability. Based on all these results, it can be concluded that the microencapsulated docosane as MEPCMs have good potential for thermal energy storage purposes such as solar space heating applications. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

More than ever, the construction industry is concerned with improving the social, economic and environmental indicators of sustainability. By applying LCA it is possible to optimise these aspects, from the extraction of raw materials to the final disposal of waste building materials. Firstly, this review details LCA concepts and focuses on the LCA methodology and tools employed in the built environment. Secondly, this paper outlines and discusses the differences between the LCA of building materials and components combinations versus the LCA of the full building life cycle. Finally, this work can be used by stakeholders as an important reference on LCA including up to date literature on approaches and methodologies to preserve the environment and therefore achieve sustainable development in both developed and developing countries. The present review has tried to compile and reflect the key milestones accomplished in LCA over the last 7 years, from 2000 to 2007 within the building sector. In summary, it can be stated that the application of LCA is fundamental to sustainability and improvement in building and construction. For industrial activities, SMEs must understand the application of LCA, not only to meet consumer demands for environmentally friendly products, but also to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the green construction markets. For this reason, this review looks at LCA because of its broad international acceptance as a means to improve environmental processes and services, and also for creating goals to prevent adverse environmental impacts, consequently enhancing quality of life and allowing people to live in a healthy environment. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipid content of N. oculata cells at different growth phases was also explored. The results showed that the lipid accumulation from logarithmic phase to stationary phase of N. oculata NCTU-3 was significantly increased from 30.8% to 50.4%. In the microalgal cultures aerated with 2%, 5%, 10% and 15% CO2, the maximal biomass and lipid productivity in the semicontinuous system were 0.480 and 0.142 g L-1 d-1 with 2% CO2 aeration, respectively. Even the N. oculata NCTU-3 cultured in the semicontinuous system aerated with 15% CO2, the biomass and lipid productivity could reach to 0.372 and 0.084 g L-1 d-1, respectively. In the comparison of productive efficiencies, the semicontinuous system was operated with two culture approaches over 12 d. The biomass and lipid productivity of N. oculata NCTU-3 were 0.497 and 0.151 g L-1 d-1 in one-day replacement (half broth was replaced each day), and were 0.296 and 0.121 g L-1 d-1 in three-day replacement (three fifth broth was replaced every 3 d), respectively. To optimize the condition for long-term biomass and lipid yield from N. oculata NCTU-3, this microalga was suggested to grow in the semicontinuous system aerated with 2% CO2 and operated by one-day replacement. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The studied SAPS, based on the Ventotene island demographic, meteorological and load data, features high renewable energy penetration onto the load power demand, i.e. up to 55.25% share of peak power capacity. Transient models have been developed to simulate the storage process of winter renewable energy surplus and the time-dependent matching among SAPS electric demand and the stochastic renewable power contributions combined with energy surplus conversion systems. The study compares a hydrogen-based system and a desalinated water-production system, proposed as two effective alternatives for renewable energy seasonal buffering in an island context. The comparative analysis of the time-dependent system's behaviour has been investigated with an hourly distribution over the period of one reference year, in terms of fuel consumption and hydrogen system energy storage or desalination capacity. The assessment is carried out by taking performance indicators, SAPS fuel savings, as well as stored and dump power data. The study demonstrates the suitability of both the models for the winter renewable energy buffer, in order to improve to the matching of peak energy and water demands. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, at 25 °C, the samples were characterized as a function of the different amounts of cross-linker. The gelation time of the systems, evaluated with the loss tangent, decreased with increasing temperature and, at a fixed temperature (25 °C), decreased with increasing cross-linker concentration. At the gel point a power-law frequency dependence of the dynamic storage modulus (G′≈ωn) and loss modulus (G″≈ωn) was observed. The value of n, evaluated according to three different methods (nslope, considering the parallelism of the two moduli, ntan, from the frequency-independence of tan δ, and from the crossing point between the apparent exponents of G′ and G″, napp), decreases with increasing cross-linking densities and with increasing temperature. The fractal dimension (df) was determined for the incipient GG/Ga hydrogels. The value of df increases with increasing cross-linker concentration and decreases with increasing temperature. This trend of df suggests a more ""tight"" structure of the network at higher cross-linking densities and at lower temperatures. The activation energy (Ea) of the chemical reaction between GG and Ga was estimated: the experimental value was close to those obtained in the case of similar chemical reactions among polymers and different kinds of cross-linkers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
