In this paper, the relation between the two VSGs is formed; one is operating as a source, whereas other as a load. This correlation defines the maximum power that can be delivered to the VSG controlled energy storage system (ESS), the influence of a load (static), and the effect of contingency (dynamic) on both VSGs. Furthermore, a unique control is presented to draw the constant maximum power from renewable energy source (RES) by interlinking it with the stable parallel-VSG; without compromising the ability of transient stability to dampen any disturbance. The results are illustrated through power and angular frequency graphs. © 2018 IEEE.","coordination; droop control; Energy storage control; VSG","Energy storage; Angular frequencies; coordination; Droop control; Energy storage systems; Power sharing; Renewable energy source; Storage control; Through power; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061939572

Considering a group of 20 customers with a Distribution Channel (DC) acts as an Aggregator, which are willing to participate in Demand response (DR) and in Energy Market (EM). Firstly, each customer load scheduling of appliances is done with Delayable Appliances and Non-Delayable Appliances using forecasted Day-Ahead Price, where Non-Delayable Appliance can reduce their power and Delayable Appliances can delay their operation time with in the time period limit set by the customer in a day. The cumulative load information goes to Distribution channel which re-adjusts again only Delayable Appliances. Distribution Channel adjustment is divided into two cases, viz., first with respect to available power and, second with respect to the price of power at that time. Some customers are having solar PV as a generation with battery storage. The scheduling of appliances is assumed as an optimization problem and solved through Genetic Algorithm Optimization (GAO). The results from Day-ahead and Hour-ahead scheduling can help in matching closely load for real-time consumption.

Based on the application requirements in Lebanon, a suitable PCM is selected. While this PCM solidifies, it releases its heat and keeps the water inside the DSHWST warmer than 55 °C along 10 hours. The needed mass of PCM was calculated and two types of containers were investigated: the tubes and the spheres. As well as, the comparison between DSHWST integrated with PCM (DSHWST-PCM) and the Conventional Domestic Solar Hot Water Storage Tank (CDSHWST) is introduced, in order to examine the performance of PCM heating against that with an Electrical Resistance (ER).

In fact, a microgrid system is a small-scale of a distribution system including three main elements: (i) distributed resources, (ii) storage system, and (iii) measurement system. The main purpose of a microgrid system is ensuring the continuous supply energy in a small or isolated area, thus it has two main operation modes: (i) independent and (ii) connected to the main power grid. One of the main challenges of the operation of a microgrid system is the smooth and optimal shift between these two operation modes in cases of any contingencies from both sides.

Then, the stability criterion of the analytic form of the system under large disturbance is obtained, which the effects of parameters such as AC side inductance, resistance, controller control parameters, and constant power load power values on the system stability are taken into account.

It is an effective way to increase the rate of wind power utilization by heating through the electric heating and accumulation energy to remove the abandoned wind power. In particular, the heat storage station built with the combination of distributed precept and phase change materials can give full play to the advantages of flexible matching, high heat storage efficiency and rapid response. This paper takes this as a starting point and optimizes the annual heating gains of the distributed phase-change heat storage station. Under the conditions of heat storage constraints, heating constraints, and combined heat supply constraints, a case study of a distributed phase-change heat storage station based on the urban scenario partition was conducted. The results show that the heat load characteristics of the district have a significant impact on the annual return and wind power consumption.

Improving the local consumption rate of renewable energy in distribution network is getting more and more attention. The local consumption rate is related to the matching degree of the power output characteristics and the load characteristics. Energy storage system has bi-directional flow characteristics of energy, which provides more flexibility for the distribution network to absorb renewable energy locally. However, the cost of energy storage system is high at present, and the economic efficiency of blindly increasing energy storage capacity to improve local renewable energy consumption is poor. Therefore, reducing construction costs of energy storage system is the key to optimizing planning and configuration of energy storage capacity. In this paper, the energy balance of charge and discharge in a typical day is taken as constraints. A solution model of energy storage dynamic planning and configuration based on bi-objective with minimum capacity and charging and discharging power is established. Through an improved ant colony algorithm based on stratified sequencing method, the multi-objective optimal planning and configuration is realized by finding the optimal solution of energy storage power in the optimal target constraint of energy storage capacity.

It is necessary to built charging station (CS), like the gasoline station, to satisfy the recharging and be convenient for the drivers. In this paper, a new type of charging station integrated with renewable energy source was studied. A hierarchical energy management strategy oriented to real-time application was proposed to handle the uncertainties. To determine the optimal size of the CS by considering multi-objective including economic, environment and battery energy storage system degradation, Monte Carlo simulation was adopted to solve the problem with many uncertainties. We treated battery degradation as a specific objective function. And we obtained the optimal Pareto set. The result demonstrated the optimal decision variable for CS sizing can compromise the objectives as well as realize the reasonable resource dispatch. © 2018 IEEE.","Charging station; Electric vehicles; Energy management strategy; Optimal sizing; Uncertainty","Electric vehicles; Energy management; Industrial electronics; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Battery degradation; Battery energy storage systems; Charging station; Energy management strategies; Optimal sizing; Real-time application; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061536990

An integrating periodic loads with different energy storage technologies to the common DC bus is strong alternative to the existing infrastructures. This paper addresses a key role of rectification topology in fast charging stations with respect to higher scalability, redundancy and its capacity to compensate unbalanced loads or total harmonic distortion (THD) at the point of common coupling (PCC). It is achieved through the operational performance of the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) deployed to transfer AC power generated by medium-voltage grid to common DC bus feeding multiple EV batteries. The developed control framework is constructed by two-layer configuration, in which a first-layer finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) methodology provides an initial controlled variables to regulate the rectifier module voltages and currents at the connected loads. The second-layer iterative controller is embedded into an integrated perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming (IPA-SQP) algorithm for handling nonlinearities and updating weighting factors. The control objectives are improving the computational burden with variables constraints, lowering the dc ripples and grid current harmonic contents. The feasibility assessment of load-leveling approach is also studied when large energy storage systems are in operation.

Compared with bidirectional traditional cascaded DC/DC converter, this new converter is also composed of two conventional two-level DC/DC converters. However, the two two-level converters in this converter are connected in parallel on the input side rather than in series. In addition, the voltage gain of the proposed converter is higher than bidirectional traditional cascaded DC/DC converter, because this new converter establishes the higher charging voltage of inductor in the step-up mode, which makes the inductor store more energy and transfer more energy to the high voltage side. Besides, the high voltage sides of the two converters are connected in series to constitute the whole high voltage side of converter, which further enhances the voltage gain and reduces the voltage stress on the power switches and capacitors. The operating principle and the steady-state analysis are presented detailedly in this paper.

The effectiveness of the cooperative control method is verified by MATLAB/Simulink simulations. © 2018 IEEE.","cooperative control; dc microgrid; droop control; energy storage system; power regulation","Energy policy; Energy storage; MATLAB; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Co-operative control; Dc micro-grid; Droop control; Energy storage systems; Power regulation; Decentralized control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060985291

This scheme can be divided into two levels. In the primary level, a cooperative method based on the local bus voltage information is presented, by which the distribution generators (DGs) and the energy storage system (ESS) in each MG can be coordinated together to regulate the local bus voltage within a certain range. In the secondary level, an adaptive droop method for each MG is introduced to control the power flow of the tie-line among the multiple MGs. Moreover, the reference for the operation of the ESS is automatically adjusted to accommodate the changes of DGs' droop characteristics, which are caused by the adaptive droop control.

Firstly, based on the idea of the best cycle depth of charging/discharging, the dual lithium batteries(A and B) are applied as the basic energy storage units. Super-capacitor (SC) is adopted to operate as a buffer device taking advantage of its high ramp rate performances. And the superior main DC bus is taken as the backup support with its high power. Then, the output power of the dual lithium batteries is controlled according to the super-capacitor voltage signal. In dynamic balance, the super-capacitor voltage can characterize the magnitude of the low frequency components of the DC bus voltage. Thus, there are four different hierarchies on the basis of the super-capacitor voltage signal. Four corresponding operation modes are designed to make every slack terminal obtain energy allocation efficiently.

Furthermore, three kinds of operational constraints are considered: the upper and lower bounds of times for pulsed loads supply, the non-constant upper bound of total charging power, and the completeness of charging process.

Due to decreases in the cost of natural gas and increases in the penetration of non-dispatchable generation, some of the traditional paradigms regarding dispatch order are changing. Although it is a fair assumption that emissions consequences will be changed by the order in which power plants are dispatched, there has been little research to find out the extent of this change.

An optimal control method for battery storage based on model predictive control is proposed to minimize the peak PV power injection to the grid also considering the network power loss reduction and battery degradation. The proposed method solves a linear optimal power flow formulation to calculate the battery active and reactive power set points at each time step. The proposed method is useful in accommodating maximum PV power without violating the network voltage and current limits. Simulation studies are conducted using Matlab on a Danish low-voltage distribution network. The simulation results show that the proposed control method is effective for reducing the peak PV power in-feed with minimum network power loss and battery degradation. © 2018 IEEE.","Active distribution network; Battery degradation; Battery storage; Linear optimal power flow; Model predictive control; Peak shaving.","Acoustic generators; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric power system control; MATLAB; Model predictive control; Power management; Renewable energy resources; Storage management; Voltage distribution measurement; Active and Reactive Power; Active distribution networks; Battery degradation; Linear optimal power flow; Low voltage distribution network; Optimal control methods; Peak shaving; Power distribution system; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060791792

In view of the DC bus voltage vulnerable to power fluctuation in DC micro-grids, a virtual inertial control method for DAB DC-DC converter is proposed in this paper. Analogized with the virtual synchronous generator to be introduced to increase the inertia of the AC microgrid, the virtual inertia control is proposed on the basis of the original dual phase shift control of the converter. When the power in a DC microgrid fluctuates, the energy storage system will provide inertia power support to strengthen the DC microgrid inertia and suppress the DC bus voltage fluctuation. In the proposed inertia control, the first-order inertia link is used to substitute the differential link to avoid high-frequency interference to the input signal. Finally, the DC microgrid model is built by Matlab/Simulink and the time domain simulation is carried out. It has been verified that the control strategy put forward can suppress abrupt change of the DC bus voltage during power fluctuation effectively, but slow down its recovery process. Appropriate control parameters can make the proposed control strategy work better. © 2018 IEEE.","DC microgrid; Dual active bridge(DAB) DC-DC converter; dual-phase-shift control; virtual inertia control","Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Energy storage; MATLAB; Time domain analysis; Dc micro-grid; Dual active bridges; Dual phase; Electrical isolation; Energy storage systems; High frequency interference; High power applications; Time-domain simulations; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060898249

After a short term power supply BESS needs to transfer power to the diesel generator. In order to ensure the quality of power supply during switching process, seamless switching from BESS to diesel generator is needed. In this paper, the constant voltage and constant frequency control strategy is proposed to stable the frequency and amplitude of the output voltage when BESS works separately. After the diesel generator is put into operation, it provides stable voltage amplitude and frequency support for stand-alone system, therefore, only the power control of the converter is needed, and the output power is gradually reduced according to the reference value of the given power. Then the load is transferred to the diesel generator gradually, and seamless switching from BESS to the diesel generator is completed. The simulation model of the seamless switching process of the hybrid emergency power supply system is built in this paper. In view of the difference between amplitude and frequency of diesel generator voltage and their rated values in the quasi synchronization grid connection, a control strategy for timely switching control mode is worked out.

Smart distribution network is one of the important means in reducing carbon emission of the power system. The research on the relationship of the carbon emission in different stages of the life-cycle of smart distribution network is significant for the green environment-friendly and low-carbon development of the power system, as also the research of the methods to reduce carbon emission. Currently, most of the calculation theories of carbon emission are based on the lossless network, but the practical power system is lossy, so it is necessary to study the calculation method of the carbon emission flow in the full life-cycle of smart distribution network with the consideration of power loss. In the background of low-carbon power system, this paper analyzes the influence of distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems (ESS), EV chargers on carbon emission of smart distribution network. Considering the access of DGs, ESS and EV chargers on smart distribution network, a life-cycle theory of carbon emission flow is proposed. Suggestions for the low-carbon operation mode of smart distribution network is proposed. The IEEE 33-node distribution system is used to validate the feasibility of the method.

Up until now, fossil fuels were the major source for generating power but it has changed drastically in recent years. Vehicles commonly used in today's world run solely on fossil fuels (i.e. gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum etc.) and their prodigious usage hints at the current over reliance on them. Fossil fuels are non-renewable and consequently, the existing transportability prototype is rendered untenable. Effects of energy shortage, meteoric decline in fossil fuel reserves along with environmental issues have diverted attention towards Electric vehicles. Electric vehicle is now the center of the attention and is termed as the future of transportability model. Use of Electric vehicle gives multiple advantages that include more use of renewable energy, less use of non-renewable energy sources, clean environment and energy storage options. Electric vehicles are capable of serving a dual purpose in terms of distributed storage units and loads both upon their integration with the power grid. Increased use of EVs, despite solving several problems has brought with it some new problems for power system and the grid.

However, the increasing usage of auxiliary loads i.e. EV and heat pumps creates adverse effects on the grid. Flexibility of power consumption due to uncertainty in modern day grid requires some storage elements. In this paper an overview of modern day grid is presented. Moreover the charging scheduling of Aggregators EVs battery is addressed.

There are main issues on how to establish the basic configuration of distributed energy system with multiple energy complementation and how the system can coordinate the start-stop and operation on variable load of the device to achieve maximum economic benefits. Starting from the basic configuration of energy utilization system, it is proposed in this paper that the distributed energy system with multiple energy complementation is a new energy system where natural gas is used as the main primary energy combined with renewable energy at local to satisfy different terminal users. Taking the method of stepwise decomposition and modeling, a superstructure model is established through the integration of different energy conversion technology and combination of different transformation, which can coordinate the energy flow and energy balance constraint in the subsystem such as energy generation, energy conversion and energy storage.

To determine the stability of the power systems, Lyapunov function played an important role. However, for nonlinear systems, there is no general method to construct Lyapunov functions, and the direct method gives sufficient conditions for the system, which makes it difficult to judge the stability of the system. In addition, if the Lyapunov function of the system exists, the Lyapunov function is generally not unique. In this paper, the equivalent stochastic model of two-machine power systems based on EEAC theory is taken as an example. The separable variable method is proposed to construct the Lyapunov function and then the weak stochastic asymptotic stability of the system is proved. The method is compared with the traditional Lyapunov first method to analyze the stochastic stability of the system. Finally, the case study is given and the stochastic response of the system is verified by simulation. © 2018 IEEE.","Lyapunov function; Power system; Stochastic stability","Asymptotic stability; Electric power system stability; Lyapunov functions; Stochastic systems; Direct method; General method; Lyapunov first methods; New energies; Power system; Stochastic asymptotic stability; Stochastic response; Stochastic stability; Stochastic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060881149

In this study, a decentralized coordinated power control approach is proposed with considering the limits of maximum charging/discharging power of ESS to achieve power management for islanded dc microgrids. The proposed control strategy is implemented by combining the dc bus voltage signaling with fuzzy logic control and can operate without the need for communication lines. When designing the fuzzy logic controller, in addition to the SOC, the charging/discharging power of ESS is also taken into account to keep both the SOC and power of ESS within the desired ranges. Then, the power limiting controller is designed for PV generators to curtail PV power when bus voltage is high. The fuzzy logic controller changes the bus voltage to make the output power of PV generators decrease or perform the load shedding. Based on the proposed method, the generation-storage-load coordination can be achieved to satisfy different usage scenarios. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed algorithm is verified by the Matlab/Simulink simulation results under different test scenarios. © 2018 IEEE.","charging/discharging power control; dc bus voltage signaling; dc microgrid; fuzzy logic control; power management","Computer circuits; Controllers; Electric machine control; Energy policy; Fuzzy logic; MATLAB; Power management; Charging/discharging; Dc micro-grid; DC-bus voltages; Energy storage systems; Fuzzy logic control; Fuzzy logic controllers; Matlab/Simulink simulation; Use of renewable energies; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060870713

In order to reduce pollution from gas emissions and achieve the economic goal, the multiple energy storage system(MESS) is configured. It is very important to study the economic dispatch problem for an integrated energy microgrid(MG). Hence, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization scheduling model for an island MG including a MESS. This island MG consists of a wind turbine (WT), a photovoltaic battery (PV), a fuel cell (FC), an electric boiler (EB), an electric storage, (ES) a heat storage (HS) and a gas storage(GS). Minimum economic cost and environmental cost are considered as the two objectives in the operation of this multiple energy source MG system. To solve this two-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective bacterial colony chemotaxis (MOBCC) algorithm is utilized to obtain the operation modes of the micro-sources and the Pareto optimal solution set. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and decision makers can choose the appropriate dispatch scheduling in this manner. © 2018 IEEE.","Economic dispatch; island MG; multiple energy storage system","Biochemistry; Decision making; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gas fuel storage; Heat storage; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Scheduling; Wind turbines; Bacterial colony chemotaxis; Economic Dispatch; Economic dispatch problems; Energy storage systems; Environmental costs; Optimal dispatch; Pareto optimal solutions; Two-objective optimization; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060860466

The change of the output mode of the wind storage combined system will inevitably affect the operation of the system. The output power curve of the combined system of wind storage and storage system is segmented in the research cycle, and the optimized output strategy is formulated. Other thermal power units use the optimal economic dispatching principle to calculate the force value with the combined system of wind storage. The transmission planning model of the wind-storage joint system is established with the goal of maximizing the total benefit of the system. The example uses the typical sunrise force curve of the wind farm and the improved IEEE-18 node system. The artificial fish swarm algorithm (ASFA) is used to determine the cost and optimal transmission of the wind storage combined system 1, 2, 4 and 8 respectively. Comparing the cost of each segmented system, it can be seen that the transmission planning scheme at the time of the four-segment output is shorter than that of the transmission plan without the energy storage, the investment is reduced, and the total system benefit is the largest.

Battery energy storage (BES) has been widely accepted as the most potential application to cope with the challenge of high penetration of DER. To cope with the uncertainties and variability of DER, a stochastic distribution network scheduling method is proposed. The overall economy is achieved by fully considering the cell degradation, DER, electricity purchasing and active power losses. DER power scenarios are generated to consider the uncertainties and correlations based on the Copula theory. Finally, numerical studies for the day-ahead distribution network scheduling in the IEEE 123-node test feeder are presented to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method.

And the large-scale renewable energy which was combined to the grid has great impact on the power grid. They have serious effect on the reliability and economy of the working of power grid. The application of energy storage technology for the distribution network can not only reduce the investment in response to the increase of load peak, but also promote the development and the exploitation of renewable energy, which does a favor for the reliability and quality of power supply. The energy storage system (ESS)as the technical support to intelligent distribution network plays a more and more important role. In this paper, the advantages of ESS applied to power distribution network was evaluated from the point of the perspectives of the network update delaying, network damage reducing, reducing backup power for distributed generation, the reducing of reliability cost, etc. The effect of ESS on the voltage of distribution network was theoretical derived. so the result would provide supporting evidence to the optimization analysis on the locating and capacity of ESS, which produces the important reference for the ESS configured in the distribution network. © 2018 IEEE.","energy storage system; over-limit of voltage; peak load shifting","Economics; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Investments; Quality control; Reliability; Energy storage systems; Energy storage technologies; Intelligent distribution networks; Optimization analysis; Peak load shifting; Power distribution network; Quality of power supply; Renewable energies; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060844377

Vias, in 125 μm thick PET, were laser cut (50, 100, 150, and 200 μm nominal diameter) then filled, and simultaneously connected to adjacent vias, by screen printing. To investigate the use of the printed via in a monolithic energy module, the vias were used for the fabrication of a flexible printed supercapacitor (aqueous electrolyte and carbon electrode).The results indicate that the lower viscosity silver ink (DuPont 5064H) does not fill the via as effectively as the higher viscosity ink (Asahi LS411AW), and only the sidewall of the vias are coated as the via size increases (≥ 150 μm diameter). Conversely, the Asahi silver paste fills the via more thoroughly and exhibited a 100 % yield (1010 vias; 100 μm nominal via diameter) with the 2-step direct screen-printing method.

With energy storage system, the PV power can become schedulable and the use efficiency of PV power can be greatly improved.

However, the research on the tracking output do not consider the fluctuation of PV power generation, the upper and lower limits of prediction errors, or only consider tracking the power curve.

In this control method, the objective function includes three parts, respectively the D-value between the planned output and actual output of PV power and energy storage system, the change of the state of charge (SOC) with different weight, The constraint condition considers the power demand, flexibility requirement and storage costs comprehensive. Then the prediction errors distribution law can be obtained by analyzing prediction errors of the PV power, the proper errors correction parameters can be selected according to the law to get a more accurate predication range and make the energy storage scheduling strategy more flexible.

In this paper, we study the design of a 2.45-GHz RF energy harvester (RFEH) system based on a discrete-component matching network, a custom 65nm CMOS cross-coupled rectifier coupled with an off-the-shelf storage-charging power management unit (PMU) performing rectifier output voltage regulation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). For 2.45-GHz operation, we propose a parasitic-aware sizing of π matching network. This introduces a maximum bound on the real impedance at the rectifier input to ensure good impedance matching in practice. MPPT is used to help reaching this target real impedance at given input RF power, as the rectifier input impedance is a function of both its input and output voltages. Measurement results show a sensitivity as low as-17.1 dBm with a peak power harvesting efficiency (PHE) of 48.3% at-3 dBm 2.45-GHz input RF power. Comparison between simulation and measurement results demonstrate that these results are limited by the parasitic capacitance and that PHE around 45% can be obtained down to-10 dBm with PCB/package improvement for lower parasitic capacitance. © 2018 IEEE.","2.45-GHz; impedance matching; maximum power point tracking; power harvesting efficiency; RF energy harvester","Capacitance; Energy harvesting; Impedance matching (electric); Internet of things; Maximum power point trackers; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Rectifying circuits; Smart sensors; Voltage regulators; 2.45-GHz; Information transfers; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Power harvesting; Power management units (PMU); Rectifier output voltages; Rf energy harvesters; Simulations and measurements; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060446718

Therefore, designing a simple yet efficient coordination mechanism that works on these distributed resources is of the utmost importance.

The paper assumes knowledge of P, Q, V measurements from smart meters placed in network leaf nodes only. At first, a topology identification algorithm is applied in order to estimate the network topology.

However, one main limitation of this technology is the aging, i.e., the degradation of storage capacity. This degradation happens in every condition, whether the battery is used or not, but in different proportions dependent on the usage and external conditions. Due to the complexity of aging phenomena to characterize, lifetime modeling of Li-ion cells attracts the attention of researchers in recent years. This paper develops cycling lifetime prediction models, for two different commercially available Li-ion cells, by using artificial neural networks. First, accelerated cycling tests are performed under different testing conditions, including different temperatures, state of charges, depth of discharges, and discharge current rates. Then, the test data is used to train a feedforward neural network that can predict one-step ahead state of health of the cells that are cycled under different conditions. Thereafter, a sensitivity analysis method is used to investigate the dependence of the state of health of the cells to each input parameter by calculating the partial derivative of the neural network model output with regard to each input. Finally, the sensitivity profile over the whole range of the inputs is provided and discussed. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Battery management systems; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Ions; Sensitivity analysis; Smart power grids; Depth of discharges; Different proportions; Discharge currents; External conditions; Lifetime prediction models; Neural network model; Partial derivatives; Sensitivity profiles; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060200565

They provide high energy density while the supercapacitors (SCs) ensure long lifetime cycles and operate at large range temperatures. This paper presents a control strategy of battery/SCs in Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) application in order to improve the efficiency, lifetime and reduce the cost. A comparison of using the hybridization with and without control system was established to highlight the power split between the two storage systems. A comparison of lead acid and li-ion battery was established. Finally, different ESS' financial study was set. © 2018 IEEE.","cost; lead acid; Lithium ion; Supercapacitors; Uninterruptible Power Supply","Costs; Electric power systems; Ions; Lead acid batteries; Supercapacitor; Uninterruptible power systems; Back-up systems; Charge/discharge cycle; Control strategies; Electrical devices; High energy densities; Lead acid; Lithium ions; Storage systems; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060649468

Especially, the power oscillating terms that appear due to the interaction between different sequences voltages and currents remains an important issue. This problematic requires the design of consistent arrangements to calculate the current references that should be exchanged with the grid by the grid side converter (GSC). This paper introduces a mechanism of negative-sequence injection based on the control of d-q currents coordinates. Besides, a comparison study of the design of current controllers, using a generic vector approach, to enhance unbalance-fault ride-through capability of dispersed generation has been proposed. The performance of entire control system is evaluated by time domain simulations with MATLAB/Simulink. The achieved results have helped to facilitate, according the preferential issue, the choice for fault ride through by simply changing the GSC converter currents reference. © 2018 IEEE.","Distributed power generation systems; renewable energies; symmetrical components; synchronization; unbalanced grid","Battery storage; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Hybrid systems; MATLAB; Synchronization; Time domain analysis; Distributed power generation systems; Fault ride through capability; Grid side converters (GSC); Instantaneous active and reactive power; Renewable energies; Symmetrical components; unbalanced grid; Unbalanced grid conditions; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060647699

In this paper, inspired by the construction and planning of existing rail transit system and the energy storage technology, we present a novel model from a perspective that considers the earth as an on-board energy storage device which can release the potential energy and store the potential energy when the train runs in the section. By making the most of the gravity, the model can concurrently optimize the vertical alignment between two adjacent rail transit stations and its corresponding speed trajectory for reducing the traction energy consumption. The whole route between two adjacent stations are discretized and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is applied for optimization. Specific cases such as same stations elevation and different stations elevation are studied in this paper. The results show that the proposed model can efficiently optimize the gradient, downhill length, uphill length, depth of the vertical alignment as well as the optimal speed trajectory according to the given elevation difference of the departure station and arrival station and other engineering and operational constraints.

In this presentation, we explained the possibilities to improve the upconversion emission efficiency of the nanomaterials by more than 10-fold. First, we verify by aberration corrected TEM technique to show that the recovery of surface defects can enhance visible emission efficiency of the upconversion nanomaterials under near-infrared excitation [1]. Furthermore, we show that by using core-shell-shell structure of the upconversion nanomaterials, we can improve the effective energy transfer between core and shells so that the influence of non-radiative recombination and transfer can be significantly suppressed [2]. As a result, deep ultraviolet emission can be obtained under near-infrared excitation. We also demonstrate that the use of optical feedback can control the population inversion at the upper levels of the lanthanide ions so that high emission efficiency can be sustained by laser action [3]. Finally, the use of phonon to assist population inversion in the Tm3+ doped nanomaterials is explained. It can be shown that upconversion emission efficiency at visible regime can be obtained from the upconversion Tm3+ doped nanomaterials under near-infrared excitation at high temperature (473 K) [4]. © 2018 IEEE.","emission; lanthanide-doped; Upconversion nanoparticles","Digital storage; Display devices; Energy transfer; Infrared devices; Neutron emission; Numerical models; Optoelectronic devices; Rare earth elements; Surface defects; Aberration corrected TEM; Emission efficiencies; Near-infrared excitation; Non-radiative recombinations; Population inversions; Up-conversion efficiency; Up-conversion emission; Upconversion nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060037909

This was carried out by insulating functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (fGNPs) with hydroxylated titanium dioxide (TD-OH) in poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix. The composites were prepared by solution blending and melt compounding methods to ensure well dispersion and in situ thermally reduction of the co-particles. Successful insulation of fGNPs was investigated using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Morphology of the composites were studied using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Capacitance, energy dissipation factor and electrical resistance of the composites were later measured. Results obtained showed significant reduction in energy dissipation factor (Df) for insulated graphene composites with appreciable capacitance compared to bared graphene composites. For instance, about 77% reduction in Df and capacitance of 8.5E-8F were recorded for 6.67wt%fGNPs/10wt%TD-OH composite film when compared to 6.67wt%fGNPs composite film with 2.89E-7F capacitance at 100Hz. These observations were attributed to increase in insulative layers between adjacent graphene nanosheets, indirect contact of graphene sheets in PVDF matrix and low current leakage. Also, insulated fGNPs composite films showed higher electrical resistance compared to bared fGNPs composite films. Based on the results obtained and analysis, appropriate insulation of graphene nanosheets in polymer matrix can address the challenge of high-energy dissipation associated with PGNs.

Renewable energy resources such as solar and wind energy are promising alternatives. However, one of the major limitations of renewable energy sources is that they provide us with discontinuous energies and most of them are unavailable all the time. As a result, to provide continuous power, these energy resources should be integrated with energy storage systems.

This technology is generally operated at temperatures of the order of 400° C with the synthetic oils as heat transfer fluids (HTF), while it can reach higher temperatures (500°C) using the molten salt. In this study we are interested in the modeling and simulation of a parabolic trough solar field operating with molten salt as heat transfer fluid using the Trnsys software for the meteorological data of Tozeur, Tunisia. Thermal performance of the developed model was evaluated without thermal energy storage. The designed field must provide to the Rankine cycle a thermal power equal to 35.52 MWth. We have studied the effect of the variation of the field size of the solar collectors, the gained energy that can be stored, by varying the solar multiple factor (SM). The results obtained show that by varying the SM, the size of the solar field increases and the supplied energy increases. We note that the excess energy is high for specific days during the year, which favors the presence of a storage system. For a factor SM equal to 1.5 the energy can be stored up to 6 hours and the amount of energy in excess during the most favorable day of the year (8 July) is of the order of 7.56 10 ∧ 8 KJ.

In each configuration, the accumulation of energy has been included. In configuration 1 there is an accumulation in a tank and in configuration 2 there is accumulation with batteries. The study was developed based on the demand curve for electricity of that community. In Colombia, non-interconnected zones represent 52% of the territory, which includes 90 municipalities, with a population of about 1,400,000 people. The implementation of non-conventional energies improves the living conditions of these populations where the provision of the service is deficient, this also helps to diversify the country's energy matrix. In these areas, there is a biomass potential with the common cane, which can be used as an energy crop. This work is based on the knowledge of the quantity and composition of syngas produced in gasification of this biomass to determine the performance of the internal combustion engine and the accumulation system. The results show that the alternative in which there is a battery accumulation has a cost that oscillates between 0.35 and 0.31 USD / kWh for the hours of minimum and maximum consumption respectively. In the configuration with tank accumulation, the cost is between 0.47 and 0.31 USD / kWh also for minimum and maximum consumption hours respectively. The greater value obtained in this second configuration is due to the greater irreversibilities generated by the operation at a partial load of the engine, which does not happen in the storage configuration with batteries, where the motor runs at full load during the hours of consumption. Energy storage battery has an average cost of 3 USD / kWh too high compared to the accumulation tank, where the cost of stored energy is on average 0.13 USD / kWh. © 2018 IEEE.","Colombia; Internal combustion engine; Non-interconnected zones; Syngas","Combustion; Crops; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Internal combustion engines; Synthesis gas; Tanks (containers); Biomass potential; Colombia; Energy accumulation; Exergoeconomics; Generation systems; Living conditions; Non-conventional energy; Syn-gas; Combustion equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060600769

For 9 hours, the highly irradiated desert of Chile produces PV at half the price compared to that generated from fossil fuels. A major challenge for the mining industry is to take advantage of it. However, the design concept for the equipment was to operate with carbon-based energy 24-hour flat-price. Moreover, since electrical energy used to be more expensive, these plants operate with small inter-electrode distances to reduce electrical consumption. They also require oil-heated exchangers to supplement the electrolyte heat required by the process. Now, during the 9 hour low PV price scenario a larger process current should be enough for electrolyte heating. To complement the heat required a solution is remove some electrodes per cell. Results indicate that the heat storage capacity of the electrolyte is enough to keep a semi-constant temperature throughout the day. Moreover, there are various advantages of larger electrode spacing: higher short circuit impedance, lower cathode-currents dispersion and, lower sensitivity to electrode misalignments and contact resistances dispersion. A 3D FEM fed with industrial data predicts the results. A discussion of the positive-negative effects on the copper deposit current efficiency and energy consumption is included.

To reduce wind variability costs, one feasible way is to introduce demand response (DR), which can adjust the demands to more closely follow wind power outputs. On the other hand, energy storage (ES) can coordinate with demand response to accommodate the variability of wind generation. In this paper, an optimization approach considering DR and ES is proposed and various combinations of ES and DR programs are deployed to quantify reductions in the variability costs of wind power. Then the proposed optimization model is reformulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved by using standard algorithms. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model by simulation studies on the modified IEEE 118-bus system.

In this paper, we consider the optimal operation cost management problem for a generalized EI topology which is composed of multiple interconnected AC microgrids (MGs) and energy routers (ERs). We assume that all the MGs are composed of wind turbine generators (WTGs), photovoltaic (PV) units, fuel cells (FCs), micro turbines (MTs), battery energy storage (BES) devices, and loads. Multiple topologies of EI are discussed and a generalized one is studied for mathematical system modelling. A group of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are utilized to describe the dynamics of each component within the whole EI. The controllers are set in MTs, FCs and ERs. We consider the operation cost of EI as a combination of four parts: The cost of BES devices, the power transmission loss between the interconnected MGs, the risk from AC bus frequency deviation and the additional cost involved by the controllers. Then the cost optimization problem is formulated as a stochastic control problem which is solved numerically. The effectiveness of the obtained optimal controllers is illustrated through numerical simulations. © 2018 IEEE.","differential equations; energy internet; microgrids; optimal control; stochastic systems","Controllers; Differential equations; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Operating costs; Ordinary differential equations; Stochastic systems; Topology; Wind turbines; Battery energy storages (BES); Energy internet; Micro grid; Multiple topologies; Optimal controls; Power transmission loss; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic optimal control; Stochastic control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060380915

This paper considers the component performance degradation and the battery replacement in the project cost through a multi-year mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. The effects of battery installation cost, maximum cycle before failure, replacement overhead cost, discount rate, and microsource degradation on optimal solution are studied. The results show that the optimal time interval in between battery replacements may not be fixed. Also, in the proposed model, the discount rate affects the design more than the battery replacement overhead cost. Lastly, because the energy generation technologies are only installed at the start of the first year, these technologies have to be oversized to account for their performance degradation in order to satisfy the load for the entire planning horizon. © 2018 IEEE.","degradation; hybrid renewable energy system; microgrid sizing; mixed integer linear programming; replacement","Degradation; Electric batteries; Renewable energy resources; Component degradation; Component performance; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Micro grid; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Performance degradation; replacement; Integer programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060374986

This paper establishes a double-layer index system for the division of the power supply area from three aspects: Load density, power supply reliability, and power quality. It uses the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the weight of each index, calculates weighted comprehensive score, and divides the power supply area. By analyzing the electricity demand of users in the different area, the selection of diversified power supply model for each power supply area is focused on from the two aspects of the connection mode and the electricity price mode to meet the diversified electricity demand of different users.

A centralised storage device, connected at the end of the feeder can be a very effective solution for dealing with over voltages. The classical positive-sequence control strategy is usually employed in these devices to ensure a power exchange between the grid and the battery and vice versa. Nevertheless, the voltage unbalance cannot be mitigated by the classical control strategies. In this article, a modified three-phase damping control strategy is used to discharge and charge the battery storage system. This control strategy has an improved resistive behavior towards the zero- and negative-sequence components which mitigates the voltage unbalance by injecting or drawing asymmetrical phase currents. Thus both power quality problems are mitigated. © 2018 IEEE.","Damping control strategy; Electric vehicles; Over voltages; Power factor corrector; Voltage unbalance mitigation","Damping; Electric power system control; Electric vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Virtual storage; Battery storage system; Damping control; Negative sequence components; Over-voltages; Overvoltage mitigations; Power factor corrector (PFC); Power quality problem; Voltage unbalances; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058817632

The CM sketch supports fast updates, but it also supports a trade-off between compression and error. This is important in the cold-chain setting because of the limited storage space in sensor nodes, but also because transmitting each sensed value increases energy consumption and introduces delays. In order to assess the trade-off between memory consumption and information loss, the actual values of CAPs with their estimates in various parameter settings are presented graphically. The estimates are obtained by querying the point estimator with the original dataset values.

However, DNNs suffer from large consumption of computation and storage resources, which may cause problems for service providers, such as server pressure, longer service latency and higher energy consumption. To solve these problems, we propose a framework that combines singular value decomposition (SVD) and adaptive drop weight (ADW) to accelerate and compress LSTM based models. We first build an LSTM based model that achieves an accuracy of 97.83% on the ICDAR2013 online HCCR competition dataset.

At present, the use of renewable energy for all or part of the ship's power supply equipment research, most of the reference or apply the research experience of terrestrial photovoltaic system. In real sailing, the ship’s attitude will change over time because of ocean winds, waves, current and the ship’s moving and rocking. Due to these factors, the irradiance on the ship PV panels is changing with time. The fluctuating power caused by the moving and rocking of ships will also change. In this paper, we presents a new idea of applying a virtual synchronous generator (VSG) technology to a ship, which can stabilize the partial fluctuation power caused by the moving and rocking of the ship. The VSG control strategy can show the characteristics of the synchronous generator (SG) by controlling the distributed power supply. Through virtual inertia and damping links of the VSG to stabilize the fluctuations caused by photovoltaic panels’ moving and rocking on the deck. Here illustrate some key process in this paper. Firstly, considering factors such as wind, wave and flow, the model of photovoltaic power generation in ship is established. Secondly, the VSG is introduced into the solar ship and the virtual inertia and damping coefficient in the VSG are designed by the actual situation. Thirdly, combining the discussion of the actual route from Shanghai to Sydney, simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of the method. Through the above method, not only the volume of the energy storage device and the number of charging and discharging times can be reduced, but also precious ship space can be saved and the stability of the power grid can be improved. New energy power generation equipment can approach the ship power system similar to the SG. Drawing on the experience of the SG power supply system, new energy can be better integrated into the ship power station for management and control. © 2018 IEEE.","Damping coefficient; Ship-swaying; Solar ship; Virtual inertia; Virtual synchronous generator","Damping; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power system control; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy conservation; Oceanography; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Synchronous generators; Damping coefficients; Distributed power supplies; Energy saving and emission reductions; Management and controls; Photovoltaic power generation; Power generation equipment; Use of renewable energies; Virtual inertia; Ships",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060278253

Yet all kinds of LVRT schemes commonly used in wind turbines tend to change the running state of the wind turbine and bring double impact to the transient stability of the system. This paper combines the output power of wind turbine with the equivalent mechanical power of the system, deducing the mathematical relationship between them. On this basis, it analyzes the mechanism of the influence of LVRT on the transient stability of the system, simultaneously proposing a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) coordinated control scheme to improve the transient stability of the wind farm connected power system. At the same time that the LVRT is achieved by the crowbar of the rotor, compensatory strategy of SMES, according to the influence law on the mechanical power of the equivalent system, is adjusted to achieve higher transient stability performance of the system.

In this paper, we focus on a wind farm with a battery energy storage system (BESS). The objective is to reduce the fluctuation of total output power by dynamically scheduling the charging and discharging power of BESS. The randomness of wind power is characterized by a periodic Markov chain from a long-term viewpoint. The variance of the power output is chosen as the indicator of long-term fluctuations. However, since the variance function is quadratic and non-additive, this scheduling problem does not fit the model of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We use the sensitivity-based optimization method to derive a difference formula to overcome this difficulty, which is the basis of the proposed iterative optimization algorithm. The optimal policy derived by the algorithm can determine the (dis)charging power of the BESS at each situation of the wind power, the battery energy level, and the hour of days. The performance of the proposed approach is verified through numerical experiments using real data from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

This causes substantial energy losses during the switching transitions. To cope with this issue, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical battery equalizer based on bipolar continuous-conduction mode buck-boost units. In the proposed structure, the inductor current is controlled to enter into the negative region at the end of each switching period. Thus, the body diode of power MOSFET provides a freewheeling path for the inductor current during the dead band. This ensures zero-voltage switching of both power MOSFETs. Therefore, the switching losses are significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the integral of the inductor negative current is precisely controlled to minimize the circulating current. This guarantees both minimized conduction losses and suitable equalization speed. The operation principle and control strategy of the equalizer are analyzed. The comparison of equalization speed between different equalizer is presented. An experimental prototype to balance four series-connected Lithium-ion battery cells is implemented.

These magnetically levitated drives create radial suspension forces and drive torque. They represent permanent-magnetic excited synchronous machines but feature rotors without any permanent-magnetic but salient rotor poles. A heteropolar air-gap field is excited by stator permanent magnets, which are located in-between the stator teeth. The rotor teeth change the permanent-magnetic flux paths and switch the magnetic flux linked with the stator coils, which are concentrically wound around the stator teeth. Typical bearingless flux-switching motors feature twelve stator teeth and ten salient rotor poles. However, all the presented designs up to now feature interior rotors.

However, the classical decentralized cell balancing method results in high voltage profiles of cells, which degrades the lifetime of cells in the repeated charging-discharging cycles. To address this challenge, we propose a cooperative cell balancing approach for reconfigurable supercapacitor energy storage systems. In the proposed method, cells communicate with their neighbours to synchronize cell voltages during the charging process. By carefully choosing the communication topology, the voltage profiles of cells can be maintained as low as possible, which alleviates the aging effects and prolongs the lifetime of cells.

Continuous supply and quick response to power load through bidirectional power control is of great importance to attain power balance and keep the stability of bus voltage. In this paper, we propose a reference modulation based power management strategy to tackle this problem. Specifically, an adaptive SCs reference current regulation is designed to maintain sustainable power supply for SCs. A discrete lead compensator based reference smoothing control technique is integrated in to bottom layer control in order for quick transient response to stochastic power demand. With the designed SCs current regulation and reference smoothing technique, we aim to reduce the fluctuation of bus voltage.

However, the series-connection of cells will typically lead to the cell imbalance and dispersion because of the different individual cell properties such as capacitance, internal resistance, self-discharge rate, and environmental conditions. In this paper, a voltage equalization scheme based on an advanced isolated converter topology that utilizes a multi-winding transformer is proposed for onboard supercapacitors of catenary-free trams. Voltage equalization is essential for series-connected supercapacitors in the energy storage system because of the system sustainability and maximizes the available storage energy.

To mitigate these issues, proper selection of energy storage system (ESS) is becoming an essential part of future grid design.

Thus, the output power of wind farms has to be controlled to limit these fluctuations. Integrating a battery energy storage system (BESS) into a wind farm can improve the wind farm- output dynamic properties. The simulation model of a grid-connected DC wind farm employing BESS is presented in this paper. The interface between DC wind farm and BESS is provided through an isolated flyback DC-DC converter. The dynamic performance and control strategy of the combined system, i.e. BESS, flyback DC-DC converter and DC wind farm is investigated. Through a proper coordination of the charging and discharging processes of BESS using the flyback DC-DC converter, it is demonstrated that the DC wind farm's output voltage and power can be controlled to a constant value. Several simulations are carried out using MATLAB and show that the proposed DC grid configuration has the potential to significantly improve the wind farm's output performance. © 2018 IEEE.","component; formatting; insert; style; styling","DC-DC converters; Dynamics; Electric inverters; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; MATLAB; Secondary batteries; Wind power; component; formatting; insert; style; styling; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070416854

Remote direct memory access (RDMA) technology partly alleviates the problems, but it is still not efficient for KVS, especially for the PUT operation. In this paper, we present an ultra-low-latency and flexible in-memory KVS system based on the CPU-FPGA heterogeneous architecture, which leverages FPGA to serve as a KVS accelerator. We design a highly parallel accelerator architecture with several novel techniques, including memory pre-Allocation, fragmentation processing, and decoupling design, to achieve ultra-low latency, high flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. The system workload can scale up with the storage capacity due to the decoupling design which stores the hash table in onboard DRAM memory and values in the host memory. For each KVS operation, at most one PCIe DMA is needed, which achieves high efficiency. Compared with current hardware-based KVS systems, the proposed one is more flexible, where the supported value range is 4x wider (from 1 byte to 4M bytes). In 10Gbps Ethernet, the peak throughput of the system can reach 13.6 million key-value operations per second (Mops), achieving nearly full utilization of the Ethernet bandwidth. The system latency can achieve as low as 1.2us for the PUT operation and 1.7us for the GET operation, which is 3.8x and 2.0x faster respectively than current state-of-The-Art KVS systems. © 2018 IEEE.","CPU-FPGA heterogeneous architecture; Fragmentation processing; In-memory key-value store; Memory pre-Allocation","Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Ethernet; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Green computing; Indium compounds; Integrated circuit design; Data technologies; Decoupling designs; Heterogeneous architectures; Highly parallels; Memory keys; Multi-level memory hierarchy; Remote direct memory access; Storage capacity; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068311101

In this paper, we consider a novel wireless network where devices use device-To-device (D2D) communication to transmit and storage content. Several schemes, such as maximum distance sparable (MDS) code and regenerating code, are employed and analysed for downloading and repairing content when nodes left and data lost in network. We found that MBR is not suitable for D2D-DSS networks due to higher download cost, surprisingly, but MDS is a convenient and appropriate scheme for majority practical D2D networks. However, MDS has to transfer the entire file size of the data to repair just a single node, which brought larger repair bandwidth. For this problem, we propose a new caching scheme, termed double replication MDS (DR-MDS) codes, utilize more storage nodes to save more repairing cost and reduce download cost simultaneously. We derive and simulate the communication cost performance of DR-MDS compared to traditional DSS coding schemes, shown that DR-MDS scheme significantly outperforms that of traditional MDS schemes and replication, that prove the practicability and feasibility of DRMDS scheme used in D2D distributed storage networks. © 2018 IEEE.","D2D communication; Distributed storage; DR-MDS codes; MDS codes; Repair bandwidth","Bandwidth; Codes (symbols); Mobile telecommunication systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multiprocessing systems; Network coding; Repair; D2D communications; Deviceto-device (D2D) communication; Distributed storage; Distributed storage networks; Distributed storage system; Effective measures; MDS code; Regenerating codes; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059964598

However, the cost of the battery storage unit is very expensive, and the life time of batteries is limited. In order to extend the service life as much as possible, rapid equalization circuits are needed for the series battery packs. Unfortunately, the equalization currents are almost small and uncontrollable. Based on Buck-Boost equalization circuit, this paper introduces the proportional current control strategy for equalization circuits of series battery packs. The state of charge (SOC) of each battery is considered in the strategy. The differences between the practical SOC values and the average SOC value are used to calculate the reference equalization currents to charge or discharge batteries. The improved current control strategy determines the duty cycle of the switches, while the voltage control loop determines the equalization direction of series packs. The derived strategy could realize accuracy control of equalization currents, and simultaneously, could achieve rapid equalization process.

When storage capacities are connected in the same grid, behind a common transformer substation, mutual charging and discharging can occur, which can be prevented by the herein introduced coordination method. When cooperation is incorported, storage capacities can be operated as a virtual microgrid. The cooperation between nodes is based on the formulation of a simple objective function for coordination. The cooperation objective is then combined with each node's local objective, which is the increase of self consumption, such that load is released off the the grid. A qualitative reflection on the practical use of three distributed algorithms, to solve the formulated optimisation problem is provided. The Jacobi algorithm is qualified to be preferable for large-scale networks with a great number of nodes, and the Gauss-Seidel algorithm is preferable when less nodes cooperate. To illustrate the concept and show the effect of coordination for prevention of mutual charginy/discharging of storage capacities in a VMG, two comparative case-study scenario are presented. © 2018 European Control Association (EUCA).",,"Control engineering; Coordinated scheduling; Coordination methods; Distributed coordination; Energy storage capacity; Gauss-Seidel algorithm; Large-scale network; Objective functions; Optimisation problems; Transformer substations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059812131

The substrate material is a laminate foil made of polyethylene terephthalate and aluminum. Activated carbon is used as the electrode, graphite ink as the current collector and aqueous NaCl or Li 2 SO 4 as electrolyte. Constant voltage floating experiments were done to estimate the practical voltage window of aqueous supercapacitors with respect to lifetime. We measured the capacitance, equivalent series resistance, efficiency and leakage current over time at constant voltage between 0.9 and 1.6 V. The results indicate that 1.5-1.6 V is feasible for a short time, i.e. about 1-100 hours depending on the materials. Lower voltages are substantially more stable: after 2000 hours at 1.2 V the capacitance decreased by about 10 % and at 0.9 V by only ca. 3 %. Potassium iodide was tested as an additive to the aqueous electrolyte, which clearly increased (up to 3-fold) capacitance but simultaneously shortened the lifetime. The potential for scalable manufacturing of supercapacitor components by printing was demonstrated in an upscaling trial.

The electrical and thermal performance of the prototype were studied in order to analyse its behaviour under severe testing conditions. The prototype exhibited an appropriate charging efficiency of 95.7% on average, while the battery pack operated safely (at less than 45\circ\mathrm {C}). When compared to a conventional system (battery and charge controller in a separated manner), the mean solar panel temperature of the prototype was 9.34% higher. However, in terms of power, the thermal losses in the PBIM resulted in an average increase of just 1.3 W (4.6%) in comparison to a conventional system. The testing validated the applicability of the integrated concept in harsh conditions, providing valuable information for future design improvements. © 2018 IEEE.","batteries; prototype; PV-battery Integrated Module; solar energy; testing","Energy conversion; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Testing; Battery systems; Charge controllers; Charging efficiency; Conventional systems; Integrated module; prototype; Testing conditions; Thermal Performance; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059907552

An ESS can locally absorb the PV produced energy during periods of high solar irradiation, thus alleviating potential overvoltages in distribution system, caused by reverse power flow. This work investigates the impact of battery ESSs operation when installed in residential PV prosumers. The charging process of the battery is activated when PV power exceeds a certain power threshold, mitigating the generation peaks in the grid. A sizing method is developed to estimate the capacity of ESSs, aiming to maximize prosumer self-consumption ratio (SCR). The proposed methodology is tested in a real LV network with increased PV integration. Results verify the effectiveness of the developed method. Overvoltages are successfully avoided while prosumers' SCR is maximized and storage utilization is preserved high.

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes modified control scheme in battery energy storage system controller based on master-slave control strategy. Main objective of this control scheme is seamless transition especially when grid-connected microgrid is transferred to islanded mode due to fault in main grid. A static transfer switch signal at point of common coupling is used to be the trigger sign for control method changing from PQ to V/f control mode. The proposed method is validated in Mae Sariang microgrid case study using DIgSILENT. For seamless transition conditions, the microgrid's voltage amplitude, frequency limit, and clearing time are defined by IEEE 1547 standard. The simulation results illustrate that when fault occurs, microgrid seamlessly transfers to islanded mode by proposed controller.

Due to increasing penetration of renewable energy, and in particular wind power, the frequency deviation has become a national problem that needs to be solved urgently to continue the positive development of renewables. In this paper, a co-optimization method of an offshore wind farm with the battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed which enable the wind farm to participate in both days ahead (DA) electricity market and primary frequency control reserve market. The optimization problem involves the hourly bidding energy, charging and discharging status which creates a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem.

Frequency volatility is directly tied to the inertia level in the grid. Since inertia-less PV power displaces synchronous generators (SG), and thereby their available rotational inertia, the inertia level is reduced and the frequency volatility increased. Frequency volatility can be quantified by the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF). The RoCoF is used as a performance index to determine the HC. Virtual inertia compensation (VIR) by chemical battery storage (BESS) can increase the HC of the grid and allow for more PV power to be integrated. The impact of PI-based VIR on increasing the HC in a 17.5 MVA diesel powered IPS is studied. Results indicate that when added PV without VIR displaced SGs the RoCoF limit could not be upheld. When VIR is added the RoCoF is improved and an HC of up to 3 MW PV is obtained. For the suggested RoCoF limit of -1.45 Hz/s and the studied scenarios it is shown that, in percentage of peak load, diesel-based generation could be replaced by 25% PV, providing that 9% of BESS with VIR is added. © 2018 IEEE.","energy storage; Frequency response; PV-diesel isolated power system; virtual inertia","Energy storage; Frequency response; Chemical batteries; Inertia compensations; Island power systems; Isolated power system; Performance indices; Rate of change of frequencies; Rotational inertia; virtual inertia; Uninterruptible power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059940035

However, the major drawback of this technology is the intermittent issue due to the rapid fluctuations in solar insolation level. Energy storage systems such as batteries and super capacitor banks are used to reduce the above problem. There is a requirement of an integrated controller strategy in order to achieve a power generation unit which includes power share among those energy storage units in between with solar PV array. Using a hybrid system of a battery bank and a super-capacitor bank over using a battery bank alone, helps to increase the lifetime of the batteries. Integrated control strategy is the common method used to control the solar PV array with energy storage units in order to supply the required islanded demand and supply excess energy to the grid while maintaining the DC-link stability through the synchronized control of DC-DC power electronic converters. This paper presents an integrated control strategy for grid connected PV array together with a battery bank and a super-capacitor bank. This further state mathematical proof for the sizing of storage devices. Performance of the integrated control strategy was evaluated using a practical experiment by developing customized DC-DC power electronic converters. © 2018 IEEE.","battery bank; DC to DC power electronic converters; integrated control strategy; solar PV array; super capacitors","Battery storage; DC-DC converters; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Hybrid systems; Integrated control; Photovoltaic cells; Power electronics; Solar power generation; Supercapacitor; Virtual storage; Battery banks; Dc power; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Integrated control strategy; Integrated controllers; Power generation units; Solar photovoltaic technology; Solar PV arrays; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059871371

As a consequence, recent work has proposed different types of PIM architectures for various fields. However, most of their evaluations rely on dedicated simulation models, which make it hard to compare different architectures. Analytical models of PIM architectures, as a solution, have not been fully discussed in literature. To help architects and programmers easily evaluate overheads of various PIM architectures, this paper presents V-PIM, a generic and flexible analytical model. By characterizing an architecture with only several parameters, the model is simple but effective. To validate the model, we compare the results of V-PIM with simulation results against three novel PIM architectures and four tasks from data-intensive to computational-intensive.

The ITES is a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system, which reduces the cost of energy in HVAC systems. Reduction in the cost of energy is achieved by shifting the cooling load from the peak and standard periods to the off-peak periods, with the aid of stored ice, which is produced when the energy cost is affordable and discharging when the cooling demand is high, particularly at expensive tariff rates. The challenge is that, most of the existing ITES systems, particularly in South Africa, are not optimal in operation. The conventional system should be optimally controlled to a higher accuracy. Based on investigations, a preferred accuracy could be achieved, with some comparisons and validations of results, by utilization of real-time control and optimisation tools, such as Fuzzy logic, Neural network, Closed-loop and Model Predictive Control (MPC). Effective utilization of ITES allows a further advantage in the management of the off-peak tariffs and consumers' demands, in accordance with the Time of Use (TOU) and maximum demand. Climate changes, installation, payback costs and other objective functions are required as additional options to the improved utilisation and design of the ITES system. The findings from the review and analysis of technologies and approaches to optimisation should benefit improvisation of the ITES in future applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Air conditioning; Cost saving potentials; Ice Thermal Energy Storage; Optimal control; Real-time control; Time of use","Air conditioning; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Fuzzy logic; Heat storage; Ice; Ice control; Model predictive control; Office buildings; Predictive control systems; Real time control; Storage management; Thermal energy; Conventional systems; Cost saving potentials; Future applications; Objective functions; Optimal controls; Real-time optimization; Time of use; Ventilation and air conditioning; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059040600

Their technologies have been widely developed over the years. However, their charging infrastructure is still a subject of interest, as most of the electric vehicle charging requirements were previously met by an AC grid. However, over the year's research has been conducted on the implementation of renewable energies in the charging station. Most of the research studies focus on the management, optimal control, charging schemes and charging strategies. There is no research done on a charging station that combines the grid integrated hybrid renewable energy system such as Wind and PV comprising of a central battery bank with a peer to peer energy trading model. The aim of this research study is to develop a well-coordinated charging scheme of Electric vehicles in a charging station whilst optimally managing the charging and discharging of the central battery bank (used for energy storage) as well as the power dispatch of the grid and Wind and PV charging station.

However, there is a need to improve these technologies in various aspects, such as: Maintenance, energy storage, cases of overload or mechanical failure. In maintenance, they constantly suffer of damage in blades typically to be in the open air and in constant operation. The most well-known damages in blades are identified as: Impact of rays, wearing, fractures by cutting forces, freezing, among others. Because of all these factors, it is necessary to develop a predictive technique to help us to do the inspections of the blades in a safer and more effective way than manual inspection. In that sense, this paper introduces a deep learning vision-based approach to automatically analyze each part of the face of the blade, capable of making the detection of certain faults (impact of rays, wear and fractures). In addition, we present a proof-of-concept using a robot to automatically detect failures in wind turbine blades.

The morphological characteristics of the PVDF/G films were evaluated by a scanning electron microscope JEOL (JMS-6360LV). Finally, the permittivity of PVDF/G films was tested at different frequencies in order to know their behavior to temperature changes. In addition, PVDF commercial films were used to comparative purposes. The dielectric response of the fabricated PVDF/G films was interesting because it showed higher temperature dependence than the PVDF films, however, this dependence was different for each frequency. It is worth mentioning that the permittivity behavior at 100 Hz showed stronger temperature dependence than the other measurements.

Doping microchannel plate with neutron sensitive nuclides, proposed by G.W. Fraser et al., is a typical method to make normal MCP become neutron sensitive. Inspired by this approach, microchannel plates doped with 3 mol% ^{nat}Gd-{2}O -{3} have been developed in this study, both in 50 mm and 106 mm diameter. Experimental results showed the neutron detection efficiency@25.3 meV was 34%, with the spatial resolution of 64 \mu m and 88 \mu m for 15 kV X-rays and 25.3 meV neutrons, respectively. Both the detection efficiency and spatial resolution are intrinsically determined by the internal processes occurring in the ^{n}MCP, such as the neutron absorption, IC electron emission and ionization, the electron multiplication and the electron cloud collection, all of which will somehow determine the performance of the ^{n}MCP detector. This paper aims to thoroughly describe these processes and investigate their influences on the detection efficiency and spatial resolution of the {n}^MCP detector. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Electron emission; Image resolution; Medical imaging; Microchannels; Neutrons; Detection efficiency; Electron clouds; Electron multiplication; Micro channel plate; Neutron detection; Neutron energy; Selective imaging; Spatial resolution; Image storage tubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058435354

Firstly, we introduce a fast matrix algorithm to combine with Winograd algorithm to further reduce the computation complexity and adapt the Winograd algorithm to large-stride convolution with a kernel-partitioning method. Secondly, computation efficiency improvement due to the fast algorithms aggravates the off-chip communication. DRAM access of different data-flows varies significantly with different CNN patterns. Dynamic configurations of both data-flows and on-chip shared memory can reduce the DRAM access effectively. A quantitative analysis is established on the design space to guide the configurations.

Of the factors affecting the ability of the grid to accept wind power, peak-shaving capacity is one of the most important constraints, and it is also a major problem faced by large-scale wind power system dispatching operations. Due to the natural conditions of wind distribution in various regions of China, the area built by wind turbines is relatively concentrated and the power transmission capacity of the grid is subject to new challenges. In addition, the northern winter heating units must operate day and night, the system's peak capacity is limited. However, the output of wind power during the period of underestimation of load is relatively high, and the peak load pressure caused by the system becomes more and more prominent, resulting in a large amount of wind power being unable to be locally consumed. Under the current policy of fully purchasing renewable energy and energy-saving power generation dispatching policies, what kind of economic incentives are adopted to promote large-scale wind power consumption; what kind of dispatching model can guarantee the safe and efficient operation of wind power-containing power systems, and improve the acceptance of wind power Capacity; There are few studies on the impact of energy storage systems under different dispatch modes on system economics and wind power acceptance. In view of this, the dissertation investigates the problems caused by large-scale wind power grid connection and its feasible solutions, and proposes a corresponding dispatching model to promote large-scale wind power consumption from the perspective of joint operation of wind and storage to promote the localization of wind power. The impact of different operating modes and capacities of the energy storage system on the wind power acceptance capacity of the grid was analyzed. © 2018 IEEE.","Dispatch Mode; Wind and Storage Joint; Wind Power Consumption; Wind Power Integration","Economics; Electric load dispatching; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Intelligent control; Wind power; Wind turbines; Dispatch Mode; Dispatching models; Energy storage systems; Large-scale wind power; Peak-shaving capacity; Power transmission capacity; Wind power capacity; Wind power integrations; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058409666

Our approach presents a scalable storage schema which uses random prefix and the pre-partition operation to ensure load-balanced entity storage. Besides presenting the storage schema, in order to improve query efficiency, we propose two distributed parallel query engines: HBase with Spark and HBase with Coprocessor. The HBase with Spark engine accelerate queries in parallel by using the memory calculation on Spark.

Due to expensive storage, large quantity of electricity cannot be stored for optimal operation of the grid. However, in recent times, large scale batteries are making inroads to the power sector. But, large scale batteries are still prohibitively expensive, thus cannot be readily used with reasonable return on investment. We propose to create a large virtual energy storage system (ESS) using myriad number of small scale batteries. Using a large central electricity storage suffers from disadvantages of capital, operational and maintenance cost and decrease of profit due to storage failure. Small scale ESSs are installed and managed by the end users who voluntarily connect their ESSs with the utility grid and provide it's control to the utility operator. In return, utility operator shares some percentage of arbitrage profit with the electricity users as an incentive. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Electric batteries; Financial markets; Investments; Profitability; Electricity storages; Electricity users; Energy storage systems; Maintenance cost; Optimal operation; Power sector; Return on investments; Utility grids; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058420134

The total monomeric anthocyanin, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity were analyzed periodically. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the extract were stable at all pH and temperature studied. The anthocyanin at pH 3 was very stable when stored at 7°C (t1/2 &gt; 500 days) and significantly decreased as pH and stored temperature increased. The activation energy of anthocyanin in MM extracts were relatively high (84.99, 72.92, and 68.50 kJ/mol at pH 3, 4, and 5, respectively) indicating its sensitivity to the temperature elevation. The result suggested the MM extract as a potential colorant for cold acidic beverage and as antioxidant drink at pH 3-5 in wide range of storage temperature. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057152370

By eliminating transistor per cell, the crossbar array possesses a higher memory density but introduces sneak currents which incur extra energy waste and reliability issues. The complementary resistive switch (CRS), consisting of two anti-serially stacked memristors, is considered as a promising solution to the sneak current problem. However, the destructive read of the CRS results in an additional recovery write operation which strongly restricts its further promotion. Exploiting the dual CRS/memristor mode of CRS devices, we propose Aliens, a novel hybrid architecture for resistive random-access memory which introduces one alien cell (memristor mode) for each wordline in the crossbar to provide a practical hybrid memory without operating system's intervention. Aliens draws advantages from both modes: restrained sneak current of CRS mode and non-destructive read of memristor mode. The simple and regular cell mode organization of Aliens enables an energy-saving read method and an effective mode switching strategy called Lazy-Switch. By exploiting memory access locality, Lazy-Switch delays and merges the recovery write operations of the CRS mode. Due to fewer recovery write operations and negligible sneak currents, Aliens achieves improvement in energy, overall endurance, and access performance. The experiment results show that our design offers average energy savings of 13.9X compared with memristor-only memory, a memory lifetime 5.3X longer than CRS-only memory, and a competitive performance compared with memristor-only memory. © 2018 ACM.",,"Computer aided design; Energy conservation; Memory architecture; Memristors; Recovery; Competitive performance; Complementary resistive switches; Crossbar arrays; Hybrid architectures; Non destructive; Resistive random access memory; Resistive random access memory (rram); Write operations; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058169402

The method is based on a nonlinear impedance and resembles the droop control applied in microgrid structures. The droop control has the advantage of being decentralized so the proposed EMS also benefits this characteristic. Usually a tradeoff must be made between voltage regulation and load sharing for the droop control and a nonlinear resistor is often used to minimize this tradeoff. For charging and discharging a SC in droop controlled microgrids, a virtual impedance with an RC characteristic is usually used. The proposed method was created by merging together the two strategies, the nonlinear resistor and the virtual capacitive impedance, in order to benefit from the advantages provided by both methods. An overview of the most common strategies is also presented in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Energy management; Energy management systems; Motion control; Power control; Power electronics; Resistors; Voltage regulators; Common strategy; Droop control; Energy management strategies; Microgrid structures; Nonlinear impedance; Nonlinear resistor; Supercapacitor storage; Virtual impedance; Supercapacitor",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058236242

A viable technology to supply electricity to some of these areas are stand-alone micro-hydropower systems which harnesses energy from flowing water. Self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) are commonly used for the generation of electricity in stand-alone micro-hydropower systems. The electricity supplied by a SEIG to the demand side i.e. the load needs to be maintained stable under various consumer load conditions. This is accomplished through the use of an electronic load controller (ELC). This paper presents the design and development of an intelligent ELC that is able to maintain stable voltage on the demand side of a 3-phase SEIG supplying varying single-phase consumer loads. The proposed intelligent ELC consists of an uncontrolled bridge rectifier, filtering capacitor, chopper switch, voltage sensor, optocoupler, Arduino microcontroller and a ballast load or storage, depending on site-specific requirements and economic viability. The fuzzy logic control method is implemented to maintain stable and reliable voltage. The ELC is designed and simulated under various consumer load conditions in Matlab/Simulink. Simulation results of the ELC model are verified experimentally in a laboratory setting. The proposed intelligent ELC will contribute towards providing reliable and cost-effective means of enhancing the proliferation of micro-hydropower particularly in rural and remote applications in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2018 IEEE.","Electronic Load Controller; Fuzzy Logic; Self-Excited Induction Generator; Stand-Alone Micro-Hydropower","Asynchronous generators; Choppers (circuits); Computer circuits; Controllers; Cost effectiveness; Electric frequency control; Electric rectifiers; Fuzzy logic; Hydroelectric power; MATLAB; Optoelectronic devices; Design and Development; Electronic load controller; Electronic load controllers (ELC); Geographical locations; Intelligent electronics; Self excited induction generators; Single-phase consumers; Stand -alone; Hydroelectric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057868613

Regarding its applications as dielectric material for electrostatic capacitors (ESCs), previous reports mainly focused on dielectric constant and lost capacity of graphene based nanocomposites (GBN). Limited reports showed capacitance (C) and dissipation factor (Df) of GBN as ESC. This is very important to determine their energy storage (Ub) capacity using Ub = CV2/2. Where V is the voltage across a capacitor. In this study, the fabrication of polymer-graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) composite films at various GNPs concentration was undertaken. Furthermore, ESCs were fabricated with composite films using copper electrode in relation to their C and Df. Results obtained showed that GNPs can significantly enhance C of polymer but strong interaction with the polymer is required for good energy storage properties and thermal stability. However, modified GNPs composite films showed better interaction and superior properties compared to unmodified GNPs composite films for ESCs applications. The enhanced C of the composite dielectric capacitors will result to higher energy storing capability than pure polymer dielectric capacitor. However, the former showed larger Df compared to the later as results of lower electrical resistance and high mobility of charge carriers. As a result, further work is in progress to suppress Of in such composite films for efficient ESC applications. © 2018 IEEE.","capacitance (C); dissipation (Df) and thermal stability; Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs); poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)","Capacitance; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrostatics; Energy storage; Fluorine compounds; Graphene; Lithium batteries; Nanocomposite films; Polymer films; Storage (materials); Thermodynamic stability; Composite dielectrics; Dissipation factors; Electrical resistances; Electrochemical capacitor; Energy storage properties; Graphene nanoplatelets; Poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF); Polymer based composite; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057851206

Poor electricity supply has led to high down time, reduction of profit margins and reduced interest in productive ventures. Portable generators are used mostly to power business activities. Using fossil fuels to generate power has not been a sustainable method considering the running cost and environmental pollution challenges. In order to improve on the availability of power and efficiently manage available energy in a typical office, an alternative energy efficient renewable energy system was developed to power the office. The system comprised of solar photovoltaic (PV) as the source of energy, a charge controller, storage batteries and a web-based switching application. In implementing the new system, load audit was carried out to determine the office energy requirements. Adapting the loads to the new supply and further improve on energy efficiency, most gadgets in the office were retrofitted to now operate on a direct current solar powered source. The management of the system used a web application developed to run on personal computers or mobile devices to switch the loads 'ON' and 'OFF' through a microcontroller. The web application introduced access control and ensure effective and efficient management of energy usage from any location where internet could be accessed. Sizing of all components was done and installation was carried out. Test results showed that the solar PV system served as a dependable, clean and sustainable alternative power source for the office. The energy consumption of the office was efficiently reduced from 11350Wh to 4626Wh due to the retrofit and introduction of web access control. During the test period, excess capacity of 43535Wh was stored for use at no extra cost which was not possible in the previous supply system. © 2018 IEEE.","D-C Powered Systems; Energy Management and Efficiency; Energy Sustainability; Index; Retrofit; Web Application","Access control; Controllers; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Personal computers; Retrofitting; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Websites; Alternative energy supplies; Energy sustainability; Environmental pollutions; Index; Renewable energy systems; Retrofit; Switching applications; WEB application; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057777923

Hybridization of energy storage has been the theme of much research in the field of power electronics as it is an effective economic solution towards improving the utilization of energy. Batteries have fallen short in comparison to both supercapacitors and hybrid capacitors because of their low power density and limited charge-discharge cycle. Most of the previous research in this field focuses on hybridizing either supercapacitor or hybrid capacitor with the battery but not both. This paper deals with the combination of both supercapacitor and hybrid capacitor with the battery thus addressing the problem of the lack of autonomy between two recharge points in supercapacitors, three hybridization techniques are considered and the balance point of the supercapacitor and hybrid capacitor banks is presented. The prospects of using a multiple-input DC-DC converter is also analyzed. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed topology.

The diversified load mentioned in this paper refers to nontraditional loads with active characteristics, such as electric vehicles charging and discharging facilities, energy storage systems, grid-connected microgrid and etc. For the effective planning of the diversified load integration into distribution network, an evaluation method of diversified load absorptive ability is presented in this paper based on the idea of hierarchical components. Firstly, a hierarchical component analysis method is proposed. Secondly, a rationality evaluation index system is presented from the perspective of safe operation, power quality and energy management to guarantee the effect integration of diversified load. Finally, the maximum absorptive ability of diversified load is evaluated by gradually increasing the capacity of the diversified load integration and adjusting the integration scheme, using ""exploratory adjustment + linear interpolation"" method. Rationality assessment of the absorptive capacity of distribution network for diversified load could promote the coordinated development of diversified load and power grid.

In order to make full use of the complementary advantages of AC and DC power supply modes and considering source-load coordination, an optimal operation method of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid based on the stochastic chance constrained programming model is proposed in this paper. This method comprises an upper-level model and a lower-level model. The upper-level model optimizes the power supply mode of load side, which aims at minimizing the power transmission loss.

The power fluctuations have significant negative effects on the power quality and reliability of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid. A fast charging and discharging control of energy storage and PV power limited operation control based on the power fluctuation characteristic is proposed in this paper. The two controls cooperate so that the fluctuation of PV power can be effectively suppressed. First of all, the autoregressive moving average algorithm (ARIMA) is used to predict ultra-short term forecasting of PV power generation, and the limited power operation mode of PV is whether to enter is determined by the predicted results. Then, in the limited power operation mode, the power limit percentage is adjusted dynamically through the PI algorithm according to the size of PV power fluctuations. Finally, an adaptive Kalman filtering algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimize the control of charging and discharging of energy storage device. The filter parameters can be adjusted automatically through the state of charging (SOC) of energy storage device, ensuring the safe operation of the energy storage device.

To keep the power system in equilibrium, the energy storage is introduced into the power system. Recently supercapacitor (SC) and battery hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) capture a great attention. Compared with other energy storage technologies the major advantages of SC are the high power density, high cycling life, and high peak current handling capacities. However, SC is also deficient in low energy density. The battery is characterized by large energy density but low in power capacity. Due to high-frequent power fluctuation cause a significant degree of battery power cycling. This, in turn, has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in battery service life. Therefore, the concept of the SC and battery hybrid scheme is proposed to participate in secondary frequency regulation. The simulation is carried out to compare the battery electrical energy storage (BEES) and HEES to verify the efficiency of the proposed modification. © 2018 IEEE.","battery electrical energy storage; frequency regulation; hybrid electrical energy storage; integral coefficient; renewable energy source","Building moving; Energy storage; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Secondary batteries; Electrical energy storages; Energy storage technologies; Frequency regulations; Hybrid electrical energy storage systems; integral coefficient; Power system frequencies; Renewable energy source; Secondary frequency regulation; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070252484

To model this system an average model is employed by using dq reference frame. The dynamical model of the SMES system considering the PWM-CSC is transformed algebraically into an equivalent linear model by simple substitutions, avoiding to use an equivalent linearization technique or Taylor's series. The linear model preserves all features of the nonlinear model, which allows obtaining control laws to be applicable in its non- linear system. The proposed control scheme permits the active and reactive control of the SMES system in a wide range of operating independently.

VPP may maximize its revenue through optimal scheduling of DERs by providing both energy and Auxiliary Service(AS). In this paper, first of all, a novel bidding strategy of VPP is proposed by considering the multi-energy storage and different Customers Satisfaction Degrees (CSDs). Furthermore, by aggregating and coordinating various DERs, including wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaic panels (PVs), micro-turbines (MTs), energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs), the VPP is able to strategically allocate the capacities for energy, reserve and regulation. In addition, in order to stimulate the initiative of EV participating in market, satisfaction degree is used to measure the revenue can be obtained.

However, hosting capacity of distribution network (DN) is restricted due to voltage problem caused by high proportion of residential PVs. In this paper, the energy storage systems (ESSs) are used to overcome the issue of voltage rise in peak PV production and voltage drop to attain the load demand. When the voltage cross the limits, the power shortage estimation method based back/forward algorithm is used to calculate the power shortfall. Then, the distributed control algorithm based on consensus algorithm is applied to regulate the voltage within the required limits. Afterward, two consensus algorithms based on limited communication network are used: the first objective is to share the power shortage among ESS, while the second objective is to modify the output reference of ESS to make the state of charge (SOC) of ESS converge closely. The proposed control method is evaluated in distribution networks, and the simulation results validate the effectiveness of this method. © 2018 IEEE.","Distributed control; distribution networks; energy storage systems; voltage regulation","Battery management systems; Distributed parameter control systems; Electric power distribution; Energy policy; Energy storage; Housing; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Consensus algorithms; Distributed control; Distributed control algorithms; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Estimation methods; Limited communication; Voltage problems; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056894180

The BESS can be used in both residential and commercial buildings in order to reduce the cost of energy consumption. Apart from maintaining the BESS's life expectancy, the NMPC is also responsible for securing the maximum possible economic profit. The implementation of the NMPC requires the modeling of the BESS, the modeling of an aging prediction mechanism for the 15-Lithium Ion batteries stack and the identification of the needs and requirements for energy management in a dynamic pricing environment where the GRID is the unique source of power to the building and to the BESS. The NMPC utilizes forecasted profiles for the energy demand and the energy prices which are retrieved from a data knowledge warehouse in order to propose an optimal discharge profile for the BESS. Furthermore, the intra-day alternations of the energy prices and the uncertainty that the day-ahead energy demand profile will match the actual demand profile, makes the necessity of the controller to update the proposed discharge profile during the day inevitable. Indicative results of the proposed method are presented in order to demonstrate the ability of the NMPC to provide an optimal solution for achieving a specific capacity loss target for the batteries stack and simultaneously ensuring high financial profit. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Costs; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy management; Energy utilization; Model predictive control; Nonlinear systems; Office buildings; Profitability; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery energy storage systems; Commercial building; Discharge profiles; Knowledge warehouse; Nonlinear model predictive control; Prediction mechanisms; Specific capacities; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056853661

Thermal energy storage (TES) with phase change materials (PCM) is valuable technique for enhancing energy proficiency of a building by lessening the mismatch amongst supply and demand of heat or cold. This paper aims to investigate thermal comfort and energy saving in buildings by incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) 600 as phase change material with concrete. A concrete PCM system which is located in Khartoum, Sudan was used to study the thermal behavior of a building in response to outdoor environmental exposure. The concrete PCM ceiling system is consisted of two models; one with PCM and the other without PCM. The experimental analysis was done with and without present of fan in the concrete model with PCM. The results showed that the model with PCM could reduce the peak temperature with and without using fan by 4 °C and 1 °C respectively.

This has prompted to a need to create proficient and sustainable techniques of storing energy. Solar thermal energy can be stored in the form of latent heat by utilizing appropriate phase change materials (PCMs), which offer high heat storage capacity. An experimental study was done in Khartoum city during summer season to investigate the thermal performance of solar water heating system integrated with PCM using flat plate collector as a heat source. The PCM used was paraffin wax whose melting point is 56 °C. An energy and exergy analysis was done to assess the thermal performance of the system and fix the thermodynamic blemish in the energy system. The outcomes showed that PCM acted as smart material which can regulate the temperature of system in the required range. The outcomes indicated that the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system were 85% and 76% respectively. The number of entropy generated was 0.26. The results showed that PCM acted as smart regulator to keep supplying the amount of heat to the system even after the absent of heat source. PCM also could increase the exergy output and led to reduce the exergy destruction. This indicates that the PCM could improve the exergy efficiency. The overall outcomes showed that the PCM optimized the performance of solar water heater system by improve energy and exergy efficiencies. © 2018 IEEE.","energy analysis; exergy analysis; phase change material; solar water heating; thermal energy storage","Energy utilization; Exergy; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Thermal energy; Energy analysis; Energy and exergy analysis; Energy and exergy efficiency; Exergy Analysis; Heat storage capacity; Solar thermal energy; Solar water heating; Solar water heating systems; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057557768

Together with numerous advantages massive rooftop PV installations (up to 5-10 kW) and utility-scale local plants of 5-20 MW in the low (LV) and middle (MV) voltage distribution networks produce a problem for voltage regulation. Rapid deviations in PV power inherent in this type of energy generate uncertainty in voltage control. Tap changers which are applicable to this purpose have sluggish reaction and occasionally couldn't be able to compensate fast changings of solar electricity. Together with the fluctuations of the consumer's power demands such disturbances can cause dangerous voltage instabilities. As a result, the protection system should disconnect PV stations from electricity supply what negatively affects electricity costs and reliability of the network. One of the possible solutions for mitigation voltage deviations is intermittent energy storage based on ultracapacitors (UC) usage. UC application can improve the voltage stability hence increasing complexity of energy equipment and energy costs. Therefore, the selection of UC bank should be done suitably considering technical and economic aspects of the problem.

The battery's upfront and replacement costs per technology are bundled together in the form of total energy costs, which gives a more realistic measure of the choice of battery size in the system design phase. The methodology presented here can be extended and applied to specific battery technologies and products, and other PV-battery applications in general. © 2018 EPE Association.","«Battery costs»; «Battery lifetime»; «Energy costs»; «Solar Home System»; «Techno-economic feasibility»","Developing countries; Electric batteries; Power electronics; Battery cost; Battery lifetime; Energy cost; Solar home system; Techno-economic feasibility; Solar buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057012055

The proposed converter offers galvanic isolation, high voltage step-up factor and power factor correction. The operation principle and control system structure of the case study converter are described. Due to the accommodation of a special phase-shift modulation algorithm, the proposed front-end converter features natural voltage clamping and soft-switching of all semiconductor devices without additional components such as snubbers and clamping circuits. Parameters of the converter were estimated in accordance with residential battery energy storage system requirements. A 500W prototype converter was developed to validate theoretically estimated characteristics of the converter, including the soft-switching range, transfer function and design constraints.

The most important feature of trolleybuses that are equipped with AC traction drive systems is the ability to generate electrical braking energy. Instead of dissipating in brake resistors, this regenerated energy can be either transferred to other accelerating trolleybus or stored in energy storage system (ESS) for repeated use. However, there are also rather well known technical disadvantages of ESS, for example, mobile ESS causes additional load for trolleybus and stationary ESS might be located so far from trolleybus that most of the energy might be lost in transmission. For this reason, the purpose of this paper was to present a method that compares energy consumptions of trolleybuses unequipped and equipped with mobile or stationary energy storage systems by analyzing the results acquired from simulations of travelling equal distances at equal motion condition cycles. Trolleybus mass increase in case of mobile ESS was considered. Overhead DC line (ODCL) transmission resistance of the portion between substation (SUB) and trolleybus was considered, and ODCL transmission resistance of the portion between stationary ESS and trolleybus was also considered. Losses in both traction drive converter and ESS bidirectional DC/DC converter and also losses in both SUB transformer and SUB rectifier were considered by assuming certain efficiency ratios. Efficiency of regenerated energy storing and substation energy consumption reduction is analyzed and corresponding conclusions are drawn. © 2018 EPE Association.","Device simulation; Electric vehicle; Energy storage; Power transmission; Supercapacitor","DC transformers; DC-DC converters; Electric power transmission; Electric rectifiers; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Power electronics; Power transmission; Supercapacitor; Trackless trolleys; Traction (friction); Traction motors; Vehicle transmissions; Bidirectional DC/DC converters; Corresponding conclusions; Device simulations; Electric transport; Energy storage systems; Important features; Motion conditions; Stationary energy storages; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056993958

The SCES systems have the possibility to interchange active and reactive power between the supercapacitor and converter to the electrical power network. The active power is directly related to the energy stored on the supercapacitor, while the reactive power is redistributed by the forced commutated switches present in the voltage source converter (VSC) used to integrate the SCES system to the power grid. PBC theory allows designing Lyapunov stable controllers for autonomous and non-Autonomous dynamical sys-Tems via port-Hamiltonian (pH) representations. The averaging modeling theory employs to develop the controllers under abc, alpha\beta and dq reference frames.

Magnetic bearings (MB) [2] with several advantages, such as eliminating of a lubrication system, friction-free operation and low power consumption can be promoted in various practical industrial applications, especially in flywheel batteries. Brushless DC motor is widely used because of its high efficiency and simple control. The bearingless brushless DC motor (BBLDC) has the advantages of the above advantages, while it has the characteristics of small friction loss [3]. The problem of strong coupling between the magnetic field and the torque magnetic field can be solved by the double stator bearingless brushless DC motor (DS-BBLDC) [4]. Halbach permanent magnet structures are suitable for use in permanent magnet motors because they enhance the unidirectional magnetic field [5]-[6]. Thus, this study presents the first prototype of a Double Stator Halbach Permanent Magnet (DSHPM) BBLDC with the advantages of weak coupling and simple control. The structure, operation principle and main electromagnetic characteristics of the DSHPM BBLDC are analyzed. The proposed motor exhibits the following advantages: 1) High integration. The motor can not only realize the problem of energy conversion, but also realize two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) suspension control. 2) Low loss. The biased flux is provided by the permanent magnet which leaves out the extra biased winding correspondingly. 3) Weak coupling. The application of halbach structure can make motor rotor yoke adopt non-magnetic material to completely isolate torque system and suspension system. 4) Favorable controllability. The dual-stator structure of the torque system and suspension system separately control, to achieve a simplified control. © 2018 IEEE.",,"AC motors; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Energy conversion; Flywheels; Friction; Magnetic fields; Magnetic materials; Permanent magnets; Stators; Suspensions (components); Wheels; Design and analysis; Electromagnetic characteristic; Flywheel energy storage; Low-power consumption; Non-magnetic materials; Permanent magnet motor; Two degrees of freedom; Unidirectional magnetic fields; Brushless DC motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066809612

However, conventional H I M suffers from the low power and torque density due to its unipolar air-gap flux density. To solve this problem, a novel multi-unit out-rotor HIM (MOHIM) with bipolar air-gap flux density is proposed. First, the structure and operation principle of MOHIM are illustrated. To simplify analysis, MOHIM is divided into unit machines (UMs) based on the equivalent magnetic circuit. The back-EMF, flux density and output torque of MOHIM and UM are respectively compared, which proves the effectiveness of U M . Finally, the performance of MOHIM is investigated by three-dimension finite element analysis (3-D FEA), which indicates that this machine is a good candidate for the application ofFESS.

Spin transfer torque magnetoresistive memories (STT-MRAMs) are prime candidates for non-volatile memory applications. As the basic storage unit of STT-MRAM, magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) has been extensively studied [2-4]. For instance-double-barrier MTJ (DMTJ), taking advantages of the enhancement of STT effect, significantly reduces the critical switching current (IC0) and switching duration (τ) [5]. MTJ with two CoFeB free layers (FLs) coupled by Ta layer can effectively improves the thermal stability (AE) [6]. In this paper, we proposed an electrical modeling of DMTJ with CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB FLs (see Fig. 1 (a)). Compared with conventional MTJ, the propose DMTJ has superiorities in IC0, τ, and ΔE. It can replace MTJ to reduce the device size, improve the reliability of memory and lower the writing energy consumption. Furthermore, this model integrates the stochastic STT switching behavior, the temperature influence and the variation of the layers' thicknesses, which can deeply affect the reliability of hybrid CMOS/MTJ circuits. Fig. 1 (b) shows the principle block diagram of the integrated physical models. In the following-we explain some key blocks modeled in the Verilog-A code. For DMTJ, STTs generated by both the transmitted and reflected spin polarized electrons add together. This enhancement strongly decreases the IC0 and x, which can be expressed as lC0=2αγe×(KEFF×Volume)/μBgDMTJ (1) τ=[C+In(π2ΔE/4)]×(em/4μBgDMT-J)×(Iwrite-IC0)-1 (2) where a is Gilbert damping factor. γ is gyromagnetic ratio. e is elementary charge. KEFF is the effective PMA energy density. Volume is the total volume of the dual FLs. μB is Bohr magneton's constant. C≈0.577 is the Euler's constant. MS is the FL's saturation magnetization. m=MS×Volume is the total magnetic moment of FL. gDMTJ represents the spin polarization efficiency factor, which is enhanced in comparison with conventional MTJ, this phenomenon can be described by gMTJ(θ)=P/2(1+P-2cosθ) (3) gDMTJ=gMTJ(θ)+gMTJ(π-θ)=P/(1-P4cos2θ) (4) where gMTJ(θ) and gMTJ(π-θ) represent the transmitted and reflected spin polarized efficiency factor of MTJ, respectively. P is the spin polarization percentage of the tunnel current, θ is the initial angle between the magnetization orientation FL's and the top reference layer's. However, the stochastic STT switching, which results from thermal fluctuations of magnetization, leads to the large fluctuations in the switching durations. We discover the real switching time comply with a gamma distribution γ(k, θ). The shape and scale parameters, respectively, k and θ, are linked to the mean and standard deviation through the relations E[τ]= θk and std [τ] = θk-1/2. Besides, the temperature influence should not be ignored. Since the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio, MS, and KEFF will decrease with the increasing of temperature [7], the magnetoresistance and IC0 can be influenced. In addition, as the limit of the manufacturing technology, the real value of the MgO-barrier layers and FLs' thicsknesses are not the constants as we expected. They always vary in a somewhat small range, but can lead to relatively significant variations for the resistance and IC0. For instance, the resistance is exponentially related to the thickness of two oxidized barrier layers, small thickness variation can lead to relatively significant impacts on resistance. In this paper we used the normal random statistical functions provided by Verilog-A to generate the true values of these thicknesses. The developed Verilog-A compact model is adopted to investigate the writing performance, temperature influence, resistance distributions and STT stochastic switching behavior. Fig.2 (a) illustrates the comparison of STT switching time of DMTJ with MTJ. DMTJ is proved to switch at a considerable speed with a much lower writing current. Fig. 2 (b) shows the DC simulations of 20nm-DMTJ at low, room and high temperature, respectively. Fig. 2(c) describes the distribution of 10k DMTJ's resistances. Monte Carlo simulations of two completed writing operations of 10 DMTJs are shown in Fig. 2 (d). The amplitude differences of different signals are caused by layers' thicknesses variations, whereas the switching time fluctuations of the same DMTJ during two writing operations describe the stochastic STT switching behaviors. These results prove that our proposed model can be a very useful tool for the performance optimizations and reliability analyses ofhybrid CMOS/DMTJ circuits. © 2018 IEEE.",,"CMOS integrated circuits; Cobalt compounds; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Field effect transistors; Intelligent systems; Iron compounds; Magnesia; Magnetic moments; Magnetic storage; Monte Carlo methods; MOS devices; MRAM devices; Oxide semiconductors; Reliability analysis; Saturation magnetization; Spin polarization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Tantalum; Tunnel junctions; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies; Critical switching current; Magnetization orientation; Manufacturing technologies; Mean and standard deviations; Non-volatile memory application; Performance optimizations; Room and high temperatures; Switching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066797024

An IoT system can be accessed either by directly connecting to the network configured with external access and appropriate port forwarding; or through a cloud server. Direct access through network may not be possible for networks with restriction on external access, and requires technical know-how to configure the port forward. The use of cloud server is convenient that the users simply have to sign up an account at and use user friendly application to setup the system. This approach however requires the manufacturer to main the cloud server, has the concern of having users’ data accessible to the owner of the cloud server, and does not allow interoperability of devices and systems across different manufacturers.

Monitoring thermal behavior of DERs network is to explore the dualism between heat effect and Electrical power flow phenomena. This is crucial to determine the dynamic rating of the system's ability to perform according to the designed current carrying capacity. It will minimize constraints development due to thermal effect in distribution networks. System operators are been informed of adverse thermal behavior through ZigBee and GSM configured technology. LM35 temperature sensors are employed to sense the temperatures of distribution cables, thermal condition of storage facilities, protection control devices and that of Solar PV irradiation and Wind turbine. The outputs are then fed into the input of ATMEGA328P microcontroller for further processing, coordinating and then transmitted through ZigBee and GSM platform to be displayed on LCD screen under normal condition. Where there is an anticipation of abnormal condition, the sensor communicates with the microcontroller to trigger an alarm of the impending condition. This sends GSM activation SMS text to the remote monitor to alert operators. NI Multisim software is used for development of the Electrical circuit. The proposed design concept will remotely monitor thermal conditions as predictive system tool for DERs network application to mitigate power flow losses. © 2018 IEEE.","Condition Monitoring; DERs; Thermal Behavior; ZigBee/GSMcomponent","Digital storage; Electric load flow; Energy resources; Liquid crystal displays; Microcontrollers; Smart power grids; Thermal effects; Wind turbines; Zigbee; Abnormal conditions; DERs; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution cables; Electrical circuit; Network applications; Storage facilities; Thermal behaviors; Condition monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057042869

In this context, an important challenge to allow the proper operation of a local energy market is to devise efficient and economic computational platforms in charge of data storage, data communication, and any other relevant computational requirements. Fortunately, the recent developments in blockchain-based mechanisms open up promising approaches that can support the effective management of local energy markets. In fact, blockchain technology allows, in particular, to carry out decentralised payments without involving a third party in charge of keeping track of the trades performed, which can potentially simplify and enhance the management of a local energy market significantly. Motivated by this, this paper will study the use of the blockchainbased Ethereum platform as the computational support for a local energy market. Specifically, this paper addresses the scalability of this platform in terms of number of participants in the local energy market, and in terms of trading frequency. With this purpose, computer simulations are carried out for a market that consists of day-ahead trading and real-time trading. The day-ahead mechanism trades energy quantities in such a way that flexible demand can be shifted to balance inflexible supply, and the real-time mechanism trades energy in such a way that flexible loads cover deviations from the day-ahead settlement. The results illustrate that the Ethereum platform is sufficiently scalable, allowing to manage a local energy market with a large number of participants and a high trading frequency. © 2018 IEEE.","Blockchain; local energy market; market design; scalability","Blockchain; Digital storage; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Power markets; Scalability; Computational platforms; Computational requirements; Data-communication; Effective management; Local energy; Market design; Real-time mechanisms; Small electricities; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056526425

In a distributed power generation system, the DC/DC converter is generally considered as the first stage converter, and the microgrid inverter is seen as the second, forming a two-stage cascade system. Now the most commonly used DC/DC converter is the buck-boost converter, but a low-frequency right half plane (RHP) zero exists in the small signal model of the converter when working in the boost mode, which limits its control bandwidth and results in a mismatch with the microgrid inverter. This situation will reduce the stability of the cascade system. This paper uses the impedance ratio criterion in the cascade system stability study to analyze the causes of this phenomenon. Through simulation in MATLAB/Simulink, it can be seen that the control bandwidth mismatch leads to low-frequency oscillation and slow response speed of the DC bus voltage, and the stability of the cascade system is poor. To solve the above problems, the sliding mode control method is used to design the control system of the first stage converter. The simulation shows that adopting sliding mode control, the DC bus voltage has no low-frequency oscillation and has quick response speed under different operating conditions. The system stability is greatly improved. © 2018 IEEE.","cascade stability; control bandwidth matching; distributed generation; energy storage system; sliding mode control","Bandwidth; Control system stability; Controllers; Distributed power generation; Electric inverters; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Flight control systems; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; MATLAB; Sliding mode control; Bidirectional DC/DC converters; Control bandwidth; Different operating conditions; Distributed power generation systems; Energy storage systems; Low frequency oscillations; Right half plane zero; Simulation in matlabs; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056515563

Preliminary simulation results, in islanded mode, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme regarding power-sharing accuracy among the resources and state-of-charge balancing among storage units. © 2018 IEEE.","droop control; energy storage; hybrid power systems; maximum power point tracking; microgrids","Energy resources; Energy storage; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Distributed Energy Resources; Droop control; Energy storage systems; Hybrid power systems; Matlab/Simulink simulation; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Micro grid; Real-life applications; Fault tolerance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056493486

These systems are composed of renewable energy sources (RES) and storage devices. The main component in these systems is the storage device (e.g., batteries), which is used in order to store extra-produced energy during the day for eventual usage at night. However, battery's characterization according to their operating conditions is required to better identify its parameters and study their performance and behavior within MG systems. This paper introduces an instrumentation platform for battery characterization and modeling using recent sensing/actuating equipment. The platform was first deployed for gathering important battery's parameters, which are then used for building a simplified battery model. This model is then integrated into the MG system for evaluation and validation. Simulation results compared to experimental results show the accuracy of the developed battery model. © 2018 IEEE.","Battery; Micro-grid system; modeling and performance evaluation; RES","Battery management systems; Renewable energy resources; Rhenium; Virtual storage; Battery; Battery modeling; Micro-grid systems; Operating condition; Performance evaluations; Renewable energy source; Rural regions; Stand -alone; Electric batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056492547

Also, when the penetration of solar generation is very high, and due to the natural variation of that energy source some challenging situations may occur if demand varies in the opposite direction, leading to what is called ""duck curve"". In this situation, conventional generation may be no longer able to accommodate the ramp rate and range needed to fully utilize solar energy in power systems with considerable amount of solar generation. It was revealed that this could result in ""overgeneration"" leading to generation curtailment, with consequent decrease in benefits and wasted investment Storage and demand-side management are tools that may be used for dealing with that discrepancy between solar and wind generation and the demand, including facilitating the accommodation of higher solar electricity, and at the same time to allow a more efficient operation of the power system. This paper explores the duck chart in Porto Santo island, examining how much photovoltaic generation might need to be cut off if additional grid flexibility operations are not taken into account. It is shown that the solar penetration as low as 40% of annual energy could lead to marginal curtailment rates that exceed 30% of the solar generation. However, employing energy storage systems allow much greater penetration of solar resources, achieving a 50% renewable portfolio standard. © 2018 IEEE.","duck curve; Porto Santo; power grid; solar and wind generation","Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Conventional generation; duck curve; Energy storage systems; Photovoltaic generation; Porto Santo; Power grids; Renewable portfolio standard; Solar and winds; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056844513

The proposed methodology perfoms the choice of locations, using a definition of the best schedule of operation, while simultaneously optimizing four objective functions: the minimization of losses, voltage deviations and investment cost, and the maximization of the net gains of exploiting the differences among time varying energy prices. Results show that the best DEESS location depends on the energy service to be provided, namely of the goal of the DM that defines the management scheme of the DEESS, suggesting the need to incorporate this level of decision on the multiple objective formulation and making this methodology appropriate for different types of stakeholders. © 2018 IEEE.","distributed electric energy storage; Improved genetic algorithms; load profiles; multiobjective assessment","Costs; Decision making; Economics; Electric energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Lithium-ion batteries; Location; Sustainable development; Electricity networks; Lithium-ion-battery technology; Load profiles; Minimization of loss; Multi objective; Multiple-objectives; Objective functions; Voltage deviations; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056822468

For the analysis, a standard IEEE 119-bus distribution network system was used as a case study. Test results reveal that the joint optimization of ESSs and network reconfiguration markedly increase flexibility in existing systems, leading to an increase in the levels of renewables integration and utilization. Moreover, the analysis of the results shows the prospect of such systems in going fully 'carbon-free', i.e. with vRES power entirely meeting system demand.

Existing models mostly use regression methods, focusing on analyzing the correlation between various influencing factors and energy consumption, and forecasting the total energy consumption of tram lines through a large amount of statistical data. Analyze the complete operation process of the tram between the stations, use MATLAB/Simulink to build its operation model, simulate the operating conditions of the tram, and obtain the traction energy consumption model of the energy storage tram.

Recently, there are many methods proposed to solve the problem, and binary neural networks have drawn many attentions for they compress and speed up its counterparts at the cost of some performance. Hence, in this paper, we binarize Deep Neural Network based separation models, aiming to deploy them on embedded devices for real-time applications. Furthermore, we improve the separation performance by integrating knowledge distillation into the training phase of binary neural network based models, which is referred as Distilled Binary Neural Network (DBNN).

However, significant computation and storage demands are required by ConvNets. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with sparsely activated neurons and event-driven computations, show great potential to take advantage of the ultra- low power spike-based hardware architectures. Yet, training SNN with similar accuracy as ConvNets is difficult. Recent researchers have demonstrated the work of converting ConvNets to SNNs (CNN-SNN conversion) with similar accuracy. However, the energy-efficiency of the converted SNNs is impaired by the increased classification latency. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the classification latency of the converted SNNs. First, we propose a restricted output training method to normalize the converted weights dynamically in the CNN-SNN training phase. Second, false spikes are identified and the false spike inhibition theory is derived to speedup the convergence of the classification process. Third, we propose a temporal max pooling method to approximate the max pooling operation in ConvNets without accuracy loss. The evaluation shows that the converted SNNs converge in about 30 time-steps and achieve the best classification accuracy of 94% on CIFAR -10 dataset. © 2018 IEEE.","CNN-SNN Conversion; Convolutional Neural Networks; Spiking Neural Networks","Classification (of information); Computation theory; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Energy efficiency; Neural networks; Classification accuracy; Classification process; Convolutional neural network; Deep convolutional neural networks; Hardware architecture; Spiking neural networks; State-of-the-art performance; Training methods; Low power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056559027

An OWC device comprises a partly submerged hollow structure composed of an aperture below the water surface and an air chamber above the free surface. The oscillating motion of the internal free water surface produced by the incident waves compresses and expands the air in the chamber. The pressure between the air chamber and the atmosphere can be used to drive a turbine connected directly to an electrical generator. Usually the turbines used in OWCs are of the self-rectifying type, i.e., they rotate always in the same sense independently of the flow direction. The aim of this paper is to assess the potential use of experimental data collected in the Mutriku breakwater wave power plant, located in the north of Spain, to perform short-term prediction of the pressure inside the air chamber by a Nonlinear Autoregressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Nowadays, there exist diverse types of batteries with different characteristics and it is very important to be able to charge and discharge the battery at a safe and effective rate to maximize the battery life and fulfill the requirements of each application. Different power electronics circuits can be used to control battery charge and discharge; one of the most used is the DC-DC Buck-Boost converter. Typically, this type of converter only allows for energy transfer in one direction; otherwise a different topology and two controllers are needed, which must commute between charging and discharging mode. The objective of this work is to develop a single neural sliding modes control with on-line identification for both battery charge and discharge processes. The proposed controller does not depend on the converter parameters; for this reason, it can be used under different voltage and current requirements without the need of considerable changes in its implementation. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Controllers; DC-DC converters; Electric inverters; Energy transfer; Renewable energy resources; Sliding mode control; Battery charge and discharge; Buck boost converter; Charge and discharge; Different voltages; Neural sliding mode control; On-line identification; Power electronics circuits; Renewable energy generation; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056488883

As a result, rural communities depended on electricity that generated from fossil fuels (FFs) powered generators and renewable energy sources (RES). Localized hybrid microgrids can be designed to cater electricity needs for such communities. The prerequisite for the design of a rural microgrid is: a load model which can be extrapolated either from a similar system or loading information gathered from FF based existing systems. In this paper such an extrapolated model has been simulated to obtain optimum microgrid design for the Nasau Village (Koro Island, Fiji) located in the pacific region which includes a methodology for designing a hybrid microgrid. An estimated load model has been designed for the village based on the existing system load and then the system has been simulated using HOMER Pro (microgrid software by HOMER Energy) to determine the supply required from Photovoltaic (PV) cells, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Diesel Generator in the hybrid microgrid.

The communication between subsystems is modeled into a digraph. To construct the relationship between input and output, the input-output linearization technique is adopted to transform the load-sharing control design into a tracking synchronization problem of a general linear multi-agent system. LQR-based method is introduced to design the cooperative load-sharing control law based on the nearest neighbor principle, which makes the coupling strength only depend on the communication topology and the control gain only depend on the sub-system model. The asymptotical stability of the entire closed-loop systems can be decoupled into each sub-system's stability through matrix transformation provided that the directed graph has a spanning tree, which is rigorously proved with the aid of the Lyapunov function. A desired response speed can be obtained by tuning the control parameters based on the LQR method. The proposed approach is successfully applied to address the current-sharing problem of parallel charging systems for energy storage type light rail vehicles. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Cooperative Control; Coupled Parallel-Connected Dynamical Systems; Distributed Load-Sharing; Input-Output Linearization; Parallel Chargers","Closed loop systems; Directed graphs; Dynamical systems; Light rail transit; Linear transformations; Linearization; Lyapunov functions; Mathematical transformations; Multi agent systems; Topology; Trees (mathematics); Co-operative control; Distributed loads; Input output linearization; Parallel Chargers; Parallel-connected; Cooperative communication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056146431

Nevertheless, the giant grid scale, complicated structure and external natural factors result in the potential of large-scaled power failure. Traditional black start power gives priority to hydropower. In areas with shortage of hydro power resources, suitable black start power is insufficient. The key of black start is able to realize the safe and stable operation of wind power and energy storage cogeneration system. Due to the combination of wind turbines and energy storage is a small system, energy storage, as a black start power source, starts the wind turbines together to supply power for the remote load. Therefore, it is necessary to run the balance and stable operation of a small system.

This paper proposes a two-level programming framework considering the operational and signaling constraints as well as the efficiencies of ESS. The minimization of equivalent energy consumption of ESS is chosen as the optimization objective. At the first level, the algorithm that can calculate an energy saving minimum trip time speed profile (MTTSP) without unnecessary braking considering signaling at the intersection was developed. At the second level, the algorithms that can calculate an energy-efficient speed profile (EESP) based on the coasting control were proposed too. With the foundation of the two-level programming framework, we can effectively obtain the EESP consequently. The framework is applied in two main signal control modes for tram: the signal priority mode and the signal passive priority mode to verify its effectiveness. Simulations of three cases for each mode demonstrate that the proposed programming framework can provide an effective approach in solving the EST control problem with signaling constraints for reducing energy consumption. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Energy Storage Tram; Energy-efficient Speed Profile; Optimal Control; Signaling Constraints","Computer aided software engineering; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Railroad rolling stock; Regenerative braking; Signaling; Energy storage systems; Optimal controls; Programming framework; Reducing energy consumption; Regenerative braking energies; Speed profile; Trajectory optimization; Two-level programming; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056138140

However, a large scale of series-connected ultracapacitors increase the voltage variation of the DC bus, which affects the size and efficiency of the subsequent power converter stage and undermines the energy utilization of the ultracapacitor. Moreover, ultracapacitors in series-connection inevitably suffer from voltage imbalance, which limits the capacity of energy storage system by the weakest cell. To alleviate the above problems, ultracapacitor parallel-series reconfiguration is employed to reduce the voltage variation in this paper. Particularly, a synchronous equilibrium strategy based on consensus tracking control is designed for voltage balance among series-connected ultracapacitors. First, we mathematically model the ultracapacitor-based energy storage system using the state-space averaging method. Second, the law of reconfiguration and synchronous equilibrium strategy is analyzed and designed. Finally, both simulation and experiment results verify that the proposed charging strategy effectively suppresses the voltage variation of the DC bus and evidently reduces balance time during charging. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Reconfigurable topology; The voltage variation; Ultracapacitor; Voltage imbalance","Capacitor storage; Energy utilization; Land vehicle propulsion; Railroad rolling stock; Capacity of energies; Charging strategies; Energy storage systems; Equilibrium strategy; Reconfigurable; State space averaging method; Voltage imbalance; Voltage variation; Supercapacitor",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056110944

Two conflicting objectives are considered and a bi-objective problem is formulated mathematically. The first objective (economical performance) contains cost of fuel consumption and cost of power purchased from grid. The second objective (environmental performance) takes account of several pollutant emissions. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is applied to derive the Pareto frontier which is a set of noninferior solutions. A realistic case study is performed on Hongfeng Eco-town as a model of VPP, which includes various distributed energy resources (DER) such as hydropower units, wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, combined cooling heating and power units (CCHP) and storage devices. Simulation concentrates on three strategies: 1) money-oriented, 2) environment-only, 3) Pareto-optimal. Comparison of simulation results reveals that Pareto-optimal strategy can better compromise costs and emissions.

The increasing demand for equipment has made smart wearable devices a research hotspot. Such equipment is usually small, light-weight, good flexibility, and can be adapted to the complex use of the environment. But these advantages just become the limitations of power supply for equipment. Generally, the fixed charger can not be used to charge the device during use, and the volume of such a special battery can not be increased in order to increase the storage capacity.

Since a perfect knowledge of the state of charge (SOC) of the storage devices may be difficult or costly in practice, in this paper we consider the optimization problem of the multiple energy systems with imperfect SOC knowledge of storage devices. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A cyber-physical simulation-based optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The effectiveness of the developed method under uncertainties in the supply and demand and the performance degradation compared to the case with perfect SOC knowledge are demonstrated based on numerical case studies. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Cyber-physical energy system; POMDP; Renewable supply; Simulation-based optimization; Storage devices","Data storage equipment; Economics; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Markov processes; Numerical methods; Optimization; Problem solving; Renewable energy resources; Virtual storage; Cyber physicals; Optimization problems; Partially observable Markov decision process; Performance degradation; POMDP; Renewable supply; Simulation-based optimizations; Supply and demand; Cyber Physical System",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056081236

The influence factors of the AC copper losses, such as the winding diameter, current and machine speed etc. are analyzed. The research results show that the winding diameter has a huge effect on the winding AC loss in ironless BLDCM, and the shunt wound structure with multiple wires method can reduce winding AC loss effectively. However, due to induced voltage and impedance unbalance, additional circulating current loss would be induced. For circulating current losses calculation, a winding circulating current equivalent calculation model is built. The circulating current losses are calculated by simplified 3D finite element method and the winding strand arrangement method to reduce circulating current loss is explored. Three strands arrangements are compared and discussed.

Recent study from Max Plank Institute for Biogeochemistry, Germany1 indicates the extreme events not only cause suffers in the whole ecosystems but also create more CO2 emission to form a climate change vicious circle due to self-reinforcing effect. Reducing CO2 emission is the most urgent endeavor in environmental protection to ensure the sustainability of tour planet ecosystems. Reducing CO2 emission through alternative material application such as lower soldering temperature can be a potential major contribution from electronic industry. iNEMI Board Assembly Technical Roadmap2 of 2017 predict that the low temperature soldering (LTS) usage will increase to 20 plus percent by 2027. The drivers for this LTS technology trend are three folds, the energy and CO2 emission reduction, overcome material limitation in electronic component and PCB, and low soldering process to match with electronic miniaturization.This article is part 1 of a series of study on new low melting temperature solder interconnect application and reliability on various product categories, enterprise computers such as server and storage, AIO (all-in-one desk top), POS (Point of Sale), tablet, and automotive electronics. First, the raw LTS SnBiAg material properties range from power particle size, Halogen content, flux characterization, viscosity, wetting, SIR, Electrochemical migration etc. are assessed. Then five product emulators are selected as test vehicle to represent the broad scope of various electronics products. Due to the nature of brittleness of Bi contain in the LTS as shown in earlier publications2,3 the material drop cycle to failure reliability of LTS is substantially below current SAC305 which widely used in various electronics. Mechanical strengthening mechanism such as corner bonding material is attached along the BGA to observe the susceptibility of mechanical shock in later two product emulators, tablet and automotive electronics.Since all BGA incoming with solder composition are in SAC305 nowadays there is a backward compatibility issue with new LTS. Inhomogeneous microstructure as well as potential solder defect was observed in SEM micrograph. Experiment of adding various LTS paste volume so as different Bi percentage in mixed alloy join are studied to see crack propagation and failure interface due to Bi diffusion and intermetallic compound formation when product emulator subject to accelerated stress test. While observe the crack propagation in microstructure, potential strengthening mechanism such as solid solution, precipitation hardening and phase size refinement can be determined in the of SAC and LTS mixed and Bi percentage variation alloy.Finally BFT (board functional test) will be conducted in between accelerated thermal and mechanical cycling test to offline but real-time monitoring the reliability of solder joint of passive, PTH, BGA of active IC and CPU. The benefit of using product emulators with BFT is an advantage in the transition of LTS from SAC. © 2018 IEEE.","Climate Change; Crack Propagation; Extreme Weather; inhomogeneous microstructure; Intermetallic Compound; Low Temperature Solder; LTS; mixed alloy; mixed alloy; Product Emulator; SAC305; SnBiAg; Strengthening Mechanism; Technology Roadmap","Age hardening; Ball grid arrays; Bismuth compounds; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crack propagation; Cracks; Ecosystems; Electronics packaging; Emission control; Failure (mechanical); Gas emissions; Integrated circuit interconnects; Intermetallics; Microstructure; Outages; Particle size; Printed circuit boards; Reliability; Silver alloys; Soldered joints; Soldering; Soldering alloys; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Temperature; Tin alloys; Extreme weather; Inhomogeneous microstructure; Low temperature solders; Product Emulator; SAC305; SnBiAg; Strengthening mechanisms; Technology roadmaps; Bismuth alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056397562

In this method, the generator power is regulated at maximum point by controlling the electromagnetic torque at the optimum point. The electromagnetic torque is controlled by regulating the generator current through the boost converter. WTGs are designed to supply a single phase load through boost inverter.

Load changes can cause system frequency fluctuations and may cause damage to electrical equipment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to obtain the right constants to obtain the best optimization. In this study compare the control method, namely; Proportional Integral Derivatives (PID), Capacitive Energy Storage (CES), and Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES). This study also compared the method of artificial intelligence between Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method has been studied with the method of Firefly Algorithm (FA). Overall this study compares 11 methods, namely methods; uncontrolled, PID-PSO method, PID-FA method, CES-PSO method, CES-FA method, SMES-PSO method, SMES-FA method, PID-CES-PSO method, PID-CES-FA method, PID-SMES-PSO, and PID-SMES-FA method. The results of the simulation showed that from the 11 methods studied, it was found that the PID-CES-FA method has the smallest undershot value, ie-7.774e-03 pu, the smallest overshoot value, which is 4.482e-05 pu, and the fastest completion time is 7.11 s. These results indicate that the smallest frequency fluctuations are found in the PID-CES-FA controller. Thus it is stated that the PID-CES-FA method is the best method used in the previous method. This research will use other methods to get the best controller. © 2018 IEEE.","CES; Firefly algorithm; Micro-hydro; PID; SMES",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069189399

Minimal leakage current and small on-chip area, low power consumption and non-volatile memory are the features that make the memristor promising and powerful tool in circuit design. However since memristive devices are not capable to supply energy to a circuit, they should be coupled with conventional CMOS devices, thus forming hybrid circuit configurations. In the frame of this study, we examine the previously proposed circuit for passive neuron. The elements are replaced by memristor to produce tanh activation function.

UAV can be classified into three main typologies depending on their method of flight. There are fixed-wing aircraft, rotary-wing aircraft, and flapping-wing aircraft. Rotary-wing aircraft is the typology that consumes more energy compared to other types. Hence, it is mandatory to optimize rotary-wing aircraft's energy consumption to achieve specific mission requirements. This paper presents the latest research done on energy optimization of rotary-wing aircraft.

In this paper, a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) driven by a wind turbine is associated with a hybrid energy storage system. The DFIG is controlled with a flexible algorithm based on fuzzy logic control combined with direct torque and reactive power control (DTRPC). The objective is to analyze the performances of the DTRPC taking into account the randomness of wind allowing the three modes (Sub, Super and synchronous) operations, in successive and continuous manner, with a particular focus on synchronous mode.

The continuous evolution of electrical energy storage sources is overcome by the great amount of energy required by the multi-rotor unmanned aerial system. Therefore, the on-board energy is a critical factor that needs to be further investigated and well-managed. The rechargeable Lithium-Polymer battery has shown a great success in aerial robotics, thanks to its high energy density, small size, and weight. However, the overall performances of aLi-Po battery degrade over time. Consequently, it is indispensable to have an instantly accurate data of the current batteries status; particularly the state of charge; and their remaining lifetime. In this work, we are interested in managing the energy of aLi-Po battery-powered multi-rotor UAS. First, we start by describing the different battery's dynamic models found in the literature. Then, the focus shifts towards the Battery Monitoring System, which as its name indicates, monitors and maintains rechargeable batteries. It turned out that the heart of modern BMS is based on battery status estimation. The battery status is widely described by two parameters: State Of Charge (SOC) and the State Of Health (SOH). These two factors are of a critical concern in energy management of dynamic applications. Therefore, we will highlight the main techniques seen in literature used to estimate the SOC and SOH. To monitor onboard energy, an Energy Control System is suggested in this paper. The ECS is based on a BMS who will manage all problems that could meet the batteries and provide the supervisor system with essential information to succeed the multi-rotor UAS flight. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery Models; Battery Monitoring System; Electrochemical battery; Energy Control System; Energy Management; Li-Po Battery; Multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial System; State Of Charge; State Of Health","Antennas; Binary alloys; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy management systems; Flight control systems; Information management; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Monitoring; Power control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Battery models; Electrochemical batteries; State of charge; State of health; Unmanned aerial systems; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055871887

However, the heat generated by these batteries remains a challenge. Without an appropriate battery thermal management system (BTMS), the Ii-ion battery surface temperature can increase very quickly, and thus creating a hazard for the users and the equipment. This paper presents a solid-state hybrid active/passive BTMS system. It includes Peltier effect heat pumps, heat sinks, heat spreaders and fans.

However, the intermittent nature of RES (e.g., Solar Energy) must be addressed in order to allow their large scale integration in buildings. Standalone PV systems are generally installed in remote and rural regions since they are not connected to the electrical grid. They use mainly storage devices (e.g., batteries) to store produced/extra solar energy during the day for eventual usage at night. Recently, there have been enormous deployments of grid-connected photovoltaic systems, which use solar panels connected to the electricity grid for producing and feeding extra electricity back to the grid. They are also being able to supply electricity to the load when there is no production. In this paper, we are talking the research question aiming at selecting the suitable dimensions for energy production (PV system). We have, therefore, developed a model for each component of the PV system. A grid-connected PV system is sized, modeled and analyzed according to a dedicated consumption profile.

In the presence of storages and demand side management (together the 'flexibility assets') the day-ahead forecast horizon might not be enough for optimal utilization of these assets. This paper shows that by increasing the forecast horizon of wind power the operational costs in the power system of the Baltic Sea region can be reduced. As the forecast horizon increases the largest cost savings are on the fuel cost of mid-merit units, whereas for the base load units the longer forecast horizon increases the operational costs. Furthermore, as the forecast horizon approaches one week, the results indicate that the relative impact on the operational cost savings start to reduce. Therefore, the increase of the forecast horizon can run up against a limit, which after the forecasts may not contain any valuable information for decision making. © 2018 IEEE.","Energy storage; Power system modeling; Wind energy; Wind energy integration","Commerce; Cost reduction; Decision making; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Baltic sea; Cost saving; Optimal utilization; Power System; Power system model; Production and consumption; Relative impact; Wind energy integration; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055593906

With this incentive mechanism and significant battery storage installation costs, there wasn't any motivation for the consumers to integrate energy storage to balance out the mismatch between local generation and demand. With the significant cost reduction of PV modules and falling costs of battery storage, these technologies become more attractive. By integrating these technologies together with the other distributed generation resources available at the consumer level, we can reduce grid supply costs and use this to finance such projects. In order to achieve such cost reduction, available production and storage resources need to be scheduled in optimal manner. This paper describes an optimization model for the optimal scheduling of distributed generation and battery storage in order to assure minimal supply costs for the grid connected consumer. The model is casted as MIP and verified through year-scale simulations based on the actual electricity consumption data, electricity price and PV plant production data for University building. © 2018 IEEE.","Distributed generation; Energy storage; Optimal scheduling; Smart building","College buildings; Commerce; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Intelligent buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Power markets; Scheduling; Distributed generation resources; Electricity prices; Electricity-consumption; Incentive mechanism; Installation costs; Optimal scheduling; Optimization modeling; Storage resources; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055491141

During the lifetime of PP, it is generally known that charging/discharging cycles can increase the ageing occurrence, even the breakdown. In this paper, the charging/discharging experiments were conducted based on polarization and depolarization current method, and the breakdown experiments were constructed with different electric-field patterns and electrode spaces. After the charging/discharging experiments, the breakdown voltage and breakdown currents were measured. The images of breakdown craters were captured through applying a monocular-videozoom microscope, and then quantitatively characterized by using an image-pattern-identification technique to obtain the breakdown characteristics of PP films. The results obtained show that both charging/discharging cycles and electric-field patterns have significant influence on the breakdown characteristics of PP films. With increasing the electrode space and uniformity of electric field, the breakdown voltage, breakdown energy and breakdown degree all show the increasing tendency. While with the increase in the charging/discharging cycles, the breakdown voltage, breakdown energy and breakdown degree show the decreasing tendency. © 2018 IEEE.","Breakdown characteristics; Charging/discharging cycles; Electrical ageing; Polypropylene film","Depolarization; Dielectric materials; Electric breakdown; Electric power transmission networks; Electrodes; Metallic films; Plasma theory; Plastic films; Polypropylenes; Breakdown characteristics; Charging/discharging; Dielectric reliability; Electric field patterns; Electrical ageing; High energy density capacitors; Polarization and depolarization currents; Poly-propylene film; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055865509

These vehicles with fast charging technologies require a high electric demand over some hours to charge their batteries. In order to provide a feasible solution at the utility level to that problem, large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) are considered as vital means to provide flexibility and effectively support the local networks. However, the capital cost of the BESS is still a main concern leading to a cost-effective operation schedule is required to ensure the desirable power quality while the lifetime of BESS is extended. This paper investigates the solutions to the power congestion problem and under-voltage issue of a Dutch medium voltage network around the Amsterdam Arena stadium once the penetration of electric vehicles keeps increasing in the years to come.

Considering the features of reducible loads and mobile energy storage devices of EVs, it's possible that EVs provide emergency ancillary service when the energy supply of BIES is malfunctioned. In this paper, the framework of BIES is firstly established and modeled. For the sake of exploiting EVs to provide emergency ancillary service for the building, an optimization dispatching model of BIES under different kinds of malfunctioning scenarios of energy supply is set up, aiming at minimizing the cost of building operation. Meanwhile, the curtailment of load demands and battery discharge of EVs can be subsidized. Through the simulation and analysis of the proposed model, the results of case study demonstrate that EV emergency ancillary service can reduce charging loads and provide reserve capacity to BIES when the energy carriers are malfunctioned. The building can maintain supply of heat and electricity without increasing the investment of backup generators and energy storage devices. © 2018 IEEE.","ancillary service; building integrated energy system; electric vehicles; system reserve","Buildings; Electric automobiles; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Emergency services; Energy resources; Grid computing; Smart power grids; Ancillary service; Building integrated; Building operations; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Heat and electricity; Optimization dispatching; Simulation and analysis; system reserve; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055577186

Selectivity is facilitated by splitting the electrical power network into zones. Protection schemes are incorporated into each zone to provide primary protection and back-up protection for external faults. The integration of distributed generators is contributing to the transformation of the power grid to a distributed architecture that incorporates hybrid microgrids and energy storage systems. This transformation impacts the sensitivity, stability and speed of the existing protection schemes leading to possible loss of selectivity, especially at the distribution level. This paper proposes a new type of protection zone, the Busbar Area Protection (BAP) zone that extends to include a busbar and all feeders fed from that busbar. The BAP zone facilitates protection that is able to eliminate the impact of DG integration on selectivity, while significantly reducing the protection component count at a busbar to only one primary relay irrespective of the number of feeders terminating at that node, in contrast to most other protection relaying systems that require at least one relay dedicated to each feeder. The protection operates under smart grid environment with intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) exchanging voltage measurements using peer-to-peer communications. © 2018 IEEE.","distributed control; multi-agent systems; power network modelling; Protection zones","Busbars; Closed loop control systems; Distributed parameter control systems; Distributed power generation; Electric equipment protection; Electric fault currents; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Feeding; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Smart power grids; Distributed architecture; Distributed control; Distributed generators; Electrical power networks; Intelligent electronic device; Peer-to-peer communications; Power networks; Protection zones; Electric power system protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055531565

Owing to the dynamics of RE generation, green energy may not guarantee sufficient power supplies for base stations (BSs). To enhance sustainable network operations, we envision future BSs to be powered by hybrid supplies including commercial grid supply or diesel generators (DG) in conjunction with the solar array. This paper focuses a hybrid energy sharing framework among RE powered BSs via physical power lines. Under the proposed framework, each BS is equipped with onsite green energy harvester having an independent storage device and the BSs share excess electricity through resistive power cables to reduce dependency on the traditional energy supply.

The increasing security concerns, electrical energy theft, and present advancement in Information and Communication Technologies are some factors that led to modernization of power system. In a smart grid, a network of smart sensors offers numerous opportunities that may include monitoring of power, consumer-side energy management, synchronization of dispersed power storage, and integrating sources of renewable energy. Smart sensor networks are low cost and are ease to deploy hence they are favorable contestants for deployment smart power grids at a larger scale. These networks will result in a colossal volume of dissimilar range of data that require an efficient processing and analyzing process in order to realize an efficient smart grid. The existing technology can be used to collect data but dealing with the collected information proficiently as well as mining valuable material out of it remains challenging.

However, due to the error-prone wireless links in the Terahertz band (0.1-10.0 THz) and very limited energy storage capacity in nanodevices, the efficient and effective error control protocols are necessary for nanonetworks. In this paper, firstly, a novel error control strategy with probing (ECP) mechanism for nanonetworks powered by energy harvesting is proposed. In particular, each data packet is transmitted only after the communication of one probing packet is successful. Secondly, the energy state model as well as state transition rate matrix by considering the energy harvesting-consumption process is presented based on the extended Markov chain approach. Thirdly, the impact of different packets energy consumption on state transition and the state probability distribution based on the above matrix are comprehensively investigated. Finally, analytical and numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed ECP mechanism in terms of end-to-end successful packet delivery probability, end-to-end packet delay, achievable throughput and energy consumption.

In this paper, we propose a novel 8-bit datapath AES architecture aiming for a small area and a high energy efficiency. Firstly, our proposed design reduces the number of temporary data storage (IntermediateReg) to 40-bit from the originally 128-bit, which saves 68.75% intermediate registers. Secondly, only one S-Box is implemented in the design that is reused throughout the whole AES operations to achieve a low area. Thirdly, the architecture is further optimized to reduce the number of clock cycles by reusing S-Box in the key expansion and the data encryption module, leading to only 213 total cycles of latency in a complete encryption process. Simulation results under TSMC 28nm technology show that our proposed AES circuit consumes an area of 0.0028mm2, with an energy efficiency of 667Gbps/W (equivalent to 1.50 pJ/bit) and throughput rate of 30.05Mbps at 0.5V.

In this paper, it is proposed for this task to use signals with a complex structure, for example timed signal structures. Feature of the timer signals is the ability to integrate both the noise-immune coding and the secrecy of signal structures. Structural secrecy of signal structures is aimed at a significant complication in the recognition of their structure, provided the means of electronic reconnaissance solve the problem of energy secrecy, i.e. The signal is detected and recorded on data carrier.The estimation of the timer coding for the synthesis of different sets allowed signal structures with given value of the minimum code distance was given. This information will allow to create algorithms for increasing structural secrecy, taking into account the corrective ability of the timer signals. Parametric properties of timer coding for the synthesis of various sets signal structures differing in the structure of their construction are investigated. The comparative analysis of methods for constructing time-domain signals using the quality equation and a complete search was carried out.The relationship of structural secrecy and corrective ability of timed signal structures is analyzed with account the parameters of their construction.

Among many kinds of catalytic materials and composites with its participation, Ni, Co-spinel attracted great interest, especially as electrode material for electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems, due to its higher theoretical specific capacity than conventional graphite. The main advantages of nickel cobalt spinel and composite materials with its participation are high electrical resistivity and electron conductivity, high rate capability, thermodynamic stability and durability. Peculiarities of the crystal structure of spinels cause such properties. Ni, Co-spinels refer to single-phase triple oxides of the inverse spinel type with two different metal cations. Inverse spinels have considerable electrical conductivity due to the possibility of electron exchange between divalent and trivalent ions in the octahedral position. Due to the presence of such structural features, inverse spinels can be successfully used as electrocatalysts in energy storage/conversion systems. Synthesis approaches of Ni, Co-spinel and composites with its participation include hydrothermal method, microwave synthesis, coprecipitation method, dry synthesis technique and sol-gel method. Establishing a connection between methods and conditions of synthesis, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the methods used to modification the obtained samples, is an important scientific and practical task and an urgent topic for further research in this field. © 2018 IEEE.","Co-spinels; Composites; Energy storage/conversion system; Modification; Ni; Synthesis","Cobalt deposits; Composite materials; Crystal structure; Electric conductivity; Electrocatalysts; Energy storage; Hydrothermal synthesis; Nanostructured materials; Nickel; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Storage (materials); Synthesis (chemical); Composite nanoparticles; Coprecipitation method; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical energy storage; Electron conductivity; High-electrical resistivities; Hydrothermal methods; Modification; Inverse problems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076815593

A grant challenge of managing this huge RDF data is how to access this big RDF data efficiently. A popular approach to addressing the problem is to build a full set of permutations of (S, P, O) indexes. Although this approach has shown to accelerate joins by orders of magnitude, the large space overhead limits the scalability of this approach and makes it heavyweight. In this paper, we present TripleBit +, a fast and compact system for updating RDF data. The design of TripleBit + has two salient features. First, the efficient maintenance strategies of TripleBit + reduces both the overhead to update data and indexes. Second, effective maintenance technologies to handle online updates over RDF repositories are proposed. Our experiments show that TripleBit + outperforms RDF-3X, MonetDB, BitMat on LUBM, UniProt, and BTC 2012 benchmark queries and it offers orders of mangnitude performance improvement for some complex join queries.

Due to the high load variability during driving, incorporating two different electric motors in the drive can provide significant improvements in terms of energy consumption. A data-driven approach towards optimal power flow management in such configuration is proposed. Computationally expensive dynamic models are translated into an equivalent power flow-based representation, taking into account peak start-up losses. Optimal synchronization of both machines is then assessed over a given drive cycle, providing an optimal actuation policy for all embodied subsystems. Modifications to a standard dynamic programming formulation are introduced, reducing the computation time by a factor 125.

However, the lack and/or expense of charging infrastructure has slowed their adoption. As such, vehicles are often equipped with small on-board chargers, which serve as the primary charging method. These chargers are discrete devices, with additional power electronics and magnetics, which increase the cost and weight of the vehicle. Another solution is to look at redeploying the existing drivetrain components to serve as an integrated charging system. This work proposes a charging scheme that utilizes the inverter and motor in a dual-inverter drive to directly charge from a single-phase AC grid, at power levels greater than existing on-board chargers. In concept, the dual-inverter drive is shown to be operable similar to a PFC based charger with high input voltage. The challenge addressed in this paper relates to how charging power can be arbitrarily divided amongst the energy sources of the dual-inverter drive. This ability to divide charging power is a critical feature needed to prevent overcharging of the batteries and is also a key feature required in a hybrid energy storage configuration. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Electric inverters; Electric utilities; Vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Charging systems; Critical features; Discrete devices; Drive-train components; Hybrid energy storage; On-board chargers; Transportation sector; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053824360

One popular multi-copy approach is known as 'dynamic' replication; each node creates replicas on a contact basis using a utility that determines a node's fitness for delivering a message to its destination. This scheme is highly flexible, configurable with different utility functions and able to operate efficiently in networks with diverse characteristics. Nonetheless, its drawback is the tendency to produce a high number of replicas that consume limited resources such as energy and storage. Our approach to tackle this problem relies on the observation that, based on their utility values, the network nodes can be grouped into clusters that portray different delivery capabilities. Then, to avoid unnecessary replication, we exploit this finding to replicate a packet to nodes that belong to clusters with increasing delivery capability instead of replicating it to nodes with increasing utility. The new method works in synergy with the basic dynamic replication algorithms and is fully configurable, in the sense that it can be used with virtually any utility function. By conducting experiments in a diverse set of real-life networks, we empirically show that the method effectively reduces the overall number of replicas without hindering delivery efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Computer networks; Information systems; Cluster-based; Dynamic replication; Forwarding strategies; Intermittent connectivity; Mobile opportunistic networks; Real-life networks; Utility functions; Utility values; Wireless ad hoc networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053813130

This process is called CO2-EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) or simply EOR. During CO2-EOR, some injected CO2 remains in the pore space left behind after the production of the in-situ pore fluid. This is a mechanism for the long-term storage of CO2, and a means to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if the injected CO2 is of anthropogenic origin. Although previous field studies around operational CO2-EOR sites have reported only a few instances of increased seismicity, induced seismicity should be monitored to identify pore pressure-induced geomechanical problems within the injection formation and overlying seals. Towards this end, we deployed a surface seismic network consisting of eight broadband seismometers around an array of injection and production wells at a CO2-EOR operation in Farnsworth, Texas. We analyzed continuous seismic data recorded from June 2017 to December 2017 and identified 115 low-frequency seismic events. These events exhibited a significant concentration of seismic energy in the frequency range of 1-5 Hz and have an emergent waveform lasting for 30-70 seconds. The low-frequency events have no temporal overlap with the regional earthquake catalog, and the signals are not recorded by nearby seismic stations from the US and Oklahoma seismic networks. We suggest these low-frequency events of long time duration could be caused by a localized source of deformation rather than small-magnitude regional earthquakes. We plotted long-period event locations on reservoir models depicting the extent of the CO2 plume and pore pressure increase, and found that a only a few events occurred within the CO2 plume and pressure perturbation area. Majority of the remaining events are uniformly distributed within 15 miles of the study area and have no apparent spatial correlation with the CO2 injection activity. We think that low-frequency events observed in the current study are possibly the seismic signatures of complex subsurface deformation and likely related to localized background seismicity. © 2018 SEG",,"Deformation; Digital storage; Earthquakes; Enhanced recovery; Greenhouse gases; Induced Seismicity; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Pore pressure; Broad-band seismometers; Depleted oil reservoirs; Enhanced-oil recoveries; Lower frequencies; Oil-production; Pore fluids; Pore space; Regional earthquakes; Seismic monitoring; Seismic networks; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121831772

Secondly, a parameter estimation algorithm for this model is proposed using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. In the proposed algorithm, the parameters of each EDSW are estimated sequentially wave by wave. A suitable number of model components for each trace is determined according to the level of the residuals energy.

The scope of this paper focuses on proving the concept with both laboratory and numerical modeling. We test approaches base upon seismic tube-wave analysis and electrical-reflectometry monitoring. The numerical modeling of the seismic tube waves suggests there are observable reflections from the base of the borehole. We test the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method in the lab with both low-impedance coaxial cables (80 m long, 53.5 Ω) and low-carbon steel pipe (6 m long with an outer diameter of 7.76 cm and an inner diameter of 7.3 cm). The pulse reflections from the end of both coaxial cable and steel pipe can be clearly seen. The calculated distances from the reflections match with the actual measurements.

The reliability and health state of battery energy storage system (BESS) directly influence the safety of the whole system. Particular emphasis is placed on approaches that can be used to assess the health state of lithium-ion battery especially for on-line operation conditions. As the battery is working in real applications, there is thereby an urgent need but it is still a significant challenge to estimate the battery health state based on on-line available parameters. This paper offers a new routine for lithium-ion battery on-line health assessment just based on the voltage measurements from constant current charge and discharge phases. Two different degradation features extracted from on-line measurable parameters are mapped to the battery health state space directly. Relevance vector machine (RVM) is applied to train the nonlinear mapping model by virtue of the sparsity of the model considering the computing complexity in on-line applications. On the other hand, the RVM algorithm can not only obtain the accurate health assessment results but also can represent the uncertainty involved in the results, which makes the health assessment more informative for system mission planning, condition based operation optimization, and other strategies to increase the system reliability and decrease the maintenance cost. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach could potentially achieve on-line battery health assessment and present the uncertainty at the same time. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Battery management systems; Digital storage; Ions; Reliability; Systems engineering; Battery energy storage systems; Computing complexity; Measurable parameters; Nonlinear mapping models; On-line applications; Operation optimization; Relevance Vector Machine; System reliability; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062847111

The battery can be regarded as an energy storage element in the system for reliable operation, or it can be considered as the load itself while being charged from null to full. The charger consists of a boost converter followed by a buck converter that charges the battery. The two converters are interfaced using a dc link capacitor that can be a super capacitor for increased energy buffer capability and to meet power spikes needed by the load. Traditionally, the boost converter is controlled to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT), while the output voltage of the boost converter is regulated by the buck converter, which connects to the battery. In this paper, a coordinated control strategy for the two converters is proposed and implemented to achieve multi-objective performance. When the optimal charging power is less than the offered maximum PV power, a power-matching control mode is initiated to keep the charging process smooth. In this mode of operation, the dc link voltage will be kept constant. When the PV maximum input power is less than the battery optimal charging power, the system shifts into MPPT control. In this paper, the dc link voltage information is used to guide the entire supervisory control system. By offering a range of voltage variation across the de link capacitor, the system can ride through fast shading or partial shading dynamics, which stabilizes the charging process in such normally occurring environmental conditions. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed control strategy. © 2018 IEEE.","Battery Charger; DC/DC converter; Multistage charger; PV system","Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Maximum power point trackers; Power control; Power electronics; Robust control; Secondary batteries; Battery chargers; Coordinated control strategy; Environmental conditions; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Multistage charger; PV system; Reliable operation; Supervisory control systems; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053845887

Moreover, for multi-level of operation, multi recommended curves generated off line consume a large storage of the ATO systems.

Utilizing this option allows for the ultimate goal of designing a hybrid wheeling and jumping robot to be reached. The modeling of NiTi wires to predict the jumping performance is not trivial, owing to NiTi's nonlinear properties. Therefore, we develop mathematical models by considering the nonlinearity as well as asymmetric loading responses to capture the force, geometry, and energy during the energy-charge process. With the designed robot, the predicted jumping performance is close to the experimental results, verifying the proposed modeling methods.

This means they do not have inertia as rotating machines do, and thus, they cannot handle transient load demands that go over their instantaneous maximum power point. In addition, when compared to traditional generators their power ramp rate is much steeper, being able to reach values of 90% per minute and higher. Both characteristics have an impact on power system operation, especially in the case of large PV plants. For example, due to their lack of inertia, a PV plant cannot participate in primary frequency regulation, injecting active power during system faults. Further, the rapid power ramp rate exhibit by PV plants can also affect system stability due to the fast increase or decrease in generated power, which usually cannot be compensated by the rest of the generators in the grid. In this regard, it has been shown that these two issues can be mitigated by the addition of energy storage elements to the PV plant power conditioning system. However, to do so proper sizing, interfacing and control of the energy storage is required. To tackle this issue, analysis of energy storage requirements for a grid connected power plant is performed in this paper. As a result, sizing guidelines and a design procedure for the required battery bank are developed. In addition, a control strategy to regulate the power ramp rate of the system is presented and its effectiveness verified through computer simulations. © 2018 IEEE.","Energy Storage; Photovoltalcs; Power ramp rate regulation","Computer control systems; Design; Energy storage; Power electronics; Ramp generators; Silicon compounds; System stability; Grid-connected PV power plants; Maximum power point; Photovoltalcs; Power conditioning systems; Power ramp rates; Power system operations; Primary frequency regulation; Storage requirements; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053840234

By introducing virtual queues for the batteries and constructing virtual workload queues, the problem fits into the framework of Lyapunov optimization, which leads to a dynamic and distributed algorithm.

The development of the energy management strategy (EMS) involves the modeling of the BESS and the modeling of a prediction aging mechanism for the Lithium Ion battery stack. In addition, EMS comprises the identification of the needs and requirements for energy management in a dynamic pricing environment where the Power Supplier (GRID) is the monadic source of power to the resident and to the BESS. The main objective of the proposed EMS is to prevent the fast aging of the Lithium-Ion batteries with respect to the maximum financial benefits for the consumer. Moreover, due to the dynamic pricing environment and the uncertainty that the forecast energy demand will match the actual energy demand, the ability of the EMS to update the proposed strategy during the day on hourly basis can be deemed vital.

Therefore, they need a stable, reliable and inexpensive energy supply system. At present, the energy supply systems for the island groups not connected with the mainland need frequent long-distance oil and gas supplies, which severely restrict the sustainable development of the islands and will bring continuous harm to the environment. The lack of effective interaction between them greatly affects the permeability of renewable energy and the reliability of the whole system. Thus, the concept of electric storage vessel used to realize the interconnection of energy and resources among the islands is put forward, and the design of multi-type electric storage vessels is given. Based on the electric storage vessels, the architecture of island group energy management system (EMS) is proposed. And then, space-time probabilistic models for the travels and energy demands of electricity storage vessels are established based on the trip chain. Finally, the spatial-temporal distribution of energy demand on different islands is simulated and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. © 2018 IEEE.","Electric storage vessel; Energy demand probabilistic model; Integrated resources supply system; Island group; Trip chain","Chains; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy resources; Sustainable development; Island group; Probabilistic modeling; Storage vessel; Supply system; Trip chains; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053156096

Our purpose is to design a controller such that two targets are achieved: 1) the rational utilization of MTs, FCs, DEGs, BES devices and FES devices; 2) the regulation of the AC bus frequency deviation. Firstly, we consider the modeling of the islanded MG system. Considering the stochastic power change within renewable power generation devices, energy storage (ES) devices and loads, we formulate the system via a group of linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Secondly, we formulate the problem of rationally utilizing MTs, FCs, DEGs and ES devices as the stochastic optimal control (pmbH-2 control) problem, and we formulate the issue of frequency regulation as the stochastic pmbH- control problem. Thirdly, we present a mixed stochastic pmbH-2pmbH- controller via the Nash game approach such that both our aims are achieved.

In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of an ionic liquid, 1-methylimidazolium acetate (MIMOAc), its electrochemical properties and its amenability as dopant in the electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber, a material commonly utilized as separator membrane for energy storage devices. MIMOAc was synthesized via solventless sonochemical reaction involving 1-methylimidazole and acetic acid. The synthesized IL was then analyzed by cyclic voltammetry to determine its electrochemical window, the range in which no visible oxidation and reduction of the material occurs. It was found out that MIMOAc has a wide potential window of 3.6 V rendering it a formidable candidate as electrolyte for supercapacitors. Furthermore, the IL was used as dopant in the electrospinning of PAN solution in the production of fibers. Based from AFM and SEM data, it was observed that the ionic liquid facilitated in the formation of thinner and consistent PAN fibers as compared to the undoped ones. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052364146

Compare to sensible heat storage, LHS has several benefits because of its high energy density, small unit sized and operating at low temperature. This paper is aimed to investigate the melting characteristic of phase change material (PCM) implemented in concentric double pipe heat exchanger. The investigation is carried out by both simulation as well as validation. The simulation is conducted using ANSYS FLUENT with double pipe shape of heat storage. The geometrical shape of the storage is double pipe heat exchanger, the PCM is stored in the inner tube meanwhile hot water is circulated in the outer tube. The dimension of the inner tube are 5 cm of diameter and 50 cm length. The diameter of outer tube is 10 cm and 60 cm length. The hot liquid is circulated from the inlet port and withdrawing from the outer port. The inlet and outlet ports are located away at the distance of 5 cm from the edge of the outer tube. The inlet and outlet ports are constructed at the bottom and upper part of the outer tube. The simulation is carried out at temperature 60°C of the hot liquid and flow rate at 4 liters per minute. The validation is also conducted at the same configuration with that on the simulation. The tweaked parameters are number of mesh and mushy-zone value. Results revealed that validation is numerically accepted at deviation less than 5% for melting time deviation. The validation is obtained at number of mesh is 144,000 and mushy-zone value is 1.4 × 107. On the evaluation of temperature distribution similarity, all of coefficient correlation are obtained greater than 0.8 between simulation and experiment. Being a valid simulation model, it is enabled to be enhanced for predicting melting of phase change materials on the heat energy storage system. © 2018 Author(s).","latent heat storage; melting; PCM; simulation; validation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052386893

At variable weather conditions there will be an instantaneous excess of electrical power that cannot be stored by a conventional battery bank. In recent years, great progress has been made in the development of short term storage units like ultracapacitors, which are capable of absorbing high power pulses within seconds. Another advantage of ultracapacitors is a high number of charge cycles. This article focuses on a hybrid energy storage system consisting of ultracapacitors and a battery bank. Ultracapacitors are used to store temporarily the energy that the batteries are unable to absorb due to the power limit in the charging process caused by their electrochemical properties. Afterwards the energy stored in the capacitors is transferred to the batteries. The article is focused on the optimal battery-to-capacitor ratio. The hypothesis is a storage capacity ratio of 1:1500 in favour of batteries. Simulations on the basis of measured solar and wind production data are made for this purpose. © 2018 IEEE.","AGM batteries; energy storage; ultracapacitors; wind energy","Digital storage; Energy storage; Engineering research; Land vehicle propulsion; Secondary batteries; Supercapacitor; Wind; Wind power; AGM batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Charging process; Conventional batteries; Electrical power; Hybrid energy storage systems; Short term storage; Ultracapacitors; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052542886

However, along with the strong projected increase of electric vehicles, a number of new challenges arise. Especially the continuously rising charge power in combination with an increasing supply by volatile sources result in high loads on the grid, which may cause instabilities and - in the worst case - even blackouts. Within this paper, the possibility of integrating a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) into a photovoltaic-assisted fast-charging station to stabilize the grid is discussed and compared to competing technologies. By introducing energy storage, even with only a low-voltage distribution grid at hand, high charge-power can be provided while at the same time stabilizing the grid. Superior cycle life of the flywheel energy storage, the ability to feed power back into the grid as well as easy transportability are further advantages of FESS for EV fast charging. Several use-cases ranging from the private home user to public transportation are evaluated based on analytical calculations.

One of the core concepts of SDN is the separation of the network's control and data planes. Topology Discovery (TD) is a critical component of any SDN architecture. Due the dynamic nature of WSN, the network topology keeps changing due to the mobility of nodes or the running out of the battery energy. Therefore more packets will be sent to the controller to update the topology and flow table. Such an overhead traffic could negatively affect the efficiency of the network resources, such as energy, channel, memory or storage and processing capability. This phenomenon calls for the development of an efficient TD protocol in SDWSN without compromising the performance of the network such as throughput, network lifetime and latency. In this paper, the possibility of how to increase the efficiency and reduce the control traffic overhead through TD in SDWSN has been discussed. Current SDN controllers use the OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP) as the key protocol for discovering the underlying network topology. OFDP is the protocol used by OpenFlow controllers to discover the underlying topology. However, such discussion on OFDP is not exhaustive and thus a comprehensive survey of the TD for SDWSN becomes necessary. © 2018 IEEE.","OFDP; SDN; SDWSN; Topology Discovery; WSN","Controllers; Digital storage; Industrial electronics; Internet protocols; Topology; Critical component; Discovery protocol; Network topology; OFDP; Processing capability; SDWSN; Topology discovery; Underlying networks; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052367594

But its high computation complexity and high memory complexity makes it hard to be deployed on traditional platforms like CPUs. Memory energy can take up a large part of the system energy, which limits the energy efficiency of CNN processing. The emerging metal-oxide resistive switching random-Access memory (RRAM) has been widely studied because of its good properties like high storage density and the compatibility with CMOS. In this paper, a system level energy analysis of using RRAM as on-chip weight buffer is carried out for a typical CNN accelerator. Hardware and scheduling optimizations are proposed to fully utilize the large RAM and avoid high read/write energy overhead. Experimental results show that RRAM based designs save 12-18% system energy with 15-75% smaller on-chip RAM area compared with SRAM designs. © 2018 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; Hardware Accelerator; RRAM","Complex networks; Convolution; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Logic design; Metals; Neural networks; Program processors; RRAM; Static random access storage; VLSI circuits; Computation complexity; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Hardware accelerators; High storage density; Random access memory; Scheduling optimization; State-of-the-art algorithms; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052103369

This will give rise to power quality issues such as voltage unbalance, voltage fluctuations and harmonics in the distribution systems. It is important to study and quantify the power quality impacts to make sure the healthy operation of the distribution system.

It has two main sources i.e. conventional and non-conventional. The available conventional hydro resource in Sri Lanka has already been harnessed to its maximum economic potential. The nonconventional hydropower generation i.e. mini-hydropower generation is predominantly run of river type. Yet, they are not dispatchable and operate when the flow of water is available. When analyzing the distribution of mini hydro projects, there are a number of locations having the capability of the addition of a storage capacity. It allows the plant to capture a certain amount of water to operate when it is required. This paper presents a comprehensive feasibility analysis of introducing dispatchable mini hydro plants to Sri Lankan power sector through low cost high efficient and environmentally friendly energy solutions.

We formulate the problem into an optimization programming to achieve optimal decisions for energy scheduling and sleep control. To avoid frequent switching, we implement BS sleep mode techniques on a larger timescale by adopting a two-timescale approach. Based on the Lyapunov technique, we further propose a close-to-optimal algorithm which only requires mean price of PG energy in each time frame instead of future information about stochastic inputs (e.g., the amount of RE harvesting and user demand for data traffic). The proposed algorithm can achieve approximately minimal energy cost and ensure the stability of workload and battery virtual queues.

Every message sent can incur a cost in storage, computation, energy and bandwidth. Consequently, reducing the communication costs of distributed applications is highly desirable. The best way to reduce message costs is by communicating without sending any messages whatsoever. This paper initiates a rigorous investigation into the use of silence in synchronous settings, in which processes can fail. We formalize sufficient conditions for information transfer using silence, as well as necessary conditions for particular cases of interest. This allows us to identify message patterns that enable communication through silence. In particular, a pattern called a silent choir is identified, and shown to be central to information transfer via silence in failure-prone systems. The power of the new framework is demonstrated on the atomic commitment problem (AC). A complete characterization of the tradeoff between message complexity and round complexity in the synchronous model with crash failures is provided, in terms of lower bounds and matching protocols. In particular, a new message-optimal AC protocol is designed using silence, in which processes decide in 3 rounds in the common case. This significantly improves on the best previously known message-optimal AC protocol, in which decisions were performed in Θ(n) rounds. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A pyramid ME (Motion Estimation) engine is employed to reduce search complexity. To compensate for the video sequences with fast moving objects, GME (Global Motion Estimation) are introduced to alleviate the effect of limited search range. We also implement an alternative 5×5 search along with 3×3 to boost video quality. For intra mode decision, original pixels, instead of reconstructed ones are used to reduce pipeline stall. The encoder supports DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) and features three operating modes, which helps to reduce power consumption by 25%. Scalable quality that trades encoding quality for power by reducing size of search range and intra prediction candidates, achieves 11.4% power reduction with 3.5% quality degradation. Furthermore, a lossless frame buffer compression is proposed which reduced DDR bandwidth by 49.1% and power consumption by 13.6%.

In many CNN accelerators, their limited on-chip memory capacity causes massive off-chip memory access and leads to very high system energy consumption. Embedded DRAM (eDRAM), with higher density than SRAM, can be used to improve on-chip buffer capacity and reduce off-chip access. However, eDRAM requires periodic refresh to maintain data retention, which costs much energy consumption. Refresh is unnecessary if the data’s lifetime in eDRAM is shorter than the eDRAM’s retention time. Based on this principle, we propose a Retention-Aware Neural Acceleration (RANA) framework for CNN accelerators to save total system energy consumption with refresh-optimized eDRAM. The RANA framework includes three levels of techniques: a retention-aware training method, a hybrid computation pattern and a refresh-optimized eDRAM controller. At the training level, CNN’s error resilience is exploited in training to improve eDRAM’s tolerable retention time. At the scheduling level, RANA assigns each CNN layer with a computation pattern that consumes the lowest energy. At the architecture level, a refresh-optimized eDRAM controller is proposed to alleviate unnecessary refresh operations. We implement an evaluation platform to verify RANA. Owing to the RANA framework, 99.7% eDRAM refresh operations can be removed with negligible performance and accuracy loss. Compared with the conventional SRAM-based CNN accelerator, an eDRAM-based CNN accelerator strengthened by RANA can save 41.7% off-chip memory access and 66.2% system energy consumption, with the same area cost. © 2018 IEEE.","Embedded DRAM (eDRAM); Neural network; Refresh optimization; Retention time","Acceleration; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Neural networks; Static random access storage; Conventional sram; Convolutional neural network; Embedded DRAM; Evaluation platforms; Hybrid computation; Retention time; System energy consumption; Training methods; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055873008

This remarkable rise in energy utilization has become increasingly important for the mobile operators due to the significant economic and environmental aspect. The unavailability of reliable electricity grids push the telecom operators to install diesel generators (DG), which not only increases operational expenditure but also contributes to the considerable amount of carbon footprints. This paper aims to address sustainability of renewable power resources and ecological issues for off-grid cellular BSS.

Thus, the knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the soft clay loam materials present in the bedrock is important. On the basis of the known thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and specific heat of the materials around the energetic needle, one can calculate the time dependency of the heat dissipated and transferred into the surrounding. This allows calculating the temperature maps that can specify in more detail the heat penetration depth during the seasonal storage and pumping out of the heat accumulated during the year seasons. The aim is to optimize the efficiency of the system. The clay loams in the free nature contain high level of the moisture and thus have high values of specific heat. The pulse transient method was used to get the thermophysical parameters of these materials. Specimens were drilled out from the bedrock at depths 50, 150 and 250cm from the surface. The measured values of equilibrium sorption moisture show that obtained materials are very different. In the paper we show the possible influence of the redistribution of water content during the shooting of the heat pulse. The water redistribution deforms the temperature response. This effect was avoided by lowering the heat pulse power to minimal values that still allows the evaluation of the measurement. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050801996

This method will be drastically reduced in the near future due to the recent introduction of European Union directives that include significant restrictions on this practice in favor of alternatives oriented towards material and energy recovery. One of the possible solutions for the use of scrap tire rubber is to incorporate it into concrete, to replace some of the natural aggregate. This paper is aimed at the thermal performance of a lightweight concrete incorporating high volume of crushed waste tires as partial substitution of natural silica aggregate of the same grain size. In order to quantify the effect of waste tires-base aggregate on concrete properties, a reference concrete mix without waste rubber was studied as well. For the applied crushed waste tire rubber, bulk density, matrix density, and particle size distribution were measured. Specific attention was paid to thermal transport and storage properties of waste rubber that were examined in dependence on compaction time. For the developed lightweight concrete, thermal properties were accessed using transient impulse technique, whereas the measurement was done in dependence on moisture content, at the dry state and at the fully water saturated state. Additionally, the investigated thermal properties were plotted as function of porosity and density. Mechanical resistance was also tested. The tested lightweight concrete was found to be an alternative construction material possessing improved thermal insulation function and sufficient mechanical resistance. Furthermore, the environmental advantages caused by reusing used tires and consequently eliminating their disposal should also be taken into consideration. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050794146

In order to develop an effective and efficient IMC platform, the performance, such as density, operation speed and power consumption, of the memory itself is one of the most important keys. In this work, we report a cross-point magnetic random access memory (MRAM) with diode selector for IMC implementation. The memory cell consists of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device and a diode connected in series. The memory cells are arranged in a cross-point array structure, providing high storage density. The MTJ can be switched through the unipolar precessional voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect, thus enabling high speed and low power. Further, Boolean logic functions can be realized via regular memory-like write &amp; read operations. The feasibility and performance of the proposed IMC in the cross-point MRAM are successfully demonstrated with hybrid VCMA-MTJ/CMOS circuit simulations under the 40 nm technology node. * © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cross-point; In-memory computation; MRAM; VCMA","Circuit simulation; Computation theory; Data transfer; Diodes; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic recording; Magnetism; Memory architecture; MRAM devices; Nanotechnology; Random access storage; Semiconductor storage; Tunnel junctions; Bandwidth requirement; Boolean logic functions; Cross point; Cross-point magnetic random access memory; Magnetic tunnel junction; Memory computations; MRAM; VCMA; Magnetic storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060709489

The software package MATLAB version R2015a was used for coding and the derived results were shown graphically. Flat plate solar collector operation with variable solar radiation may be designed using the proposed model that could be utilized for supplying hot water in the industrial and household works having a maximum temperature of 51 and thereby would help in conserving the fossil fuel/electricity maintaining harmony with the environment. The model may be used to predict the temperature of the working fluid that could be raised to its maximum level subject to the local ambient temperature and variable solar radiation. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050735389

The use of ultracapacitor can be found in a machine that need to store high density energy, such as automotive, wind energy powerplant and industry. In automotive, it is used as an energy storage in electrical car and for the engine start-up. Ultra capacitor is also used as the electronic conditioner to improve the quality of power extracted on wind turbine. In industry, it can be used as emergency power supply. In the use of ultracapacitor, aging often occurs in consequence of the increasing temperature that causes the destruction in ultracapacitor. Because of that, a cooling system that is capable to maintain the working temperature, is used. The common one is to use the forced air cooling. In this study, the effect of different volumetric flow rate of the fan and the allowable electric current that the ultracapacitor can withstand are investigated. The ultracapacitors were modeled in three dimensions and simulated by using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes method. The simulation is performed in a steady, segregated manner, with the assumptions of incompressible flow, with various turbulence models. The electrical current loaded in the ultracapacitor was set at the maximum current of 100 Ampere with the variation of Reynolds of 6,000, 12,000 and 24,000. It is shown that the results is slightly sensitive to the turbulence model used. The Reynolds number has significant effect towards the temperature and flow distributions around the ultracapacitors. However, for the given electricity load, the results shows that the maximum temperature around the ultracapacitor exceeds the allowable operating temperature of the ultracapacitor. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050473385

Due to economic of the production and rather simple manufacturing process, the lead-acid battery remains as a feasible type of battery for renewable energy storage application. However, the cycle life of battery is limited to several hundreds of cycles depends on operational conditions. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of depth of discharge (DoD) on the cycle life of a battery which is relevant for battery in renewable energy applications. The battery samples used in the present work were prepared from commercial SLI battery. The sample was cycled in 2 electrode systems at constant current charging and discharging procedure in an Autolab PGSTAT 302 N at different DoD, i.e. 40%, 60%, and 80% for 80 cycles. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize active materials after the cycle life test. The cycle test showed a significant formation of lead sulfate (PbSO4) on the negative and positive electrode and the highest level was found at 80% DoD. The sulfation decreased as DoD was reduced. Excessive lead sulfate (PbSO4) formation was found on the negative electrode at all the DoD regimes. This result indicates that decreasing cycle life of valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) battery is mostly caused by sulfation on the negative electrode. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050457865

In the hierarchical network, cluster heads play an important role in the network. Once being captured, they will expose more keys and information. Therefore, how to choose the cluster head should be considered seriously. However, the existing clustering algorithms only consider energy factor when selecting cluster heads. This paper proposes a model regarding probability of nodes being captured which not only considers the energy factors, but also considers the nodes capture probability when choosing cluster heads, so that nodes which hold smaller capture probability tend to be the cluster heads. On the basis of this model, an efficient key agreement scheme is proposed, which can use EBS (Exclusion Basis Systems) structure to update the group keys between clusters effectively.

A joint operation of wind power with electric vehicles (EVs) or other energy storage devices is helpful to alleviate the negative effects of wind power integration on power systems. The impacts of different operation modes of wind power producer (WPP) and EV aggregator (EVA) on the market equilibrium outcomes are addressed in this paper. First, based on the oligopolistic competition theory, two stochastic equilibrium models of electricity market are proposed. One is for the case where the WPP and EVA bid separately in a non-cooperative mode, the other is for the case where the WPP and EVA form a virtual power plant (VPP) and bid in a cooperative mode to participate in the market competition. In these models, the scenario generation and reduction technique is employed to describe the uncertainty of wind speed. Secondly, the proposed equilibrium models are solved by GAMS software. Then based on the cooperative game theory, the Shapley value method is applied to allocate profits between the WPP and EVA in the VPP. Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify reasonableness and effectiveness of models. Simulation results show that when the WPP and EVA compete in a non-cooperative mode, they play a better role in peak shaving and valley filling in electricity markets.

The impact of electric vehicle charging on the power grid is different from the traditional power load. At the same time, the electric vehicle is also a distributed energy storage device. In the city, large-scale electric vehicles as a charging load, its charging mode has a greater impact on the grid. When a large number of electric vehicles are connected to the power grid, there may be 'peak to peak' phenomenon, increasing the difficulty of power grid peak shaving, and increasing the pressure of power grid construction. This paper analyzes the impact of electric vehicle charging on the power grid, and puts forward the reasonable control of electric vehicle charging and discharging behavior. Establish a reasonable policy mechanism, through the appropriate incentive mechanism to guide the electric car users, to achieve the electric vehicle charging and discharging in reasonable time. For the peak use of electric vehicles, other shaving solutions need to be considered. It is necessary to establish a large number of charging stations, charging piles and other facilities, reasonable arrangement of layout. © 2018 IEEE.","Electric Vehicle; Impact; Power Grid; Utilization",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050866691

PHEV may consume electricity while charging, may supply electricity while discharging, and may serve as a storage to the electric power grid. It is therefore of significant practical interest to coordinate PHEVs with the rest of the grid. Supply demand coordination is an important way to achieve high energy efficiency at the system level while satisfying the stability of the grid and the trip requirement of the PHEVs. This problem is challenging due to the highly uncertainty from both the supply and the demand side in the system, the multiple-stage decision making, the large-scale of the system, the multiple objective functions and constraints involved.

Meanwhile, to increase the efficiency of the power plant, and as well as improve the reliability of electricity supply. The control strategy of the battery energy storage system (BESS) Based on a cascade H-Bridge multilevel converter (CHB-MLC) has been received wide attention since it was proposed. This paper describes a 14.14 kV, 2MW, 1000Ah system with forty-five Li (Lithium)-ion battery units. The system based on a cascaded H-bridge multilevel pulse width modulation (PWM) converter with star configuration focusing on the active power balancing of individual converter cells. The whole control system consists of active power control and state of charge (SOC) balancing control (inter-phase SOC balancing control and phase-phase SOC balancing control), the first one is required to produce the three-phase balanced line to line voltage while the second one is indispensable for effective utilization of the battery energy to manage the SOC value for each battery to avoid the over-charge/over-discharge. The simulation results are obtained using MATLAB/Simulink, the results show the good operational performance of the BESS based on CHB-MLI. Hence, we can conclude that the validity and effectiveness of the control strategy are verified. © 2018 IEEE.","(Lithium)-ion battery; Active power control; Battery energy storage system; Cascade H-bridge multilevel converter; State of charge balancing control","Battery storage; Bridge circuits; Charging (batteries); Lithium batteries; MATLAB; Power control; Power converters; Pulse width modulation; Secondary batteries; Voltage control; Active power control; Battery energy storage systems; Cascade h-bridge multilevel converters; Ion batteries; State of charge; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050398200

The use of wind energy for residential in remote areas that are not connected to the grid is very important. Compared to large-scale wind turbines, small-scale wind turbines are more suitable for residential because they can be integrated with building, easy to assembly and low cost maintenance. One of the most widely used wind turbine technologies is small-scale wind turbines with permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG). To be able to meet household electricity needs, electronic power is needed which plays an important role in wind turbine systems. In this paper the power electronic design for small-scale wind turbine systems is simple, easy to assembly and low cost. The system consists of a 500 watt PMSG, three phase uncontrolled rectifier, buck converter, microcontroller and battery as energy storage. The wind turbine system will charge the battery at a constant voltage. The constant voltage setting to the battery is carried out by the microcontroller through the duty cycle setting sent to the buck converter. Based on the results of the test, the wind turbine system can charge a battery with a constant voltage of 14Volt despite the fluctuations in wind speed and electrical energy produced. © 2018 IEEE.","converter; PMSG; wind energy; wind turbine","Charging (batteries); Costs; DC-DC converters; Electric energy storage; Electric rectifiers; Housing; Information systems; Information use; Microcontrollers; Permanent magnets; Secondary batteries; Synchronous generators; Wind; Wind power; converter; Large scale wind turbines; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; PMSG; Simple power converters; Small scale wind turbines; Uncontrolled rectifiers; Wind turbine technology; Wind turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067133051

Photovoltaic is a component of renewable energy that used sunlight to produce electrical energy. The problem that occurs in photovoltaic is the output power that changes depending of light intensity. That problem causes the output power in the Photovoltaic to supply the load to be unstable due to changes in sunlight The solution of the problem is using the bidirectional converters. The bidirectional converter are currently widely used to store excess power in energy storage system and keep output voltage of the system on stable condition. Therefore this problem requires a good control to be applied to the bidirectional converter. The PID controller can be applied to the bidirectional converter to keep the voltage on the DC bus steady at the set point. Therefore, this paper proposed the performance of bidirectional SEPIC/Zeta converters using PID controller to solve that problem. The experiment result shows the PID controller can keep the DC bus voltage in stable condition. Average time speed to reach set point when charging mode is 1,024 ms with average error is 0,08%.

A preliminary study, for specific cities in the Sub-Sunbelt region, is analyzed in terms of key performance indexes related to renewables production and self-sufficiency. For this, selected cities from the Sub-Sunbelt region (from 35° to 50° latitude north) in Greece, Spain, Romania and Austria have been chosen, by also making a comparison with sunny Sunbelt based cities Rabat and Dubai. The study suggests that high or complete self-sufficiency with solar based renewables is possible in Sub-Sunbelt regions, and that important renewables-based H2/CH4 long-term storage and consumption resources are also needed, while the Sunbelt regions can become exporters of renewables-based H2/CH4 by using their surplus energy during the summer time. © 2018 IEEE.","City; PV; renewable energy sources; self-suffciency; Sub-Sunbelt; Sunbelt","Climate change; Renewable energy resources; City; Electrical energy; Long-term storage; Long-term sustainability; Performance indices; Renewable energy source; self-suffciency; Sun belts; Engineering research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067094485

However, the battery performance degrades gradually due to the SEI growth, li-plating and other irreversible electro-chemical reactions. These inevitable reactions directly influence the reliability of the energy storage system and may further cause catastrophic consequences to the host system. Remaining useful life (RUL) is one of critical indicators to evaluate the battery performance. This paper proposes a battery RUL prediction approach based on a new recurrent neural network (RNN), i.e. the RNN with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The proposed method overcomes the drawback on dealing with long term relationship of RNN. The structure of the RNN-GRU is much simpler which contributes to a higher computational complexity. The experiments based on the NMC lithium-ion battery cycle life testing data are conducted and the results indicate that the mean error of different battery cells are both less than 3% which means the proposed method is accurate and robust for battery RUL predictions. © 2018 IEEE.","gated recurrent unit; Lithium-ion battery; recurrent neural network; remaining useful life prediction","Digital storage; Energy storage; Forecasting; Ions; Maintainability; Recurrent neural networks; Reliability; Catastrophic consequences; Electrochemical reactions; Energy storage components; Energy storage systems; gated recurrent unit; Long-term relationships; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Remaining useful life predictions; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067056037

Due to their various functions such as buffer, energy storage and polarization, springs are playing an increasingly important role in various fields. In the long-term storage process, due to environmental factors such as temperature, the spring will be degraded, manifested as the stress relaxation phenomenon, and the process is that as the storage time increases, the elasticity of the spring slowly declines, and the load capacity slowly decreases, the torque changes while the spring is released. In this paper, the variation of spring torque under different stress is taken as the degradation of the spring, and the reliability analysis of the springs' experimental data based on the degradation distribution is analyzed by using the stochastic process degradation modeling method and the generalized degenerate modeling method respectively.

Existing systems mostly construct wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and incorporate a gateway to bridge the networks with the Internet for remote monitoring. Some work uses sensor nodes, cloud storage and/or IoT platform to create IoT-based monitoring systems. In contrast, the crop monitoring and automation system in this paper uses an IoT cloud-based platform and open APIs to utilize many services available via the Internet. Specifically, low-cost sensor nodes form a cluster-based WSN to save energy consumption and communicate with each other through the platform. Sensed data are shown through a web application for both real-time and historical data displays. If node's power is low, a Line application message is sent to alert the user to replace batteries. A weather API is also used to obtain a weather forecast to reduce water usage. Furthermore, the Google Maps API is used to display node's location, facilitating network maintenance. The evaluation clearly shows that the system can provide real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity and control water valves.

If solar module is dirty the energy generated will also reduce. Therefore, solar module needs to be kept clean. One of the challenges of rooftop PV, the solar module is difficult to clean due to its position on the roof. One solution is to clean the module with the help of cleaning robot. In this study a solar module cleaning robot was developed. The robot must be able to navigate the surface area of solar module thoroughly, cleaning it with a brush, and rinsing it by water spray. The robot shall also be able to send image and video wirelessly and also able to fly to reach the rooftop solar module. At this stage, the robot has been built using servo robot drive, limit switches for navigation, servo brush system, and pump drive. The test results showed that the robot has been able to trace the surface of ASL-M200 solar module and brushing the dirt, and rinsing it with water. Future work is to equip the robot with lifting or flying engine and wireless data communication capabilities so rooftop PV owner can keep their solar module in good and clean condition. © 2018 IEEE.","cleaning; robot; rooftop PV; solar photovoltaic","Cleaning; Digital storage; Environmental technology; Information systems; Information use; Photovoltaic cells; Robots; Solar power generation; Cleaning robot; Energy productions; Limit switches; rooftop PV; Solar module; Solar photovoltaics; Water sprays; Wireless data communication; Solar cell arrays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065971519

Battery safety and reliability are ensured usually by battery management system (BMS). Among various parameters in a BMS, State of Charge (SOC) of Li-Ion cells is a key indicator which represents the ratio of the stored energy in the battery to the total energy that the battery can contain.

First, EKF for estimating SOC of Li-Ion battery is mathematically designed. Then electrical battery model is implemented using Ah counting and EKF in MATLAB/Simulink.

The volatility of renewable energy is increasing along with its installed capacity magnfying, resulting in abandoned wind, light and other issues, impacting renewable energy consumption seriously. In order to solve this problem, trading the abandoned wind and light and using them supply based on power market means under the existing scheduling system can effectively promote the elimination of renewable energy, reduce the consumption of fossil fuels such as coal, and protect the environment. China's renewable energy has been growing rapidly. However, the phenomena of wind and solar power curtailment because of the lack of the peak load regulating capacity in power system, CHP(Combined Heat and Power)operating on the principle of power determined by heat', the mismatch between installed capacity of renewable energy and the demand for electricity, the lack of local consumption capacity, the unbalance between renewable energy power generation and grid construction, and the transmission capacity restrictions, still exist, which brings serious challenge to power system economic operation. The randomness, variability and uncertainty of renewable energy power generation further increase the difficulty of grid connected consumption. To solve the problem of renewable energy consumption, measures should be taken from the aspects of generation, grid, load, storage, power market and other areas. Focusing on the issue of renewable energy consumption, the following research was carried out: considering using the multi-energy complementary strategy improve the ability of renewable energy consumption, the integrated electricity-heat energy system which is coupled by CHP units and power-to-heat equipment is researched and a combined heat and power dispatch considering the energy storage characteristics of the heating network is formulated. In the optimal dispatch model which comprehensively takes into account the complementary characteristics of electrical system and the system-temperature dynamics equation considering transmission delay in the pipelines is used to reflect the energy storage characteristics of the heating network. In addition, the transmission loss in the pipelines, the user flexible demand for thermal energy and other heating network constraints are taken into account in the model. The simulation indicates that the proposed model can coordinate the generation, grid, load in the system and realize optimal matching of heat and power thus improve the renewable energy consumption ability. © 2018 IEEE.","Combined heat and power dispatch; Energy storage of heating network; Renewable energy consumption; Uncertainty","Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Electric energy storage; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Heating; Heating equipment; Pipelines; Power markets; Smart city; Solar energy; Systems engineering; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power dispatches; Complementary characteristics; Coordinated optimization; Energy storage characteristics; Heating network; Renewable energy consumption; Uncertainty; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065895166

Batteries used in storage systems for renewable power can undergo many irregular cycles of charge / discharge. In turn, this can also have a detrimental effect on the life of battery and can increase project costs. To ensure long life span, a good cost and good performance of the system, two embedded energy sharing methods between the energy storage system battery and the auxiliary energy storage system such as supercapacitors is proposed. The supercapacitor guarantees a long cycle life but suffers from a low energy density and high cost. Combining the two storage devices is possible to obtain good compromise in terms of energy density and a long cycle life.

The village under study can stand for most fishing villages of the area of southern Moroccan coastline. Since these villages might not have easy access to the national electricity grid, their energy needs are ensured by highly polluting generators with high energy generation cost in the long term. One of the solutions for decreasing power systems energy cost in these villages is installation of hybrid energy systems. In order to comprehend the viability of such systems, a pilot site was chosen: Lamhiriz, a small village of 4625 inhabitants with an annual consumption of 1.3 GWh. The new power system investigated for Lamhiriz village is diesel-wind hybrid system with electrochemical and thermal storages. First, energy consumption and wind potential of Lamhiriz are presented, then it comes the design of the hybrid system that was approached in two ways: a first configuration of the hybrid system is obtained by economical simulation on HOMER software. In a second step, the sizing problem is solved as an optimization problem where we try to minimize the cost of energy generated by each element of the system in order to meet the electrical demand. Once the optimum sizing obtained, the appropriate energy management is chosen. The GAMS software was used to approach the optimal sizing and energy management. The results found by both HOMER and GAMS are compared in order to see the one meeting the expectations of an optimized system. Energy cost results brought by the optimized hybrid system is compared with energy cost brought by a conventional diesel system. © 2018 IEEE.","Economical simulation; Energy management; Hybrid energy system; Optimization problem; Optimum sizing","Computer software; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy utilization; Fisheries; Hybrid systems; Landforms; Optimization; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Annual consumption; Economic feasibilities; Economical simulation; Energy generations; Feasibility studies; Hybrid energy system; Optimization problems; Optimum sizing; Rural areas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065673822

A residential micro-grid makes it possible to exploit renewable energy sources locally, while optimizing production, consumption and storage in order to participate in the balance of the distribution network. In this paper, an optimal design approach integrating the planning of energy flows and sizing of the elements of a residential micro-grid with storage is developed in order to define the optimum number of PV panels and battery banks capacity. The approach consists in designing architectures and conversion chains adapted to both the integration of decentralized generation, with energy storage, connected or not to a distribution network, while ensuring the intelligent management of energy in this residential city. Then, an adjustment of consumption is obtained by adjusting the daily consumption curve in order to adapt it to production and to maintain the balance between supply and demand. The principle is based on the modulation of the load curve by distributing the consumption during the day in order to avoid consumption peaks during peak periods and the mismatch between consumption and energy availability locally. © 2018 IEEE.","Demand-side management; Distributed energy resource; Load shifting; Residential micro-grid; Smart grid","Demand side management; Economics; Electric load management; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Decentralized generation; Distributed Energy Resources; Intelligent management; Load shifting; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Residential microgrid; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065668203

In fact, many initiatives have been deployed by integrating these sources (e.g. Photovoltaic panel, Wind, Fuel cellâ€¦) in order to increase energy efficiency (i.e., electricity production) in buildings while limiting CO2 emissions. In parallel to this development, micro-grids have emerged as decentralized systems to allow connecting different decentralized sources in which buildings become active electricity producers in addition to the main traditional electric grid. However, a smarter demand response management system is required to efficiently balancing the energy production, storage, and the electricity consumption. In this paper, a demand/response control approach is introduced by integrating into a holistic platform different RES together with storage devices for supplying electricity to buildings equipment (e.g. ventilation system, lightingâ€¦). A prototype was developed and deployed in our EEBLab for experiments and real-testing.

The quasi z source inverter used in this structure make it possible to establish the simultaneous control of the photovoltaic maximum power and real time motor speed regulation. Also, their structures give the opportunity to integrate several storage systems in parallel with the capacitance in the impedance network: For that, the batteries are used to compensate the long time power lack can be occurred in the installation because it has a high energy density. In other hand, supercapacitors are used to improve the battery lifetime and reduce the life cycle cost of the photovoltaic pumping system, hence, they are integrated to reimburse the transitory moments time produced by fast climatic and pump speed variations because it has a high power density and a large cycle life.

The oil storage system charges up fastest, followed by the small pebbles TES and lastly by the large pebbles TES. The fast charging of the oil storage system is due to its lower thermal mass. The small pebbles TES has a lower void fraction as compared to the larger pebbles making its rate of temperature rise faster. Higher charging energy and exergy rates are obtained with the small pebbles TES system. Energy and exergy rates are found to be dependent on temperature differences between the top and the bottom of the storages. Exergy rates are lower than energy rates since they consider heat losses.

HRHPS consists of a PV array and wind turbines (WT) for the production of clean energy. Electrical grid can be utilized as a backup energy source and/or a virtual energy storage system (VESS) as it is the case in building integrated PV systems. This can contribute to reduce the cost of energy storage devices. Energy and hydrogen management strategy (EHMS) is proposed and designed according to the system functionality and the possibility of operating electrolyzer at partial load or steady-power. The main objective of this investigation is to identify the optimal configuration of a grid-tied HRHPS leading to the minimum cost of hydrogen (COH). Three configurations of HRHPS based on both solar PV and wind energy sources, only PV energy source and only wind energy source are examined. Economic optimization is performed based on the method of net present cost (NPC). This method is used to determine the total annual cost (ACT), cost of energy (COE) and cost of hydrogen. These two latter parameters are calculated using the total annual amount of energy and hydrogen produced. In the case study, meteorological data taken from the meteorological and radiometric station of CDER at Algiers and a typical demand profile of hydrogen are utilized. Optimization results reveal that the most cost-effective configuration of HRHPS is based on only PV energy source where the values of COE and COH are 0.42 /kWh and 25.17 /kg, respectively. © 2018 IEEE.","Cost assessment; EHMS; Grid connected; Hydrogen production; NPC; Renewable energy","Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Meteorology; Photovoltaic cells; Wind power; Wind turbines; Backup energy sources; Cost assessment; EHMS; Energy storage systems; Grid-connected; Management strategies; Renewable energies; Renewable hydrogen production; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065636305

The provenance can be encoded through fingerprinting the node IDs along a packet path where the packets are generated, forwarded and/or aggregated. Because WSNs are resource-tightened networks, most of the known provenance schemes applied in WSNs address the issues on how to reduce the provenance size with various compression techniques only. However, reducing the provenance size at a sensor node also costs too much energy. In addition, such schemes did not take the secure and persistant provenance storage for consideration in a long term. To fill the gap, we propose a blockchainbased data provenance scheme (BCP) of compression free, where the provenances are stored distributively on the nodes along the packet path and the BS can retrieve the provenance on demand through a query process. An edge computing based monitor network consisting of high performance nodes (H-nodes) is deployed above or nearby the WSNs, which keeps the WSN's provenance data in a blockchain-based database. The security and authenticity of the provenances are then protected. What's more, the WSN is released from consuming much energy in handling provenance data, which is more superior to all the previous schemes. Both the simulation and experiment results show that our scheme BCP is more energy efficient and secure than those of the known distributed data provenances. © 2018 IEEE.","Blockchain; Provenance; WSN","Blockchain; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Mobile ad hoc networks; Query processing; Sensor nodes; Communication failure; Compression techniques; Data provenance; Distributed data; Energy efficient; Provenance; Secure data; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065336595

Operation of micro hydro requires appropriate control technology. Micro hydro is very suitable for use in areas that are difficult to reach the central power grid. A common problem with micro-hydro systems is the unstable turbine spin, caused by changes in loads from consumers. This causes a change in the frequency fluctuations in the system that can cause damage from the factory side and from the side of the consumer electrical appliances. Therefore, in this research we will discuss the strategy of load frequency control based on Capacitive Energy Storage (CES). CES is a tool that can store energy quickly and release energy in a certain time. In its use required proper adjustment for CES parameters.

These pose critical challenges across the world. The renewable energy sources (RESs) provide a viable and sustainable energy alternative which is capable of meeting the exponential energy growth, reducing over-dependency on fossil fuels as well as minimizing global warming. This paper presents an optimal control and management of an autonomous hybrid energy system (AHES) that reliably supplies energy demand at a minimum daily operating cost. The non-linear cost function is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to optimize the use of renewable resources and minimize the utilization of diesel generator (DG). The unpredictability inherent in RESs is addressed through the optimal design and management of multiple energy generation sources, and battery storage system (BSS). The MINLP optimization technique employed is validated with a dynamic commercial daily load profiles.

Inspired by the rapid projection mechanism of the chameleon tongue, this paper carries out research on the biological structure and projection principle of the chameleon tongue, as well as a bionic mechanical device. Firstly, the biological phenomenon of rapid projection and extension is described and an elastic-energy storage/release mechanism is introduced to explain the projection principle. Based on the inspiration of the elastic-energy storage/release mechanism, an elastic projecting robot with multi-layer elastic nested structure is designed. Then the mechanical kinematic and dynamic analysis is proposed. Reasonable parameters which are based on the mechanical structure parameters are set in the Solidworks motion software for the 3-D model simulation of the robot.

Among all materials, barium titanate materials have been found to be a promising ceramic capacitor dielectric system, like BaTi1-xHfxO3 material and BaTi1-xSnxO3 material. However, to search the optimal composition, mass samples are needed by the traditional method of exhaustion, which increases the cost of work. In order to access the optimal composition of high permittivity efficiently, a machine learning prediction is employed to the searching process in Sn/Ca doped barium titanate ceramics. The machine learning prediction is iteration between theoretical predictions and experiment data. According to our prediction, the searching result shows Ba0.86Ca0.14Ti0.86Sn0.14O3 has the peak values of dielectric permittivity with ϵr=2.0×104 at T=13°C. As a result, sample preparation number reduces to 5.5% compared with the traditional method of exhaustion.

NZEBs are characterized by reduced net-energy demand, since most of their energy needs are met by on-site renewable energy sources, especially photovoltaics (PVs). Consequently, in the following years, a considerable amount of intermittent solar generators will be connected in the electrical grid posing new challenges concerning the secure and reliable grid operation. To effectively address these challenges, the integration of energy storage systems (ESSs) in NZEBs is considered as the most promising solution. Towards this objective, the PV-ESTIA project aims to develop an innovative management scheme for hybrid PV and storage systems in order to promote the use of ESSs in the building environment. In the framework of the project, the proposed management scheme will be tested and validated under real-field conditions at pilot installations placed in the Balkan Mediterranean (Balkan-MED) region. Additionally, the distinct features and functionalities of the proposed scheme will be further evaluated during the project through the development of optimization tools. This paper presents briefly the main activities and the expected outcomes of the PV-ESTIA project, focusing on the conceptual analysis of the foreseen management scheme for hybrid PV and storage systems. Additionally, potential barriers related with the integration of ESSs in buildings at the Balkan-MED region are identified and discussed.

Box 5031, Delft, 2600 GA, Netherlands","The coupling of solar panels and energy storage is inevitable and especially pertinent in places with no access to the electricity grid. This combination must be modular, providing the opportunity to scale up the system if energy demand increases, but also easy to install and user-friendly. These requirements validate the PV-Battery Integrated Module (PBIM) as a potential solution for stand-Alone applications. In this paper, we assess the performance of directly integrating a battery system at the back of a PV panel in comparison to a typical solar home system (SHS) with all the components in a separated manner. The study is carried out using data from a community in the countryside of Stung Treng (Cambodia). First, the optimum battery size and PV panel rating were determined using the loss of load probability metric. Second, the extra PV power losses in the case of (PBIM) were calculated, finding that it is 2.16% less efficient than a normal SHS due to the poorer heat dissipation induced by integrating the converter and batteries at the back of the PV panel. Third, the battery capacity faded by 1% after a year of simulation. Although when compared to a typical SHS PBIM results in slightly higher system losses, the losses are moderated and their impact is minimum when considering the expected benefits derived from using PBIM in SHS. Therefore in this paper, we validate the feasibility of PBIM as a solution for standalone systems in developing countries. © 2018 IEEE.","PV-Battery Integrated Module; Rural Electrification; Solar Home Systems","Developing countries; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy utilization; Loss of load probability; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Battery capacity; Developing world; Electricity grids; Integrated module; Rural electrification; Solar home system; Standalone applications; Standalone systems; Solar buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050242069

An MG-leading inverter (MGLI) incorporating a supercapacitor energy storage system (SC-ESS) coordinates the MG, in both grid-connected and autonomous mode. Focusing on the grid-connected operation, this paper shows that, by the proposed control mechanism, a precise control of the power exchange with the grid can be obtained. An advantage of the proposed control method is that, regardless of the MG operation status, the units supplying the MG (e.g. MG-supporting inverters) operate without changes in their operating mode. Moreover, the proposed control approach ensures the MGLI to take over only transitory loads, which are then distributed among the MG sources capable of sharing the permanent load, this way an increased power reserve is always available to be deployed in case of contingencies that can jeopardize the MG stability. In order to validate the grid-connected operation of the proposed MG, experimental results obtained in laboratory are included in the paper. © 2018 IEEE.","Energy storage; Grid-connected operation; Microgrid; Supercapacitor","Electric inverters; Energy storage; Supercapacitor; Control approach; Control mechanism; Control solutions; Grid-connected operation; Micro grid; Microgrids (MGs); Operation status; Supercapacitor energy storages; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050231676

This stored energy is utilized at night when the majority of the EVs is expected to be charged. Moreover, a Unified Particle Swarm Optimization (UPSO) algorithm is used in order to optimally schedule EVs charging during the night and under different charging modes. This scheduling is implemented under either an assumed continuous charging mode or an intermittent one. The objective function is set to be the optimal voltage profile. A real LV DN with real measured load data is examined. Variations have been taken into account about some EVs' parameters and the results indicate that the voltage profile is significantly improved under the proposed charging schedule by the UPSO. If this charging schedule is combined with efficient exploitation of the BESS stored energy then the improvement is even higher.

The economic viability of different energy storage applications was performed via the use of techno-econometric models. The results show a positive Net Present Value (NPV) for the applications of Excess PV Energy Utilization (EPVU) and Maximum Demand Charge (MDC) reduction. A highly positive NPV emerged from the combination of the two applications for cases where the MDC is applicable. For frequency regulation applications, high NPV arises for systems with power to energy ratios from 1 MW/0.75 MWh to 1 MW/0.5 MWh, although the battery system end up with shorter lifetime as a result of to the high cycling requirements.

The idea emerged as a solution for issues arising from strategies promoting installations of fast charging electric vehicle stations. Short, high power period peaks of fast charging increase the volatility of voltage in distribution networks and result in line congestions, requiring grid reinforcements by the distribution system operator (DSO). Additionally, transmission system operators (TSO) need to treat these power spikes, characterized by uncertainty of occurrence, by ensuring additional system flexibility. Coupling battery storage systems with FCS so that they serve as a buffer between the power system, reducing the stress of fast charging, and the electric vehicle (EV) users, providing the desired comfort in terms of charging speed, create multiple benefits for system participants. The results of the developed optimization model demonstrate that there is a feasible investment case for the proposed concept even in cases where only energy arbitrage is in place.

Although replica technology can increase data availability and improve load balancing, an unreasonable replica management strategy will waste too much storage and increase the energy consuming sharply. In this paper, we developed a replica management strategy based on MOEA/D, in which we take five factors affecting replication decisions into consideration such as system data unavailability, network traffic, disk performance, load balancing and energy consuming. By using the improved MOEA/D algorithm, we get a Pareto solution sets, then an elite selection strategy based on individual density was proposed to pick out the suitable solution from the set. At last, we adjust the replica dynamically depending on the file access record log. Those steps are gathered to form the final strategy: A Replica Management Strategy Based On MOEA/D(MDRMS). Series of experiments are designed to demonstrate the validity and universality of the strategy.

Firstly, the circuit configuration of parallel-connected energy storage system based on centralized control is introduced, and the equivalent model is established. Then the expressions of active and reactive circulating current in parallel system are deduced and analyzed. The result shows that the circulating current is related to the output voltage as well as parallel impedance, and can be suppressed by adjusting the output voltage. Moreover, considering the coupling between active and reactive circulation and the static error of impedance, a current sharing control strategy based on power series decoupling is proposed.

Heat and mass transfer model based on control volume method is developed to evaluate the performance of dehumidifier and regenerator under different operating parameters, especially varying desiccant concentrations. Solution transfer process is described to determine the initial concentrations both in dehumidifier and regenerator after the transfer completed. Simulation study is carried out to compare the air dehumidification rate and solution regeneration rate between conventional ongoing exchange scheme and proposed scheme with batch-wise operation strategy.

Using sensitivity analysis are identified critical nodes and respective share of DG, which causes exceeding of voltage magnitude limit values. Assumptions about negative effect on voltage fluctuations were confirmed at higher penetration levels.

To improve the performance of CNNs on FPGAs, fast algorithms and sparse methods emerge as the most attractive alternatives, which can effectively reduce the complexity of CNNs. Using fast algorithms, the feature maps are transformed to special domain to reduce the arithmetic complexity. On the other hand, compressing CNN models by pruning the unimportant connections reduces both storage and arithmetic complexity. In this paper, we introduce sparse Winograd convolution accelerator (SpWA) combining these two orthogonal approaches on FPGAs. First, we employ a novel dataflow by rearranging the filter layout in Winograd convolution. Then we design an efficient architecture to implement SpWA using line buffer design and Compress-Sparse-Column (CSC) format-based processing element. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to balance the computation among different processing elements.

To ensure battery lifetime, DVFS has become an essential technique in such SoC chips. With continuously decreasing supply level, noise margins in these devices are already being squeezed. During DVFS transition, large current that accompanies the clock speed transition runs into or out of clock networks in a few clock cycles, and induces large Ldi/dt noise, thereby stressing the power delivery network (PDN). Due to the limited area and cost target, adding additional decap to mitigate such noise is usually challenging. A common approach is to gradually introduce/remove the additional clock cycles to increase or reduce the clock frequency in steps, a.k.a., clock skipping. However, such a technique may increase DVFS transition time, and still cannot guarantee minimal noise. In this work, we propose a new noise-aware DVFS sequence optimization technique by formulating a mixed 0/1 programming to resolve the problems of clock skipping sequence optimization. Moreover, the method is also extended to schedule extensive wake-up activities on different clock domains for the same purpose. The results show that we are able to achieve minimal-noise sequence within desired transition time with 53% noise reduction and save more than 15-17% power compared with the traditional approach. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",,"Clocks; Computer aided design; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission; Noise abatement; System-on-chip; Battery lifetime; Internet of Things (IOT); Limited energies; Low-power systems; Power delivery network (PDN); Sequence optimization; Traditional approaches; Transition sequences; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053698074

In fact, these storage devises could handle this issue, which is very complex without taking into consideration actual occupancy and environmental context.

Moreover, the transmission among areas should be properly modelled to better accommodate VG in multiple areas.

Therefore, when analyzing these data with linear and stationary formalism (such as FFT) or a normative base (FFT, Wavelet), signals is introduced that are not part of the original set, and their interpretation is inadequate. So, it is necessary to introduce an adaptive and empirical formalism, which allows analyzing an non stationary and non-linear signal, breaking in sub signals of intrinsic mode (IMF) characterized by its frequency and instantaneous amplitude. The temporal analysis of the frequency is useful because in certain phenomena, the evolution of it gives valuable information on the analyzed system. In the process, the tactile perception associated with the capture of information excites the sensory synapse, activating for approx. 1-2 seconds the sensory memory (SeM) and if a level of 'sufficient attention' is exceeded, the sensory information is encoded and controlled by the working memory (WoM), activating actions of knowledge registration in the synaptic mental form, enabling the process storage of this information, in the long-term memory. In this context, this paper presents the analysis of an EEG signal through the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT), applied to memorization of objects using the tactile sense that is, depriving the individual of vision and hearing. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is developed and the Hilbert spectral analysis is obtained revealing the temporal-frequency energy distribution of phenomena. As a result of this process an activity marker appears that can be associated to the wait (timeout) between the memorization of two objects corresponding to 0.2 sec. The activity marker is located in the second component of signal intrinsic mode (IMF2). When observing the instantaneous frequency, after the subject in study leaves a first object and prepares to receive the second, it is perceived that this frequency varies between 3 and 7 Hz for the channels AF3, F7, F3, FC5 of the left frontal lobe.

Although the plug-in electric vehicle has short mileage, charging inconvenience and other problems, it has real-time visible running state, convenient communication control, two-way control and other advantages to its great potential for development. And the energy internet is the important foundation to solve the future large-scale electric vehicles scattered and incoordination access to the distribution network and resource sharing. Therefore, how to use the energy internet control platform to response the guide of the peak-valley time-of-use (TOU) power price, and then optimizing the electric vehicle access to the grid charging and discharging, and to maximize the potential of electric vehicles energy storage, has important research significance. Based on the analysis of the present situation of the application of electric vehicles in the energy Internet, this paper proposes a cooperative charging algorithm combining the charging current and giving the preferential or compensated price.

Furthermore, most of water heating takes place during peak electricity consumption periods, where electricity costs are highest. In this paper, the optimal energy management of a hybrid solar electric water heater (HSWH) is presented. The hybrid system consists of an indirect flat plate collector coupled to an electric storage tank water heater (ESTWH). The electric resistive element inside the storage tank water heater serves only as an auxiliary heater when solar irradiance is insufficient. A typical medium density household within the Mangaung municipality area in the city of Bloemfontein, South Africa is considered. The aim is to evaluate if an optimal control approach can be used to effectively shift the energy usage profile of the system under the residential Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff enforced by the electricity supplier, while maintaining a comfortable thermal level of the hot water user. The secondary aim is to reduce the energy required to increase the thermal level of the water compared to a baseline water heater. The proposed water heating system with optimal control is modelled and simulated using Matlab OPTI-Toolbox. The control variable was successfully solved with switching taking place during off-peak periods while maintaining the desired temperature of the hot water consumer. © 2018 Cape Peninsula University of technology.","Cost minimization; Flat plate solar collector; hot water storage tank; hybrid solar/electric storage tank water heater modelling; optimization","Costs; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Hot water distribution systems; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Solar collectors; Tanks (containers); Water; Water heaters; Cost minimization; Electric water heaters; Flat-plate collector; Flat-plate solar collectors; Hot water storage tanks; Resistive elements; Storage tank; Water heating systems; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049973696

Low (0.6 L/min) and high (1.7 L/min) flow-rates are used to discharge the oil storage tank. Radial temperature distribution results for both flow-rates show that the temperature slightly increases radially from the tank inner wall to a maximum value which occurs at around 80 mm from the tank inner wall. After this increment, the temperature decreases as the radial distance increases. The higher flow-rate eliminates the initial radial temperature rise at the bottom of the storage tank seen with the low flow-rate due an increase in the axial heat transfer rate. Radial stratification number profiles show that radial thermal energy flow increases as the fluid flows down axially from the top to the bottom of the storage tank. The higher flow-rate results in more axial thermal heat transfer at the expense of increasing radial thermal energy dispersion in the middle and bottom sections of the storage tank. © 2018 Cape Peninsula University of technology.","discharging; domestic; oil storage tank; radial; thermal stratification","Flow rate; Heat transfer; Thermal energy; Thermal stratification; discharging; domestic; Oil storage tank; radial; Radial temperature distribution; Temperature decrease; Thermal characteristics; Thermal energy flow; Tanks (containers)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049936754

Different paraffin waxes (Ributherm RT25, RT 28, and RT35) have been used as PCMs because of their high energy storage density, availability and relatively low cost. A series of experiments were conducted to test the rate of heat absorption and release of the paraffin waxes. Results indicate that the heat transfer stored using PCMs is dependent on the circulation flow rate of the water in the helical coiled tube.

The focus is to design cost-effective hybrid microgrid system with renewable source such as wind combined hydrogen based storage system. The proposed system uses wind turbine for producing power which will meet out the demand. An electrolyser absorbs the excess power from the wind turbine. If there is excess hydrogen from electrolyser, the hydrogen tank stores the excess hydrogen. When power demand is not met by wind, power to the grid is supplied by fuel cell. Diesel generators(DG) are used to support the system when the demand is not met by fuel cell. Assumed that, wind turbine power is free of cost. When rated power is below the actual power, the DG picks up to provide power support to the system. © 2018 IEEE.","Economic Dispatch; Particle Swarm Optimization; Renewable Energy","Cost effectiveness; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power control; Scheduling; Wind turbines; Diesel generators; Economic Dispatch; Excess hydrogen; Hybrid microgrid; Renewable energies; Renewable generation; Renewable sources; Wind turbine power; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049954675

In addition, the inclusion of deferrable loads introduces integer decision variables to the problem formulation. Consequently, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer dynamic optimization problem in the case of the grid-connected mode of operation. In order to solve the problem, a powerful variant of the particle swarm optimization algorithm known as the random drift particle swarm optimization is adapted in this paper. The results of applying this variant have been compared with those of two state of the art optimization techniques, namely the particle swarm optimization and the differential evolution algorithm.

Hydro-power energy has been selected as an alternative source of energy that is sustainable, functional and economically feasible. A hydro-power plant was designed to provide electricity to a mid-size farm that requires 50 kW power. The hydro-power power plant was designed using micro-Pelton wheel turbines and a pumped-storage reservoir as a water energy source due to the lack of water dams and river streams in UAE. The design focus of the hydro-power was on the turbine section of the plant that consists of a unique blade shape of turbine bucket that was able to extract maximum energy from the water flow. To verify on the functionality of the hydro-power plant, theoretical calculations have been done to determine the output electrical power and the overall efficiency, which have been obtained to be 47.2 kW and 80% respectively. This indicates the designed micro-Pelton wheel turbines are able to produce the required energy of the farm with a high overall efficiency.

Globally, such reserves are usually supplied by thermal generation sources, which incur no-load running costs due to mechanical and electrical losses. To avoid these losses, a generator should be maintained at rest. When the system is triggered, the generator must then be rapidly accelerated and connected to the power network.

In case of contingent events, fast instantaneous reserve systems should be employed in order to restore the frequency. One of the promising solutions is the use of rapidly accelerated synchronous generators with hydraulic drive-trains. They are driven by energy from compressed gas in pneumo-hydraulic accumulators. To reduce the cost of recharging, nitrogen which is used in these accumulators, can be replaced with air. However, this has the potential to create a dangerous flammable mix of air and mineral oil within the accumulator.

We describe the various properties of energy storage devices and, for each, we highlight the requirements to be met for environment monitoring applications, especially in remote areas in Africa. We evaluate the performance of some of these energy storage options against the requirements using three use cases. We indicate the technologies that have shown reliability for each use case.

One group discharge the energy-storage capacitors to the load and the other group discharges the energy stored in the parasitic capacitor of the capacitive load so as to chop off the slow tailing of pulses. Therefore, two independent drive circuits are required for these pulse generators. In this paper, a novel drive circuit combined with time-delay circuits, which can drive many different groups of switches with only one drive circuit, is propos ed. Using magnetic transformers with common primary winding, many synchronized driving signals can be generated.

For fast processing of big data, block device drivers have been developed for NVM such that traditional file systems (e.g., EXT4) operated on non-volatile main memory. However, the existing block driver blindly caches pages, which incurs unnecessary access delays. To overcome this drawback, this paper develops a novel block device driver, called NVMBD, for byte-addressable non-volatile main memory. It adopts two methods of processing block I/O requests, i.e., traditional block I/O and BMAP. On the one hand, traditional block I/O reads/writes 512B sectors with multiple load/store instructions. On the other hand, BMAP inserts NVM pages into the page cache tree when processing block I/O requests, which removes the page movement between the page cache and the NVM. BMAP involves in the management of page cache, but it is transparent to file systems. BMAP provides file systems with the DAX-like feature, improving the file system performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the developed block device driver significantly improves the file access performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Block device driver; File systems; Non-volatile main memory; Storage","Big data; Data handling; Energy storage; File organization; Block devices; Fast Processing; File systems; Multiple load/store; Non-volatile main memory; Non-volatile memory technology; Page movements; Phase change memory (pcm); Phase change memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048377443

For CNN's acceleration, exploiting the data reuse of CNNs is an effective way to reduce bandwidth and energy consumption. Row-stationary (RS) dataflow of Eyeriss is one of the most energy-efficient state-of-the-art hardware architectures, but has redundant storage usage and data access, so the data reuse has not been fully exploited. It also requires complex control and is intrinsically unable to skip over zero-valued inputs in timing. In this paper, we present COSY (CNN on Systolic Array), an energy-efficient hardware architecture based on the systolic array for CNNs. COSY adopts the method of systolic array to achieve the storage sharing between processing elements (PEs) in RS dataflow at the RF level, which reduces low-level energy consumption and on-chip storage. Multiple COSY arrays sharing the same storage can execute multiple 2-D convolutions in parallel, further increasing the data reuse in the low-level storage and improving throughput. To compare the energy consumption of COSY and Eyeriss running actual CNN models, we build a process-based energy consumption evaluation system according to the hardware storage hierarchy.

The network edge devices with computation, communication and storage capabilities can be applied to cache popular resource in close proximity to end uses and directly distribute resource to them, which is a promising solution to provide enhanced service. Firstly, in order to respond to the users' access requests at the edge of network, the distributed resource distribution network (DRDN) is constructed to realize the quick query, positioning and distribution of resource. It mainly consists of network elements: NEF (Network Exposure Function) node for global management and MEC nodes for distribution service. Secondly, on the basis of DRDN, two kinds of MEC's service models of distributing resource are defined and classified, the total energy consumption and average service delay for distributing resource to end users are analyzed. Finally, for the heavy access load and high latency of root caching MEC node, a hierarchical caching scheme (HCS) is designed and a caching node selection algorithm based on fuzzy C-means clustering is proposed according to the location characteristics of end users. The simulation results show that the HCS can save a lot of energy and reduce the average service delay. Additionally, for the different total arrival rate of users' access requests, the change of average service delay is stable with good adaptability in the HCS. © 2017 IEEE.","Caching resource; Distribution energy consumption; Fuzzy C means clustering; Mobile edge computing; Service delay","Digital storage; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Fuzzy systems; Query processing; Smartphones; Caching resource; Distributed resources; Distribution services; Fuzzy C means clustering; Mobile Edge Computing; Node selection algorithms; Service delays; Total energy consumption; Green computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048355874

In this context, understanding the energy consumption of operations on data-structures is crucial when optimizing software to execute under power constricted environments. Existing studies have not focused on the different components of energy consumption that processors expose, rather considering the global consumption. To understand the relationship between CPU and memory energy consumptions with execution time, we instrument a microbenchmark suite to collect such values, and we analyze the results. Our benchmark suite is comprised of 16 implementations of functional sequences, collections and associative collections while measuring detailed energy and time metrics. We further investigate the energy consumption impact of using different compilation optimizations. We have concluded that energy consumption is directly proportional to execution time. Additionally, DRAM and Package energy consumptions are directly proportional, with the DRAM representing between 15 and 31% of the total energy consumption. Finally, we also conclude that optimizations can have both a positive or a negative impact on energy consumption. © 2018 ACM.","data structures; energy consumption; functional programming; Haskell","Data structures; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Functional programming; Software engineering; Benchmark suites; Energy efficient; Environmental consequences; Functional sequences; Global consumption; Haskell; Structure evaluations; Total energy consumption; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051250960

The purpose of this study is to optimize the heat transfer to degrease the cooling time and recommend a technologic innovation to realize this purpose without altering the quality of this product. First the different production processes are analyzed. The decrease of the shear stress with time indicates that this fluid is non-Newtonian and has to be characterized. The rheological behavior of this fluid is determined by a series of viscosimetric measurements, at different shear rates (30 to 400 s-1), and at different temperatures in the range (20° C to 80 °C), representing the stress and temperature conditions recorded during production, storage and packaging cycles of this product. Experimental results show that the nature of the fluid is pseudo-plastic with flow behavior index n&lt;1 and follow the power law model, with the influence of temperature on flow consistency index K. A thermo-dependent model is given to express this rheological parameters and viscosity of this fluid as a function of temperature, valid for the fluid temperature between 20 to 80 °C. This rheological model is used to achieve the heat transfer simulation in the industrial stirred tank with an anchor impeller mixing. Simulation results shows that the cooling time by mixing can be the quarter by reducing the stirring speed to 125 rpm, and decreasing the coolant temperature to 20°C and therefore reduce energy consumption. A technologic integration of a natural cooling thermo-siphon devise outside the process is proposed to afford a cooling fluid below 20°C. © 2018 Author(s).","Energy efficiency; heat transfer; optimization; pseudo-plastic; simulation; thermo-dependent model",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050778693

Being a fundamental part of national economies, the business models and the operating regulatory structures have been the subject of intense research and experimentation. At the same time, the increasing integration of distributed energy resources to the microgrid level changes the dependence of the grid infrastructure from fossil and nuclear to renewable energy sources, smart storage and smart management. In this paper, it is argued that this shift which marks the transformation towards the next industrial era, puts in the market foreground a big number of smaller producers and ultimately all the end users, in the form of actively engaged prosumers. Furthermore, it is shown that the computational resources and technology to support an open, widely accessible and fair peer-to-peer trading market, are already available.

It is believed that substitution of EVs for conventional fuel vehicles can help reduce the greenhouse gases emission, increase the energy efficiency, enhance the integration of renewable energy, and so forth. These advantages originate from the double role of the electrical vehicle's battery. Thus, it may constitute firstly a controllable load that we are able to optimally control at convenient time frames and secondly, it may store and inject energy, acting as a storage device. Nowadays, a number of EVs use power grids around the world to charge and discharge their batteries. Smart Microgrids (SMs) seem to be the best solution for the management of modern Low Voltage (LV) grids with Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and EVs. Among these technologies, EVs pose both a risk by increasing the peak load as well as an opportunity for the existing energy management systems by charging and discharging electricity with the help of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. The key to the implementation of V2G is how to effectively integrate information into energy conversion, transmission and distribution. V2G should be carried out within the framework of SM, so that the status information of power grid can be perceived. In this paper, a Low Voltage (LV) SM derived from an interconnection bus is considered which is characterized by the presence of DERs units and EVs. Firstly, an overview of plug in EV technologies is examined and then the main purpose of the paper is to investigate the effects of V2G charging and discharging strategies in a SM. With EVs and absence of DERs is considered as the base case. For each scenario, two different charging technologies are examined (Dump Charging and V2G) in terms of operational cost.

The porous medium has been integrated with different thickness to show the influence of the medium thickness on the thermal performance of solar dryer. Different kinds of materials have been tested and studied. The effect of porosity of porous medium has been studied. The obtained results showed that the temperature of drying air is increased by 4°C with integration of porous medium. The increasing in the thickness of the porous medium by 1cm leads to increase the temperature of drying air by 2°C.

However, most of them are purely theoretical studies without real experiments. In realistic application scenarios, there can be a variety of factors that can impact the effectiveness of the energy efficient model. In this paper, a new energy efficient storage system for astronomical observation data called MCS-B is designed, which uses multi-level caching strategy and block replacement strategy. According to the manner of astronomical data access, MCS-B uses LB (logical blocks) to cluster correlated files and places them on the data disk via a temporal and spatial pattern. We further design a specialized prefetching and caching strategy to create larger disk idle time intervals so that the disks that are not in use within a certain time will be powered down. Experimental results show that MCS-B outperforms existing traditional energy efficient schemes in the energy consumption by 34.24% up to 42.39%.

However, the assumptions made for previous well-established cache design might not hold anymore The previous well-established cache design, however, is inefficient in terms of energy since it assumes that memory is DRAM with symmetric read/write power as working memory other than persistent storage. To mitigate this issue, we propose two techniques, asymmetry-Aware cache filling and locality-Aware cache flushing.

NVM provides data persistence that data written into NVM will not be lost during unexpected system failure occurs. Data persistence is mandatory for programs such as file system and database. However, traditional memory protocol cannot provide an mechanism for programs to guarantee data persistence because the write instructions do not ensure that data would be eventually written into the memory media. Furthermore, extra global operations such as PCOMMIT for data committing could incur significant performance loss, especially for multi-Task programs. To address this issue, we propose a hardware-software coordinated mechanism to achieve low-overhead data committing. Write queues in memory controller are divided into multiple sub-queues for monitoring write commands for different address ranges. Programs can query write queues to check the execution status of previous written commands through a series of OS-managed library APIs. Fine-grained data committing can reduce the interferences among processes effectively. Extensive evaluations show that per-Task data committing brings an average 1.78x performance improvement than original global committing mechanism and accelerates the data committing by 2.07 times. © 2017 IEEE.","Data committing; Non Volatile Memory; Persistent memory","Energy efficiency; Nonvolatile storage; Query processing; Queueing theory; Systems engineering; Ubiquitous computing; Coordinated mechanisms; Data committing; Global operations; Memory controller; Non-volatile memory; Performance improvements; Performance loss; Persistent memory; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048355844

An effective way to alleviate this problem is to provide resource capacity on demand. However, it is challenging to match the offered resource capacity with the real system workloads, thus resulting a violation of service level agreement. This paper proposes a QoS-oriented capacity provisioning mechanism by leveraging queueing theory. Based on workload features, the mechanism selects a suitable queueing model to represent the pattern of current workloads. In accordance with the model, our mechanism can well forecast the actual resource capacity demand without violating the service level agreement, and then offer the required resource capacity in terms of the real workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the energy consumption of a typical storage cluster, while meeting the QoS requirements. It also significantly outperforms two classic and two state-of-The-Art capacity provisioning mechanisms. © 2017 IEEE.","Capacity provisioning; Energy efficient; QoS; SLA; Storage cluster","Computation theory; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Queueing theory; Ubiquitous computing; Capacity provisioning; Energy efficient; QoS requirements; Queueing model; Real workloads; Resource capacity; Service Level Agreements; Workload patterns; Quality of service",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038562736

An islanded Microgrid is subjected to many disturbances throughout the day e.g. load profile and power generation changes. The case gets even worse when this small grid is exclusively driven by renewable sources such as wind and power; which are dependent on wind speed and sun radiation.

One of the application areas is off-grid distributed generation, where solar photovoltaics-energy storage systems are used to power remote facilities with small electrical loads. Since energy storage costs dominate the overall system costs, effective utilization of energy storage is essential. To reduce life cycle costing, and to maximize the system reliability, requires not only accurate system design but also optimum operational efficiency. To run the plant at optimum levels requires effective power flow and a load management mechanism to sustain power demand effectively. For off-grid solar photovoltaics-energy storage systems, both power supply and power demand behaviors are independent and nonlinear, which creates operational and modelling complexities. In this paper, only one side of the equation, the prediction of power demand, will be studied by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As a case study, remote oil & gas facility electrical load is considered, using several multi-layer neural network prediction models to evaluate forecasted load demand accuracy.

However, a rapid growth of the dynamic and stand-by power due to transistor leakages becomes a pressing issue. A promising way to slow down this trend is to introduce non-volatility. The development of an electrically addressable non-volatile memory combining high speed and high endurance is essential to achieve these goals. It is particularly promising to employ non-volatility in IoT and automotive applications, as well as in the main computer memory as a replacement of conventional volatile CMOS-based DRAM. To further reduce the energy consumption, it is essential to replace SRAM in modern hierarchical multi-level processor memory structure with a non-volatile memory technology. The spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) combines non-volatility, high speed, and high endurance and is thus suitable for applications in caches. However, its development is still hindered by relatively high switching currents. Several paths to reduce the switching current in an in-plane SOT-MRAM structure are analyzed. The switching by means of two orthogonal current pulses complemented with an interface-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy allows reducing the switching current significantly for achieving sub-500ps switching. © 2018 IEEE.","in-plane MTJ; MRAM; perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Spin-orbit torque; switching","Cache memory; CMOS integrated circuits; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic recording; Magnetism; Metals; MOS devices; MRAM devices; Nonvolatile storage; Oxide semiconductors; Static random access storage; Switching; Automotive applications; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Magnetic random access memory; MRAM; Non-volatile memory; Non-volatile memory technology; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Spin orbits; Magnetic storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050912558

The energy content of sustainable woody biomass resources can be maximized through drying. On the other hand, there is an urgent need for low-cost energy storage applications, related to solar energy in particular. Biomass dried with solar energy could serve as a seasonal energy storage. It also improves the quality of biomass and helps preserve its quality. In order to study the technology and economy of solar enhanced drying, several drying experiments were conducted on wood chips and on hog fuel made from recycled wood in VTT’s convective dryer in Jyväskylä. VTT’s experiments show that solar heat energy can be successfully applied to thermal drying of biomass. The moderate drying temperatures achieved are advantageous for ensuring homogenous drying of wood particles and for preventing changes to the physical structure of the biomass and loss of volatiles. Due to the low efficiency of the system, still in its prototype phase, the calculated payback times were not highly attractive to the entrepreneur. The best experiment with drying seasoned wood resulted in the shortest payback time (22 years). With technical improvements and a better design, however, the efficiency of the dryer could be improved significantly. Our calculations show that if most of the heat could be utilized for evaporation, the payback time would be brought below 10 years. © 2018 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Biomass drying; Solar energy; Wood chips",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051043791

This potential energy source is usually burnt off in many rice industries to create space by farms that are in dire need of thermal energy for air and water heating as well as for electricity generation. A simple energy efficient rice husk fired stove was developed for space and water heating as well as for cooking. The stove consisted of three closed concentric cast iron cylinders with the innermost being the combustion chamber that supplies heat directly onto a cooking cast iron plate. Waste heat from the innermost cylinder is extracted from the second cylinder using a forced convection 12 volt powered compressor and transferred to the heating space. A stainless steel heat exchanger brings in cold water into the combustion chamber and conveys warm water away from the stove to a storage tank. The outermost cylinder is heavily lagged to prevent heat losses. Rice husk is introduced into the innermost cylinder through a rectangular supply port that has a cover. The inner most cylinder has a grate under for ash exit and an exhaust pipe for smoke exit. Preliminary tests indicated that complete combustion of 1 kg of rice husk with calorific value of 12.6 MJ in the furnace of the stove took 30 minutes. The heat transfer through the cooking plate, the heat exchanger by water and air were 25513.33 J/s, 11486.45 J/s, and 10235.32 J/s respectively. Over 140g of the rice husk supplied 1.75 MJ of heat to the 3 sections. The maximum temperature reached in the furnace was 556.5 °C. The temperatures of the hot air and water from the stove rose up 116.5 °C and 105°C respectively. The burning rate of the husk in the furnace was 1.6 kg/hr. No pre-mechanical treatment of rice husk is required for the stove to function properly. © 2018 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Agricultural waste; Biomass stoves; Rice husk; Space heating; Water heating",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051022230

The forest chip supply chain is modeled using a simulation tool to estimate the effect of fuel quality enhancement on the competitiveness of forest chips as feedstock. At the moment some tentative results are available, as the collection of data is still ongoing. However, the continuous measurement method is expected to reduce unwanted variation in fuel quality as fuel suppliers are able to react faster to feedback on fuel quality.

However, successful coordination of electric vehicles and renewable energy systems require accurate state estimations of EVs such as state of charge (SoC) due to intermittent renewable energy output.

Achieving thermal comfort with minimum energy consumption is the main concern for innovative designing of an air conditioning system. The A/C system is the chief contributor to energy consumption in hot and humid areas. An innovative design of an A/C operating system is essential to satisfy a high thermal performance and maintain the desired thermal comfort level. The aim of this work was to experiment the thermal performance and the energy consumptions of A/C units for two identical houses located in the Dhahran area of Saudi Arabia. In this case, the experiment work for both houses has been conducted incorporating two different air-conditioning systems. These include a conventional ON/OFF cycle A/C system and a variable frequency drive (VFD) A/C system. LabView platform with the data acquisition has been utilized for the experimental work to monitor the actual climate and power consumption. The analyses pertain to the assessment of energy consumptions and energy savings. The variable frequency drive controller provides higher efficiency and lower cost of A/C systems. Consequently, comparing the behavior of the energy consumption for both A/C units shows a clear and strong correlation between them. © 2018 IEEE.","Air-Conditioning; Energy Consumption; Energy Savings; ON/OFF A/C; Variable Frequency Drives VFD","Air conditioning; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Thermal comfort; Variable speed drives; Experimental investigations; Higher efficiency; Minimum energy consumption; ON/OFF A/C; Strong correlation; Thermal comfort level; Thermal Performance; Variable frequency drives; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046962305

The Ising chip, expressing the behavior of magnetic spin systems with CMOS circuit, can efficiently support such operations. On the Ising chip, the state search can be carried out for all the spins in parallel. As the Ising chip is mainly SRAM based architecture, we propose Ising memory that enhancing the traditional memory with Ising ability, which can be easily integrated into Von Neumann architecture for both traditional data storage and efficiently solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, due to the non-memory logic for state search operations, directly integrating Ising ability into traditional memory would introduce additional 2× area overhead. To solve this problem, we propose pre-calculating structure to reduce the complexity of the state search circuit. Our proposal helps to reduce the non-memory area overhead to about 0.9× of the traditional memory. Moreover, we have physically designed an Ising memory and tested it with image segmentation problems. Our Ising memory can accelerate the segmenting processing by 26000× with only 0.0001‰ energy consumption.

Spin Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) has negligible leakage power, fast access speed, high integration density and non-volatility. Therefore, it is a promising candidate for the last level cache design. However, it suffers from high write energy and slow write speed. In the paper, we observe that the traditional cache replacement policy is not optimal when applied to STT-MRAM from the energy consumption perspective. So we propose a novel write energy aware cache replacement policy, which utilizes a MinHash function to identify the similarities between the cache line to be written back and candidates for the replacement. The cache line with the highest similarity is chosen as the victim. In addition, we propose a new metric for cache replacement considering both performance and write energy to improve the replacement policy further. The experimental results show that our proposed policy can reduce write energy by 33.6% on average compared to the state-of-the-art Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy with only 0.5% performance penalty and negligible hardware overhead. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Cache memory; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Magnetic leakage; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Power management; Random access storage; Cache replacement policy; Hardware overheads; High integration density; Least recently used; Magnetic random access memory; Performance penalties; Processor performance; Spin torque transfer; MRAM devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057095951

Basically, major converter losses are reduced in this system. In acquiring a highly efficient power supply, the charge controller plays an important role. When a DC microgrid powers DC loads based on a renewable source such as a PV system; energy storage becomes mandatory due to fluctuating nature of the source. Localized DC-energy storage within DC-DC converters could address this requirement. A variation of supercapacitor assisted regulators could provide localized energy storage with low-noise and fast transient response [1]. 12 V LED lights will be powered from this system. LEDs can be powered directly via a supercapacitor bank from the regulated Photovoltaic energy. In the case of Inverter type Air Conditioner, in order to overcome converter losses, the DC Bus inside it should be accessed. Typically, DC Bus voltage inside the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is 1-414 times the supply voltage. Hence DC-DC Converters are used to power up the inside circuitry of the Inverter Air Conditioner from the solar panel. In order to optimize the energy usage and reduce electricity consumption, light dimming and air conditioning control systems were added to control the light intensity and switching of the air conditioner. © 2018 IEEE.","Air Conditioning Control System; Arduino Microcontroller; Fuzzy Logic Control; Light Dimming System; Microgrid; Power Switching System; Pulse Width Modulation; Supercapacitor","Air conditioning; Control systems; Controllers; Design; Domestic appliances; Electric energy storage; Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Electric power systems; Electric rectifiers; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Industrial electronics; Light emitting diodes; Pulse width modulation; Solar energy; Supercapacitor; Transient analysis; Uninterruptible power systems; Variable speed drives; Voltage control; Air conditioning control systems; Arduino; Dimming systems; Fuzzy logic control; Micro grid; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048840812

Using DC at home and DC-microgrids are relatively new concepts proposed to overcome the problems with energy efficiency. DC-microgrids are local energy networks which consist of renewable energy sources and storage systems. In many modern white goods, typically advertised as inverter driven, there is an AC-DC converter in the power drive train starting from AC 230V, 50Hz. Most domestic white goods, including energy efficient lighting are internally DC-driven and based on multiple DC-DC converters. Overall efficiency of a domestic appliance is determined by the multiplication of the efficiencies in each conversion stage. If the first stage of AC-DC conversion is not used, by feeding it from a DC source such as solar energy, end-To-end efficiency (ETEE) will be increased. Energy engineers are now getting ready to use DC-microgrid techniques. In this project where LED lighting loads are to be fed by solar or other renewable energy DC sources, 12V LED lighting is an excellent starting point, since LED lamps operate from plus or minus DC sources of widely varying DC values. We are developing a new technique, Supercapacitor Assisted LED (SCALED) lighting system powered by DC bus fed directly from solar panels, in which a supercapacitor (SC) bank is to be used to buffer short-Term energy supply interruptions.

However, they suffer from limited write endurance and high write energy consumption. Encoding methods such as Flip-N-Write, FlipMin and CAFO can reduce the bit flips of NVMs by exploiting additional capacity to store the tag bits of encoding methods. The effects of encoding methods are limited by the capacity overhead of the tag bits. In this paper, we propose COE to COmpress cacheline for Extending the lifetime of NVMs. COE exploits the space saved by compression to store the tag bits of data encoding methods. Through combining data compression techniques with data encoding methods, COE can reduce the bit flips with negligible capacity overhead. We further observe that the saved space size of each compressed cacheline varies, and different encoding methods have different tradeoffs between capacity overhead and effects.

The CNN methods consume more computation as well as storage, so GPU is introduced for real-time object detection. However, due to the high power consumption of GPU, it is difficult to adopt GPU in mobile applications like automatic driving. The previous work proposes some optimizing techniques to lower the power consumption of object detection on mobile GPU or FPGA. In the first Low-Power Image Recognition Challenge (LPIRC), our system achieved the best result with mAP/Energy on mobile GPU platforms.

However, PCM also suffers from high write latency and energy consumption. To mitigate the write overhead of PCM-based main memory, we propose a Fine-grained Dirtiness Aware (FDA) last-level cache (LLC) victimization scheme. The key idea of FDA is to preferentially evict cachelines with fewer dirty words when victimizing dirty cachelines. The modified word is defined to be dirty. FDA exploits two key observations. First, the write service time of a cacheline is proportional to the number of dirty words. Second, a cacheline with fewer dirty words has the same or lower reference frequency compared with other dirty cachelines. Therefore, evicting cachelines with fewer dirty words can reduce the write service time of cachelines and will not increase the miss rate. To reduce the write service time of cachelines, FDA evicts the cacheline with the fewest dirty words when victimizing dirty cachelines. We also present FDARP to decrease the miss rate by further synergizing the number of dirty words with Re-reference Prediction Value. Experimental results show that FDA (FDARP) can improve the IPC performance by 8.3% (14.8%), decrease the write service time of cachelines by 37.0% (36.3%) and reduce write energy consumption of PCM by 27.0% (32.5%) under the mixed benchmarks. © 2018 EDAA.",,"Benchmarking; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Phase change memory; Dram memory; Fine grained; Lastlevel caches (LLC); Modified words; Nonvolatility; Phase change memory (pcm); Reference frequency; Service time; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048753030

The emerging metal-oxide resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) and ReRAM crossbar have shown great potential in providing the energy-efficient memory module. However, the performance of ReRAMs suffers from data access patterns with poor locality and large amounts of written data, which are common in graph processing. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Vertex-Edge memory hierarchy, HyVE, to avoid random access and data written to ReRAM modules. With data allocation and scheduling over vertices and edges, HyVE reduces memory energy consumption by 69% compared with conventional memory system in graph processing.

The cascaded H-bridge multilevel topology enables independent DC voltage control for each PV panel or string to meet the requirements of distributed maximum power point tracking, which reduces the efficiency loss caused by panel mismatch and unequal sheltering. But as the total power of distributed grid-connected photovoltaic inverter increases, the power fluctuation brought by those photovoltaic systems will become serious and even affect the stability of the grid. To alleviate this problem, a supercapacitor cell is added to the inverter. It not only smooths the PV inverter's output power fluctuation, but also increases the inverter's output level. For the coordination of these two kinds of cells, a control strategy is proposed, in which all cascaded PV cells only output active power, and the supercapacitor cell undertakes the reactive active power and compensates the active power fluctuations.

This problem can be addressed by a proper energy storage system that allows increasing the utilization of the generators. This paper proposes the use of a Quadruple Active Bridge (QAB) converter, already adopted in other fields, to interfaces different storage technologies to the aircraft DC bus. This solution would replace multiple DC/DC converters, increasing the power density, but presents difficulty in the power flow control and in the possible efficiency deterioration in the case of asymmetrical operation. A novel control, based on current feed-forward and power decoupling is proposed to this aim and simulations shows the effectiveness of the solution. A laboratory prototype is used to confirm that the asymmetrical operation, where each port processes a different amount of power, does not imply a marked reduction of efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Electric load flow; Electric vehicles; Power electronics; Bridge converter; Electric systems; Electrical power distribution systems; Electrical subsystems; Energy storage systems; More electric aircraft; Power flow controls; Storage technology; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046948250

However, the MMC control strategies still inherit from traditional two-level voltage source converter, in which the DC voltage regulation relies on an AC current control loop. In this paper, according to the specific energy storage characteristic of the MMC sub-module capacitors, a decoupled control strategy is proposed which can independently control the AC and DC loops. This strategy not only has a faster response of DC voltage regulation, but also has DC current control capability which avoids overcurrent/oscillation. In addition, a new average-value model is further designed to reflect the energy storage and control decoupling features of MMC.

Several dopants (e.g., C, N and F) have been tested versus adsorption of H2 molecule and other gas molecules (e.g., N2, O2, H2O, H2S). The results of relaxation show the occurrence of chemisorption to occur only in cases of C- and N-doped samples. Selective chemisorption of H2 and O2 molecules are observed on N-doped ZnO-NRs. The chemisorption of O2 is associated with the breaking of just one π-bond. Whereas, the chemisorption of H2 is associated with a complete dissociation and a formation of donor states in the gap (i.e., it yields n-type doping) and has the ability to enhance the conductivity. These characteristics made N-doped ZnO-NRs suitable for high sensitivity and selectivity towards the detection of H2 gas. Furthermore, the calculated IV-curves have paved the way for estimating the sensitivity and consolidated our results.

However, increased penetration of RES in the conventional power system has led to new challenges as well, such as loss of inertia, low short circuit ratio, difficulty in reactive power support, the problem of storage in islanded condition, which need to be handled properly. Among other challenges, the reactive power sharing is one of the major problems in a Microgrid that leads to the voltage limit violation and increase in losses. This paper proposes a new methodology to control the reactive power through the distributed approach by measuring locally the change in the Thevenin equivalent impedance across the terminals of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) due to the change in the load. A vector control in dq frame of reference by decoupling the active and reactive power is implemented by fixing the active power support from the VSC.

To overcome this problem, this paper investigates operation mode control for residential housing which consists of the rooftop solar PV and Battery Energy Storage System(BESS) which could be regulated by a Charging/Discharging Controller incorporated into a power management strategy. It could operate on the DC-AC Converter which depends on the State of Charge (SOC%), real time of resident load, and real time Solar PV panel generation. The proposed strategy not only supports the grid power stability due to demand of the residential house loads but also compensates impacts of solar variations by passing clouds and other causes.

However, there are reliability issues in abnormal situations because the protections used in DC components are very slow in their response which can cause the blackout of the system. Normally, DC microgrids are controlled using a three-level hierarchical control, being the secondary level the responsible of the DC bus regulation through the elements connected. To manage difference power in the DC bus, the DC microgrid generator and storage elements must respond delivering or consuming that power but when this difference is higher/lower than the limits of the system, it can not be achieved. In this work, a load control is proposed for a DC microgrid which allows increasing the number of the agents involved in the DC bus regulation and improving the reliability of the system. A simulation is implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK which shows the dynamical responses of the elements in a real operation for a day. The simulation results show a good response when the load power consumption is greater than the generated energy, making the load disconnect and connected once the DC bus regulation reaches the reference value. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Buses; Electric equipment protection; MATLAB; Power electronics; Reliability; DC bus regulation; Dc micro-grid; Dynamical response; Hierarchical control; MATLAB /simulink; Reference values; Storage elements; Use of renewable energies; Electric load management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049167115

The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game between the leader (the wireless operator) and multiple followers (RPSs). Efficient distributed algorithms are proposed to find the RPSs' unique equilibrium pricing scheme and the operator's optimal energy storage and service price decisions. Our analysis provides the important observation that direct competition between RPSs on the same backhaul node will induce the operator to store more energy and can thus improve the revenues of both the operator and the RPSs. Furthermore, we consider that RPSs along the backhaul may form coalitions when they sell energy to the wireless operator. A distributed algorithm is proposed to obtain the Nash stable coalition structure and the corresponding energy pricing strategy for each coalition. Finally, simulation results are presented to compare the solutions of the competitive model and the cooperative model. We show that forming coalitions between RPSs benefits both the RPSs and the operator. © 2017 IEEE.","backhaul; cooperation; energy allocation; game theory; Green communication; price-production decisions","Economics; Game theory; Renewable energy resources; backhaul; cooperation; Energy allocations; Green communications; Production decisions; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049660952

Offering greatly expanded capacity at near-DRAM speed, today's new-generation persistent memory (PM) module is no doubt an ideal candidate for system upgrade. However, integrating DRAM-comparable PMs in current enterprise systems faces big barriers in terms of huge system modifications for software compati-bility and complex runtime support. In addition, the very large PM capacity unavoidably results in massive metadata, which introduces significant performance and energy overhead. The inefficiency issue becomes even acute when the memory system reaches its capacity limit or the application requires large memory space allocation. In this paper we propose adaptive memory fusion (AMF), a novel PM integration scheme that jointly solves the above issues. Rather than struggle to adapt to the persistence property of PM through modifying the full software stack, we focus on exploiting the high capacity feature of emerging PM modules. AMF is designed to be totally transparent to user applications by carefully hiding PM devices and managing the available PM space in a DRAM-like way. To further improve the performance, we devise holistic optimization scheme that allows the system to efficiently utilize system resources. Specifically, AMF is able to adaptively release PM based on memory pressure status, smartly reclaim PM pages, and enable fast space expansion with direct PM pass-through. We implement AMF as a kernel subsystem in Linux. Compared to traditional approaches, AMF could decrease the page faults number of high-resident-set benchmarks by up to 67.8% with an average of 46.1%. Using realistic in-memory database, we show that AMF outperforms existing solutions by 57.7% on SQLite and 21.8% on Redis. Overall, AMF represents a more lightweight design approach and it would greatly encourage rapid and flexible adoption of PM in the near future. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive; DRAM; In Memory Computing; Integration; Persistent Memory","Computer operating systems; Integration; Memory architecture; Supercomputers; Adaptive; Holistic optimizations; In-memory database; Integration scheme; Lightweight design; Persistent memory; System modifications; Traditional approaches; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046811332

To achieve accurate results, the driver behavior in traffic simulation needs to be representative. Since the driver behavior are simulated by car following models, these models need to be calibrated to reproduce traffic flow as well as energy demand similar to drivers in real traffic. In this paper, three car following models commonly used in traffic simulation, i.e., the intelligent driver model (IDM), the Krauss car following model, and the Wiedemann car following model, are calibrated and verified on around 200 recorded trips. The trip data are collected from human drivers driving on the Drive Me route, which is an autonomous drive test route in Gothenburg, Sweden. To find the optimal parameters of the car following models, a Genetic Algorithm minimizes a performance index which is derived to reflect the error in the vehicle's impact on traffic flow as well as its energy demand, compared to a reference trip. The result of the simulation shows that in average, the optimized IDM can replicate driving behaviors best compared to the other two models. It is also shown that adding a time delay improves the performance of all the models. © 2017 IEEE.","Car Following Model; Drive Me; Intelligent driver model; Krauss; Performance Index; Traffic simulation; Wiedemann","Behavioral research; Computer software; Digital storage; Energy management; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Street traffic control; Vehicle performance; Car following models; Intelligent driver models; Krauss; Performance indices; Traffic simulations; Wiedemann; Highway traffic control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046255146

For validation purposes, extensive simulation scenarios are conducted confirming significant energy saving and cost reduction potential of the presented coordination in different railway system operation set-ups including volatile price tariffs, different energy storage systems, different number of trains in the substation supply area and grid conditions. © 2017 IEEE.","efficient energy management; electric railway traction system; electric traction substation energy flows; energy storages; hierarchical coordination; model predictive control; trains energy consumption","Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric traction; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Model predictive control; Railroads; Traction control; Electric railways; Electricity supply; Energy flow; Energy storage systems; Extensive simulations; Grid-supplied electricity; Hierarchical coordination; Traction substation; Rectifier substations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046246961

Traditional A-CAES systems often store the compressed air in nature storage vessels, such as underground hard-rock and salt caverns, thus depending heavily on geographical conditions. This problem can be mitigated by introducing artificial vessels. However, the artificial vessels could be very costly since their construction requires a large number of steels, accounting for a large proportion of the capital investment of A-CAES. For a given output, the capital investment and the performance of A-CAES system are depend on the operation pressure of each component (compression train, expansion train, thermal energy storage tanks and artificial vessels). In this work, both thermodynamic and economic performance of A-CAES have been investigated through a multiobjective evolutionary optimization, and the four operation pressures from different components are considered. Experimental results show that the Round trip efficiency (RTE) is improved by 4.41%, the system total investment cost (TIC) is decreased by 4.55%and the Profit is increased by 8.91%compared with conventional A-CAES. Hence, the designed A-CAES is more efficient and more economic than the conventional one. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adiabatic compressed air energy storage; Economic analysis; Evolutionary optimization; Multi-objective optimization; Thermodynamic analyses","Artificial intelligence; Compressed air; Economic analysis; Evolutionary algorithms; Heat storage; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Pressure vessels; Thermoanalysis; Capital investment; Economic performance; Evolutionary optimizations; Geographical conditions; Multi-objective evolutionary optimizations; Operation pressure; Thermal energy storage tanks; Thermo dynamic analysis; Compressed air energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048363633

Due to their limited energy storage, the nodes are prone to fail, which may lead to network partitioning problem. To cope with this problem, the number of deployed sensor nodes in an area is more than the required quantity. The challenge is to turn on a minimal number of nodes to preserve network connectivity and area coverage. In this paper, we apply computational geometry techniques to introduce a new 2-phase algorithm, called Delaunay Based Connected Cover (DBCC), to find a connected cover in an omnidirectional wireless sensor network. In the first phase, the Delaunay triangulation of all sensors is computed and a minimal number of sensors is selected to ensure the coverage of the region. In the second phase, connectivity of the nodes is ensured. The devised method is simulated by NS2 and is compared with two well-known algorithms, CCP and OGDC. For the case, where the communication and the coverage radii are equal, our method requires 23% and 45% fewer nodes compared to the aforementioned methods, respectively. In the second simulation case, the communication radius is set to 1.5 times of the coverage radius. The results demonstrate that DBCC chooses 14% and 34% fewer nodes, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computational geometry; Computer architecture; Network architecture; Communication radius; Connected cover; Delau-nay triangulations; Limited energies; Monitoring applications; Network connectivity; Network partitioning; Two phase algorithm; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050614718

ESS could be used for deferring network upgrades, demand side management, maximizing the arbitrage benefits, minimizing of energy losses, and allowing the integration of more renewable power. However, optimal planning of ESS is a must in order to achieve the utmost benefits. This paper presents a novel approach for optimal planning of ESS in order to maximize the arbitrage benefits and minimize the total cost of energy losses. The proposed approach relies on the modeling results obtained from a Monte Carlo based probabilistic modeling strategy for wind power and system demand. In the presented planning approach, the optimal operation schedule of ESS is firstly determined in order to maximize the distribution system arbitrage benefit. Secondly, the grey wolf optimization method is employed to determine the optimal location of wind based distributed generators and ESS in order to minimize the total net present value of energy losses cost.

Three operating concepts are considered based on the acceptable speed range of generators. Elaborated RAM analysis of each WTG system associated with each operating concept is presented starting from the subassemblies level to the subsystems level then the overall system. Based on their impact on the energy production, the subassemblies are classified to primary and secondary elements. A failure in a primary element causes interruption of the energy production while the energy production efficiency is degraded due to failures in secondary components. Mathematically, various subassemblies are given weights according to their classifications. In addition, an improved Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is presented for estimating the RAM performance of various WTG configurations, and systems. The required input data are obtained from worldwide databases of failures, and repair of various subassemblies comprising various operating concepts. Fixed speed squirrel cage induction generators (FS-SCIG) based systems are no longer manufactured in utility scale applications due to their low aerodynamic efficiency. However, this configuration is proposed in this paper for assessing the historical low-efficiency designs and compares with the current designs that have higher efficiencies from the RAM points of view. It is found that the doubly fed induction generator with a partially rated converter (DFIG-PRC) has the highest reliability and lowest maintainability but it has a medium availability. Whereas the direct drive electrically excited synchronous generator with a fully rated converter (DDSG) has the lowest reliability, lowest availability and intermediate maintainability. © 2017 IEEE.","Availability; Maintainability; Reliability; Reliability block diagram (RBD); Wind turbine generator (WTG)","Availability; Digital storage; Dynamical systems; Electric fault currents; Maintainability; Power converters; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Turbogenerators; Wind turbines; Aerodynamic efficiency; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Fully rated converters; Reliability , availability , and maintainabilities; Reliability assessments; Reliability block diagrams; Secondary components; Squirrel cage induction generators; Asynchronous generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047406235

However, the intermittent nature of wind energy, electrical energy storage system can be recognized as underpinning systems that can be employed in meeting the challenges in energy generation and load balance. Therefore, this work aims to assess and optimizing different available wind turbines with an electrical energy storage system for supplying the distribution systems. Fuel cell is suggested as electrical energy storage to construct a wind turbine-fuel cell hybrid system to ensure that loads will be supplied in continuous and reliable way. The available wind turbines are optimized from both technical and economical points of view. This model is applied numerically to estimate the optimal wind turbine that may be utilized to supply a part of Egyptian electrical distribution network. The surplus power generated from the available wind turbines is used for producing an amount of hydrogen, through water electrolysis operation, and hydrogen which stored in a tank. This hydrogen is used to obtain the most suitable fuel cell, which produces an electrical energy. This energy will be used to supply the system in the deficit times. Also, the economical design of the fuel cell is evaluated in this paper. © 2017 IEEE.","electrical energy storage systems; fuel cell; Mersi-Matrouh electrical distribution system; Renewable energy; wind turbine","Data storage equipment; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hybrid systems; Wind power; Electrical distribution networks; Electrical distribution system; Electrical energy storage systems; Electrical energy storages; Energy storage systems; Hybrid renewable energies; Intermittent nature of winds; Renewable energies; Wind turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047387097

This paper proposes a control strategy to smooth wind power by using flywheel energy storage system (FESS) driven by permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). A back-To-back converter is used to connect the flywheel system with the grid. The converter functions are to control the charging/discharging process of the flywheel, to keep the DC link voltage at constant predetermined value, and to control the reactive power exchanged with the grid. The second order adaptive notch filter (SOANF) is proposed to estimate the flywheel power reference by filtering the wind power. The dynamic performance of the proposed control strategy is studied using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The simulation results proved the success of the proposed control in smoothing wind power. They also show acceptable behavior of the proposed filtering technique and the strength of the proposed control strategy. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive notch filter; Back to back converter; Flywheel; Pmsm","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Electric power system control; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Notch filters; Permanent magnets; Power control; Power converters; Process control; Wheels; Wind power; Adaptive notch filters; Back-to-back converter; Charging/discharging; Dynamic performance; Filtering technique; Flywheel energy storage system; Permanent magnet synchronous machines; Pmsm; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047074228

In addition to this it suffers from quick changes in the structure of the wireless link due to variations of the signal strength, interference, and multi-path propagation characteristics. Reliable energy efficient data transmission in WSNs to prolong the network lifetime is an important and challenging issue. In general, there are several approaches like multi-path routing and source coding, automatic repeat request, used for providing reliable data transfer in WSNs. But the overhead and performance of such end-to-end single-path approaches are often dominated by congestion as well as some poor-quality links or nodes on the path. That is, these traditional approaches are not able to quickly and properly react in this multi-hop wireless environment. To cope with the above issues, in this paper we propose an energy efficient reliable data transfer scheme named as 'Adaptive Sectoring Scheme for Reliability (ASSR)' for WSNs. In this approach, the given sensor field is divided into sectors activated one at a time by the occurrence of an event. To minimize the congestion as well as to increase the throughput with maximum packet delivery ratio, the sectoring process is adjusted dynamically to ensure reliable data transmission. Simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme leads to an improvement of the reliability and energy consumption. © 2017 IEEE.","Ad-hoc networks; Data transmission; Network reliability; Routing protocols; Sectoring; Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks; Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Error correction; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Reliability; Routing protocols; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Ad-hoc communication networks; Automatic repeat request; Computational capability; Network reliability; Reliable data transfers; Reliable data transmission; Sectoring; Traditional approaches; Data communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050687752

Most previous work in this area has concentrated only on designing and optimizing accelerators for 2D CNN, with few attempts made to accelerate 3D CNN on FPGA. We find accelerating 3D CNNs on FPGA to be challenge due to their high computational complexity and storage demands. More importantly, although the computation patterns of 2D and 3D CNNs are analogous, the conventional approaches adopted for accelerating 2D CNNs may be unfit for 3D CNN acceleration. In this paper, in order to accelerate 2D and 3D CNNs using a uniform framework, we propose a uniform template-based architecture that uses templates based on the Winograd algorithm to ensure fast development of 2D and 3D CNN accelerators. Furthermore, we also develop a uniform analytical model to facilitate efficient design space explorations of 2D and 3D CNN accelerators based on our architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the template-based architecture by implementing accelerators for real-life 2D and 3D CNNs (VGG16 and C3D) on multiple FPGA platforms. On S2C VUS440, we achieve up to 1.13 TOPS and 1.11 TOPS under low resource utilization for VGG16 and C3D, respectively. End-to-end comparisons with CPU and GPU solutions demonstrate that our implementation of C3D achieves gains of up to 13x and 60x in performance and energy relative to a CPU solution, and a 6.4x energy efficiency gain over a GPU solution. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","3D CNN; Uniform Templates; Winograd Algorithm","Acceleration; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Network architecture; Neural networks; 3D CNN; Computer vision applications; Conventional approach; Convolutional neural network; Efficient design space explorations; Resource utilizations; Uniform Templates; Winograd; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051119925

However, the mismatched distribution of energy storage and traffic load leads to a bad result that the renewable energy can not be utilized sufficiently. To tackle this issue, we propose an energy-biased-received-power (EBRP) scheme (i.e., users incline to associate with BSs at higher energy level) for energy-load balancing and on-grid energy saving. Taking into account the dynamic EH behavior, a performance analysis of coverage probability and energy efficiency is conducted in a two-tier heterogeneous network with EH enabled personal cells. Numerical and simulation results are provided along with the maximum-biased-received-power (MBRP) scheme. Numerical results show that the reduction of maximum transmit power at base stations is favorable for enhancing energy efficiency. Moreover, it is revealed that the proposed scheme shows superiority in energy-load balancing when the energy efficiency is comparable with that of the MBRP scheme. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy harvesting; Heterogeneous networks; Power management (telecommunication); Radio communication; Coverage probabilities; Heterogeneous cellular networks; Numerical results; Performance analysis; Received power; Renewable energies; Transmit power; User associations; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045262031

In this paper, a device for UEWE was developed and composed of pulse capacitors (200μF, 16kV), a spark gap switch, and a metal wire immersed in a chamber filled with water. A Rogowski coil and a voltage divider were used for the measurements of the current and the voltage on the wire load, respectively. The shock waves were recorded by a piezoelectric pressure probe (model: PCB138A11). The amplitude of the shock waves was measured to be 82.4MPa at 50mm from the exploding wire. The effects of the experimental parameters (including the wire diameter, the storage energy in capacitors, the energy deposition into the wire) on the shock waves were investigated. It was shown that thicker copper wires would generate stronger shock waves and the amplitude of shock wave was approximately proportional to the energy deposition into the wire. For potential application in oil exploitation, the destruction of the concrete cylinders with a thickness of 75mm by the shock wave was studied. A storage energy of 0.9 kJ is high enough to break the concrete cylinder into pieces. At a position of 75mm from the exploding wire, the shock wave measured in the concrete cylinder attenuates to 43.5% in amplitude of that measured in water without the cylinder. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Concretes; Cylinders (shapes); Deposition; Exploding wires; Voltage dividers; Concrete cylinders; Energy depositions; Experimental parameters; Piezoelectric pressure; Spark gap switch; Strong shock waves; Underwater electrical explosions; Underwater electrical wire explosion; Shock waves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054253173

It is found that the resistance of the test gap containing nano-fluids increases by double when subjected to high amplitude voltage before the development of electrical breakdown, greatly differing from the invariable resistance in the pure PC case. Besides, compared with pure PC, the streamers in nano-fluids are more complex branched. It implies that the charge carriers in nano-fluids can be effectively captured and scattered by nanoparticles, which is verified by means of thermally stimulated current method.

In this paper, the high permittivity liquid dielectric and a spiral structure are adopted to lengthen the pulse width of a compact pulsed power generator. Firstly, the operation principles of the compact pulsed power generator are described. The techniques used to lengthen the pulse width are then presented and analyzed. Prior to its use, the propylene carbonate was purified by filtering to remove particles, de-ionizing, and de-gassing. The high voltage insulation was designed using insulation matching to ensure optimal distribution of the electromagnetic field. Finally, a compact pulsed power generator with longer output pulse duration was developed. For a generator length of 1 m, an output voltage of 100 kV was developed across a 10 Ω resistive load, with a pulse duration of 33 ns.

In this paper, a distributed energy dispatch algorithm is proposed for achieving both the balances of EESSs over an undirected connected communication network. Each EESS shares the information with communication neighbors through the network. The algorithm design contains three parts. Firstly, the sign function is utilized to integrate the charging and discharging models of EESSs into a unified switching form. Secondly, for each EESS, the desired power in system steady state is calculated and containing global coefficients of EESSs, and a distributed observer based algorithm is derived to estimate the desired power, which provides the local power reference for each EESS. Thirdly, for each EESS, based on the local power tracking error and the SoC error between itself and its communication neighbors, the energy dispatch algorithm is constructed by employing the distributed receding horizon control (DRHC) approach. The algorithm realizes the two balances and simultaneously satisfies the power and SoC constraints. Effectiveness of the proposed dispatch algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Battery management systems; Energy storage; Algorithm design; Dispatch algorithms; Distributed energies; Electrical energy storage systems; Load operations; Receding horizon control; State of charge; Supply-demand balances; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047481698

Due to the limitation of WSN in energy, capability of communication, computing and the capability of storage, it is difficult for nodes to communicate. Existing researches show that using network coding in WSN can enhance throughput and the security transmission of network, and reduce the energy consumption of nodes [1]. This paper chooses a typical TEEN protocol as the research object of network coding. We attempt to employ network coding to achieve the improvement on throughput of WSN and communication performance, and decrease the energy consumption of sensor nodes. Based on these points, this paper proposes to create network coding opportunities on cluster head nodes in TEEN protocol by utilizing the advantages of opposite links, and a new network coding model basing on TEEN (NCTEEN). The results of simulations show that NCTEEN model has better performance than TEEN in terms of throughput and energy consumption.

Accurate estimation of state of charge (SOC) is crucial for charging or discharging the batteries safely and reliably. However, the SOC is immeasurable and nonlinearly varies with factors (e.g., current rate, battery degeneration, ambient temperature and measurement noise), a reliable and robust algorithm for SOC estimation is accordingly expected. In this paper, an optimal nonlinear observer (ONLO) for SOC estimation is proposed. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to optimize parameters of the nonlinear observer. The proposed approach is verified by experiments performed on INR18650-25R lithium-ion batteries produced by SAMSUMG SDI.

Complex and resource intensive security schemes are infeasible and reduce the network lifetime. We have explored polynomial distribution based key establishment schemes and identified an issue that the resultant polynomial value is either storage intensive or infeasible when large values are multiplied, and it becomes more costly when these polynomials are regenerated dynamically after each node join or leave operations. To reduce the computation overhead on a cluster head, we have proposed XOR based key management scheme. Simulation scenarios are performed using NS 2.35 to validate the results for storage, communication, latency, energy, and polynomial calculation costs.

It is a promising alternative to replace the traditional memory architecture. PDRAM has good characteristics as large capacity, good stability and non-volatile, while PRAM has disadvantages of a limited life and large access latency. Traditional policies are not sufficient to be directly applied to the PDRAM memory architecture. They cannot adapt to the new features of the hybrid architecture because of their undifferentiated operation, extensive use of PRAM can cause performance degradation and shorten the life of PDRAM memory. This paper proposed Hybrid-LRU caching scheme to address these problems. Our scheme mainly uses the cache consistency address resolution mode to distinguish between different physical mediums in PDRAM, and then take different actions depending on different physical mediums. We have taken a variety of tradition policies like LRU, FIFO, RANDOM, CFLRU to make experimental comparisons. The experimental results have shown that our scheme can reduce the PRAM utilization rate of 11.8% and improve the performance by 4.6%, energy consumption of write and read operation can be reduced up to 88.2%. © 2016 IEEE.","cache policy; energy; hybrid memory architecture; performance; phase change memory","Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Memory architecture; Phase change memory; Conventional memory; energy; Experimental comparison; Hybrid architectures; Hybrid memory architectures; performance; Performance degradation; Phase change memory (pram); Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050894570

As the scale of applications become increasingly large and complex, the data to be processed grows exponentially. In contrast, FPGAS provide limited memory capacity and bandwidth, severely limiting the scale and performance of prototype verification systems and acceleration systems. Furthermore, data movement is expected to be a dominant consumer of energy, thus inefficient data movement between different DRAM modules also incurs significant performance and energy penalties. This paper proposes a practical design: A Scalable Memory Extension Fabric for FPGA (SMEFF), which is an asynchronous memory access mechanism and exploits cascaded technology to solve the problem of memory capacity and bandwidth. SMEFF uses two key technologies to achieve memory capacity and bandwidth improvements, and shrink the latency and overhead of data movement-the first is an FPGA-based high-speed serial bus to build a multi-level memory fabric instead of the traditional parallel bus mechanism to solve the signal integrity problem. The second is a module to module (M-To-M) DMA data movement technology, which reduces the latency and overhead of data movement between memory modules. We implement SMEFF on an FPGA-based prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results show that SMEFF provides 5x memory capacity increase and up to 3.6x memory bandwidth improvement compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based memory systems, and outperforms PCIe-based systems. The data movement of M-TO-M's DMA technology obtains up to 3x latency reduction, and average of 21.1% to 61.1% energy reduction compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based memory systems. SMEFF thus increases FPGA-based prototype memory systems capacity and bandwidth. More importantly, our architecture provides opportunities for the design of scalable, cost-effective FPGA-based memory subsystems. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Big data; Cost effectiveness; Dynamic random access storage; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; System buses; Acceleration systems; High-speed serial bus; Latency reduction; Memory subsystems; Multilevel memory; Prototype verification; Prototype verification systems; Signal-integrity problems; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050892672

Sand can provide a unique and eco-friendly alternative to current storage mediums, while having minimized cost and maintenance. Oil will be heated and pumped to flow through pipes leading to the Thermal Energy Storage Element, where the sand will be thermally charged. After the desired temperature in the sand is obtained, the oil is left to cool down while the sand loses some of its stored energy. Finally, the remaining sand energy is discharged and absorbed by the oil, whose heat is utilized to generate electricity using a Peltier Element. To design and manufacture the prototype, in depth research on the thermal properties of UAE's desert sand was conducted. Furthermore, a 3 D model of the prototype is included, along with the details on its operating principle. To determine the efficiency of the system, the experiments conducted are divided into three subsections: Charging Phase, Storing Phase, and Discharging Phase. Certain constraints in designing the system are addressed along with several methods to improve the system's functionality for successful future optimization. The charging time required by the sand to reach 150°C was found experimentally to be 56 minutes. After 5 hours of storing, under insulated conditions, the sand decreased to 91° indicating a storing efficiency of 62.4%. In 7 minutes the oil absorbed back the heat from the sand with a discharge efficiency of 61%, followed by a voltage generation of 0.535 V by the thermoelectric generator. © 2017 IEEE.","heat; renewable energy; solar radiation; thermal storage","Electric energy storage; Heat storage; Heating; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Design and manufactures; Discharge efficiency; Generate electricity; Renewable energies; Solar thermal energy; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal storage; Thermo-electric generators; Sand",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050885894

The usage of SMES is more efficient than a battery system with less distortions. To reduce more distortions in the AC power connected to the grid, ant colony optimization is used to control the inverter gating signal which converts DC power from the renewable energy to AC power.

Firstly, the polynomial fit and hereditary integral were applied to model the nonlinear stiffness and hysteresis behavior in harmonic drive. As the critical point of system energy discharge is the local torsional angle extremum, the hereditary hysteresis model was improved by replacing the global torsional angle extremum with the local extremum. Then the active loading method by a torsion bar with double motors was used to measure the hysteresis loop. Through this test data, the model parameters were identified by the least square method, and the precision of this compliance and hysteresis model was verified through experiments. Furthermore the erasure property of hysteresis in harmonic drive was captured by the improved hereditary model and this improvement was verified by a unilateral attenuating loading test.

Electrification of these remote rural regions through national power grids is largely unviable low due to i) a high infrastructure cost and ii) limited power generation capacity in many countries. Therefore, low-power, low-voltage, solar photovoltaic (PV) based DC microgrids are becoming very popular in these regions. Many of these low voltage solar powered DC microgrids are based on central generation and central storage with distribution efficiencies typically ranging from 60% to 80%. Therefore, it is important to design better architectures to attain the highest possible efficiency within system constraints. In this work, we analyze three possible distribution architectures and evaluate their operational efficiency with regards to typical spatial village orientations in many developing countries. These include C-Architecture, Cluster-Architectures and O-Architecture with maximum distribution efficiencies of 83.5%, 91.6% and 95.6%, respectively for a typical 40-house village at 24V DC distribution utilizing 10 AWG conductors. Based upon the comparative analysis in this work, an efficient distribution architecture of a village can be proposed in accordance with its orientation (arrangement of houses) to achieve a higher operational efficiency and a reduced upfront cost.

Energy storage is emerging as an attractive solution for dealing with uncertainty and variability of renewable generation. Specifically, large-scale battery storage units are gaining popularity due to their modularity, fast response and ongoing cost reduction. In this paper we model a two-stage adaptive robust unit commitment model with large-scale energy storage. The objective is to minimize the operating costs of thermal generators under the worst wind power output scenario. The over-protection is addressed using a parameter that controls the conservatism of the model. This control parameter can be extended to cover the uncertainty more realistically using multiple bands as the time horizon progresses. The proposed model is tested on an updated IEEE RTS-96 system. Different levels of protecting the system against uncertainty are evaluated and the role of energy storage is analyzed. © 2017 IEEE.","Benders' decomposition; Energy storage; Multiband uncertainty; Robust unit commitment; Wind uncertainty","Cost reduction; Electric batteries; Electric equipment protection; Energy storage; Operating costs; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Attractive solutions; Benders' decompositions; Multiband; Renewable energies; Renewable generation; Uncertainty and variability; Unit-commitment; Wind uncertainties; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046336416

Voltage regulation is a vital issue for active distribution networks (ADNs). Optimal placement for energy storage system (ESS) units is determined to enhance their impacts on voltage regulation by solving a mixed integer linear programming model. A voltage regulation strategy is proposed by coordinating DGs, ESS units and on-load tap changer (OLTC). The ADN is partitioned into various zones by using the sensitivity information. For each zone, ESS units play a very active role in voltage regulation coordinating with DGs. The OLTC is activated to ensure achieving the voltage regulation goal when DGs and ESS units are out of control scope.

In the scenario with densely-deployed access points (APs), edge caching technology could reduce the backhaul links traffic by caching files at APs. Considering these APs with limited storage capacity, an appropriate proportion of a file may be stored into the AP. While these numerous APs could provide users with more convenient access, they may also increase the system energy consumption. Then AP sleeping strategy could be introduced and discussed accordingly. In this paper, we propose a user connection matrix-based AP sleeping (UCMAS) algorithm. Each AP will randomly store a part of each file. We establish the connection state matrix for users and the active APs in the local area. Then the expected transport energy consumption of the APs for one user could be calculated. We model the energy consumption into a two-dimensional problem and find a solution to optimize it.

For example, in the case of a silicon photovoltaic (PV) system, approximately 25% of the incoming concentrated solar energy will be converted into electrical energy and the remaining is converted into waste heat which contributes to elevate the cell temperature and so decreases its efficiency. The main objective of this project is to emphasize the Phase Change Material (PCM) cooling technique. This kind of material is known for its high storing capacity of the temperature which will enhance the cycle lifetime of any device. In this project, a direct application on a PV panel was carried out, an organic PCM is tested in order to study its properties and capacity of absorption. The results shows that around 13% of the energy can be saved. Another objective of this project consists of a numerical validation of the modeling used to determine the temperature of a photovoltaic panel.

In this process, shear strength of circuit pads joints are a vital quality characteristic and the need to increase this is required for new products which have an increased quantity of photo diode circuit pads. The root cause analysis tools including Cause &amp; Effect Diagram and FMEA were employed to determine the key process input variables (KPIVs). These analysis yielded five potential KPIVs.

The statistical analysis on observations revealed that laser energy, laser time, and bond position had significant effect to shear strength. Next, the regression model was solved to obtain the optimal process parameters. These optimal process parameters were tested with a production lot.

However, the dielectric permittivity varies sharply in the vicinity of Curie temperature, which restricts thermal stability for its relevant devices. Therefore, it is of practical importance to improve the dielectric temperature stability for its application reliability. In this paper, we report an approach to enhance the temperature stability of dielectric permittivity through introducing the composition gradient in barium titanate ceramic. Firstly, the graded ceramic (consisting of BaTiO3-xBaSnO3, x=0.07, 0.09, 0.105, 0.12, 0.14) was prepared by a conventional solid state reaction process with a modified forming process. Secondly, a comparison has been made between the temperature dependency of dielectric property with different composition gradient arrangement by simulation, and the optimal one has been selected. Finally, the dielectric permittivity of graded ceramic was measured and it has been found that the temperature variation parameter Δr% = (r - r25°C)/r25°C of graded ceramic is lower than that of other single composition ceramic from 20°C to 60°C, which verifies the validity for composition gradient method to improve the dielectric temperature stability of BaTiO3 ceramics. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Barium titanate; Ceramic materials; Ferroelectric ceramics; Gradient methods; Solid state reactions; Stability; Barium titanate ceramics; Composition gradient method; Dielectric permittivities; Dielectric-temperature stability; Solid-state reaction process; Temperature dependencies; Temperature stability; Temperature variation; Permittivity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045185692

Interfacing of these generators involves a good number of electronic components and filters. Small changes in operating conditions as well as disturbances at or beyond the point of common coupling can excite the associated eigenvalues giving rise to small signal instability in the system.

Mobility offers many benefits such as reliability, lifetime enhancement, security and so on. However, it poses a set of challenges the most prominent is data loss. Data collection using a mobile sink may induce huge latencies and packet drops within the network particularly when the sink moves with a lower speed and in an unpredictable manner. Thereby, some region might be visited more than others, which causes data loss due to buffer overflow. In an attempt to overcome this issue, we propose in this paper an efficient approach that balances the network storage and prevents packet drops. Nodes having run out of storage space offload their extra data to their neighbors in a proportional manner in function of their free spaces. In case all nodes have filled up their memories and there is no possibility for data partitioning, the sink is notified urgently to move towards the crowded zone to perform data offloading before the occurrence of any packet drop. Intensive simulation reveals that our approach significantly decreases packet loss and spread the load within the network. © 2017 IEEE.","buffer overflow; data loss; data repartition; storage; wireless sensor network","Buffer storage; Drops; Energy storage; Packet loss; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Buffer overflows; Data collection; Data loss; Data partitioning; data repartition; Lifetime enhancement; Network storage; New approaches; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047323147

How can the internet of things, therefore, be used to identify sources of energy consumption? The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and setup of a non-complex cost-effective energy monitoring system for a residential home environment. This may enable homeowners to identify unwanted energy consumption and thereby reduce their electrical utility bills. The system incorporates an Arduino Uno Board, ESP8266 WiFi module and a cloud server called ThingSpeak. No physical wiring connections are needed, as only a current transformer sensor needs to be hooked around the main AC supply line from the electrical utility provider. No PC data storage is required, as the data is stored on the cloud server. The only key requirement is internet connectivity so that the WiFi module may connect directly to the cloud server where all data is captured and presented. © International Conference on Multidisciplinary Research.All right reserved.","Arduino; Energy; Internet of things",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113877454

Without considering plant efficiency, capital or operating costs, hydrogen from SMR has a minimum value of 1.45 times the price of methane, a valuable and resource-limited commodity. In addition, for every ton of hydrogen produced, 10 ton of greenhouse-gas carbon dioxide is coproduced and released from the feedstock and in processing. The electrolysis of water requires a clean, pure feedstock and requires considerably more energy than what hydrogen will produce when reacted with oxygen (air). In contrast to inorganic hydrogen production as described above, organic biofuels are produced by anaerobic digestion and fermentation, which are proven and well-established technologies. Anaerobic digestion uses decaying organic material to produce a syngas where there is waste that needs disposal, or significant subsidies for using energy crops. Fermentation has been producing alcohol beverages for thousands of years from cultivated crops, now it's used to produce subsidized ethanol from corn and sugar, impacting feed and food costs. To quiet the ""food vs. fuel"" debate, effort is now directed at cultivating algae and grass feedstock. Cultivation requires fossil-fuel for planting, fertilizing, harvesting, transporting and distillation of product, which without subsidies would be highly unprofitable. Anaerobic digestion and fermentation both use biological microorganisms ('bugs'), which are temperature dependent, require large volumes with slow rates &amp; low-yields, and are prone to contamination (sulfur) or conditions (temperature) that kills the 'bugs' employed to do the work. In addition, conventional biofuel producers must pay for crop feedstocks whereas biowaste producers pay for biowaste disposal; yet, biowaste has higher energy content than crop feedstocks. An alternative, recovering hydrogen biofuel from wet-biowaste: In the U.S., waste-water treatment plants (WWTP), municipal solid waste, confined area feeding operations, and agriculture produce over 1 billion tons of organic biowaste annually that can cost from $40-$200 per ton to treat before use or disposal. In addition, the amount and cost is increasing. Fuel and electricity represent a substantial cost to WWTPs; one is required for nearly all stages in the treatment process, from the collection of raw sewage to the discharge of treated effluent. An estimated 3-4% of total U.S. electricity consumption is used for the transfer and treatment of wastewater, corresponding to more than 45 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. WWTP in the U.S. produced 7.9 million tons of sewage biowaste in 2014. The latent energy in this biowaste could meet 12% of the nation's electricity demand. A 10 million gallon/day WWTP producing 7 tons/day of biowaste will require 11 to 17 MWhe of electricity daily. In addition, due to water shortages, higher energy &amp; capital costs and a changing climate, water-energy issues are of growing importance in biowaste management at WWTP. In contrast to being a public energy, economic and environmental burden, Chemergy's patented HyBrTec technology allows WWTPs to be energy independent and profitable producers of thermal energy and renewable fuel. All organic biowaste contains an unused remnant of stored solar energy that HyBrTec recovers as renewable hydrogen, non-anthropogenic carbon dioxide, thermal energy and inorganic residuals suitable as a micro-nutrient fertilizer. Processing wet-biowaste, HyBrTec exploits two well-established steps that are scalable from pounds to tons per minute with commercially available components. First, the wet-biowaste (C6H10O5&amp; H2O) is eburnedf or oxidized with bromine (Br2) to produce hydrogen bromide (HBr), carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat (C6H10O5+ 7H2O + 12Br2← 24HBr + 6CO2). The HBr reacts with unreacted water forming concentrated hydrobromic acid (HBraq). Bromination is followed by electrolysis of the hydrobromic acid into hydrogen (H2) and reagent Br2 and dilute acid that is recycled back into the process. Hydrogen bromide electrochemistry is reversible (2HBr ← H2+ Br2) allowing the charging (storing) and discharging (production) of electrical energy. This enables a HyBrTec reversible electrolysis system to co-provide efficient electrical energy storage. The hydrogen-bromine energy storage system operates as a flow battery where the reactants are stored outside the electrochemical PEM stack, which simplifies capacity growth. Energy storage increases the value of off-peak and intermittent solar &amp; wind energy and promotes development of micro- and smartgrids that can exploit local sources of energy, improve efficiency, reduce needed capacity and mitigate disruptions. Feedstocks include: sewage, manure, agricultural residuals, and municipal solid waste including plastics. Also, wastewater is a reagent in the process producing additional hydrogen. Unique to HyBrTec is that 175-200 C heat (26.3 kWhth/kgH2) is released, which can be used to reduce the feedstock water content to a desired 50%. Also, electroosmotic water transfer from the bromine anode to the hydrogen cathode increases the acid concentration at the anode, which lowers cell voltage and results in 4-6 gallons of potable water per kgH2. If the residual energy content of the biowaste is omitted, HyBrTec offers a theoretical biowaste-to-hydrogen-to-energy efficiency greater than 100%. This is simply because the theoretical voltage to dissociate hydrogen carrier hydrogen bromide into hydrogen and bromine (0.58 Volt) is less than the voltage produced in the hydrogen reaction with oxygen (1.23 Volt) forming water, providing a theoretical biowaste-to-energy efficiency of 212% (1.23V/0.58V). However, if the electrolyzer operates at an actual 0.75-0.8 Volts (16-21.23 kWh/kgH2 depending on electrolyte temperature) the efficiency is 154%, and if the hydrogen is used in a 65% efficient fuel cell with air the electric-to-electric efficiency is reduced further to 100%. The efficiencies above disregard the latent energy content of the negative-valued feedstock; however, if included the biowaste-to-electricity efficiency is a healthy 67%. Hydrogen can enrich natural gas to increase its Btu content and reduce NOx emissions, used directly as a clean fuel or sold as a commodity. Furthermore, byproduct carbon dioxide is organic in origin and not considered a GHG, can be vented, or used with recovered hydrogen to synthesize methanol, ethanol or methane using Fischer-Tropsch or the Audi e-gas process. Also, recovered hydrogen can be combined with nitrogen from on-site membrane air-separation to produce ammonia, which is a higher-value commodity and easily transportable. Other opportunities to monetize the carbon dioxide byproduct include reacting with ammonia to produce even higher value urea. Beginning in 2010 the U.S. Department of Energy and the Florida Hydrogen Initiative funded laboratory bench-top R&amp;D of HyBrTec. Based on the success of this research and at the recommendation of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the California Energy Commission (CEC) in 2013 funded Chemergy in a cost-shared program to determine suitability of biosolids from the Delta Diablo WWTP, prepare a detailed system design &amp; cost estimate of a demonstration system and an economic analysis of a HyBrTec commercial system. The results of the CEC program verified that 21.44 kg of hydrogen could be produced per wet-ton of sewage sludge and providing a 95% reduction of the wet-mass. An economic analysis for a small system processing 11 wet-tons of sewage sludge per day into 236 kg of hydrogen predicted a hydrogen production cost of $2/kg and a 14% Internal Rate of Return. Economic benefits from an increased scale, energy storage, state &amp; federal renewable energy tax incentives, loan guarantees, cap &amp; trade credits and subsidies were not included in the analysis, which if taken would increase the IRR. © Emerging Technologies in Clean Energy 2018 -.All rights reserved.",,"Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Anodes; Biofuels; Bromine; Bromine compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Crops; Cultivation; Distillation; Earnings; Economic analysis; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrogen storage; Inorganic acids; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Natural gasoline plants; Operating costs; Organic carbon; Oxygen; Patents and inventions; Potable water; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reagents; Recovery; Sewage sludge; Solar energy; Springs (components); Steam reforming; Taxation; Thermal energy; Urea; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Wind power; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Biological microorganisms; California energy commissions; Electrical energy storages; Hydrogen production costs; Lawrence livermore national laboratories; U.S. Department of Energy; Wastewater treatment plants; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095793105

The high energy storage capacity and easy handling of the liquid fuels makes the use of DMFC advantageous for applications where a long running time with medium to low power demands is required. Furthermore, the simple and thus robust system design and the typical set-up which keeps the membrane wet for most of the time even after shut-down leads to a high cycle stability. Therefore, DMFC are in particular suitable for applications were random start-up and shut-downs are to be expected like portable power supply, on-board vehicle battery charging or back-up power. Whereas the market for portable fuel cell power systems never really took off outside the military world, battery charging and in particular back-up power are increasing in volume. However, for these markets larger systems in the range of kilowatts are often required. Here the use of today's proton exchange membrane technology based DMFC experiences economical limits due to the need to use platinum based catalyst at rather high loadings. Alkaline anion exchange membrane based DMFC could be an alternative to overcome this issue. However, classic alkaline fuel cells (AFC) are known to be sensitive against carbon dioxide from air. As was shown by Inaba et al. typical anion exchange membranes also suffer from a reduction of conductivity if exposed to carbon dioxide1. In contrast to the situation in AFC the effect was, however, found to be reversible. As the current density at which DMFC typically operate are much lower than those of fuel cells operating on hydrogen, the effect of increased ohmic resistance can also be expected to be less relevant. Much less is known about the effect of CO2and carbonate ions on the electrochemical reaction. Vega et al. reported on the effect of CO2on the ORR at Pt electrode in KOH electrolyte2. A slight reduction of performance was found. For the alcohol oxidation and the oxygen reduction at non PGM catalyst even less is known. In this study we will report on systematic tests of the methanol oxidation at carbon supported platinum catalyst in KOH and KHCO3 electrolytes as well as the oxygen reduction at commercial PGM-free cathode catalyst K4020 by Acta.. The results will be compared to studies on single cell level. Here tests were performed using also KOH or KHCO3 as supporting electrolyte. Additionally, the effect of dosing CO2to the synthetic air feed of the cathode was investigated. Experimental set-up and procedures Catalyst tests were performed using a standard rotating disk electrode set-up from PINE instruments with a glassy carbon disk electrode. The disk was coated with an ink of catalyst power dispersed in a mixture of DI water and 2-propanol with a very small amount of added Nafion®. A platinum foil was used as counter electrode and a HydroFlex® reversible hydrogen electrode by Gaskatel as reference electrode. The used cell was equipped with a double jacked so that heating of the cell was possible. Measurements there conducted between 30 °C and 60 °C. Single cell tests were performed at membrane electrode assemblies consisting of a Fumatech FumaPEM FAA3 electrolyte membrane, an anode GDE made from a Sigracet 10AA GDL coated with Johson &amp; Matthey HiSpec3000 Pt/C catalyst at a platinum loading of 2 mg cm-2and a cathode GDE made from a Freudenberg H32C2 GDL coated with Acta K4020 catalyst at a loading of 5 mg cm-2. Test were performed in a qFC 100-25 cell fixture by balticFuelCells using an Autolab potentiostat as electric load. On the cathode side gas was supplied using mass flow controllers from Bronkhorst for synthetic air and CO2. Results The first observation comparing the methanol oxidation at Pt/C catalyst in 0.25 M KOH and 0.25 M KHCO3 solution is that the achievable peek mass activity in the KOH solution is about a factor of 5 higher than in KHCO3 solution. At the same time the peak potential in the KHCO3 electrolyte is shifted towards lower potentials, whereas the onset potentials are comparable. In both cases a pronounced temperature dependence was observed with the mass activity increasing by about a factor 5 if temperature is raised from 30 °C to 60 °C. A further significant difference between the CV in KOH and KHCO3 electrolyte is the presence of a second oxidation wave in the latter. The CV in KHCO3 resembles thus a CV in acidic electrolyte. © Emerging Technologies in Clean Energy 2018 -.All rights reserved.",,"Alkaline fuel cells; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Catalyst supports; Cathodes; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric loads; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Energy storage; Fuel cell power plants; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Hydrogen; Ion exchange membranes; Ions; Membrane technology; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Mobile power plants; Ohmic contacts; Oxidation; Oxygen; Platinum; Potassium hydroxide; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Secondary batteries; Solid electrolytes; Springs (components); Temperature distribution; Voltage regulators; Alkaline anion exchange membrane; Alkaline direct methanol fuel cells; Carbon supported platinum catalyst; Electrochemical reactions; Membrane electrode assemblies; Proton exchange membranes; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Rotating disk electrodes; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095778268

The internal floating roof tank adopts nitrogen sealing technology, which reduces the breathing loss, guarantees the quality of oil storage, and reduces the possibility of fire and explosion caused by oil and gas accumulation. However, the safety problems caused by nitrogen sealing technology are rarely considered, which may occur in practical applications, especially the design of nitrogen sealing ventilation volume. In this paper, nitrogen sealing system should consider the ventilation volume under various working conditions and other safety problems. Under the present condition of vigorously promoting the energy saving and emission reduction, the control and reduction of VOC emission become the key mission in the petrochemical industry and the nitrogen sealing technology used in internal floating roof tank is one of the important means for VOC governance. The internal floating roof storage tank is made by adding the floating roof inside the vault storage tank, the floating roof added inside the tank can reduce the vaporization loss of medium and the external vault can prevent the rainwater, snow and dust entering into the tank to keep the medium inside the tank clean. However, the breather valve of internal floating roof tank is directly connected to the atmosphere, the pressure of storage tank is lower than the atmospheric pressure, the air enters into the storage tank and the oil product contacts with air to react and deteriorate, thus the quality of oil product will be affected. If the pressure of storage tank is higher than the atmospheric pressure, lots of oil product will volatilize into atmosphere, the fire and explosion accidents may occurs. So, as for the internal floating roof storage tank storing the combustible liquid of low flash point, the nitrogen sealing system is usually equipped in the top of storage tank and the nitrogen is filled into the gas-phase space in the top of storage tank to isolate the air; meanwhile, the nitrogen is filled inside the storage tank to reduce the vaporization of oil and gas and improve the storage safety of oil product. © GCPS 2018.All right reserved.","internal floating roof tank; safety performance of nitrogen sealing; ventilation volume","Atmospheric pressure; Emission control; Energy conservation; Explosions; Nitrogen; Petroleum industry; Phase space methods; Roofs; Sealing (finishing); Springs (components); Tanks (containers); Vaporization; Combustible liquids; Energy saving and emission reductions; Fire and explosion accidents; Internal floating roof tank; Oil and gas accumulation; Petrochemical industry; Safety performance; Sealing technology; Seals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095775556

Results indicate B2-B20 had only a marginal effect on heating values, fuel blend density, and maximum power. Relative to neat diesel, the blends showed a 1-5% lower specific fuel consumption (SFC) with B5 lowest. Mileage was 1-5% higher with the blends with B5 highest. CO decreased with increasing blend. THC emissions of B1-B20 were roughly half that of diesel. NOx from the CME blends was marginally lower than diesel. The CO and THC trends agreed with published literature and usually ascribed to overall lean mixtures and increased amount of oxygenated fuel at higher CME blends.

Owing to Oil refineries producing below designed capacity and not meeting with demand for transportation fuel in the country. This has been investigated to result from weak maintenance culture, technical issues and increase in population etc. The result has led to several man-hour losses, overdependence on foreign imported refined products and many more not to mention. Presently, production network processes via the transportation sector has been hindered due to the paucity sustainability of fuel supply. Auspiciously, Nigeria holds an abundant of Natural Gas deposits of 187tcf proven reserves which is underutilized in several sectors, especially the transportation sector which accommodate about 75% of the total energy usage in the country. Hence, the idea of using LNG as a transportation fuel is well-thought-out. This paper looks at the thermodynamic effect and computational fluid considerations involved in applying the LNG as a transportation fuel to attain longer distance travel. A numerical simulation was conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine the pressure distribution of the cryogenic tanks as well as the thermal effect of atmospheric disturbances through computational fluid dynamics. The result of atmospheric temperature is measured to be 25°C and as a result inlet velocity is set at 183.2 K. The LNG temperature initialized at -155, while the tank pressure equals 1.2bar. The tank heating and the heat flux is simulated for 5 hours per day km. Initial volume of LNG cryogenic storage tank is 60 liters, initial LNG temperature of 162°c, heat leakage per hour each day were measured to be 1.3 W and 1 bar, respectively. Initial mass flow rates of LNG Boil-off gas production (kg) 1%, 1.2%, 1.4%, 1.6% and 1.8%. Atmospheric Heat (KJ/h) and Mass Flow Rate the results are 0%, 0%, 0.000187% 0.000551% and 0.0009262% respectively. LNG can be used to transport vehicles to a very long distance of 1300Km without re-fill. Finally, the likelihood of utilizing LNG as a transportation fuel will be of immense economic and environmental benefit over Gasoline, diesel and CNG to the midstream sector.

That is, the case study of the giant Bachaquero-02 reservoir, there is a lack of Rhob data in the spatial data sets that prevent a good assessment of the storage capacity in the petrophysical model and thus wrong original oil in place estimation. This paper, therefore, presents a solution to this problem; this work develops a methodology for predicting formation density values which establish a link between probabilistic interpretations from multi-mineral solution and deterministic predictions from multiple linear regression with the main objective of seeking a mathematical expression which describes the best fit for the Bachaquero Member and Laguna Member in each location. The manner of estimating formation density can vary according to the available data in well logs, as a first step, this technique uses classic lithology indicators from well logging such as gamma ray, spontaneous potential and resistivity index to calculate the most probable minerals in the rock with the purpose of assessing a probabilistic approach, the second stage is to create a prediction model with surrounding wells, the input data, which is the probabilistic outcome and measured logs, it is trained using a ‘least squares’ regression routine that will find the best fit in the data for bulk density reckoning. A reliable formation density profile according to the lithology of the reservoir was obtained for each well. The model shows more than 0.9 of correlation coefficients between the density measured by wire-line services and the new bulk density reproduced in this method. Particularly, the Bachaquero-02 reservoir has a notorious heterogeneity along the stratigraphic column; the Bachaquero Member has different depositional environment and rock properties in comparison with Laguna Member which has poor quality reservoir rock. This workflow has the ability to incorporate reservoir heterogeneities in the probabilistic module without a problem.

For the tight oil reservoir, large scale and high pumping rate multi-stage fracturing in horizontal wells and fracture diversion technique are recommended to smash the reservoirto create a fracture network of natural fractures and artificial fractures for oil and gas flow. The aim is to increase reservoir stimulation volume and the artificial fracture area. Meanwhile, nanometer high efficient oil washing agent is added in the fracturing fluid. By changing rock wettability, the oil-wet interface is turned water-wet, and the capillary force is changed from imbibition resistance to imbibition drive, boosting spontaneous imbibition. Therefore, the biobased solvent and surfactant can work in synergy to separate the oil film from pore and throat surface, realizing displacement of oil by water. Experimental data shows the application the nanometer oil displacement agent can enhance the oil displacement efficiency of core by12%. After fracturing, the well should be shut down for some time. The shut-down time should take the reservoir pressure and temperature, pore structure and connectivity and the imbibition capacity of the fracturing fluid etc into account, and can be worked out by spontaneous imbibition experiment and NMR etc to guide field operation. This technology has been used 10 well times in tight oil reservoirs in western China, including 3 well times of key exploration well stimulation, and 7 well times of old well repeated fracturing, all the treatments have achieved good effect. Among them, one well worth special note, this well had no production before fracturing, but obtained a high production of 42t a day after fracturing. During the shutdown of well, the fracturing fluid in the artificial fracture network can contact fully with micro-pores in the matrix and displace the oil in them through imbibition to the fracture system, then the oil can flow along the fracture network to the well bottom. The high efficient imbibition fracturing technology for tight oil reservoir is a revolution in fracturing. With fracturing fluid system and well shutdown different from traditional fracturing, this technology can enhance fracturing effect and more importantly oil recovery. This paper has great guidance and reference significance for engineers and researchers engaged in tight oil development.

The impact of pressure ratio distribution curve on the system energy efficiency suggests that the change curve of the characteristics vary in different heat exchanger performance. Results show that the change of thermal transfer reactor performance leads to the variety of optimal distribution pressure ratio and energy efficiency of the system.

Researches determined that well J-502 was causing these operational problems, in response it was decided to install a sand trap at the well head in order to evaluate its effectiveness. The device has a simple design without moving parts and counts with a separate solid storage area, which allows disposing the retained sand without affecting the production of the oil well. Its principle of capture is the speed reduction due to fluids expansion, based on Stokes’ Law. In addition, its inlet is connected to the well head and the outlet to flow line. The data used for the design of the equipment were: Oil API Gravity 31.5°, Oil Rate: 1969 Barrels per Day, BS&W 20.4%, Gas Rate 14.9 MMSCFD, Operating Pressure 1350 psig, the size of sand grains, which varies between 90 and 600 microns and its density (1,304 gr/cc). This information was used to calculate the dimensions of the equipment (Diameter and Length) necessary to decant the sand particles inside of it. After installing the sand trap, the number of stoppage in the flow station dropped from 18 per year to none, preventing deferred production of more than 7,600 barrels of crude per year, with savings in maintenance costs up to 30,000 US$ per year. Likewise, after 84 days operating, it was able to retain as much as 4 cubic meters of sand (141 cubic feet). In conclusion, the success achieved demonstrated the effectiveness of this useful device and its profitability was proved through an economical evaluation. Finally, the sand trap represents an innovative and effective solution in cases where the sand cannot be retained from the bottom hole. For this reason, it would be recommended to implement this solution in wells with sand production problems, and in a greater extend, in downstream facilities such as flow stations, in order to enhance effectiveness by using a higher capability device interconnected to various wells instead of one sand trap for each well, this will reduce manufacturing and installation costs.

SO2 is separated from a tail end wet scrubber using H2O2, producing a 15-25wt% H2SO4 solution, which is injected into the boiler producing SO2, thus creating a sulphur loop. The recirculated sulphur will increase the gas concentration of SO2 in the boiler and decrease the Cl/S ratio of the deposits and ashes, thus producing a less corrosive environment for the superheaters. Furthermore, the lower chlorine content of the boiler deposits also significantly decreased the dioxin formation rates as well as dioxin emissions. Sulphur Recirculation was initially demonstrated in pilot plant tests as well as full-scale tests at a Waste to Energy plant in Göteborg (Sweden) during nearly two months of operation. Babcock & Wilcox Vølund AB in Sweden has installed their Sulphur Recirculation technology in one of the two Waste-to Energy lines at Maabjerg Energy Center (MEC) in Denmark in order to combat high temperature corrosion and dioxin formation. This is the first commercial installation and it has been operating since mid-October 2016. Sulphur Recirculation decreased the high temperature corrosion rates of the superheaters in this full-scale installation by approximately 50%, which may increase green electricity production from combustion of biomass and waste in the future. Furthermore, the dioxin gas concentrations decreased by 72%. Sulphur Recirculation almost entirely decreased the need for costly road transports of effluent sulphate water for the Sulphur Recirculation line, since most sulphur from the waste now ends up in the ashes instead of creating a surplus dilute Na2SO4 solution. The sulphur content of the waste varies with time, which may create periods of sulphur surplus and deficit respectively. Most of these variations are being evened out by a storage vessel for H2SO4. These variations may facilitate a small market of waste sulphuric acid between plants in the future. © Sulphur 2018 + Sulphuric Acid.All rights reserved.",,"Boiler corrosion; Boiler deposits; Boilers; Chlorine compounds; Corrosion rate; High temperature corrosion; Organic pollutants; Patents and inventions; Pilot plants; Scrubbers; Sodium sulfate; Sulfur compounds; Sulfuric acid; Superheaters; Waste incineration; Commercial installation; Corrosive environment; Gas concentration; Green electricity; Patented technology; Pilot plant test; Recirculation line; Waste-to-energy plants; Effluents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086583464

It deals with materials at a molecular and atomic scale and is predicted that it will affect all aspects of our lives. Nano-materials are a major branch of nanotechnology that is characterized by different behaviors. One of the promising nano-materials that are expected to play an important role in industry is the carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs improve the efficiency of many tools, e.g., energy storage, electrical cables, and ultra-capacitors. CNTs exhibit very different features under extreme conditions, such as high pressure. In addition, doping carbon nanotubes with nitrogen might enhance their performance and allows them for more advanced applications. In this study, we examined nitrogen-doped CNTs (CNX-NTS) under high pressure. We used 1.5% and 5.4% CNX-NTS samples that were exposed to pressure range up to 15 GPa. For both samples, there was no phase transformation. The two sample's results suggest that doping of nitrogen strengthens the mechanical property of CNTs. As the results showed, that CNX-NTS can overcome high-pressure rates (more than 15 GPa), and they can be used in applications that encompass high pressure. For example, in oil and gas industry, CNTs can be used in protecting oil and gas operation equipment and structures to provide protection, increase the service life, and decrease the maintenance cost. © 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Doping (additives); Gas industry; Nitrogen; Advanced applications; Electrical cables; Extreme conditions; Industrial revolutions; Maintenance cost; Oil and Gas Industry; Oil and gas operations; Ultracapacitors; Carbon nanotubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085408980

A high thermal density data center using these computer systems has resulted in a very high power density at room level. These computer systems are represented by and included in a rack. Normally a standard rack is two meters high and can accommodate an equivalent of 34 thin desktop computer systems. If each system consumes around 300 W, a standard rack in a data center can consume up to 7.2 kW. While a data center can be consisted of hundreds of racks, this results in very high heat dissipation in the data center. For the racks to operate at normal operating conditions, a suitable air conditioning system should be designed to remove the high heat dissipation. Using simple energy balance and steady state analysis is no longer adequate to rely on for a proper design and analysis of air flow and temperature distributions in a data center. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a prototype data center is presented to make the case for such modeling. The study is carried out using CFD simulation techniques as embedded in the commercially available CFD code (ANSYS V.16). The CFD modeling techniques solved the continuity, momentum and energy conservation equations in addition to standard k – ε model equations for turbulence closure. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Controlling prosumers is an enabling solution of satisfying network constraints via prosumers’ flexible consumption/production. In addition to energy price, the grid tariffs comprise a large proportion of electricity bill in Denmark, and thus should be given full consideration in the optimization of operational strategy. In this paper, prosumers with PV and battery storage optimize their schedule via a supplier considering the grid tariffs’ influences. Taking into account the impact of negative electricity prices, PV curtailment phenomenon is modeled in the formulation of the optimization problem. The battery’s charging/discharging schedule is optimized in conjunction with PV curtailment using the MILP mathematical programming method. Different case studies are analyzed in simulations to emphasize the significance of tariff model for incentivizing flexibility.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) as their fast response speed is an effective way to improve the frequency regulation capability without involving more synchronous generators. Meanwhile, with the growth of battery technology and the reduction of investment cost, utility-scale BESS with multiple battery sub-modules (BSM) becomes the dominating type in the near future. However, current frequency regulation control (FRC) of BESS focuses more on the system requirement without considering characteristics of each BSM and their need of shallow cycle operation profile (SCOP). Thus, a FRC for BESS considering SCOP as SCOP-based FRC is proposed in this paper. Finally, promising results are shown in Matlab\Simulink, including the system frequency performance and the power output of BESS equipped with multiple BSM. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

A model of solar-assisted distributed heating and cooling (DHC) system integrated with energy storage is presented. Then a comprehensive evaluation index which consists of energy, environmental and economic benefit is established using judgment matrix approach. This planning problem is solved by employing the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Taking the separate production (SP) system as reference, the result shows that the proposed DHC system is feasible in investment and has good performance in reducing pollution emission.

However, material balance requires availability of average reservoir pressure measurements, as these data is a critical input for its calculations. Alas, there are multiple scenarios where reservoir pressure cannot be measured as it requires for the well to be shut-in and this is subject to economic and operational restrictions. In contrast, daily production data is commonly available and can be used to calculate the HCIIP by applying any production data analysis technique, such as the Dynamic Material Balance (DMB) method. It was widely demonstrated in recent years, how the application of such methods to volumetric gas reservoirs and naturally fractured reservoirs produced accurate and reliable estimations. Nevertheless, for the case of water drive gas reservoirs, were the water influx term should be introduced into the iterative process, research is scarce and field case applications are limited. An extension to the DMB technique for water-drive gas reservoirs is presented in this paper. A methodology for simultaneous estimation of the Original Gas-in-place (OGIP) and the water influx term is derived and detailed. This is achieved by coupling the DMB technique with the Fetkovich aquifer model. Average reservoir pressure estimation can also be attained as a result of the coupled method. This method was validated by means of numerical simulation on a synthetic model and a field study case. The OGIP, water influx volumes and average reservoir pressure calculated by the proposed coupled method were compared with simulator output where relative error was found to be negligible. Furthermore, application of the coupled method to the field study case yielded comparable results to those obtained by application of the volumetric method and conventional material balance.

Nowadays, electric buses are promising alternative solutions to replace the conventional diesel buses in public transport and to improve the air quality thanks to their zero-tail pipe emissions. However, the major challenges of these technologies are the battery systems (in terms of cost, design and sizing, lifetime, state-of-charge, etc.), charging infrastructure (in terms of location, charging power, charging time, charging scenarios and cost) and bus autonomy. Therefore, in this paper, a co-design optimization framework based on simulation design tool is developed to select the proper battery technology (in terms of chemistry, capacity, voltage, etc.) taking into account its lifetime constraints and to provide the best charging scenario (i.e. Overnight charging or Opportunity charging) and charging management strategy (in terms of charging power and time) for dedicated bus-lines in Brussels city. These bus-lines have been selected by STIB company (bus operator in Brussels) in the framework of an EU project, called ELIPTIC.

This technology makes use of a hydraulic system to reduce the fuel consumption of the vehicle. MISER achieves this by means of a combination of regenerative braking, hydraulics and using gas compression to provide an almost loss-free medium for fast storing and fast release of energy that contributes to optimized engine performance. The system uses a hydraulic Pump/Motor (P/M) and nitrogen filled accumulators to store the excess and unwanted kinetic energy and reuse the stored energy at the latter stage. The hydraulic Pump/Motor (P/M) is a critical component in the system and very little is known of its performance characteristics. This study provides clarity on the development of the system model and the performance of the hydraulic system P/M. The system model consists of a Nitrogen-filled hydraulic accumulator, a MISER P/M, a reservoir and a flywheel which is used to represent the inertia of the vehicle. The model has been developed and implemented in MATLAB Simulink. An integration Solver is used to simultaneously solve the governing equations and predict the system performance.

The challenge consists in storage of mixtures of Hydrogen in natural gas in existing UGS facilities. UGS are usually connected to the gas grid and that is the reason why the consequences of the injection and storage of Hydrogen/natural gas admixtures for all UGS types have to be assessed. Considering adding Hydrogen into Underground Gas Storages, an important point not to forget is that, for the same volume, Hydrogen gas carries three time less energy than natural gas, resulting in reduced marketable storage capacities. The review of research programs and experiments with Hydrogen storage, allow to conclude that salt caverns are by nature more compatible with Hydrogen storage. Concerning storage in porous rock, such as aquifers or former gas or oil fields, phenomena of dissolution in water, fingering and confinement under caprock are mostly similar to the ones obtained with Methane (CH4) and should need only little additional research. A major issue remains the possible chemical/biological reaction in porous reservoirs, which has already been observed in some of former manufactured gas storages. Potential risks are linked to the consumption of Hydrogen by microorganisms, implying H2S generation, development of biofilms in the vicinity of wells, and even pore clogging in the worst case. A special attention should be paid to well integrity regarding risks of steel corrosion, elastomers fractures in the sealing elements and reaction to the cement. Expected impact on surface facilities is similar to gas transmission lines and compression stations, but the specific storage conditions, especially the significantly higher pressures, have to be taken into account. Furthermore, some specific aspects as consequences on the storage performance by lowering of compression power, corrosion of steel under carbon dioxide (CO2), impact on desulfurization and dehydration processes have to be assessed. In order to complete our knowledge on the impacts generated by Hydrogen/natural gas admixture injection into underground natural gas storages, we recommend the following working axes: Reinterpretation of previous observations on the former manufactured gas storages. Laboratories tests and monitoring on microbiological reactivity of subsurface Hydrogen with different water/gas compositions and at reservoir conditions. Laboratories tests on material. Pilot storage in a porous reservoir which formation water contains sulfates. Pilot storage in a salt cavern to get technological information about operating issues. Check list for each facility to review the compatibility of wells and surface facility equipment with a given H2 content. The conclusion is that research programs are needed before standardization on H2 content in natural gas before injection in underground storage facilities. Marcogaz will promote these programs and recommend that they are based on a wide European cooperation among stakeholders. © 27th World Gas Conference, WGC 2018.

The optimal strategy depends on required working volume, injection and withdrawal rates, and acceptable quality of the produced gas. Storing natural gas in reservoirs containing lower quality native gas may be attractive from the economic point of view. On the other hand, a technical risk related to the produced gas quality should be considered. This risk can be minimized by the use of the computer simulation and optimization. In the presented case of Wierzchowice UGS in Poland the simulation has been employing during all life cycle of the UGS. At the beginning simulation studies were conducted to assess whether the residual gas will affect the quality of the withdrawn gas. Then results were used to optimize strategy of gas injection and withdrawal to manage the high quality working gas volume and lower quality cushion gas. In the successive years, the model has been updated and improved by adding elements of artificial intelligence. The case study presented in this paper shows that application of artificial intelligence tool resulted in improving energy produced from the storage by 2,4% in one withdrawal cycle. The example of Wierzchowice UGS, operated by Polish Oil and Gas Company, shows that storing high quality gas in lower quality reservoir can be effective both technically and economically. Performance of the UGS can be improved significantly by combination of optimization and artificial intelligence methods. © 27th World Gas Conference, WGC 2018.

However, the inherent supercooling and phase separation of the hydrated inorganic salts severely limit the practical application of magnesium chloride hexahydrate. In order to develop a high performance magnesium chloride hexahedral magnesium chloride phase change material, a new phase change material (PCM) is prepared by compositing MgCl2·6H2O with the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) of different mass fractions, and its thermophysical properties are measured. The results show that the phase transition temperature of MgCl2·6H2O is 119 °C and the phase change enthalpy is 120 kJ / kg. The composite phase change material has the same melting point, but a lower phase change enthalpy. The phase change enthalpy reaches 109.5 kJ/kg, with a the C3N4 mass fraction of 80%, and increases with the mass fraction. The pure MgCl2·6H2O is easy to absorb the water in air and the mass change reaches up to 5% in just one hour. Compositing MgCl2·6H2O with C3N4 helps prevent the hydrate absorbing water. With the C3N4 mass fraction of 85%, the mass change can be limited within 0.4% in two hours. The composite phase change material also has a better thermal stability. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) test shows the weight loss rate of the composite PCM at 300 °C is 10.92% less than pure MgCl2·6H2O. The MgCl2·6H2O/C3N4 composite has a thermal conductivity of 0.51 W/m K, greater than the pure MgCl2·6H2O. And the composite still suffers a high subcooling degree. But after adding 2% SrCl2·6H2O, the high subcooling degree of MgCl2·6H2O/C3N4 around 25 °C can be almost eliminated. On overall, compositing MgCl2·6H2O with C3N4 enhances the thermophysical properties of MgCl2·6H2O, making it a great choice for medium-temperature thermal energy storage materials. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Excess energy stored in a suitable form has been able to bridge this energy demand/supply gap significantly. Thermal energy storage with the use of phase change materials (PCMs), which feature to high energy storage density and nearly isothermal operating characteristic, is an effective way to solve the problems of energy storage and conservation. Poor heat transfer performance is the common drawback for most potential PCMs due to the low thermal conductivity. Therefore, this study investigates the performance enhancement of palmitic and stearic acids eutectic mixture (PA-SA) with the additions of different microstructure and dimension carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplatelets and expanded graphite) as heat transfer promoters. Composite PCMs filled with carbon materials were prepared at various loadings by melt blending method. The microstructure, thermal properties, thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs were measured. The heat transfer performance of the composite PCMs were investigated by the thermal energy storage/release test in a phase change unit. The results show that all the carbon materials can improve the thermal conductivity of PA-SA effectively, but it also weakens the natural convection of PA-SA in liquid state. The heat transfer performances results show that expended graphite with three-dimensional network structure is more effective addition for enhancing the heat transfer of the PCMs compared with other carbon materials. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Cyber-physical systems (CPS), autonomous vehicles, robotics, additive technologies, and alternative energy systems, are under draconian scientific investigations, leading to incredible achievements, with the promise to replace humans in future supply chain operations. Thus, as the technological trend improves into the future, the question is asked, to what extent do the tendencies support sustainability and how secure is the current technology, or the decision to adopt new ones to improve product delivery, material handling and organize storage conservatively without causing havoc in the society. As such, maximize profits while meeting societal satisfaction.

However, they suffer from disadvantages of low thermal conductivity, super cooling, volume expansion and corrosion issue. To address these problems, this article reported a thermally-enhanced PCM composite for passive thermal management with microencapsulated phase change material slurry (MPCMS) saturated in metal foam. Microencapsulation technology for PCM avoided the super cooling, volume expansion during phase change, and segregated the core PCM from environment to solve the corrosion issue. The addition of metal foam was aimed to further enhance the heat transfer rate. The experimental system to evaluate the flow and thermal performances of the MPCMS/foam composite was built. The case of pristine MPCMS was employed as the control group. The thermal characteristics of MPCMS and MPCMS/foam modules in terms of surface/internal temperatures were extracted and compared. The effects of natural convection of slurry and foam geometries on the surface temperature of MPCMS/foam were investigated. Experiment results showed that significant temperature reduction in the heated surface was achieved by MPCMS/foam composite at the penalty of shrinking the thermal management time since metal foam enhanced heat transfer rate and reduced the latent heat density. The natural convection of slurry exerted important role in heat transfer of MPCMS, but was almost suppressed in the compact pore structure in MPCMS/foam composite. Moreover, lower porosity MPCMS/foam composite had lower surface temperature than higher porosity composite. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

In this work, the temperature-dependent dynamic viscosities of two pure sugar alcohols (d-mannitol and d-dulcitol) and their binary eutectic mixture (70 mol% d-mannitol) were measured experimentally over a wide temperature range (393.15-533.15 K). At each temperature point of interest, measurements were undertaken at various shear rates from 0.1 s-1 to 300 s-1. Upon establishing the viscosity-temperature curves, the Arrhenius model was adopted to correlate the dynamic viscosity as a function of temperature by curve fitting. The activation energies Eη of the pure sugar alcohols are determined based on curving fitting. It was found that the pure and mixture sugar alcohols, either in the melt or in the supercooled liquid state, show non-Newtonian behaviors at the full shear rate range. The dynamic viscosities decrease exponentially with increasing the temperature, and the values of d-mannitol and d-dulcitol are 36.0 mPas and 18.5 mPas, respectively at their melting temperatures. D-mannitol present a higher activation energy of 41418.77 J/mol than that of d-dulcitol (38505.54 J/mol). © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

However, current studies about the analysis and optimization of absorption heat pump cycle still have some disadvantages, especially about the optimization theory and method. In this contribution, the entransy theory is applied to analyze the ideal solution and ideal absorption heat pump cycle to investigate the operation principle of the absorption heat pump. The entransy variation between the pure state and solution state of the solvent is derived, which is not considered before. Besides, actual absorption heat pump systems are simplified to the ideal absorption heat pump cycle to find out the performance limit of the cycle, and the entransy analysis model of the ideal cycle is constructed. The entransy analysis model presents that due to the solution concentration difference in the heat pump, the ideal cycle of absorption pumps cannot be completely reversible. Besides, the COP of the ideal cycle is always equal to 2, hence the COP cannot simply describe the system performance. However, the irreversibility of the system, i.e. the entransy dissipation in the solution heat exchanger can be used to describe the effect of solution concentration difference on the system. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

To explore the gravity effects on natural convection melting, two dimensional and three dimensional lattice Boltzmann model are established to solve the phase change heat transfer. Firstly, the average Nusselt number and total liquid fraction are examined under different gravity conditions. It is found that the increasing gravitational acceleration plays a positive effect on the natural convection effect, and results in the pronounced increment of melting rate. In addition, a three dimensional simulation of natural convection melting is performed, and the evolution of its temperature distribution shows similar trends with the two dimensional model. Moreover, the three dimensional effects during natural convection melting are discussed by the comparison of total liquid fraction with two dimensional lattice Boltzmann model. Numerical results show that a considerable difference exists in the two dimensional and three dimensional lattice Boltzmann models. It might be caused by the depressed natural convection in three dimensional lattice Boltzmann models where there are walls along z direction. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

This paper aims at probing the physics of latent TES through numerical modelling with a focus on morphological evolution of mushy zone and influence of mushy zone constant (Amush) during melting process. Mushy zone refers to a two-phase mixed region appearing between solid phase and liquid phase under non-isothermal solid-fluid phase change conditions, while Amush comes from a damping term of momentum equations in the enthalpy-porosity model to simulate fluid flow within the mushy zone. In the present study, the melting of lauric acid in a simple rectangular TES container has been modelled numerically, and our predictions have been validated in comparison with experimental results from the literature [12]. It has been found that the morphological evolution of mushy zone, including the marching speed and the overall thickness variation, is strongly relevant to the local heat transfer mechanisms, both heat conduction and natural convection. In addition, our results also indicate that Amush is a critical parameter for performance prediction of mushy zone phase-change processes. A higher Amush value generally corresponds to a slower PCM melting process, mainly because it implies larger flow resistance and weaker natural convection within the mushy zone. Further experimental work and theoretical analysis are ongoing to capture microscopic morphological evolutions and determine appropriate Amush values for modelling mushy zone phase change processes. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Moreover, it is also a hot research field, which involves the latent heat storage (used in the industrial waste heat recovery system, the building energy saving, and the solar power system), the crystallization of crystals, the solidification processing in metals and alloys, and so on. The research on the solid-liquid phase change has never been hung. Besides experiment, numerical methods are another study tools. The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has drawn much attention in the field of solid-liquid phase change owing to its natural parallel and transient characteristic. Compared with the CPU parallel, GPU parallel is more suitable for some scientific calculations. Unfortunately, the internal memory of GPU is much less than that of CPU, which limit the number of the gird size, especially for three-dimension simulation. In order to reduce the internal memory demand, we propose a fractional-step LB method for solid-liquid phase change. Compared with the general LB model, the present one needs less internal memory with the same mesh number. The analytical solutions and published numerical solutions are compared with the present results for verification. Results shows that the present model is able to simulate solid-liquid phase change. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Here, we will consider the possibility of combining diurnal photovoltaic (PV) conversion and nocturnal radiative cooling (RC) process in a single system (PV-RC system). We know that conventional PV panel has high solar absorption within PV conversion band to enlarge electricity production, whereas single RC emitter exhibits high emissivity within atmospheric window (i.e., 8 μm ~ 13 μm) to achieve space cooling. Thus, integrating aforementioned two spectral characteristics in a single unit is a feasible method for PV-RC hybrid system. Considering the cooling of PV cells in diurnal PV process, high emissivity of such a unit in thermal radiation band (i.e., 4 μm~25 μm) is better than that just in atmospheric window(i.e., 8 μm ~13 μm). In this work, a composite panel was proposed and manufactured by laminating mono-crystalline cells onto a 3.2mm glass for trial to achieve both diurnal PV and nocturnal RC. The result of spectral characterization shows such a panel exhibits high spectral emissivity (absorptivity) in PV conversion band and thermal radiation band (i.e., 0.3μm ~1.1 μm and 4 μm~25 μm). A simplified PV-RC hybrid system was also mounted and the experiments were carried out both at daytime and nighttime in Hefei, China. It is found that the diurnal PV conversion efficiency of the system is approximately 11.75% and the nocturnal equilibrium temperature of panel is about 10.0℃ lower than ambient temperature, which proves that such a panel has considerable performance for both diurnal PV and nocturnal RC.

The number of research works in the field of PCM is growing very fast, and, as in many other fields of heat transfer, things are sometimes re-discovered or re-invented. This lecture's first aim is to give an historical perspective of heat transfer research in this rich and important field. It is shown that, in fact, the true interest in it arose first about half a century ago, in connection with the space exploration. In fact, many prominent heat transfer researchers contributed to this field, and it is demonstrated in the lecture how their insightful work remains more than relevant today. The second aim of this lecture is to present state-of-the-art of heat transfer enhancement in PCM, because these materials are notorious for their low thermal conductivity. Various enhancement methods are outlined and their merits are evaluated. Among those methods, we discuss extended surfaces, conductive additions, porous matrices, nanoparticles and PCM-based slurries. The presentation is based, to a very large extent, on the author's personal knowledge and experience in PCM systems, partially reflected in a number of very recent publications of our laboratory.

To improve its technological maturity simultaneous investigation on more than one length scale, ranging from molecular level up to system level, is required. In this work, the results of a multi-scale approach are presented to investigate the potential for thermochemical heat storage. On molecular scale, atomic-scale Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are performed, which are upscaled to molecular level via a Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) approach. The newly developed ReaxFF approach is used for in-silico characterization of the material properties of magnesium and calcium chloride hydrates. On grain scale, the focus is on numerical and experimental analyses of the dehydration reaction kinetics and the accompanying heat and mass transfer processes. Lithium sulfate monohydrate (Li2SO4 ·H2O) is used as model material. Microscope experiments are carried out on the dehydration reaction of encapsulated single crystals of lithium sulfate monohydrate to gain insight into the nucleation process at the surface and the reaction kinetics in the substrate. On material scale, the challenge lies in synthesizing an optimized material showing enough thermal and mechanical stability, sufficiently fast kinetics and mass and heat transfer properties to obtain the required power, and adequately high enough energy density. Calcium chloride salt hydrate has been tested in its pure form, when encapsulated in an inert material and when impregnated in a porous matrix. On reactor scale, a detailed understanding of the transport phenomena for heat and mass transfer is needed. During the (de)hydration process in a cylindrical packed bed reactor, the wall creates radial effects due to heat losses, flow channeling and a non-uniform state of charge. A detailed 2D model for the transport phenomena in a packed bed is developed. The model is validated using experimental data measured in a 1L lab-scale setup and unique experimental results on adsorbed water concentration from MRI experiments.

The nanofluid is usually used as the heat transfer fluid to directly absorb the solar radiation energy. However, the volume fraction of nanoparticle is extremely small, which is in general far lower than 1 vol%, because of the high extinction coefficient of particle in nano-scale. The micro-encapsulated phase change material (MPCM) slurry is currently popular in the fields of energy transport and storage due to large heat capacity. Therefore, a concept that adopting MPCM slurry as the heat transfer fluid and energy storage medium rather than nanofluid in the volumetric absorption solar collector is proposed in the present study. The optical property of micro-scale particle is not as good as that of nano-scale particle so that the extinction coefficient of the slurry can be enhanced through increasing the volume fraction of particle, which can make full use of the large heat capacity of the MPCM. The extinction coefficient of the MPCM slurry with relatively large particle size and high volume fraction compared with nanofluid is firstly estimated to validate the feasibility of the MPCM slurry as the heat transfer fluid in the volumetric absorption solar collector. Then the Eulerian mixture model is built to investigate the thermal performance of the volumetric absorption solar collector based on the MPCM slurry. The thermal performance of the VASC using the slurry without phase change is also studied for comparison. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

A coaxial flow microfludic device was used to produce the monodisperse heptadecane-in-monomer droplets with predetermined core/shell volume ratios. The heptadecane, monomer and an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution were injected into the device from different inlet of the microfluidic device. By controlling the inlet velocities of the three phases, the core and shell thicknesses of the droplets could be controlled independently. The size of the core was controlled in the range of 100-500 μm, meanwhile the shell thickness was tuned in the range of 10-100 μm.

In present paper, an experimental comparative investigation of modelling test cells combined PCM wallboards is carefully described conducted. The experiment compares the test cells with and without PCM wallboards, and with different PCM wallboards that have different PCM positions (in exterior surface and interior surface). The two experimental cells are located in the artificial climate chamber named thermal storage and ventilation (TSV) laboratory, which could be controlled by the daily temperature change condition and the dynamic temperature change condition of the heating/cooling. A set of experimental data is obtained in detail, concerning the temperature of the air, PCM layers and the wallboard surfaces, temperatures and the heat flux that through the wallboards. The results show that the PCM wallboards can significantly stabilize the indoor air and inner wallboard surface temperature fluctuations, and substantially increase the temperature delay effect. This experiment shows that PCMs installed in the exterior surface of wallboard could obtain better thermal storage effect. Moreover, this paper put forward a new kind of index to evaluation the effect of envelopes thermal storage ability.

The optimal PCM temperature and the optimal HTF temperature in the metal-foam-enhanced thermal storage device are derived. The results show that the solid-liquid interface of the pure PCM is a line, and that of the mixture PCM is a mushy area. Natural convection in the melting liquid is very intensive for a PCM without porous medium. The porous medium weakens the natural convection, and makes temperature field, flow field and solid-liquid interface distribution more homogeneous.

Composite PCMs now is the mainstream. In the application of PCMs, OA often be filled in the substrate, like porous, framework and microencapsulated matrix, in nanoscale form. Although, OA greatly influenced by size effect, its macro thermal properties usually used in the composite's design. In order to further develop efficient composite PCMs based on OA, it is essential to study OA's thermal properties in nanoscale. In this study, we performed the atom-scale simulation through a top-down approach based on equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) to calculated the thermal conductivity(k) of OA with bulk, nanowire and nanochain. Vibrational density of states(VDOS) and phonon overlap energy were used to explore size scale of k. There is the greatest k of nanochain in 3 form and the smallest is nanowire. Size effect limit atoms vibration and weaken phonon match level of nanowire that results its k lower than bulk. But for nanochain, the effect of better nanostructure for heat transfer is much greater than attenuate by nanosize, with the VDOS peak shifting to lower frequency and phonon overlap energy enhancing. For the composite materials, especially for multilevel porous structure, it is better for materials design to choose appropriate k of filled OA. Our findings can provide a viable guidance for high-efficient thermal management designs of composite phase change materials. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Joule heat caused by internal resistance is a major source of the heat generation of supercapacitors, which is strongly related to the transport behavior of energy carriers (i.e., electrons and ions). In this work, electrochemical and thermal tests are conducted to study the heat generation performance of graphene-based supercapacitors. A density functional theory calculation combined with non-equilibrium Green's function is employed to explore the electron transport behavior. Ion diffusion in nanoscale graphene channels is investigated with molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that, compared with those employing activated carbons, graphene-based supercapacitor presents lower heat generation rate, consistent with its lower internal resistance. The resistance of electron transport is mainly from graphene inter-layers and the interface between graphene and current collector. Ion transport within nano-sized graphene channels presents different properties with those in bulk electrolytes. Sub-nanometer channels could induce deformation of hydration shells, leading to higher resistance.

In order to relieve the stress of grid and ensure the electricity supply, peak load shifting is an effective option. Buildings are consuming a huge amount of energy for space heating, ventilation and cooling. Using building thermal inertia to shift peak load has attracted more and more attention. By using thermal inertia, heat supplied during off-peak periods can be stored in the construction materials, and used in peak demand hours. However, peak shaving shall not sacrifice the indoor thermal comfort. The objective of this work is to investigate the impact of demand shifting by using thermal inertia on the indoor temperature.

Composite PCMs filling with high thermal conductivity materials have been proposed to solve this issue, but the latent heat of the composite PCMs decrease with the fillings loading accordingly. Therefore, a compromise between the thermal conductivity and latent heat is significant to the performance of the composite PCMs. In this study, we dedicated to optimizing the thermal conductivity of composite PCM to confirm a sufficient latent heat storage process and the least latent heat reduction simultaneously. A thermal resistance model of a typical phase-change based thermal storage unit (TSU) was developed to predict the optimal thermal conductivity. The accuracy of the model was confirmed by finite elements method (FEM) and the deviations were within 1%. The effect of heat flux, the aspect ratio of TSU, and the melting point on the optimal thermal conductivity were further investigated. Results showed that a larger aspect ratio is preferred at a higher heat flux, and a lower melting point will benefit for the performance of TSU. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Also, it is the foundation of energy technology development. In order to overcome the problem that the measurement frequency of polyimide substrate independent detector is lower and the measurement time is longer, based on the relationship among 3ω detection frequency, thermal wave penetration depth and thermal properties of substrate material, this paper developed a Stethoscope-type 3ω independent detector based on sapphire substrate for fast measurement of material thermal conductivity. Nickel, with a high resistance temperature coefficient, was used as the metal detector. The influence of the width of the nickel metal detector and the thickness of the sapphire substrate on the measurement accuracy was analyzed by introducing an effective heat flow ratio. The sapphire substrate independent detector was calibrated by using copper, aluminum,304 stainless steel, quartz glass, ethylene glycol, and Plexiglass with known thermal conductivities. The experiment shows that the measurement frequency of the stethoscope detector can be ten times higher than that of Kapton film independent detector. It's measurement time is only one tenth of the Kapton film independent detector, which greatly reduces the measurement time. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Current risk reduction measures include setting vertical plates around key components of the storage system to prevent gas leaks from spreading over very large areas. This research investigates the concentration profiles of high pressure underexpanded jet flows impinging on a vertical plate in the flow field using both experimental and numerical models. The flow along the ground is also important since the gas dispersion can be significantly expanded when flowing along a horizontal surface, such as the ground; thus, the flow concentrations are also investigated along a horizontal plate below the jet. Two simplified, reduced-order underexpanded jet flow models were used with the results validated against experimental data and simulation results obtained from full CFD models. The concentration profiles in front of the vertical plate decrease exponentially as the axial distance from the nozzle to the plate increases and in the radial direction on the plate. The gas concentrations along the horizontal plate centerline first increase and then decrease far from the nozzle. Both reduced-order models predict reasonable gas concentration profiles along the vertical plate but were not as accurate along the horizontal plate with much less time and computational resources than the full CFD model. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

However, the interactions could be regulated by the surface modification on supporters. Here, the metal organic framework Cr-MIL-101 and mesoporous zeolite MCM-41 were chosen as the supporters, which were modified with functional terminals, such as -NH2 or -OH. A physical blending and impregnation method was applied to assemble the stearic acid(SA) and polyethylene glycol(PEG) into host matrix. FTIR and DSC characterization studies have been conducted to reveal the structural and thermal properties of the achieved PCM composites. Results showed that after amino group, the max mass percentage of SA was increased from 30% of SA@Cr-MIL-101 to 70% of SA@Cr-MIL-101-NH2, besides, the fusion enthalpy was increased from 0 J/g of PEG@MCM-41(-OH) to 58.76 J/g of PEG@MCM-41-NH2. MD simulation was also introduced in to explain the experimental phenomena. It can be concluded that the interaction between core materials and supports could be regulated by modifying the internal surface of supports: suitably reinforced interactions lead higher loading, but too heavy interactions restrict the motion of filler molecules, results in low crystallization, even with no fusion enthalpy. Surface functionalization is indicated to be very salutary to regulate the phase change properties of this core-shell type composite PCMs, such as loading capacity and crystallization, and how to balance those properties is essential to meet a high energy storage efficiency. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

In this paper, a printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) with three supercritical CO2 flow passages and two molten salt flow passages in one unit is proposed, and its thermal-hydraulic performance was simulated. The flow field of S-CO2 remarkably changes along the flow direction, while flow field of molten salt changes little, and the pressure drops of molten salt and S-CO2 are respectively 528.28 Pa and 373.5 Pa. At the inlet stage of S-CO2 flow passage, the heat transfer enhancement occurs due to the high specific heat and the buoyant force, which causes the formation of vortices and disturbs the temperature distribution. With the increase of the fluid temperature in middle stage, the influence of the buoyant force decreases for little density difference, and the specific heat also decreases, so heat transfer deteriorates. In the outlet stage of the heat exchanger, turbulent kinetic energy rapidly develops and heat transfer is enhanced. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Lunar regolith simulant (LRS-1), the research object of this paper, was given the microstructure and element composition by use of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A variety of processing methods were used to modify the thermal conductivity of LRS-1, such as particle sieving, compacting, heating up to sintering and melting under air atmosphere. Four samples were fabricated, including two particle diameter sizes, 500 m and 100 m, and two heating temperatures, 1100°C and 1200°C. The XRD results showed that the sintering and melting processes transformed the crystalline structure of lunar regolith simulant into amorphous structure. The thermal conductivity tester results showed that compacting, sintering and melting processes had improved the thermal conductivity of lunar regolith simulant indeed. The thermal conductivities of sintered and melted samples had been raised hundreds of times as against the native lunar regolith. The particle size also a key factor to influence the thermal conductivity besides the heating temperature. The SEM images of different particle size samples indicated that the porosity increased with particle size under same heating temperature.

The continuous supply of thermal and electrical energy for the scientific equipment and human beings is a crucial issue for the lunar outposts. A conceptual design of static converters for electricity and co-generation heat in a lunar based solar thermal power system with regolith thermal storage is developed and analyzed in this paper. Each converter is comprised of an AMTEC (alkali metal thermal-to-electrical conversion) unit, which operates between ~900-1300 K and ~530-650 K, and is thermally coupled to a bottom cycle consisting of a multitude of TE (thermoelectric) generators. The rejected waste heat at ~350 K by the latter is removed by radiation, which could be used for space heating. The load following characteristics on the conversion efficiency and electrical power output of the AMTEC/TE converters are investigated and discussed. The analytical results show that the static converters offer an excellent option for the lunar based solar thermal power system of co-generation of heat and of electricity. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

Pumped-storage plants account for most of the storage capacity worldwide. It is popular for high capacity, good responsiveness and high efficiency. It can smooth peak loads, therefore plays a vital role in balancing the grid loads and enhancing the grid availability. A pumped-storage station can be operated in generation, pumping or idle states. In order to obtain an optimal plant schedule, a stochastic optimization model is proposed and the sample average approximation method is applied. The proposed model is used to determine the number of units to be hourly scheduled in generation or pumping mode. The model aims to minimize a supply-demand disparity and shortfall function as a weighted score taking into account the hourly grid demand. Furthermore, the model considers the grid demand uncertainty by considering the main two different demand scenarios ""Winter and Summer"", and many constraints which are limiting the operation of a pumped-storage station. The model is solved optimally with a case study derived based on the Ingula pumped-storage station in South Africa. Results show that our model proposes pumping-generating schedules that could eliminate the disparity between demand and supply for both summer and winter demand profiles. Furthermore, it could provide a robust schedule that could work for both demand scenarios. © IEOM Society International.","Demand uncertainty; Energy storage; Mixed integer programming optimization; Optimal pumping and generation scheduling; Pumped-storage station",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067204387

Supply-chain management is very important in the petroleum industry. Few continents have petroleum reserves, hence there is a need for efficient methods of managing the sourcing, storage and distribution processes across the globe. There have been major improvements in safety management practices, during extraction and processing, in transit, and in situ distribution. Bulk storage of petroleum plays a crucial role across the world as it eases distribution hassles and can act as emergency reserves in the event of disruptions in the supply chain. However, lighter fractions of petroleum have a tendency to evaporate during storage as they are highly volatile. Although there are mechanisms such as floating roofs that have been invented to effectively reduce evaporative losses of light petroleum fractions, the percentage of losses are still high, particularly in some climatic conditions. On average, floating roofs allow leeway for loss tolerances of +/- 0.2% of throughput. Unleaded petrol tanks record significant losses beyond the acceptable tolerances. The Botswana climate is semi-arid, which makes bulk oil storage facility manager cautious about prevailing conditions at their storage reserves. Trends analysed show losses well above the stated tolerance range. This article illustrates the analysis conducted to comprehend the root cause for losses experienced by bulk oil storage tanks (BOSTs) and decision making solution to tackle the problem of excessive evaporative losses in similar climatic conditions. © IEOM Society International.","Bulk oil storage tanks; Petroleum; Root cause analysis; Semi-arid; Supply chain",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067184688

The NH3 with PA system increased the thermal stability of the as-synthesized Mg(OH)2. The synthesized MgO and/or Mg(OH)2 were used to confine blended polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 1000 and 6000, 1:1 wt.%) and formed a phase change composite where MgO and Mg(OH)2 served as a matrix to accommodate blended PEG. Both MgO and Mg(OH)2 matrix protected the PEG liquid leakage during the phase transition. The SEM analysis of the composite revealed that considerable amount of PEG was occupying within the pores, well-dispersed on the surfaces of the magnesium oxide porous structure which stabilized by capillary forces and the surface tension.

These discussions and the influence of the energy policy is why the situation in Germany is described as a transition from active to abandoned mining. Many PhD theses have been written within the last 20 years-every single one with a different topic but all with the same issue-the effects and challenges of mining subsidence. These challenges start with the research regarding geological and hydrogeological conditions, which is the basis for calculations like the angle of draw or predictions of subsidence due to water table drawdown. Furthermore, the research investigates issues like risk-management and financial planning. One of these issues is post-mining calculations; others include potential hazards of storage or the use of geothermal energy.

It deals with an overview of the circumstances related to hard coal mining, lignite mining, the use of geothermal energy, gas, and opportunities regarding underground storage.

Aim of the paper is to present Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) in production and utility of the industry. In addition, energy efficiency in production is presented. The energy consumption and production data related to crude oil production is obtained from the Brunei Shell Petroleum company (BSP), and for the natural gas plant is provided by the Brunei Liquefied Natural Gas company (BLNG). The energy consumption in BSP and BLNG is categorized into production and utility. The production category is subdivided into three: gas compression, condensate stabilizer and reformer. The consumption of energy in utility is in storage and transportation of oil and gas. Investigation is based on data from year 2011 to 2015 in the current study. It is found that the average SEC in production at BSP is 202 kWh/bbl. It is found that the energy consumption for production is between 168-315 kWh/bbl [1]. The utility SEC at BSP is found to be 14.85 kWh/bbl. The SEC in utility is 7% of the SEC in production. The efficiency of production in BSP is found to be 88%. The average SEC in production at BLNG is found to be 772 kWh/m3of Liquefied Natural gas (LNG) equivalent to 1.28 kWh/m3 of Natural Gas. The efficiency of production at BLNG is found to be 88%. The efficiency in production at United States refinery is within a range of 84-88% [2], Hence, the efficiency in production at BSP and BLNG is comparable with the US refinery. It is thus concluded that the oil and gas industry in Brunei Darussalam is operating within an acceptable range of SEC and efficiency. In future, the research could be extended to other industries in Brunei Darussalam. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

These nodes are self-organizing and are not controlled by a central administrator. The wide adoption and deployment rate of WSN is as a result of the processing power, wireless communication and the sensing technology that the WSN possesses. The numerous advantages this network holds has led to its growth. As the deployment and acceptability of WSN increases, the vulnerability to attacks is increasing hence the need for effective security mechanisms. Encryption has proven to be a reliable way of data protection hence its adoption in the improvement of the security level in WSNs. Identifying suitable encryption mechanism for WSNs has proven to be a challenge due to the limited amount of energy, computation capability and storage resources of the sensor nodes.

Full earth observation in twenty-four hours under all kinds of climate all around the earth has been realized. However, due to the limited bandwidth and energy resources, these data are not appropriate to be completely downloaded, and on-orbit image processing and data mining techniques are required. On one hand, redundant or invalid data can be removed to save limited bandwidth and energy, on the other hand, the on-orbit images are effectively processed in real time, and the intelligence and emergency response capabilities of earth observation system are enhanced. First, a high-performance computing architecture is established, and a high-performance computing platform based on Xilinx Zynq7000 series SoC chip and Nvidia Jetson TX2 series chip is designed to accomplish the on-orbit high-performance image processing with single point computing capacity of 2TFLOPS, storage capacity of 16Tb. Secondly, the image semantic segmentation on the TX2 hardware platform is realized by using the compressed lightweight deep neural network, and the classification of remote sensing image is achieved with accuracy 87% and 1 image per second prediction speed; On the basis of semantic segmentation, the semantic information of forest coverage and the number of houses is extracted. Finally, the image data retrieval technology is used to effectively organize and manage the images, complete the reception and response after receiving the ground commands, and transmit the effective data information to the ground in time. The verification system is further built to verify the rationality, availability and real-time aspects of the image data modeling and data mining platform, which lays the foundation for the future establishment and improvement of earth observation system. The systematic method proposed in this paper transforms the earth observation mode from the image data downlink reprocessing to the intelligent real-time processing on orbit, thus solve the contradiction between the limited space-earth data bandwidth and the transmission of massive data, and satisfy the realtime monitoring and identification of time-sensitive targets demand. In addition, data mining platform can effectively accomplish tasks such as cloud computing and disaster emergency in various satellites and spacecrafts, leading the transformation of spatial information acquisition and processing mode in China.

During the storage or operation of the SRM, the propellant grain is in a multidirectional stress state, and the maximum elongation of uniaxial tension as the limit of failure restricts the accuracy of the evaluation. The stress states of four typical specimens of high-energy propellant under uniaxial tension, biaxial strip tension, cruciform biaxial tension and uniaxial tension under the confining pressure are analyzed, and the influence factors of stress state on failure performance of propellant are determined. The correlation between the ultimate strain of multiaxial tension-compression and uniaxial tension is established. A failure prediction method which introduces the influence of multiaxial stress state in the Mises failure criterion is proposed, and the rationality of the method is verified by the structural integrity analysis and ground test of an SRM.

With the expansion of space task requirements and the development of space technology, small satellites formation has become a research hotspot in the field of aerospace. Formation satellites are widely used, and it is important to make use of specific formation configuration for earth observation. In order to improve the real-time performance of satellite formation's mission planning and improve the overall performance of formation satellites, it is necessary to study the autonomous mission planning of formation satellites on orbit. The satellite autonomous task scheduling arranges the task requests submitted by users by the various resource constraints. As satellite autonomous task scheduling needs to satisfy many complex constraints, including time window constraints, storage capacity constraints, energy constraints and so on, so it is a combinatorial optimization problem, which has NP-hard character. In this paper, we build a single-objective and multi-constraints model of satellite autonomous task scheduling problem and design an advanced genetic algorithm to optimize the algorithm from the various parts of the genetic operation. Firstly, the constraint model of autonomous mission planning of serial formation satellites is described. A multi-objective function for autonomous mission planning of serial formation satellites is designed. The mission planning model of serial formation satellites is built. An advanced genetic algorithm is designed to solve the mission planning model. Secondly, we design simulation experiments for the above two mission planning algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the algorithms. The experimental results show that the advanced genetic algorithm proposed is more effective and has a better convergence compared with the traditional algorithm.

The key elements for the next generation power systems are high reliability, high specific power, lifetime and cost. The high reliability is the cornerstone of every single spacecraft. A high specific power system allows the reduction of the overall system mass for a given power budget. But it allows also to build more powerful spacecraft within a given mass figures. Lifetime is another crucial parameter of every space system. The target lifetime is usually achieved by an intentional overdesign of the system. The option of the on-orbit servicing is becoming a viable solution in the next future but currently there is no system designed for such occurrence. The financial effort associated to the entire lifecycle is also one of the key figures of a space program. This includes development, industrialization, system integration, testing and other operative aspects. The proposed electrical architecture aims to match all the aforementioned key elements by adopting innovative solutions. In particular, this paper contains a highly diversified system based on Solar Arrays, Fuel Cells, Kinetic Energy System and ultracapacitors. This architecture is easily scalable due to the modular nature of its components and could be integrated in an on-orbit serviceable spacecraft. For commercial application, this may lead to an increased profitability. In the domain of space exploration, it could be integrated into manned and unmanned spacecraft, ensuring a reliable, serviceable and easy to maintain power system. The paper is composed by three main sections. The first describes the main electrical architecture of the system, depicting the benefits and the main mission constraints under the technical and operational point of view. The second part reports a first order sizing of the Electrical Power System, highlighting the design trade-offs and the main technical budgets, with an emphasis on the power source, storage and utilization strategies.

These pathways include energy efficiency and renewable energy production. However, the worldwide current energy infrastructure was designed for conventional technologies, based on fossil fuels that have provided large and cheap energy storage. This flexibility of fossil fuels enables the production of energy whenever is required. On the other hand, variable renewable energy sources (RES) as wind or solar are not flexible since energy production from these sources is intermittent. This intermittent nature introduces barriers to the penetration of energy from these sources into the power supply system, like the struggle to match demand with supply. In some regions, the water supply is limited, and it can worsen due to climate change. Hence, it is important to study if there is a significant synergetic relation that can be obtained by coupling these two sectors. The objective of this study is to develop a techno-economic modelling tool to conduct an analysis of specified RES penetration scenarios, focusing mainly on the power and water sectors and considering the integration of the most suitable RES conversion technologies.

Attention has also been paid to the modeling of greenhouse climate simulation and energy sources to evaluate energy saving options. However, such models are not readily available in the literature. The goal of this work is therefore to propose an open modelling framework capable of simulating the complex interactions and energy flows relative to such systems. A detailed dynamic model of a greenhouse describing the indoor climate and the heating system components was implemented. A dynamic tomato crop yield model was also implemented to account for the effects of the indoor climate on the harvested dry matter. The models are written in the Modelica language, are released open-source and are run within the Dymola simulation platform. The use of the proposed simulation platform is then illustrated for a particular case. The limited electrical load of greenhouses implies an excess of electricity generation when using CHP units, which have a power-to-heat ratio close to one. In this work, the addition of a heat pump is proposed to foster electrical self-consumption. A control strategy is designed to optimize the operational cost of the system. The system includes thermal energy storage, which acts as a buffer and allows minimizing the electricity sold back to the grid. Performance-based models for each generation unit and the storage unit are developed. Results show that the gas consumption was reduced by 25%. The heat pump generated 25% of the thermal load, the rest being generated by the CHP. Only 42% of the generated electricity is sold back to the grid, 57% being consumed by the heat pump. In conclusion, the heat pump and the thermal energy storage significantly improve the self-consumption level and thereby reduce the system operational cost by 9%. © 2018 University of Minho.

Most importantly, they open perspectives for integration of low-grade residual heat from industry, renewable energy sources (such as geothermal heat and cold and solar thermal collectors), more efficient energy conversion units (such as collective heat pumps), while thermal energy storage (TES) systems increase system flexibility. In order to optimize design and control of such complex systems, a toolbox modesto (Multi-objective district energy systems toolbox for optimization) is under development. However, the representation of seasonal heat and cold storage systems on an annual basis requires large computational power. In an attempt to decrease computational cost, a technique with representative time slices (inspired by and combining aspects from optimization studies of electrical energy systems, unit commitment problems, thermal systems with short term energy storage and smaller scale industrial thermal systems with longer term energy storage) is developed and tested. The aim of this study is to investigate the applicability of such representative time periods to optimize seasonal TES systems in THERNETs. To this end a full year optimization is compared to one with representative time periods for a realistic case study that uses demand profiles from the city of Genk (Belgium) and energy system parameters from Marstal (Denmark). This comparative study shows that modelling with representative periods is sufficient to mimic the behaviour of a full year optimization. However, when curtailment of solar heat injection occurs, not all representations yield the same results. It was found that for the studied case, a selection of 12 representative weeks performs best, while all reduced optimizations result in a substantial reduction (speed-up of on average x4.8 to x7.7) of the calculation time. © 2018 University of Minho.

Nevertheless, many islandic power systems like the islands in Southern Europe are still depending on oil-fired diesel engines, while the renewable energy production is limited due to financial, technical and environmental reasons. In this study, the power system of a typical non-interconnected South European island consisting of diesel generators and a PV farm is modelled and simulated. Scope of this paper is to examine the ability of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to achieve load peak shaving combined with maximization of the PV power penetration into the grid leading to pre-planned zero curtailment. For this purpose, a novel peak shaving algorithm is developed and implemented into an Energy Management System (EMS), for optimal scheduling of the diesel engines. Thereinafter, dynamic simulations of the island’s power system are carried out employing a predictive control strategy for different time scales, ranging from a supervisor BESS controller based on load forecasting, to a real-time battery power regulation. The predictive BESS controller is based on future consumption values forecasting, which in turn result from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an optimization procedure taking into account PV power generation and a peak shaving threshold. Thus, a new diesel engine scheduling is obtained capable of replacing the maximum peak power demand with renewable power while at the same time load curve smoothening and reduced diesel generators ramps-up are achieved. The simulations are executed in APROS (Advanced Process Simulator) dynamic simulation platform, using built-in components for the BESS modelling, an external model for load forecasting and a user-developed EMS structure. © 2018 University of Minho.

It was conducted an energy analysis on a Waste to Energy (WtE) power plant based on an existing prototype, which is located in San Andres Island, in the Caribbean Ocean. WtE by incineration, pyrolysis or gasification of MSW, has been identified for being one of the most promising, suitable and economically viable approach for the management of waste to generate electricity. WtE appears to be a very effective strategy to tackle the annual increasing of MSW, the reduction of land for disposal and the impact of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. Nowadays Colombia lacks of policies for the use of MSW and do not have any WtE program for reducing waste storage in landfills. Thus, it is presented a solution to reduce the amount of waste, to reduce fossil fuel consumption for energy generation and establish new scenarios for MSW management in San Andres Island. The thermodynamic and kinetic models of the WtE power plant analysed are described.

This technology still reveals some challenges that may obstruct its expansion. Among which, the long and inefficient production chain and the intermittence of solar radiation. In this paper, we studied numerically and statistically the solar absorber based on a circulating particle suspension which is considered as a heat transfer fluid. It can be used for both heat transfer and storage or for direct performing of extremely endothermic reactions. Our aim was to study statistically the particles behaviour and build a heuristic model for the design process of this technology keeping in mind whether it is used for heat transfer or chemical reactions. We used a finite volume method to solve the problem numerically in order to generate the data. An Euler-Lagrange multiphase model was used to simulate both the continuous phase and discrete phase. The results highlighted the influence of the superficial inlet velocity of the gaseous phase and the heat flux on the temperature of the particles and its evolution history.

In the case of thermal energy, storage has been a step ahead since storage solutions already exist, unlike other conversion energy technologies. In this sense, the utilization of molten salts, mainly composed of mixtures of alkali/alkaline earth metals, in nitrate forms (sometimes also with nitrite), have been proposed and successfully applied. Molten salts have recognized advantages over other solutions namely in what concerns simultaneous use as heat transfer fluids and as storage media. Commercial utilization of molten salts has been tested essentially with the Na/K salt mixtures. Introduction of lithium nitrate in these formulation has been proposed, since can allow decreasing the melting point of the mixtures, thus providing safety concerning the risks of freezing in the tubes or tanks of the storage plant. This paper provides a short review on the utilization of lithium in molten salt mixtures used for thermal energy storage. Physical, chemical and thermal properties, as well as stability and decomposition issues are evaluated. Corrosion of stainless steels in contact with the salts is another crucial question that is also addressed. © 2018 University of Minho.

Unfortunately energy demands are on a 24 hour basis while solar power is only available during daytime. In an attempt to overcome this obstacle a way to store the sun’s energy for later use is examined embedding a modified copper tube/aluminum fin heat exchanger of the type typically used in room air conditioners in a container filled with wax-based phase change material. In this study the charging phase of a latent heat storage tank (LHST) is simulated. The PCM can store energy in the form of latent heat which can later be used during the nighttime. Paraffin is used as PCM. This type of PCM is applied for the temperature range it can operate, which is relatively low, and this also explains why solar collectors are selected to provide the required heat. A series of fin formations with different spacing will be examined to determine how the charging time is affected by the fin’s placement. The phase change heat transfer was implemented using the effective heat capacity method. Simulations were run in Comsol and the results show a significant improvement in charging and discharging times. © 2018 University of Minho.

For this reason, renewable energy sources are emerging as an ecologically way to produce energy. However, associated with the renewables integration into power grids, new challenges and opportunities arises. Although the crescent energy production, there are still 1.2 thousand million people without access to electricity, since some places are difficult to reach or is expensive to extend the power grid.

This paper reports on R&amp;D work on two features that significantly impact the overall performance of slag2PCC as a carbon capture and storage (CCU) technology and costs related to make-up chemicals. In this process, operating at (near) ambient conditions, calcium is selectively leached from steelmaking slag using ammonium salt solvent in water, followed by carbonation using a carbon dioxide (CO2)-containing gas stream. Separators for removing spent slag and PCC from the solutions connect two reactors for extraction and carbonation, respectively, between which the solvent solution is cycling. Two process aspects will be reported on: One requirement is effective conversion of the CO2 fed to the system into PCC: since the dissolution of CO2 is the rate-liming process step it is essential to optimise its feeding rate so that release of unreacted CO2 is avoided. Mixing of the solutions enhances the mass transfer, which was analysed using high-speed video. Recordings were made around mixers located at various heights in a 2 m high, 13 cm inner diameter bubble column with mixers operated at up to 200 rpm speed, analysing CO2 bubble swarm dissolution. A second critical feature addressed here are losses of ammonia (NH3) from the solution. A gas outlet for unreacted feed gas presents a risk of release of NH3 vapour (in equilibrium with dissolved ammonia). This loss of solvent salt lowers the alkalinity of the solutions while adding costs. Multicomponent mixture mass transfer analysis showed that diffusion of NH3 into the gas feed may be significant at least during initial stage of dissolution and depends in a complex way on temperature, pH and dissolved chemical species concentrations. Experimental findings could be verified. © 2018 University of Minho.

During the end of the XIX century, coal became the first energy resource before biomass. After WWII, the thermodynamic quality of hydrocarbons made them the first primary energy resource. Finally, today due to global warming threats, humanity starts a decarbonising energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy (RE) sources. This study focuses on the energy storage mix required for the energy transition of the electricity system to high RE shares illustrated by the case of Belgium. An hour-based model is used in order to yearly optimise the country RE energy return on investment (EROI). The storage dynamics is studied through its monthly needs.

The decision to work with this kind of solution is justified because of the important part of total energy consumed in the residential sector for buildings heating. The present paper focuses on the flexibility potential evaluation of two residential buildings in order to evaluate their contribution to the electrical grid management in the Greater Region. The work is based upon simulations which are run with TRNSYS software. The capacity of buildings to deal with a heating system cut-off strategy during winter is assessed by means of comfort and energy performance indicators. The goal of this study is to assess in which way the selected buildings will respond to a heating cut-off (in case of grid congestion, the heat pumps will be switched off) and to analyse their “flexibility” as a function of design parameters series. The flexibility takes into account the comfort and the energy aspect of buildings performance. The first part of this paper presents the method used to select the reference buildings in Wallonia and the second part is dedicated to the evaluation their flexibility according to several heating management scenarios. This evaluation is realized by means of specific performance indicators which were developed the project. © 2018 University of Minho.

Natural gas is usually liquefied for shipping and storage. Fire and explosion are among the most dangerous accidents in facilities at LNG Depot; especially pool fire is the most frequent incidents. At the same time the chain of accidents may lead to extremely severe consequences. In order to avoid such calamity a detail study on accident inversion technology is required to save human lives and prohibit the destruction of LNG Depot. In this thesis a topological network based fire accident inversion method for LNG tank fire accident is proposed. Firstly, analyze the LNG depot with the STAMP/STPA method. Then, the topology model of LNG tank fire inversion is established, and the optimal estimator of the shortest path is proposed according to the weighted edge topological network structure, based on which the fire location can be determined. Case study is applied to a LNG Depot. The results show that the position of the fire source calculated by the proposed method is the same as that of the simulated accident by FDS, which proves the feasibility of the method and provides a basis for reducing the fire losses and preventing accidents of LNG.

The nearby user is with multiple antennas, which receives its own information and harvests energy from the signals transmitted by the source and also help forward information to the far-end user. For such a system, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the required transmit power by jointly optimizing beamforming vectors and power splitting (PS) ratio under the energy harvesting and users' data rate constraints of both users. As the problem is non-convex with unknown solution, a bilevel-optimization method is proposed to solve it via semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the global optimal solution is achieved with perfect self-interference cancellation. However, since self-interference may not be cancelled perfectly in practice, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm with low complexity is proposed to obtain a near optimal solution. Numerical results show that integrating NOMA, FD relaying and SWIPT in a single communication system is able to greatly reduce the required transmit power. Besides, the effects of the parameters including the data rate threshold and the energy storage amounts, on the system performance are also discussed. © 2018 IEEE.","beamforming design; full-duplex; Non-orthogonal multiple access; simultaneous wireless information and power transfer; successive convex approximation","Antennas; Approximation algorithms; Beamforming; Computational complexity; Energy harvesting; Energy transfer; Finite difference method; Optimal systems; Data rate constraints; Full-duplex; Global optimal solutions; Information and power transfers; Multiple access; Near-optimal solutions; Semidefinite relaxation; Successive convex approximations; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063471902

Approximated consumption time series based on measured data and simulated time series data for wind and solar production based on rigorous statistical modelling were used to make a sober assessment of the viability of the scenarios. It transpired that, based on 2016 costs for the solar-only option, and 2017 costs for the solar and wind option, that it is more economical to make a 7 km MV feeder connection to a primary substation than invest in the backup generation and storage necessary to provide supply to even the summer-only demand scenarios.

However, it is a great challenge to share residents' energy with others in the smart community for minimizing the total cost of all residents. In this paper, we investigate the problem of energy management and task scheduling for a smart community with residential combined heat and power system (resCHP) and renewable energy to pay the least bill. We take heterogeneous task arrival into consideration, which widely exists in the community. We formulate the minimum cost problem of a non-cooperative community as a random non-convex optimization problem with physical constraints. Our objective is to minimize the community time-average cost, including the cost of the external grid and natural gas. We adopt the Lyapunov optimization theory to tackle this problem, which needs no future data and has low computational complexity. Furthermore, we design a cooperative renewable energy sharing algorithm based on Sarsa Algorithm. Finally, we present extensive simulations to validate the proposed algorithms by using real trace data. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Convex optimization; Digital storage; Energy management; Scheduling; Site selection; Smart city; Telecommunication services; Communication technologies; Energy storage systems; Extensive simulations; Low computational complexity; Nonconvex optimization; Renewable energy devices; Renewable energy technologies; Residential combined heat and power systems; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063444336

The stored energy is removed during the reverse process which solidifies the PCM. Due to the superiority of high latent heat compared to sensible heat, PCMs can contribute to the reduction of the storage systems’ size offering a promising solution especially when coupled with solar collectors. Despite the aforementioned advantages, the relatively low thermal conductivity of PCM hinders their wide utilization. In the present study, a thermal analysis of phase change materials is carried out. Different types of phase change materials (PCMs) are analyzed at various temperature ranges. The energy equation for the PCM is solved by implementing a 1D explicit finite difference scheme in Matlab and the results are compared with corresponding results deriving from Comsol. The properties of the utilized PCMs are altered accordingly so as to take into account their variation during phase change. In this analysis, only the thermal behavior of a PCM is investigated while the gravitational effect is neglected. The results of the analysis regard the temperature variations within the phase change material, the stored energy in the PCM per volume unit, the process speed and the effect of thermal conductivity on phase change, especially on the melting front displacement. Primary results have shown that the stored energy depends on the heat source and on the utilized PCM. In order to tackle the problem of PCM low conductivity, nanoparticles are added so as to enhance the stored energy due to the higher thermal conductivity. Upon the addition of two types of nanoparticles, the enhancement of melting fraction and stored heat are determined.

Given this, CO 2 waterless fracturing, which improves the production and recovery factor of an individual well and meanwhile serves for water preservation and CO 2 underground storage, can contribute to the sustainable development of China's oil industry. The continuity and reliability of equipment is a key technical aspect for the successful waterless fracturing, in which the operation is required to be done in a sealed, pressurized environment during the whole workflow, and the proppant-carrying capability of fluids is low. Therefore, strict requirements are raised up upon the equipment. On the basis of the dynamic fluid balance combined with the fluid phase evolution during the whole construction workflow and its effects on stimulation treatments, this paper optimized the design of key construction equipment, such as CO 2 storage tanks, booster pumps, sealed blender trucks and fracturing pump trucks. Major improvements can be concluded as: 1) the vertical tank is used for the sealed blender, which enhances the control stability of sand supply process jointly by the pressure difference regulation and auger; 2) booster pump unit with high pump-rate capability are included in the system for liquid supply and fluid phase control; 3) the liquid supply combines the mobile transport tanks and fixed storage tanks to increase the liquid supply capability; 4) the fracturing system is equipped with eight special fracturing pumps for waterless fracturing, fulfilling the construction requirement of 20,000 hydraulic horse power. The whole equipment system has treatment capability of available pump rates up to 12 m 3 /min, sand volume of 27 m 3 and CO 2 injection of 1500 m 3 . In 2017, this equipment system was used in waterless fracturing for six times, with a maximum proppant input of 23 m 3 . Both the liquid and sand supply processes are found stable, and the production gain after stimulation is considerable. It is estimated that in tight reservoir, oil production brought by 1 unit volume of CO 2 equals to that of 2.4 unit volume of water-based fracturing fluid. Providing that the average CO 2 injection of waterless fracturing wells is 630 m 3 , a single well can save 1512 m 3 water resource. This equipment system fully meets the requirement of fracturing in vertical and horizontal wells of unconventional resources, and can effectively support the further development of the waterless fracturing technology.

In this paper, the latest development of Chinese liquid CO 2 fracturing technique is introduced through a case study of typical well. The target depth of operating well is 1730.8m-1757m, with a daily fluid production of 1.6t and oil production of 0.5t, indicating that the displacement relationship has not been effectively established. The fracturing treatment was carried out using the independently developed equipment system, which has treatment capability of available pump rates up to 12 m 3 /min, sand transportation of 27 m 3 and CO 2 injection of 1000 m 3 . During this operation, 860m3 liquid CO 2 was injected at a displacement of 5-6m 3 /min. and 23m 3 proppant was preloaded and totally pumped into reservoirs with maximum instantaneous proppant concentration of 12%. After the fracturing, the daily fluid production increased from 1.9t to 3.9t, the daily oil production increased from 0.7t to 2.3t and the water cut decreased from 63.2% to 41.0%, achieving a significant increase in production. In addition, the oil pressure of one adjacent well increased from 0.5Mpa to 12.4Mpa and the daily oil production of four adjacent wells increased by 0.7-1.1t through the energy enhancement and miscibility of CO 2 . The field test shows that liquid CO 2 fracturing technology has a significant effects of energy storage and stimulation, adjusts the injection-production relationship effectively, and greatly enhances the single well production.

The use of phase change materials in the construction of passive houses, where the thermal transfer process is a complex process that is subject to external influences due to the climatic area, and the internal influences due to the solar radiation flow entering the building and the internal thermal loads, will allow the reduction or even removal of thermal bridges and will supply the heating and cooling energy needs by creating a thermal management system through which internal energy will not be lost, but will be stored and released to the inner environment in a continuous cycle. In the global context where we are talking about the depletion of classical combustible resources, we find that orientation towards passive houses and passive buildings is a necessary direction to follow, and by using phase change materials we can conclude that their integration into the constructive systems of passive houses has a significant impact in the creation of a thermal management system, that will allow efficient storage of the energy necessary for the optimal operation and maintenance of the indoor microclimate conditions, and at the same time will ensure the energy optimization and the limitation of the energy losses and consequently the limitation of costs regarding the implementation and operation indifferent of the climate zone. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The high solar combi-plus system consists of evacuated tube heat pipe solar collector panels, thermal energy storage in the form of a phase change material (PCM) to maintain the stability of the system, a hot water driven lithium bromide absorption chiller, the heating, and the domestic hot water systems. The sequence of operation and control for such a system was described in four modes: solar regeneration mode, solar source only mode, solar and storage mixing mode, and the storage source only mode. In order to study its validity and reliability, a mathematical model was developed for its different components. These models were then coupled with a fully programmed calculator developed using “Visual Basic ©”. This calculator was capable of finding the optimized combination between the solar collectors and PCM thermal energy storage, together with all annual hourly simulation results from the consumption of the building and the collected solar radiation, to the PCM thermal energy storage level. Furthermore, a villa in Riyadh KSA designed according to Saudi Arabia Thermal Standard was taken as a case study. The thermal and electrical consumption baselines were simulated hourly using the “Design Builder” Program, and then input in the calculator. The results showed that only 80m2(861 ft2) solar collectors and 3.5 m3 (925 gal) PCM storage were enough for running this system continuously throughout the year without the need for any other auxiliary source of energy. Finally, the feasibility of the novel system shows that although the very low electrical tariff in KSA deters its usage, adopting this system in the Country‟s Energy Policy will help the government decrease 12.7% of the overall electrical consumption in the country. © 2018 Amer.

The catalytic microparticles are produced in a coaxial glass capillary-based 3D flow-focusing microreactor. The microreactor consists of two precursors, a cross-linking catalyst in toluene and a mixture of the PHMS polymer and a divinyl cross-linker. The dispersed phase containing the polymer, cross-linker, and cross-linking catalyst is continuously mixed and then formed into microdroplets by the continuous phase of water and surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) introduced in a counter-flow configuration. Elastomeric microdroplets with a diameter ranging between 50 to 300 micron are produced at 25 to 250 Hz with a size polydispersity less than 3% in single stream production. The physicochemical properties of the elastomeric microparticles such as particle swelling/softness can be tuned using the ratio of cross-linker to polymer as well as the ratio of polymer mixture to solvent during the particle formation. Swelling in toluene can be tuned up to 400% of the initial particle volume by reducing the concentration of cross-linker in the mixture and increasing the ratio of polymer to solvent during production.5 After the particles are produced and collected, they are transferred into toluene containing palladium acetate, allowing the particles to incorporate the palladium into the polymer network and then reduce the palladium to Pd0 with the Si-H functionality present on the PHMS backbones. After the reduction, the Pd-loaded particles can be washed and dried for storage or switched into an ethanol/water solution for loading into a micro-packed bed reactor (µ-PBR) for continuous organic synthesis. The in-situ reduction of Pd within the PHMS microparticles was confirmed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and focused ion beam-SEM, and TEM techniques. In the next step, we used the developed µ-PBR to conduct continuous organic synthesis of 4-phenyltoluene by Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of 4-iodotoluene and phenylboronic acid using potassium carbonate as the base. Catalyst leaching was determined to only occur at sub ppm concentrations even at high solvent flow rates after 24 h of continuous run using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The developed µ-PBR using the elastomeric microparticles is an important initial step towards the development of highly-efficient and green continuous manufacturing technologies in the pharma industry. In addition, the developed elastomeric microparticle synthesis technique can be utilized for the development of a library of other chemically cross-linkable polymer/cross-linker pairs for applications in organic synthesis, targeted drug delivery, cell encapsulation, or biomedical imaging.

The drainage basin area of the project is 1 million km 2 , and the development mode of “one stage development, one stage construction, by-stage impoundment and continuous migration” was adopted for the construction of the project. The TGP is a key project for harnessing and developing the Yangtze River basin. Because of the advantageous geographical position and natural conditions, it plays a unique role in flood control, power generation, shipping and other aspects of the Yangtze River management and social-economic development in the basin, and its status is irreplaceable for any other projects. In addition, the construction of the TGP plays an important role in providing water sources, diverting water from the south to the north, developing aquatic products and tourism, improving the environment and promoting the technological development of water conservancy and Hydropower projects. The elevation of dam crest of TGP is 185 m, the normal pool level of the reservoir is 175 m, the flood control level is 145 m, and the flood control capacity under normal pool level is 22.15 billion m 3 . With regulation of the TGP, the flood control standards of Jingjiang River can reach to 100-year return period. When a flood is greater than 100-year period and less than 1000-year period, including the 1870 flood, which is almost the largest in the history, the discharge of Zhicheng (the gauge station in Jingjiang river section) can be reduced to 80,000 m 3 /s. Under the cooperation of Jingjiang and other flood detention basins, the devastating disaster of the dike break at the middle-downstream of Yangtze River can be prevented. The chance and the discharge of diversion using the retention basin nearby can also be greatly reduced. The installed capacity of Three Gorges power station is 18200 MW (including the underground powerhouse it reaches to 22,400 MW), the firm capacity is 4990 MW, and the annual generating capacity is 88.2 billion kWH. The power can replace coal by 4,000 ~ 45 million tons, which can reduce coal pollution and improve the environment. The TGP is equipped with the double-lane five-step ship lock weighing 10,000 tons and a vertical ship lift weighing 3,000 tons, which is an important basic project in Yangtze River shipping network construction. The navigation function has the advantage of saving investment and costs of other means of transportation, promoting the rationalization of social comprehensive traffic structure, promoting the economy resource development and the development of industrial and agricultural in related areas, promoting the optimal allocation of resources and regional traffic balance, and promoting the rapid development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt construction. Construction of the TGP started in 1993. In December 1994, construction of the main project has started and the key project (hydraulic structures) was completed in 2008. Since 2008, the water storage of 175 m scheme has been implemented, and successfully made for 7 consecutive years since 2010. At the present, the project has entered the normal operation stage and is fully displaying the huge comprehensive benefits. The successful use of the innovative technologies of large flood discharge and energy dissipation of high dam, fast concrete construction, large-scale underground cavern design, innovative resettlement programs, and the integrated regulation of multiple-reservoirs together with other reservoirs of Yangtze River, provided strong foundation for the smooth construction of the project, and ensured the comprehensive benefits of the flood control, power generation, shipping and water resources allocation etc. Since the project was put into operation in 2003, it has brought remarkable social-economic benefits to the national development, energy saving and emission reduction. By the end of March 2017, the power generated by TGP is equivalent to saving 3.27 tons of standard coal, reducing carbon dioxide emissions of about 8.58 tons, reducing sulfur dioxide emissions of about 8,990,000 tons, and reducing nitrogen oxide emissions of about 2570,000 tons. The project improved the waterway and water conditions, promoted the development of waterway transportation, and created conditions for the construction of the green ecological corridor of Yangtze River basin. © 2018 ICOLD/CIGB, Paris, France.","Giant turbine-generator units; High-speed construction technology; Innovation of involuntary resettlement; Layout of hydro project; Technological innovation; Three Gorges project; Three Gorges Project main river closure; Unit spiral case “Combined Embedment” technology; “All-Lining Ship-Lock” Structure","Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Coal; Concrete dams; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric substations; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Flood control; Floods; Global warming; Groundwater resources; Hydraulic motors; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Locks (fasteners); Nitrogen oxides; Power control; Reservoirs (water); Resource allocation; River control; River pollution; Ships; Sulfur dioxide; Water management; Watersheds; Waterway transportation; Weighing; High Speed; Hydro projects; Main rivers; Ship lock; Spiral case; Technological innovation; Three Gorges project; Turbine generator unit; River basin projects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061516005

With the energy carrier water and its ideal properties and proven storage technologies for electricity as well as thermal energy, it’s possible to cover both energy sectors with demand-based, environmental friendly energy. The groundbreaking idea of a study is the combination of electric and thermal energy storage in one system by the hybrid utilization of the energy carrier water. The unifying part of this innovative 2-in-1 concept is a modified closed loop pumped storage plant. Thus, the heated-up water for thermal energy storage is used for pumped storage operation too. The synergetic application with solar thermal energy enables the transfer of thermal energy from the summer to the winter months with highest demand on thermal heat. The thermal energy is stored and provided by a district heating transmission line, connected with heat exchangers in the dead storage of the pumped storage reservoirs. Using hot water with seasonal fluctuating temperatures for pumped storage plants presents technical challenges for all components of hydropower plants, which can be solved technically. In the study technical solutions for structural components, electric and hydraulic fluid machines have been developed. Besides, also adapted underground power station concepts, power tunnel layouts and reservoir designs have been carried out for efficient thermal energy storage. This innovative concept with the efficient double use of the renewable energy carrier water considerably increases the annual energy turnover and output compared to conventional pumped storage plants. As a consequence, the economic profitability could be improved significantly in comparison with conventional pumped storage plants. Ultimately this environmental-friendly storage concept also reduces construction and infrastructure costs, as well as environmental impacts since the two technologies use the same energy storage infrastructure. With the entire underground realization of such hot water pumped storage plants and its transmission and grid infrastructure also any land consumption is required and a socially acceptable realization is possible. The climate friendly energy storage system with the sustainable utilization of the regenerative energy carrier water should help to save greenhouse gas emissions and further the development of CO2-free energy supply. Last but not least it should improve the economic framework for ecological storage systems by integrating two energy storage sectors in one system at the same time. © 2018 ICOLD/CIGB, Paris, France.","District heating; Energy storage technologies; Pumped storage hydroelectricity; Renewable energies; Thermal energy storage","District heating; Electric energy storage; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Free energy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Hydraulic machinery; Hydroelectric power; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Water; Energy storage technologies; Fluctuating temperatures; Pumped Storage; Renewable energies; Renewable energy carrier; Renewable energy generation; Sustainable utilization; Underground power station; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061504923

The results showed with the rise of confining pressure, characteristic energy density of the rock increased in a power—exponent form, and the energy storage limit density of the rock increased faster than the maximum dissipated energy density. The confining pressure increased the intensity of energy input, improved the efficiency of energy accumulation and inhibited the degree of energy release. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Cyclic loads; Dynamics; Energy conversion; Energy dissipation; Pressure effects; Rock pressure; Unloading; Characteristic energy; Confining pressure effect; Conversion equation; Conversion mechanism; Different confining pressures; Dissipated energy density; Elastic energy density; Energy accumulation; Rocks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061498870

The failure of lithium-ion batteries can cause serious inconvenience and huge losses. Therefore, it is of great significance to evaluate the state of health (SOH) of battery for battery management. SOH can provide information about the actual available capacity and aging state of the battery to support making battery control decisions. This paper proposed an improved convolutional neural network with long short-term memory network (LSTM) gate structure and Residual Networks to estimate SOH of the Li-ion battery. LSTM gate structure could be regarded as a filter to effectively remove noise from the battery operational data, while the residual network could improve the overall predictive accuracy.

The symbolic manipulation required to obtain the ODE formulation is minimized as the junction structure allows to transform only part(s) of the model separately. The approach also applies to all other models in which differential causality occurs due to internally modulated junction structures, but is applied to (planar) multibody systems as kinematic constraints are the most common sources of this kind of DAE models. It is shown, that the proposed transformation also applies to models where one of the generalized velocities is dictated by a velocity source.

Simulation results are compared to previously published results from a similar pilot installation in Miraah of Oman which delivers 50 tonnes of steam per day. A desired 7 MWth peak power pilot plant is assumed in this work which will produce 80% quality steam at 110 bar and 300 ° C, matching typical EOR specifications. Simulation performed using System Advisor Model (SAM), developed by NRL, based on historical data of Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) of Kuwait. Given that the heating and pressurization of the subterranean reservoir typically transpires over a period of many months, EOR process is not sensitive to the timing of steam injection, and thus we can assume no steam injection during the periods with no sun. Linear Fresnel collectors have been assumed, which are like parabolic mirrors. Two more assumptions are worthy of comment. First, the SAM model baseline assumptions included 5% soiling on mirrors and 2% average soiling on the receiver envelope. In a typical EOR application, to maintain steam injection around the clock, solar steam is injected during the day and steam produced by natural gas is injected at night. If the rate of steam injection is held constant, gas consumption is reduced by up to 25%. By injecting more steam during the day and less at night, gas consumption can be reduced up to 80% without the need for costly thermal storage; the reservoir itself acts as a primary thermal storage medium. The simulation shows that a peak power of 7 MWth can be achieved with an average output of more than 50 tons of steam per month from May to August and 10 tons/month for the rest of the year; a total of 517 ton/year. The simulated system requires a total land area of 5.2 acres and can eliminate 44,698 ton of CO2 emission per year. To the best of our knowledge, a few studies have been published for Kuwait, which is pursuing a national objective to produce 4 million b/d of oil by the year 2020. This target may be achieved sustainably with heavy oil development using various techniques like unheated-water flooding, hot water flooding, steam flooding, and cyclic steam stimulation. The objective of this study is to investigate the later technique under the local climatic conditions.

The production practice in Daqing Oilfield (China) shows that the EOR of ASP flooding is more than 10% original oil in place (OOIP) over conventional polymer flooding. However, the problems of corrosion and scaling that surface facilities and pipelines encounter with still remain very challenging in ASP flooding production, especially in the strong alkali (NaOH) ASP flooding fields. In the industrialized-application of ASP flooding process, these problems are drawing more and more attention. The corrosion behaviors of surface facilities and pipelines that utilized in strong alkali (NaOH) and weak alkali (Na2CO3) ASP flooding fields were characterized with the integration of production practice, the general anticorrosion measures and the failure of internal coating in fields were presented and demonstrated. A coating solution for fluorocarbons surface treatment was proposed and tested in this case study. The performance of interior surface coatings including corrosion-scaling resistance, wax-deposition inhibition and drag reduction was evaluated with the existence of ASP chemicals in produced emulsions, and the mechanism was discussed from both film-forming and reducing surface energy aspect. The distinct competitive advantage of fluorocarbons interior coating for anticorrosion and wax-deposition inhibition in ASP flooding production was presented. Considerable corrosion and scaling were created and covering the surface facilities such as the storage tanks of ASP chemicals, the pipelines for injection and production, and the heating furnaces in ASP flooding production. Both of the applied physical and chemical protection measures are facing to the challenges of service life, potential environmental threats and unpredictable cost-effectiveness. High bond energy and strong chemistry inertia of fluorinated resins can prevent the coating structure from being destroyed and develop flexibility and weatherability of the coating. The pore resistance and shielding performance of fluorocarbon coating in corrosion environment highlighted actually result from the superior mechanical properties, super-hydrophobicity, and self-cleaning performance. Furthermore, the low surface energy and low coefficient of friction of the fluorocarbon interior coating provide the possibility of pipeline wax-deposition inhibition and drag reduction. The maximum wax-deposition inhibition rate and the maximum drag reduction rate reached 46.42% and 60.00% respectively for high-viscosity ASP flooding produced emulsions in this case study. The reasonable coating configurations and process are certainly indispensable in the potential applications of fluorocarbons surface technology. The case study contributes to the existing knowledge in the implementation of chemical EOR project for a green oilfield development, and it is also helpful to accelerate industrialized-application of ASP flooding and design another emerging pattern-flood pilot. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Chemical bonds; Competition; Corrosive effects; Cost effectiveness; Deposition; Drag reduction; Enhanced recovery; Floods; Fluorocarbons; Friction; Hydrophobicity; Interfacial energy; Internal corrosion; Oil field development; Oil well flooding; Oilfield chemistry; Ostwald ripening; Pipelines; Sodium Carbonate; Sodium hydroxide; Surface treatment; Alkali/surfactant/polymer flooding; Corrosion environments; Enhance oil recoveries; Environmental threats; Fluorocarbon coatings; Low coefficient of friction; Maximum drag reductions; Original oil in places; Corrosion resistant coatings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059784462

However, its clinical application was limited by its poor aqueous solubility and chemical stability. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to prepare IR780 encapsulated nanoemulsion (IR780-NE) to enhance the solubility and chemical stability of IR780, using a low-energy emulsion inversion point (EIP) method, which could avoid complex procedure and IR780 degradation during preparation process. The IR780-NE presented a homogeneous and clear appearance, as well as a mean droplet diameter of 38.17 ± 3.59 nm, as determined by dynamic light scattering. The IR780-NE greatly enhanced the chemical stability of IR780, with more than 80% IR780 retained after storage at 25 °C for 4 days. The IR780-NE also showed satisfactory physical stability, with no alteration of mean droplet diameter during storage at 25 °C for 4 days or 4 °C for 30 days. The zeta potential of the IR780-NE was nearly zero (-0.27 ± 2.06 mV), and the ultraviolet-visible light absorption spectrum showed that the near-infrared light absorbing ability of IR780 was not influenced. In conclusion, the IR780-NE is a potential delivery system for the application of IR780 in biological systems. © 2018 SPIE.","IR780; low-energy method; nanoemulsion; photodynamic therapy; stability","Absorption spectroscopy; Chemical stability; Convergence of numerical methods; Degradation; Drops; Emulsification; Infrared devices; Light; Light absorption; Light scattering; Photonics; Photosensitizers; Solubility; Clinical application; Emulsion inversion; IR780; Low-energy methods; Nanoemulsion; Near infrared light; Preparation process; Ultraviolet-visible light absorption; Photodynamic therapy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059474587

As shown, through SPPs, incident light energy can be localized effectively in a sub-wavelength region or space, and thus so-called light diffraction limit can be break through easily. Therefore, it has demonstrated a good prospects for developing advanced functioned materials or devices such as light absorbing materials, optical antennas, and optical information storage modules. In this paper, we propose a special metallic nanostructures, which can be used to absorb a certain band of incident light by converting them into a kind of local freeelectron oscillation, which means that SPPs can be generated and processed efficiently. As shown, the metallic nanostructures will present a lower reflectivity in the wavelength range, and through adjusting several key parameters such as the period of the metallic nanostructures, we can achieve an effective control of reflectivity because a valley of the reflectivity curve can be formed, which means a low reflectance at a specific wavelength band has been obtained. © 2018 SPIE.","low reflectance; metallic nanostructures; surface plasmon polaritons","Diffraction; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Electromagnetic waves; Light; Nanostructures; Phonons; Photonics; Photons; Reflection; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface plasmons; Absorbing materials; Light diffraction; Metallic nanostructure; Micrometer scale; Optical information; Reflectivity curve; Surface plasmon polaritons; Wavelength ranges; Metals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059470012

However, so far, there has been no report demonstrating how and in what form that the memory is encoded, stored and retrieved. In this paper, we propose a holographic model with theoretical analysis to describe the mechanism of memory encoding, storage and retrieval in brain. The model suggests that memory encoding in brain is achieved through the process of hologram generation in synapses via the interference of the signal wave carrying the outside information and the energy wave emitted by neurons of hippocampus. The holograms are formed by modulated synapses with the structures of the interference patterns. In memory retrieval process, hippocampus emits the same energy wave as that used for encoding with consciousness to induce the reconstruction of the signal wave from the hologram. Experiment was carried out to simulate hologram encoding and retrieval. The discussion presented in the paper shows that the proposed model can reasonably explain some phenomena related to brain memory. © 2018 SPIE.","Energy wave; Hippocampus; Hologram; Memory encoding; Memory retrieval; Neuron; Synapse","Brain; Encoding (symbols); Lithography; Neurons; Signal encoding; Energy waves; Hippocampus; Memory encoding; Memory retrieval; Synapse; Holograms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059414987

Most PCMs need to be hermetically sealed in a container or a storage tank because of the risk of leakage to the surrounding environment when a PCM is in the liquid state. A good compatibility between the PCMs and the materials for their encapsulation is very important for the long lifespan and safety of the heat storage systems. Metals are excellent heat conductors and for this reason they are often used as encapsulation materials for PCMs. The present paper focuses on the methodology and results of the compatibility tests of organic and inorganic PCMs with metals. Three sets of metallic samples of encapsulation materials have been prepared. The first set contained copper samples, the second aluminum samples and the third stainless steel samples. The samples were immersed in the PCMs creating metal - PCM pairs and then subjected to periodical heating and cooling in a small environmental chamber, which imitated the operation of thermal energy storage. One set of metal samples was withdrawn for testing each month. The results indicate a good compatibility between stainless steel and all tested PCMs. © 2018 TANGER Ltd., Ostrava.","Corrosion; Material compatibility; Metals; Phase change materials","Corrosion; Environmental chambers; Heat storage; Metals; Stainless steel; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Compatibility test; Good compatibility; Heat storage systems; Heating and cooling; Hermetically sealed; Material compatibility; Metallic samples; Surrounding environment; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059414573

The flexibility is the ability of power systems to maintain continuous operation in the face of large and rapid swings in supply or in demand. Recently the most proven and from economical point most efficient technology available for large-scale energy storage is the hydroelectric pumped storage. In the analysis of hydrodynamic transient operating conditions, the most complex boundary condition is the pump turbine. The pump turbine can operate either as a pump or as a turbine depending on the direction of rotation. Performance curves for pump-turbine systems describe the machine characteristics (flow, head, torque and rotational speed) in each of the four quadrants. This paper demonstrates that pump-turbine hydraulic characteristics can be modelled by a numerical tool, easy to use in computations. The use of feature curves helps to exclude singularities in the range of low opening guide vanes and eliminate the instability of the conventional interpolation processes. © 2018 BHR Group.",,"Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Pumped storage power plants; Pumps; Transient analysis; Characteristics models; Continuous operation; Direction of rotation; Efficient technology; Performance curve; Reliable operation; Transient operating condition; Transient operation; Hydraulic turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059039454

In order to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the international energy transition process, Romania must undertake new directions for development in the energy sector. Conventional energy sources based on oil, coal and natural gas have had tremendous effects on economic progress, but in the same time proved to be harmful to the environment and quality of life. With the recent remarkable development of sustainable energy technologies and the need to produce it with low greenhouse gas emissions, the use of renewable energy has promising prospects for the energy sector. Energy demand for buildings accounts for 40% of total EU energy consumption, and it is obvious that reducing energy consumption and using renewable energy in the buildings sector is an important part of the measures needed to reduce energy dependency. Romania has a considerable potential for renewable energy resources and is currently very poorly exploited. Renewable energy sources such as solar energy, wind, biomass, hydropower and geothermal energy can play an important role in streamlining and decarbonising power generation systems in stationary applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the local availability of renewable energy sources that can provide sustainable energy services for buildings. In addition, renewable energy conversion technologies, including energy storage solutions, and various types of hybrid power systems have been shown schematically. Also, a brief overview of the carbon footprint obtained by the production of a 1 kWh of electricity, which registered in 2017 decreases by 24,75% compared to 2010 due to the increase of the share of renewable energy sources in the mix energy. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Gas depleted reservoirs are the first candidates for turning into underground storages, as the storage process is closest to the production process, but also due to the availability of a large amount of data which makes the reservoir to be well defined and also due to the existing surface facilities that are required for storage operation. The injected gas volume over the gas resource that exists in the reservoir at the beginning of storage development (working gas), has to correspond to the gas demand that has to be covered by such storage. Considering the demand and opportunity for increase of gas storage withdrawal capacity and working volume, the operation of UGSs at highest possible pressure could be one of the safest and most cost-efficient way to achieve such demand. In Romania gas storages usually operate at lower pressures than the original reservoir pressure, while in other countries there are underground storages operating at pressures at least equal to the original reservoir pressure, proving higher benefits. Given this background the paper makes recommendations on the selection of minimum and maximum pressures for UGS operation and analyses the impact of increased injection pressure on the operation of gas storage in Romania. © SGEM2018.","Depleted reservoir; Initial reservoir pressure; Maximum operation pressure; Working gas","Digital storage; Energy resources; Natural gasoline plants; Depleted reservoirs; Injection pressures; Operation pressure; Optimization factors; Primary energy source; Reservoir pressures; Underground storage; Working gas; Underground gas storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058898937

Since the 50-60’s (1955-1960) it was opened here the open cast mining from which was extracted lignite, a quality charcoal. There followed the years of communism when were opened many fronts of exploitation and now has over 50 quarries, micro quarries, dumps and mining extraction. Opening and exploiting the high capacity of coal in this extractions unit, needed to find solutions for the storage of residual material (tailings) have required that large areas of land to set aside from the agricultural, forestry or construction circuit, all with negative impact on the environment. Of these, the deforestation had the biggest impact and on them acted most aggressive in this process of expanding coal mining pits. This work wants to propose a methodology to assess and quantify the forestry systems from an area strong anthropized by mining activities: the Motru-Rovinari coal basin. This way will be noticed and inventory the wooded areas or destroyed using fractal geometry in graphic modelling by determining two indicators: the fractal dimension (FD) and Fractal Spectrum (FS). Comparing with this methodology will be used other techniques and data from remote sensing and GIS, applying the NDVI analysis in estimation of changes at vegetation level, by choosing the supervised classification algorithm to provide both spatial and numerical results on assessments. In this study will be used information provided by sets of Landsat satellite images, from August 1980 to April 2015. We are looking to determine the best methods for monitoring the impact of mining activities over the environment, mainly on forest systems to signal possible unbalances and prevent natural hazards. In the context of the economic policies of the last 50 years, both locally and nationally, focus was placed on discover and exploit new energy resources, without always find mining methods and processes with the minimal impact the environment.

Poultry manure pyrolysis is the intended technology of combustion for both ecological and energy generation purposes, obtaining coke and gas fuel. The waste subjected to pyrolysis had a behaviour very close to that of the inferior coal. This is also confirmed by the elemental analysis; high moisture value raising issues when direct combustion is used. The combustion of the poultry manure through various technologies, including pyrolysis, using also another fuel, is a secondary result. Waste management represents a current major concern, especially for modern society who faces the pressing problem of their storage. Thermal treatment is a solution adopted in several circumstances. The results obtained show that waste behavior is very close to that of inferior coal. Power consumption for pyrolysis process falls within satisfactory limits; bellow the heat obtained by burning pyrolysis products. Pyrolysis fuel products, represented by semi-coke and coke, are likely to be used to produce energy.

Noise reduction is a significant component in creating a professional and suitable work environment as open-plan offices have become a quintessential trend of the 21st century. The most common solutions in noise control include installation of noise absorption barriers and acoustic systems. Bio-based materials show good sound absorption performances, at the same time leaving much lower environmental impact than traditionally used synthetic materials. One of the most important energy-saving types is to reduce energy consumption in buildings by insulating them. Research is focused on designating the optimal structure of composite materials in order to obtain a material with high textural qualities of the surface and a noise absorption level that reaches an average noise absorption coefficient value of αw = 0,5 in at least one set of specified frequencies. Following variables were analyzed in the research: the proportion rate of wool and wood shaving fibers, the panel layer thickness within 15mm – 25mm range, the number of layers per sample material. For measuring the acoustic properties of the sample materials an impedance tube was used. The measurements were carried out in 8 different sample categories, total of 40 samples were prepared and tested. After obtaining sound absorption coefficients, three samples with the highest sound absorption indices were selected for thermal conductivity measurements. © SGEM2018.

It was taken in consideration also the wood mass destined to heating the population, as a large number of households still use this fuel exclusively. Starting from the plough land and its associated production, there is the availability of agricultural biomass possible to use for energy production. The paper is concluded with the final considerations on the benefits of using biomass for energy production. As far as straw is concerned, a feasible long-distance transport option has not yet been found, so their use is limited to the range in which the trucks can be economically conveyed. The same is true for the case of energy willow or sorghum crops. For sorghum its fermentation is advantageous. For the biomass cultivator the following opportunities can be identified: Reduced storage costs; Reducing the environmental pollution and, implicitly, avoiding the sanitation costs of the adjacent area; Income generation through sales; Development of deprived areas and rational employment of the workforce. For the biomass consumer the following advantages can be mentioned: Reducing Renewable Fuel Costs vs. Conventional Fuels (Fuel, Natural Gas, Coal); as a rule, in Romania, agricultural biomass was imposed for the production of thermal energy; Reducing environmental costs. This is possible if it is considered that by using biomass as a fuel, CO2 emissions are considered to be zero compared to the use of conventional fuels under the Kyoto Convention. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

It is also true that there might be some cases of storages accomplished as permanent which recently tend to work seasonal, but in these cases, besides proper running and maintenance rules, no structural measures would be necessary. In this respect, the present paper comes with a study case to develop the required structural measures for converting a specific non-permanent water reservoir – Radovan Valley on Bărăgui Stream, Dolj County, south of Romania – into a storage that can safely work under load even for full time. Initially (about the middle of the previous century) accomplished with the aim of delaying seasonal high waters and so to protect the downstream farm land, since nowadays the stream shows a less seldom flow, the reservoir can and should be employed as permanent reservoir (even of variable level) with an extended use in agricultural purpose. The storage of about two and a half hectares is retained by an earth-fill dam with no special sealing element, with a maximum high of 6m and a length of 124m at the top, originally endowed only with a reduced capacity “monk” type discharger. Under the new circumstances specifically represented by water flows of 17.8cm/s (5%) and 32.9cm/s (1%) as supplied by the Romanian Water Administration (manager of the studied structure), we came to propose the required dam rehabilitation measures and new hydraulic appurtenant (top and bottom dischargers, water energy dissipater). © SGEM2018 All Rights Reserved.","Dam rehabilitation; Non-permanent water storage; Water storage conversion","Agricultural robots; Flow of water; Hydraulics; Reconstruction (structural); Surface waters; Agricultural purpose; Earth-fill dams; Rehabilitation measures; Sealing element; Structural measures; Surface water flows; Water energy; Water storage; Reservoirs (water)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058884005

This led to a significant growth in the number and the sizes of data centers. The energy used by the data centers has increased dramatically. This situation determined the quest for metrics that measures energy efficiency in data centers. A classical metric for measuring energy efficiency in data centers is PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness). It was introduced in 2006 by C. Malone and Christian Belady. It is defined as the ratio between the PDC (total power used in the data center) and PIT (the power used for the IT equipment). PDC is the energy requirement for the major IT components of the data center plus the energy for supporting the infrastructure. The infrastructure is composed by: power delivery components, cooling system components and other miscellaneous component loads, such as data center lighting. PIT is the energy requirements associated with all the major IT components of the data center, such as server, storage, network, and other devices (KVM switches, monitors, and workstations/laptops) used to monitor or otherwise control the data center. PUE is a very popular metric for measuring energy efficiency in data centers. It has advantages and disadvantages. The present paper proposes an analysis of new metrics for measuring energy efficiency in data centers. This thing is necessary in order to attain sustainability goals. A globally accepted metric on the energy efficiency of computer servers in business applications is still missing, despite a great interest from stakeholders. Some complementary metrics and new metrics for improving PUE are synthesized. This analysis can help researchers to identify the main trends of energy efficiency assessment in data centers. The paper provides also a comprehensive and critical survey of energy efficiency metrics in data centers.

The basic indicator of the potential for water energy utilization is the calculation of the so called hydropower potential (HPP). While the hydropower potential belongs to the natural riches of each country, and as it is linked to the use of the head (difference in water levels), it includes the technical and economic possibilities as well as the ecological and social priorities of the present period and the field of application for which it is set. To determine the impact of climate change on hydrological regime there are various methodological procedures. Changed climate conditions characterized in particular by the changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and air temperature in the future decades were predicted according to the latest outputs of two regional climate change models KNMI and MPI and the A1B emission scenario. To specify changes in long-term mean monthly runoff in comparison with the reference period 1981-2010 and future time horizons 2055 and 2085, we used the physically-based WetSpa rainfall-runoff model that works with spatial interpretations of hydrological balance elements in the GIS environment. An assessment of possible adaptation strategies for water management with respect to the hydropower potential and its utilization for energy production in Slovakia was attempted. The hydropower potential of small, run-of-river and storage hydropower plants is strongly related to the distribution of runoff over the year and can therefore affect not only the total change in runoff but also changes in its distribution in the future. © SGEM2018 All Rights Reserved.","The climate change; The hydropower potential; The WetSpa model","Climate models; Energy utilization; Hydroelectric power; Rivers; Runoff; Water levels; Water management; Watersheds; Adaptation strategies; Hydrological balance; Hydrological regime; Hydropower potential; Potential evapotranspiration; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Regional climate changes; Spatial interpretation; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058877406

In order to achieve the static converters in which semiconductor materials are used, the latest generation technologies are used. For Silicon Quality Control in industrial processes CryoSAS (Cryogenic Silicon Analysis System) or SiBrickScan (SBS) Silicon Ingot Analyzer are used. The use of diode rectifiers for supplying inverters has as a major negative consequence the increase of ""harmonic pollution"". The energy system can function properly in the presence of a limited amount of harmonics. The presence of harmonics in the power supply system can generate a wide range of unwanted effects. For example, harmonics can cause signal interference, overvoltage, loss of data in data transmission lines. Harmonics can also cause overheating, inadequate operation, or even electrical equipment failure.

The Gravity Hydro Power Tower Energy Storage (GHPTES) is an innovative hydraulic energy storage system based on pumped storage technology. It consists of a vertical cylindrical cavity, filled with water, in which moves an overload piston from steel at smaller storage systems or from rock at large storage systems. To produce energy the overload piston drops in cavity tower and forces water down in the cavity. The water is returned in the space above the piston through a pipe in which a turbine-motor/generator produce electricity. To store energy, external grid power drives the motor/generator-pump, force water to return through pipe into the cavity, below the piston, lifting the overload piston and thereby storing potential energy. Important advantages of (GHPTES) include: modularity, use of existing technologies, environmental compatibility, flexible siting, rapid construction, relative low cost per kwh, long lifetime and high efficiency. It can help also wind farms and solar farms autonomously store their electricity. Besides the many advantages an important disadvantage of (GHPTES) is the too cost-intensive overload piston made of heavy material (e.g., steel with density of approximately 7.8 t/m³) and thereby a great construction complexity which can leads to restriction of application the power towers energy storage. The present study analyses the elimination possibilities of the heavy overload piston using compressed air. The proposed system in which the heavy overload piston is complete eliminated is a Compressed-Air-Hydro-Power-Tower Energy Storage System (CAHPTES) or simply Hydropneumatics Energy Storage system (HPES). A comparative operating scheme as well as comparative calculations method, among others for energy storage for the two systems are presented. It will be shown that the proposed compressed air-based energy storage system (CAHPTES), even at ordinary air pressure of some bar (e.g. 3-7 bar) can eliminate several tones of heave overload weight material (e.g. 30-700 tone steel) maintaining the same energy storage as the (GHPTES). © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

A composite flywheel stored energy of 54MJ in length of 1800mm and diameter of 450 mm was proposed. Elastic connection element is used to keep the composite cylinder for energy storage rotor in rigid state without bending mode for high speed rotation. The vibration characteristics of two composite cylinder with elastic connection and supports are studied. Supposing the cylinders are rigid, the Lagrange vibration equation is established to learn the low frequency modal characteristics. Both modal frequency and vibration mode are solved, and then the variation of modal frequency and mode attenuation coefficient with damping are discussed. The rotor support system is also calculated by the transfer matrix-polynomial method and the bending mode of the flywheel rotor with bellow connection is obtained. The modal frequencies calculated by the two methods are basically the same, the first four order forward precession are 4.3Hz、8.3Hz、20.5Hz and 533.Hz. Considering mode frequencies varies with speed, corresponding critical speeds are 4.3 rps, 8.9 rps and 26.8rps under the rated speed of 500 rps. The vibration behavior was revealed when the damping of the support changes. The special vibration mode switching in such low support stiffness and overdamped rotor system are discussed. © 25th International Congress on Sound and Vibration 2018, ICSV 2018: Hiroshima Calling.

That is, the PEMFC offers high power at the same energy efficiency range. This is because the cell potential remains constant while current density increases. With increased current density at constant energy efficiency, the heat flux increases along with internal temperature gradients. During the last 15 years, several studies of the thermal conductivity of PEMFC components have been undertaken. The knowledge now covers PTFE loading, ageing, water content, direction (in-vs. through-plane), material types, and material integration. With a modem fuel cell operation at a cell voltage of +0.7 V, one can easily observe temperature differences between the polarisation plates and the membrane of more than 10°C, depending upon the state of the water and material selection. In other electrochemical energy storage devices such as super-capacitors (SC) and lithium ion batteries (LiB), thermal conductivity values are similar to those of the PEMFC. From an engineering point of view, it is interesting to compare thermal gradients and internal temperature differences of a PEMFC to LiB and SC. The thermal conductivity of the materials are similar, the operation voltage is higher in a LiB and SC than in a PEMFC, the electrode thicknesses are larger in a LiB and SC than in a PEMFC; there are less opportunities for cooling inside a LiB and SC than in a PEMFC, and remarkably, relevant current density of a PEMFC, SC, and LiB are 30 000, 200, and 50 A m""2, respectively. © 2018 by The Electrochemical Society.

Different from those conventional polarized light emission generated with plasmonic metallic grating in which at least 50% high energy loss happens inherently due to high reflection of TE component of the electric field, a reflecting metasurface with 2D elliptic metal cylinder array (EMCA) that functions as a half-wave plate was integrated at the bottom of a LED such that the back-reflected TE component that is otherwise lost by a dielectric/metal bi-layered wire grids (DMBiWG) polarizer on the top emitting surface of the LED can be converted to desired TM polarized emission after reflecting from the metasurface, which significantly enhances the polarized light emission efficiency. Experimental results show that the extraction efficiency of the polarized emission can be increased by 40% on average in a wide angle of ±60° compared to that with naked bottom of sapphire substrate or 20% compared to that with reflecting Al film on the bottom of sapphire substrate while an extinction ratio (ER) of higher than 20 dB within an angle of ±60° can be simultaneously obtained directly from an InGaN/GaN LED.

They are part of a complex ecosystem that supports different forms of life. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more proficient in sequestering and storing carbon than terrestrial ecosystems. Although seagrasses occupy only 0.2% of the area of the oceans, they sequester approximately 15% of total carbon storage in the ocean. Several remote sensing techniques are available to map and monitor seagrasses but most of them focus only on extent and area coverage. To estimate the carbon sequestration of seagrass beds, aside from extent, other parameters are needed such as leaf area index, percent cover, density, biomass etc., However, there are limits in mapping seagrass parameters using remote sensing. The reflectance measured by sensors is affected by other factors such as water absorption, turbidity, dissolved organic matter, depth and phytoplankton which affects the backscattering of energy. In this study, different remotely sensed datasets and field data were used to measure the parameters needed to estimate the carbon sequestration. Multispectral satellite images such as Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope were utilized to map the distribution and percent cover. High-resolution RGB images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were also utilized to correlate field data gathered parameters. Field data such as species, percent cover, leaf area index, canopy height and above ground biomass were gathered in situ. Data extracted from different remote sensing technologies were put together to support the estimation of carbon sequestration of seagrass beds.

In the present study, the melting behavior of GNP-lauric acid nanocomposite in rectangular cavity was numerically investigated; the influences of GNP concentration on the solid-liquid interface evolution, temperature distribution, streamline profile, melting rate and heat transfer performance were analyzed. The results show that the heat conduction plays a dominant role in the early stage of melting, and the natural convection gradually becomes obvious in the later stage. The addition of GNPs promotes the melting process, and the moving velocity of solid-liquid interface increases with the increase of GNP concentration. The melting time reduction degrees for GNP-lauric acid nanocomposites comparing to pure lauric acid are 9.3%, 18.4%, 28.6%, 36.7% and 43.4% at GNP concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 vol%, respectively; the melting time reduction degree shows down for higher GNP concentration. The heat transfer rate increases with the increase of GNP concentration. The results indicate that GNP-lauric acid nanocomposite is a promising phase change material for improving efficiency of thermal energy storage system. © ACRA 2018 - 9th Asian Conference on Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning.

So it is necessary to solve the challenge of controlling the pressure in a rational range. The Spray-bar thermodynamic vent system was well proposed as an effective method to control the ullage pressure and reduce the mass loss of liquid propellant. A CFD model is employed to investigate the influence of spray parameters such as numbers and the configuration of spray orifices on the pressure maintain behavior. The physical and mathematical models are built and fiinite volume method is used to calculate the temperature and pressure distribution inside the tank. Then these results are used to organize analyzation of the optimal layout of the spray orifices on the spray bar. Finally, the ullage pressure, local vapor and liquid temperature evolution are validated against the corresponding data provided by the MHTB spray bar mixing experiment developed by NASA. It shows a good match between two results. So the conclusion can be given that this CFD model is an optional technology to simulate the thermodynamic vent process in normal gravity condition. © ACRA 2018 - 9th Asian Conference on Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning.

While in summer, the sensible and latent cooling load can be independently handled, which provides chilled water by solar PV directly powered vapor compression refrigerator and applies solar thermal energy from collectors for desiccant regeneration. Also in the system, there are two separate water tanks for thermal energy storage, one for high temperature water and one for low temperature water.

According to the Gibbs-Thomson effect, the pre-melted film may form around the walls of porous media when the temperature is below the bulk water freezing point, so the water penetration of frozen porous media is possible. However, most of the numerical works of frozen porous media were focused on the phase change that has been reported by many researchers, while few numerical works were done for the permeability. In this study, a three-phase model capable of predicting the permeability of the frozen porous media was developed, this model was based on both the MRT-LBM (multi relaxation time lattice Boltzmann mothed) and the enthalpy-based phase change method. By using this model, the permeability of the frozen porous media with different particle sizes and different frozen temperatures were well predicted due to the introduction of pre-melting temperature with the correlation coefficient R2 = 0.91. Results reveal that the permeability decreases with decreasing temperature when the temperature is lower than Tm0. Furthermore, results show that the permeability decreases more slowly in porous media with smaller particle size due to the Gibbs-Thomson effect. © ACRA 2018 - 9th Asian Conference on Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning.

The dependences can be caused by external hazards, which can affect multiple units at the same time; shared operational and safety systems at the site; common staff who should manage the situations.

Throttle-free solutions have the potential for high efficiency. The main throttle-free approaches are pumpcontrolled systems, transformer-based solutions, and digital hydraulic solutions, such as switching transformers, multichamber cylinder and multi-pressure systems. This paper presents a novel solution based on a so-called digital hydraulic power management system (DHPMS). The DHPMS is freely rotating and a hydraulic accumulator is used for energy storage. In contrast to existing approaches, each actuator has its own DHPMS and a small accumulator to locally handle the power peaks. Only an average amount of power is needed from the hydraulic grid, radically reducing the size of the supply pump and the hydraulic piping and hosing. Pump flow is only 12.5% of the peak flow of the actuator in the case studied. Control of this type of system is challenging, and the model-based approach is used. The controller uses a simplified model and functionality is verified by using a detailed simulation model of the system. The results show that the approach is feasible but is demanding on the control valves. The system delay is also relatively long, which reduces the control performance in high-end systems. Nevertheless, this approach has potential in mobile machines, for example.

It also has important detrimental effects on the appearance and durability of construction materials. The mitigation of condensation risks is not simple, particularly in the process of rehabilitation of old buildings. The preservation of architectural features precludes the possibility of using thermal insulation materials in facades. The installation of these materials inside buildings (on walls and ceilings), when possible, leads to other problems, such as: (i) breeding of thermal bridges; (ii) reducing of thermal inertia; (iii) reducing the interior area. Phase Change Materials (PCM) can be incorporated into traditional building materials with the aim to increase heat storage capacity, enable stabilization of interior surface temperatures of buildings whereby influencing the thermal comfort sensation and the stabilization of the interior ambient temperatures and without influencing the aspect of those traditional building materials. This paper aims to assess the possibility of using PCM plastering mortars to mitigate condensation risks in the inner surfaces of walls of old residential buildings. The use of PCMs in internal coatings can potentially avoid (or strongly reduce) the occurrence of condensation temperatures in the inner surfaces, thus fulfilling their twofold intent: improvement of inner thermal comfort and minimization of condensation risks. Numerical simulations are used to predict dew point temperatures due to exterior climatic conditions and envelope characteristics of typical Portuguese old residential buildings. The influence of PCM on condensation risk mitigation is assessed and the global results are presented with the goal of highlighting behavioural differences in regard to common construction materials. © 2018, University of Cantabria - Building Technology R&D Group.

Meanwhile, such effect includes vibrational relaxation, electron rearrangement of solvent molecule, special role of the sample with the solvent molecules and so on. The experiment of fluorescence quantum efficiency at atmosphere reduces the interference, because the distance between molecules is much larger in gas phase. In addition, the research of quantum efficiency can also promote the understanding of LIF and expand the range. In this paper, the fluorescence quantum efficiency of 3 different samples at atmosphere was compared, and the electrospray ionization source was selected for its soft ionization characteristics. The ionization method did not spoil the fluorophore of the sample, and the drift tube of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) was used for ions transport and desolvation. The ionization source was on the one side of the drift tube and the test point was on the other side. The paths of excited laser and emission light were orthogonal at the test point. Meanwhile, stable ions flowed through the drift tube. The emission light was captured by the camera, which was coupled with a long-wave pass filter. The test samples were Rhodamine 6G, Rhodamine B and amino copper indium sulfide quantum dots of the same mass fraction. The energy of excited laser was between 30 mW and 150 mW.

A methodology to assess the gas supply capacity and gas supply reliability of a natural gas pipeline network system is developed in this paper. Due to random failure and maintenance action of the components in the pipeline network system, the system can be in a number of operating states. The methodology is able to simulate the state transition process and the duration of each operating state based on a Monte Carlo approach. After the system transits to other states, the actual flow rate will change accordingly. The hydraulic analysis, which includes thermal-hydraulic simulation and maximum flow algorithm, is applied to analyze the change law of the actual flow rate. By combining the hydraulic analysis into the simulation of the state transition process, gas supply capacity of the pipeline network system is quantified. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of market demand, the load duration curve (LDC) method is employed to predict the amount of demand for each consumer node. The gas supply reliability is then calculated by comparing the gas supply capacity with market demand. Finally, a detailed procedure for gas supply capacity and gas supply reliability assessment of a natural gas pipeline network system is presented, and its feasibility is confirmed with a case study.

Apart from conventional method to improve the specific energy via complex electrode development, here an alternative route to enhance the performance of the N-doped graphene oxide aerogel supercapacitor using a redox active electrolyte was introduced. The effect of ferrocene methanol in 1- butyl-l-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide ionic liquid electrolyte as a redox active electrolyte was investigated. The coupling of this new hybrid electrolyte and a unique nanostructure of the N-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel could exhibit an excellent specific capacitance and specific energy of 112.1 F g-1 and 34.2 Wh kg-1, respectively as compared to 76.7 F g-1 and 23.5 Wh kg-1 of the conventional 1-butyl-l-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide ionic liquid electrolyte.

The HECS cell consists of photoactive cobalt oxide (CO3O4) positive electrode as the energy conversion material and N-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel (N-rGOAE) as the energy storage material. The photoactive CO3O4 nanosheets were prepared by using various calcination temperatures for which the in situ electrochemical XAS suggests that the C03O4 nanosheets calcined at 300°C exhibit the highest change in oxidation state compared to other conditions. The HECS cell using photoactive CO3O4 film calcined at 300°C and N- rGOAE exhibits 1.7-fold higher specific capacitance under LED light illumination than that of the dark condition. Under white LED light illumination, the photovoltaic effect can be generated in the C03O4 electrode with electron-hole pairs, while the N-rGOAE can balance all the charges generated from the CO3O4 via both electrochemical double-layer and pseudocapacitive behaviours. © 2018 Electrochemical Society Inc.

For Eucalyptus tree plantation inventory and monitoring, Canopy Height (CH) and Above Ground Biomass (AGB) are required parameters. However, the traditional inventory methods are label intensive, timeconsuming, and inaccurate. This study, we presented the method for estimating CH and AGB from Eucalyptus plantation based on the very high spatial resolution imagery (∼5 cm.) from Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV). To estimate AGB, we first generated the digital surface models (DSMs) from 3 D point-cloud. Then, the digital terrain models (DTMs) were generated from Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) surveying technique. The CH was calculated based on the different of DSM and DTM. We located individual trees location using tree detection software. Next, the allometric equation was generated from the 20 samples (tree) and their subsamples (e.g. foliage, litter, branch). The correlation between sampling tree height and tree weight was relatively high (R2 = 0.977) with the exponential relationship. We then apply the correlation to estimate tree weight of the remaining trees. Next, the individual UAVs-based AGB was calculated based on the ratio of fresh weight and dry weight. The total AGB was 3450 kg ha-1 © SPIE.

As a major national science and technology project, since the construction of the high temperature gas cooled reactor demonstration project (HTR-PM) since 2012, the civil construction of the nuclear island has been basically completed, the installation of equipment has been carried out orderly, and many process systems have entered debugging and operation stage gradually. As an important auxiliary process system, fuel handling and storage system for online refueling of the pebble bed high temperature gas cooled reactor, plays an important role in relation to the stable operation of the reactor. The main functions of the fuel handling and storage system are loading the fresh fuel elements and unloading the spent fuel elements which has reached its target burnup continuously for reactor operation, the spent fuel elements would be discharged into the spent fuel canister firstly, when the spent fuel storage canister is full of spent fuel, the canister would be sealed through welding method, and then the spent fuel canister would be transferred and stored in the spent fuel storage silo with the ground crane system. The fuel element of the pebble bed high temperature gas cooled reactor is spherical fuel element with graphite matrix, the fuel elements will have friction and collision with the inner wall of the pipeline in transporting process, which will produce graphite dust, the graphite dust should be removed continuously though filtration method, so as not to affect the fuel elements transportation in pipeline. This article focus on the production mechanism and filtering method of the graphite dust in graphite matrix fuel element transporting process in pipeline, to study the graphite dust removal technology, and then we could provide theoretical guidance for the design and operation of the key system and equipment for HTR-PM.

Molten fluoride salts were selected as primary and secondary coolants in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Therefore, it is dramatically important to study the physical and chemical properties of molten fluoride salts that impact on the design of reactor core and thermohydraulics. The molecular structure directly determines the physical and chemical properties of matter, so it is also essential to study the structure of molten salts. Spectroscopy has been proven to be a very useful tool for investigating molten salts structures. However, the standard instrument is inapplicable for measurement of the high temperature molten salts, especially for molten fluoride salts. To obtain the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of molten salts at high temperature, an instrument was designed to study the structures of molten salts in situ. The instrument is mainly composed of a vertical pit furnace connecting with a glovebox and an assembled cuvette which can operate from room temperature up to 800ºC. The assembled cuvette is made of Hastelloy C/N as the main body with a reverse ‘T’ contour and diamond or crystalline CaF2 etc. as the window plates, so it can withstand the corrosion produced by the sample and allow the interest light passing through. The effective spectral range of this instrument is from 200 to 1000 nm. Performances of the instrument are testified by spectral studies on water under room temperature and molten salts under high temperature.

In the recent years, the digitalization process for nuclear power plants has also been moving on rapidly. Full digital I&C systems are now adopted in almost all new constructed nuclear power plants. The architecture of a digital I&C system plays a pivotal role for the safety, reliability and security of the whole nuclear power plant. Moreover, for the advanced small modular reactors, both the reliability and extensibility of I&C systems are especially required. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new architecture of the digital I&C systems based on the developed computing performance and communication technology. The control units and the data servers in the new proposed architecture are decentralized and working in a mutually redundant and distributed computing/storage way. Thus the architecture is with a flexible extensibility. Moreover, other control units or data servers can take over the functions of a certain number of failed ones. This characteristic benefits the system's reliability significantly. The reliability of the new architecture is theoretically evaluated and the results demonstrate that it is much higher than that of the traditional architecture of I&C systems.

Majority of the nuclear facilities around the world utilize diesel generators and battery banks as emergency power to back up the grid power supply. This power supply configuration represents the concept of the micro-grid system. The research work proposes reliability improvement of the emergency power supply by introducing distributed energy sources and large-scale energy storage systems. The proposed system was modelled with reliability block diagrams and analysed with Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the system's reliability in terms of loss of power supply probability (LPSP). The analysis takes into consideration, the failure probability of the components combined with the power unavailability due to the intermittent energy sources. The results show that the proposed system reduces the LPSP.

The numbers speak for themselves: begun in 1956 and completed in 1966, the programme constructed 6072 units, accommodating 9.8% of the total population of the city at that time. Having reached the age of 60, the housing buildings are in need of conservation due to their poor thermal performance, rain water infiltrations, and abusive appropriations of escape exit spaces. The housing blocks have been refurbished recently to increase their level of thermal comfort and to ensure energy sustainability through improvements made to the edifice's thermal envelope. However, the thermal enhancement raises problems of appropriation of the modernist gallery - the most innovative and ambiguous architectural element of the original programme. In fact, the gallery still is the greatest refurbishment challenge, as on the one hand, residents have strongly advocated for increasing their respective apartment areas by incorporating the gallery space, and since on the other, any renovation will bring technical problems given that changes will prevent cross ventilation, hinder fire escapes and emergency exits, and privatize a common space. In other cases of buildings not yet refurbished, the gallery is incorporated and assumed as an everyday space, allowing residents to set up drying racks for laundry, to eat outdoors, park bicycles, plant flowers or gardens, have storage space, and access to their apartments. Focusing on the use of the gallery as a programme for refurbishing the housing blocks, this paper will reflect on strategies for re-designing this ambiguous in-between modernist space and will examine how to prevent the technical problems raised by enclosing the gallery and to keep their unique character, identity and atmosphere which have been shaped over time. © Proceedings of the 15th International Docomomo Conference - Metamorphosis: The Continuity of Change, IDC 2018.

However, a rapid growth of the dynamic and stand-by power due to transistor leakages becomes a pressing issue. A promising way to stop this trend is to introduce non-volatility. The development of an electrically addressable nonvolatile memory combining high speed and high endurance is essential to achieve these goals. It is particularly promising to employ non-volatility in the main computer memory as a replacement of conventional volatile CMOS-based DRAM. To further reduce the energy consumption, it is essential to also replace the caches (SRAM) in modem hierarchical multilevel processor memory structures with a non-volatile memory technology. The spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) combines non-volatility, high speed and high endurance and is thus suitable for applications in caches. However, its development is still impeded by the necessity of a static in-plane magnetic field. We propose a magnetic field-free perpendicular SOTMRAM, based on a crossbar architecture and the use of two consecutive orthogonal sub-nanosecond curr ent pulses. In this way small layout footprint and high integration density are guaranteed.

Operational flexibility of coal-fired power plants inChina has played an essential and promising role inaccommodating these nonequilibrium in the power grid. In thestudy, focusing on condensate throttling coupled with thermalstorage tank measures, dynamic simulations of an entire 660MW supercritical coal-fired power plant were developed via theGSE software. Then, the dynamic characteristics of mainthermodynamic parameters and output power were describedand compared, and operational flexibility performances of thesemeasures were discussed. It turns out that: when condensatewater flowrate decreases, the largest power ramp rate, powercapacity, and energy capacity are 12.68 MW min-1, 12.76 MW,and 1084.70 MJ, respectively, and when condensate waterflowrate increases, the largest power ramp rate, power capacity,and energy capacity are-5.49 MW min-1,-5.65 MW, and-695.94 MJ, respectively, which means condensate throttlingwithout thermal storage tank measure is more suitable forpower-up regulation than power-down regulation, but theshortest duration time is 130 s, which will restrict theoperational flexibility regulation. However, coupling withthermal storage tanks, the deaerator water level can maintain alonger time. Meanwhile, at feedwater bypass 60% coupled withthermal storage tank, the largest power ramp rate, powercapacity, and energy capacity are-3.62 MW min-1,-3.81 MW,and-897.31 MJ, respectively, and at condensate water bypass60% coupled with thermal storage tank, the largest power ramprate, power capacity, and energy capacity are 7.74 MW min-1,7.88 MW, and 1829.38 MJ, respectively, and these parametervalues are greater than condensate water flowrate directlyincreases or decreases 60%, which means condensate throttlingcoupling with thermal storage tanks can improve operationalflexibility performances.

In this paper, we report a room-temperature switchable carbon nanotube (CNT)/hexadecane composites. Electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and permittivity of the CNT/hexadecane composites can be regulated around 18°C and the maximal switching ratio reaches 5 orders of magnitude, 3 times and 106.4, respectively. The switching behavior of composites is caused by rearrangement of the carbon nanotube fillers in hexadecane matrix during liquid-solid phase transition. It is found that surface modification is necessary to improve dispersion stability. Effects of filler properties on switching behaviour are also discussed.

A numerical simulation study was done prior to the field test to quantify performance metrics, such as the amount of water usage per m3 of produced oil, the energy input requirements, kW·hr/m3 of oil (i.e. an equivalent Steam Oil Ratio value), green house gas emissions, drilling performance, operating costs, and process facility design. Field performance met or exceeded expectations. The recovery factor was greater than 75%, the energy requirement per m3 of oil produced was 23% less than calculated and peak production rates were greater than expected. The water oil ratio was one with no green house gas emissions in heating the oil. An insignificant volume of sand was produced and the oil recovered had very little to no emulsions. A comparison of the data with theory reveals that not all the drive mechanisms were considered in the initial numerical simulation. One of the more significant is the contribution of associated gas. Albeit in relatively small amounts, the gas evolving from the bitumen with rising temperature displaced the bitumen from the pore volume and accelerated recovery from the production wells. © Canadian International Petroleum Conference 2008.

Firstly, the extended Kalman filter is used to estimate states of monitored system using available input and output variables. The residual vector corresponding to the specific fault is generated by comparing the actual measured value and estimated value. Secondly, the original accelerometer signals collected from monitored system are decomposed by EEMD and a group of the intrinsic mode functions without mode mixing are obtained. The characteristic vector is constructed by computing the energy index of every IMF. Finally, the characteristic vector is combined and acts as the training samples to train BP neural network fault classifier, therefore, the fault diagnosis is achieved. The example analysis proves that the hybrid fault diagnosis method proposed in this paper is more accurate in diagnosing direct drive EMA faults. © 2018 IET Conference Publications.

In this paper, an active ankle prosthesis powered by electrohydrostatic actuation (EHA) is proposed. EHA is a new actuator that integrates the actuation system energy source and the output actuator. It has been successfully applied to aircrafts such as the A380, A400M, B787 and F35. The use of EHA in the prosthesis provided high power density, and the ability to switch quickly and smoothly between passive and active modes. The prototype consists of more than ten components, such as the motor, doubleplunger pump, valves, double outlet hydraulic cylinder, pressure sensors, accumulators, carbon fiber foot plate, etc. After rigorous verification via simulation and evaluation, this study proved that its structure was reliable and durable. A simulation model was then developed to analyze the performance of EHA, results showed that this hydraulic system could provide enough torque to satisfy energy needs of human bodies. The innovation of this study was reflected in the creative use of combining the hydraulic cylinder and the plunger pump to be a closed hydraulic circuit, thereby forming proactive assistance prosthesis. Moreover, another novelty is that micro-accumulators also used for energy storage, released when in necessity. With laboratory experiments, the overall control of the prosthesis and structural improvement are also in progress at present. © 2018 IET Conference Publications.

However, cabin door retractable system is turned on and off only for a very short period of time, so most energy is wasted. In order to solve the problem, a new cabin door retractable system is proposed in this paper, and the basic ideas are low-power pressurized energy storage and high-power transient operation by using the accumulator. According to this way, the installed power of the cabin door retractable system is reduced greatly and the burden on the engine is lightened at the same time. To validate the presented system, the paper establishes the simulation model of the traditional cabin door system and the new cabin door system.

However, most PCM microcapsules have lower themostability with an onset decomposition temperature of about 150°C, which to some extent restricts their application. In this study, high thermostability PCM microcapsules were synthesized with long chain ester as PCM and PMMA as shell. During the preparation, high chain ester of dodecanol laurate was first synthesized by an esterification reaction under catalysis, then the ester as core material was encapsulated using PMMA by emulsion polymerization. The resultant products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetry (TG), laser particle size analyzer and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The synthesized dodecanol laurate have a high purity according to the IR spectrum analysis with a suitable phase temperature range of 22-30°C. In addition, the ester also shows good thermal properties with latent heat of 206 J/g, small super-cooling degree of 0.5°C and high thermal evaporation temperature of 220°C, which is very suitable for applying in PCM energy storage materials. Using the above ester as core material, the PCM microcapsules were successfully fabricated by emulsification and polymerization. The prepared microcapsules had a perfect spherical shape with about a diameter of about 865 nm as well as a high heat storage performance with a latent energy of 118 J/g. Due to the high evaporation temperature of the ester core material itself, and with further encapsulation, the prepared PCM microcapsules demonstrated higher thermostability. TG results suggest that the microcapsules have a high onset weight loss temperature of over 252°C due to the encapsulation of PMMA, it is a significant increment when compared to PCM microcapsules reported by most literatures. © 2018 Binary Information Press.

With grains comprising a high percentage amongst food crops consumed over the world, it remains a nutritious and healthy food source for all population types. Cowpea grains remain an inexpensive and rich source of protein needed for tissue development and crude fiber that aids digestibility in humans. Hence there is a need to store and retain these nutritional parameters during storage till consumption. This paper investigates diatomaceous earth (DE) effects on the nutrient composition (crude protein and crude fiber) of stored cowpea variety (IT96D-610K) in wooden and galvanized mild steel structures. Twenty-eight thousand grams of cowpea at a moisture content of 9.8% was admixed with 21g of ground crude diatomaceous earth having a particle size of 0.075mm. Six small scale prototype structures made of two different materials (wooden and galvanized mild steel (GMS)) were developed and used in the storage of the cowpea for a 16-week period under room temperature. Effects of storage time and storage structures on nutritional parameters such as crude protein and crude fiber were determined. Significant differences (p<0.05) was observed between the control sample and the treated samples. A general decrease in the crude protein content of 0.19% was observed throughout the period of sixteen weeks’ storage. A significant reduction of 0.07% was seen in crude protein content between the initial crude protein content and the control having (zero concentration) of DE. Crude protein decreased with increased storage period in both storage structures (wooden and galvanized mild steel (GMS)) with GMS being most effective in storage. The (control) DE having zero concentration, (0g/100g) showed a negligible increase of 0.01% in the crude fiber content throughout the period of storage. The crude fiber content of the stored cowpea in the storage structures showed an increase of 0.03% in its value. Both wooden and GMS storage structures had same effect on the crude fiber content at the end of storage. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

Most snack foods are often considered as ""junk food"" or empty foods because they contain high levels of calories with little protein, vitamin and minerals. Due to high importation costs of wheat, biscuits have been developed from non-wheat products. The quality protein maize (QPM) grown locally in Nigeria is a popular alternative to wheat. Studies have been conducted to enrich biscuits using some plant materials. Fluted Pumpkin leaves (Telfairia occidentalis) 'ugu' leaves is a cheap source of minerals and vitamins. In Nigeria, the range of industrial products from cocoa beans is small hence the need to explore other uses for the cocoa powder. This study investigated the effects of enriching biscuits from QPM with dried 'ugu' leaves (DUL) and cocoa powder (CP) with the aim of increasing their utilization. Ugu leaves were washed, shredded, dried and milled to fine powder. QPM were cleaned, decorticated, dried and milled into fine powder. The flours were formulated into biscuits: QPM flour: xanthan gum: DUL: CP (100:0:0, 99:1:0:0, 96:1:0:3, 93:1:3:3, 90:1:6:3, 87:1:9:3, 84:1:12:3). Biscuits were packed in a low density polyethylene bag and analyzed for proximate, minerals, amino acid composition, physical, functional and sensory properties on the samples using standard analytical methods. Addition of DUL and CP increased the protein, ash, fat, fibre amino acid content and mineral contents significantly but decreased the carbohydrate and metabolizable energy values for the biscuits. The water and oil absorption capacities of the samples increased with addition of CP. Bulk density, swelling capacity of the samples decreased with addition of DUL and CP. Functional properties varied with temperature and water absorption capacity and swelling capacity of the flour samples ranged between 169.66% to 197.33% and 121.00 to 183.33% respectively. Quadratic equations gave highest R2 values for swelling capacity (0.9339-0.9979) and water absorption capacity (0.9259-0.9817) at different temperatures compared to exponential, linear, or logarithmic equations. The physical properties of the biscuits: weight and thickness increased while diameter, spread ratio and break strength reduced with enrichment. PH of the flour reduced with the addition of dried 'ugu' leaves but increased with the addition of cocoa powder. The in-vitro protein digestibility of the biscuits increased with enrichment (51.68 to 62.16%). QPM based biscuits had total amino acid values ranging between 88.83 and 98.33 g/100 g protein. The biscuits were of acceptable sensory qualities up to 12% level of cocoa powder substitution but the scores were lower than that of the control samples. Regression equations were developed for the relationships between breaking strength and storage time, moisture content and storage time. The study concluded that biscuits from QPM enriched with DUL and CP improved the nutritional properties without affecting the functional attributes thus enlarging their utilization potentials. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

With the current shift towards decentralized power production, micro Gas Turbines (mGTs) appear as a promising technology for small-scale generation. The target of a carbonclean power production calls for the implementation of Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) technologies. Compared to coal fired power production, the low CO2 concentration in the exhaust gas of a mGT makes Carbon Capture (CC) much more expensive. However, the CO2 concentration can be increased by performing Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), therefore reducing the CC energy penalty. Additionally, cycle humidification can also help to increase the electrical efficiency of the turbine plant. Nevertheless, the higher CO2 content in the inlet air, in combination with the high humidity level, will affect the opera- tion of the mGT. This paper presents a numerical study of this innovative cycle combined with preliminary experimental validation of CO2 injection. To the authors' best knowledge, experimental analysis of EGR together with humidification applied to a mGT has never been carried out. Experimental results showed a stable turbo-machinery operation under a moderate CO2 injection. The results of this paper are a first step towards a more severe dilution conditions, with the aim of a full implementation of EGR on a micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT). © 2018 ASME.",,"Alternative fuels; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fossil fuels; Gases; Rankine cycle; Renewable energy resources; Wind turbines; Decentralized power productions; Electrical efficiency; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Experimental analysis; Experimental validations; Low carbon economy; Renewable energies; Small-scale generations; Gas turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053925563

However, synthesis of some materials including Mg2FeH6 ternary hydride poses a number of challenges. In spite a variety of reports on various synthesis routes yielding Mg2FeH6, none of them produces a 100 % pure Mg2FeH6. In this communication, we have attempted to synthesize Mg2FeH6 by high energy reactive ball milling (HERBM) performed in hydrogen gas. Prior to the ball milling, the starting stoichiometric 2:1 mixture of the initial materials Mg+Fe was heat treated through a judicious temperature program. It was found that the yield of Mg2FeH6 is related to the conditions of heat treatment, time and temperature, and the milling parameters such as ball to powder mass ratio (BPR) and rotation speed of the planetary mill. Moreover, it was found that the synthesis took place in less than 5 hours of milling with a maximum yield of Mg2FeH6 of 84 wt%, which is a noticeable improvement as compared to the reference data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this paper is to investigate a solar assisted heating system with various criteria. Different building envelopes are investigated with the TEE-KENAK software (official Greek software for energy efficiency) for the climate conditions of Athens (Greece). Different combinations of insulation thicknesses up to 8 cm, as well as three different windows types, are investigated. Totally 15 different building envelopes are examined and evaluated in this work. In all the cases, the examined building has 100 m2 floor area, while its characteristics remain constant except for the insulation thickness and the window type. Two different heating systems are investigated, one typical with a conventional boiler and one with a solar-assisted boiler. Flat plate collectors coupled to a storage tank are used in this work and their aperture is investigated parametrically up to 30 m2. The building performance is evaluated using energetic and financial criteria, with single and multi-objective procedures. The goal is to determine the optimum building design for the Athens climate which combines high energy efficiency and reasonable cost. In the cost analysis, the investment cost of the installation, as the operating costs are taken into account in order to perform a suitable analysis. According to the final results, the use of solar energy is able to reduce the fuel consumption in the boiler, while the use of conventional double windows with 6 cm insulation thickness is a suitable design. © 2018 University of Minho.

It is considered a secure and sustainable solution for the 21st century energy supply in isolated communities, such as islands and remote areas, where electrical grid extension is difficult and fuel transportation and logistics are costly. To ensure continuous power availability, the renewable energy system should include an appropriate storage solution. This project proposes a feasible, cost effective, carbon-free, sustainable solar Photovoltaic (PV) power generation system augmented by a hydrogen power storage system. The storage system consists of three main components; an electrolyzer which uses electricity to analyze water into hydrogen and oxygen, a storage tank which captures and stores the hydrogen, and a fuel cell which uses hydrogen to generate electricity. This system will be developed and evaluated for the first time in the Arabia desert region where dust and humidity are great challenges. The system provides typical power needs for an average home and platform for applied research. The project offers a renewable energy laboratory for course delivery, learning-by-doing activities, and industry-related projects for students of different disciplines of engineering and science.

This filter improves the energy spectrum of sonar beamforming, and allows the system to avoid using high sampling rates to improve delay accuracy, which helps to reduce computer storage performance requirements. By comparing the frequency response characteristics of the Least-squares linear-phase FIR filter, Lagrange and Hermite fractional delay filter with same order, the Hermite fractional delay filter is proved to be less attenuated and less error at the high frequency.

The recovery of a tensor from an incomplete set of its entries, known as tensor completion, is crucial in applications like compression. Furthermore, in many cases observations are not only incomplete, but also highly quantized. Quantization is a critical step for high dimensional data transmission and storage in order to reduce storage requirements and power consumption, especially for energy-limited systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the recovery of low-rank tensors from a small number of binary (1-bit) measurements. The proposed method, called 1-bit Tensor Completion, relies on the application of 1-bit matrix completion over different matricizations of the underlying tensor. Experimental results on hyperspectral images demonstrate that directly operating with the binary measurements, rather than treating them as real values, results in lower recovery error. © 2018 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,"Clustering algorithms; Digital storage; Hyperspectral imaging; Image processing; Recovery; Spectroscopy; Binary measurements; Critical steps; High dimensional data; Higher-order tensor; Matrix completion; Storage requirements; Structured data; Tensor completion; Tensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052851411

The presence of 4MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·5H2O is found to decrease the characteristic decomposition temperatures (T0, Te, and Tp), reduce the net decomposition enthalpy, and reduce the apparent activation energy, indicating that the 5AT-Sr(NO3)2 propellant catalyzed by 4MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·5H2O is a kind of heat sensitive compound and needs more attention during storage period.

At-shore or inshore floating liquefaction is under serious consideration as a scalable, cost effective, risk mitigated architecture for the development and export of such reserves. Onshore liquefaction projects have many challenges including regulatory, social license to operate, First Nations consents, in addition to challenging geotechnical and topographical suitability of sites. At-shore or inshore FLNG, the paper will demonstrate, provides an attractive development option for the export of pipeline gas to global markets. The remote construction possible with the FLNG option offers potential reduction in investment outlay, and reduced dependence on incountry skilled labour pool often stressed by projects in a parallel time frame. The FLNG feed gas will be sourced from pipeline grids flowing conditioned gas and this alleviates the feed gas treatment required prior to liquefaction. The benign metocean at-shore offers the added benefit of designing fractionators, cryogenic exchangers and other sensitive equipment with reduced design margins and allows adoption of more conventional design of storage and offloading systems. Further topsides simplification can be achieved by locating power generation, control room and living quarters off the floating unit and adjacent to the jetty. The paper contrasts this with the metocean challenged, and now commercialized, offshore FLNG concept where the feed gas is typically sourced from subsea wells/subsea gathering system. The raw gas must be fully treated on the FLNG in readiness for liquefaction. The flow assurance issues - reception of slugs, pulsating gas flow - and the motions arising from the offshore metocean environment adversely impact topsides process performance and hence reliability. The paper will draw on recent studies and projects to demonstrate the following: The potential benefits arising from the scalability of the architecture, including the potential for capacity development in line with reserves and market growth. Key differences in process line-up for gas reception, gas treatment, NGL extraction and choice of liquefaction circuits relative to offshore FLNG. Measurable simplification in technology and design feasible for at-shore FLNG arising from the reduced motion envelope. Mitigation of nearshore environmental impact arising from deployment of FLNG at-shore or inshore (via site selection, choice of cooling medium e.g. air-cooling versus sea water-cooling to eliminate inshore seawater temperature rise) Credible TIC metrics ($/mta) for at-shore floating liquefaction, expected economic payback and implementation schedule advantage relative to onshore deployment Through the above critical assessment the paper provides key inputs and insights as development guidance to the evaluation of at-shore FLNG for monetization and export of pipeline gas.

For a standard chocolate having an average fat dosage, the temper index (TI) for a well-tempered condition is between 4 and 6. This may differ for more extreme recipes such as a high-fat and low-fat chocolate. In such a case, the lesser undercooling required for a high-fat chocolate may become an advantage for minimizing energy consumption within the production line. This study evaluates the effect of tempering conditions on chocolates with different fat compositions by using a standard cocoa butter seed addition (CBSA) technique used by Cargill® and conventional tempering by Aasted temper unit. The results indicated that the high-fat chocolate tempered to TI 2.0 showed an equivalent quality to TI 5.0 in terms of hardness and fat bloom stability whereas, a TI of 7.0 was necessary for the low-fat chocolate to attain a better bloom stability than TI 5.0. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the faster crystallization power of high-fat chocolates and the slower crystallization power of low-fat chocolates necessitates the adaptation of the temper indexes. © 2018 EUROSIS-ETI.","Chocolate tempering; Cocoa butter crystallization; Temper index","Blooms (metal); Energy utilization; Modal analysis; Cargill; Cocoa butter; Dark chocolate; Fat bloom; Minimizing energy; Production line; Seed addition; Tempering conditions; Tempering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050319564

Normally, the compressor of a ground source heat pump works at a very wide range of compression ratios, and thus the annually overall performance is comparatively low. Through simulation evaluation, the annual cooling and heating performance of the ground source heat pump is enhanced by increasing the mean temperature of the ground and thus narrowing the work range of compression ratios.

Exposed to demanding customers where reputation is an important part of the business, focus is given to cost of ownership, and therefore the energy efficiency of the technical equipment, and the environmental profile. Due to the EU F-gas regulation, vendors supplying conventional, non-natural working fluid refrigeration equipment are facing challenges related to the legislative requirements and supply shortages. It forces them to implement less conventional refrigerants with lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) in their new products. The newly introduced next generation of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with ultra-low GWPs do have a very short (atmospheric) lifetime, however, the decomposing products are highly toxic in combination with water, and distributed everywhere it becomes a question whether they represent a safe and sustainable alternative. As Gustav Lorentzen said: “We should not try to solve a problem by introducing another problem”. Natural working fluids like CO2 have demonstrated to be an energy efficient and environmentally benign alternative, especially for supermarket applications. Since its fluid- and thermosphysical properties are quite different from most other working fluids, the refrigeration system designs have to be carefully adapted to the properties of CO2, thereby maximising the energy efficiency and minimising the total cost of ownership. Integrated CO2 systems can simultaneously provide refrigeration capacities at various temperature levels, air conditioning (AC) & dehumidification, heating and even sanitary hot water at adequate temperature levels. A further integration of advanced thermal storage devices can enable centralised supermarket refrigeration systems to become a valuable element within smart (thermal) grids. Well designed and integrated systems can demonstrate reduced power consumption typically by more than 30 %.

This paper describes a concept for a large cold thermal energy storage (CTES) system integrated in an industrial NH3/CO2 cascade refrigeration system for a poultry processing plant. The refrigeration system is fully centralized while oil-free CO2 is pumped to the freezing and cooling equipment. The CTES consists of closed tanks that contain stacks of heat exchanger plates with circulating CO2 on the inside and a phase change material (PCM) in the tank. During charging, the CO2 evaporates inside the plates while the PCM changes phase from liquid to solid. The purpose of CTES is to reduce daytime peaks in the energy use, e.g. charging the storage during night and weekends and discharging during times of peak refrigeration demand. The performance of the system is investigated through simulations with Modelica/Dymola. © 2018 International Institute of Refrigeration.

The objective of the study is to investigate the integration of a phase change material (PCM) accumulator along the air circulation path in the lower part of a refrigerated display cabinet to maintain the product temperature within safe limits. The PCM accumulator consists of three fluids: PCM (pure water is used here), air to be cooled down and CO2 as cooling medium. The lower part of such cabinets offers limited volume and thus requires effective space use. Dimensioning a three-fluid PCM accumulator integrated into the air circulation path requires a detailed CFD design, given the dynamic nature of thermal loads and small temperature differences during charging and discharging phases. A generic geometry is designed to fulfil the purpose. In this first study, transient CFD simulations are performed for a series of simplified geometries to evaluate the influence of the distance between CO2 coils and air ducts with regards to freezing time, melting time and heat absorbed from the air. The results showed that a variation of a few millimetres in the distance between the air ducts for a given PCM accumulator dimension yields considerably different charging and discharging times. The calculated integrated heat flux from all air ducts provided a useful indication to select the geometric configuration giving the best match to a given application, e.g. covering defrost cycles or night-time cooling. © 2018 International Institute of Refrigeration.

Consequently, many challenges exist for cloud providers to run such an environment. One important challenge is to minimize cloud users' network latency while accessing services from the DCs. The other is to decrease the DCs' energy consumption that contributes to high operational cost rates, low profits for cloud providers, and high carbon non-environment friendly emissions. In this paper, we studied the problem of virtual machine placement that results in less energy consumption, less CO2 emission, and less access latency towards large-scale cloud providers operational cost minimization. The problem was formulated as multi-objective function and an intelligent machine-learning model constructed to improve the performance of the proposed model. To evaluate the proposed model, extensive simulation is conducted using the CloudSim simulator. The simulation results reveal the effectiveness of PCVM model compared to other competing virtual machine placement methods in terms of network latency, energy consumption, CO2 emission and operational cost minimization. © 2018 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The focus in this study is on energy micropiles which provide thermal energy to be stored to undisturbed soil under the building. The soil works as an energy storage medium. In this study, energy simulations were carried out during the planning process. The energy simulations specified the amount and period of the heating and cooling energy consumptions in the buildings. According to the energy simulation steel micropiles can be used efficiently for storing energy and as a source of energy in Finnish conditions. At the commercial building temperatures used in simulation was not found to have significant geotechnical influences. However, no long term modelling of the current energy utilization technique has been carried out.

The direct emission measurements and reduction potential evaluation is the prerequisite to achieve an effective reduction goal on greenhouse gas emission. Based on the survey of production processes and related parameters, a series of greenhouse gas emission sources were identified and measured. The emission sources including production processes, leakage-prone facilities such as dehydrator, boilers, heaters, associated gas treatment plant, light hydrocarbon recovery unit, storage tank, and gas flaring were measured. A series of leakage detection and measurement instruments were applied as well, such as Hi-Flow™ Sampler, impeller flowmeter, Bascom-Turner gas sentry and gas flow probes, etc. Based on the measured emission data, a simulation model was then used to evaluate the specific forms, sources and the reduction potentials of the greenhouse gases. The measured greenhouse gas emissions showed that: evaporation and flashing losses from storage tanks were the largest source, accounting for 86% of the total methane emission, and 42% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution of methane emissions from heaters and boilers during incomplete combustions was less than 1% of the total methane emissions, and about 16% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. When controlling technology on storage tank losses was applied, methane emission could be reduced by 81.7%, and the greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 39.9%. Furthermore, such controlling technologies also presented substantial economic benefits through the recovery of fuel gas. In this study, the recovery potential of various greenhouse gas emission sources were analyzed. In addition, a preliminary cost-benefit analysis was performed per the emission categories, reduction potentials, and the feasibility of reduction technologies. Finally, the probability on the application of such reduction technologies were evaluated. © 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

In this paper, we address the mask synthesis problem by developing a optimization framework based on the vector imaging model fully describing the vector nature of electromagnetic fields in the aerial imaging formation and the stratified media model for the resist image, which is further reduced to a variational level-set based time-dependent model combining an internal energy term forcing the level set function close to a signed distance function and an extra energy term that drives the zero level set toward desired mask features minimizing the pattern difference between the printed wafer and the desired pattern, thereby optimizing the mask layout without the costly re- initialization procedure and ensuring the stability of the evolution of level surfaces. Represented by a partial differential equation, the time-dependent model is readily solved by finite difference schemes. Acceleration of over 30 times of the optimization procedure is achieved by computing convolution operations in the frequency domain with fast fourier transfrom (FFT) and the repeated usage of data, together with a 50% convergency performance improvement by means of applying Polak-Ribi'ere-Polyak (PRP) conjugate gradient (CG) to updating the normal velocity of the level-set function, which are merited by the experimental results. © 2018 SPIE.","Computational imaging; Level set; Microlithoraphy; Photolithography","Antennas; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electromagnetic fields; Finite difference method; Frequency domain analysis; Image segmentation; Inverse problems; Lenses; Photolithography; Plants (botany); Rotational flow; Set theory; Computational imaging; Finite difference scheme; Inverse lithography technologies; Level Set; Microlithoraphy; Optimization procedures; Performance improvements; Signed distance function; Vectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047839523

These sensors can be used in a hostile environment, such as, for example, on a field of battle, in the presence of fires, floods, earthquakes. In these environments the sensors can fail, even in a normal operation. It is therefore necessary to develop algorithms tolerant and detection of defects of the nodes for the network of sensor without wires, therefore, the faults of the sensor can reduce the quality of the surveillance if they are not detected. The values that are measured by the sensors are used to estimate the state of the monitored area.

To meet the trend of energy conservation and emission reduction and quantify the effect of cold chain on the environment, the life cycle assessment method was used to analyze the carbon footprint of fruits and vegetables cold-chain in the life cycle. The results show that the in each phase of cold chain, the carbon footprint of transportation accounts for a large proportion. As the storage time increases, the carbon footprint of the cold chain increases. The carbon footprint of the refrigerated transport phase and pre-refrigerated storage phase accounts for 50%-70% of the total cold chain.

Power demands on offshore rigs are met principally through the use of diesel engines and gas turbines. This adds to the already high safety hazards and environmental threat through greenhouse gas emissions, heat and noise generation. Additionally, petroleum generated power is an expensive venture that can have significant impact on oil and gas project economics. Moreover, some of these offshore locations are so remote that accessibility to petroleum fuel may be challenging. As petroleum exploration and production pushes steadily into deeper, farther waters especially in sub-Saharan Africa, safety, environmental and logistical security may be key for sustainability. Situated almost entirely within the tropics, Africa is a very suitable place for solar energy applications. This study assesses the potential of solar power for offshore oil and gas operations in Africa to mitigate the issues associated with the use of fossil fuel thereby ensuring sustainability of the upstream petroleum industry in Africa. The size of the solar power system that may meet the power requirement of a sample floating storage and production vessel (FPSO) in offshore Angola was estimated. Appropriate areas and extent of potential solar power application on this sample rig were also assessed. This was followed by some cost analysis to compare the two sources of power economically.

This is expected to remain unchanged for a long time as the world energy consumption doubles. Renewable energy is often a better option since it is environmental friendly but its technologies are not financially available for most countries. Carbon (iv)oxide capture and sequestration (CCS) is necessary for meaningful greenhouse gases reduction in the immediate future. CCS could reduce emissions by 19%. This is an important bridge between our lifestyle and an environmental friendly world. The components of CCS system include; capture (separation and compression), transport, injection and finally monitoring. Power plants which are gas and coal fired are the main source of CO2. Other candidate sources include; cement production plants, refineries, petrochemical industries, oil and gas processing firms and natural gas wells The methods of capturing CO2 are pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-combustion/oxy-fuel. Possible sequestration places for the captured CO2 include; geological storage, for example depleted oil and gas reservoir, enhanced oil recovery, un-minable coal seams and deep saline formations, ocean storage, mineral carbonation and algal growth. Each of the methods above have their advantages and shortcomings as discussed in the research paper. CO2 can be utilized in various ways like, conversion into renewable fuels, formic acid, syngas, methane and methanol, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for organic and inorganic carbonates, urea and biodegradable polymers as well as non-conversion use of CO2 for example as a geothermal fluid, used in enhanced oil recovery and beverage making. The challenges of CCS are; high cost of capture transport and injection, environmental and safety, subsurface uncertainty, legal and regulatory issues. Trappings contribute to storage of CO2 in a site. They include; Structural and stratigraphic, residual, solubility, mineral trappings. In conclusion, an approach that integrates different methods of capture and storage of CO2 may be a practical solution for CCS.",,"Biodegradable polymers; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Coal storage; Combustion; Energy utilization; Enhanced recovery; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Metal recovery; Methanol fuels; Natural gas well production; Natural gas wells; Nitrogen compounds; Offshore gas fields; Offshore gas well production; Offshore gas wells; Oil well flooding; Organic polymers; Petrochemical plants; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Precombustion; Stratigraphy; Urea; Deep saline formations; Engineering and technology; Enhanced oil recovery; Environmental-friendly; Fossil fuel combustion; Oil and gas reservoir; Petrochemical industry; World energy consumption; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040536800
