Exploitation of renewable energy sources and particularly ground heat in buildings can significantly contribute towards reducing dependency on fossil fuels. This paper highlights the potential energy saving that could be achieved through use of ground energy source. It also focuses on the optimisation and improvement of the operation conditions of the heat cycles and performances of the DX GSHP. It is concluded that the direct expansion of GSHP are extendable to more comprehensive applications combined with the ground heat exchanger in foundation piles and the seasonal thermal energy storage from solar thermal collectors.

Box 522, 11001 Belgrade, Serbia","The hydrogen storage potential of TiNi-based shape memory alloys is an attractive but experimentally challenging issue. We employ the FP (L)APW+lo method, based on the density functional theory (DFT), in order to address the electronic structure of the low-temperature, martensitic phase of Ti 0.67Zr0.33Ni and its hydrides. Further, the thermodynamics of hydride formation in the martensitic Ti-Zr-Ni alloys is studied, and some unanswered questions regarding the hydriding of martensite TiNi are resolved. The calculated formation energy of the orthorhombic β- and γ-hydrides of martensitic Ti0.67Zr0.33Ni is, respectively, -14.2 kJ/mol(H) and -29.6 kJ/mol(H), showing that isostructural (Ti,Zr)Ni hydrides with a larger amount of titanium have improved potential for hydrogen storage applications. Furthermore, based on the calculation results, it is unlikely that the hydriding of TiNi martensite would lead to the formation of orthorhombic β-hydride in analogy to the pseudobinary compound. The formation of Ti 0.67Zr0.33Ni hydrides leads to significant changes in electronic structure, causing shifting of some metal states to lower energies due to their interaction with hydrogen s states, and the increase of the number of states at Fermi energy. By modeling intermediate structures, the process of hydride formation in martensitic Ti0.67Zr0.33Ni is resolved to reveal the effects of crystal structure change, volume increase, and hydrogen-metal interactions on the band structure, charge transfer, and thermodynamics. A dominant, stabilizing effect in the process of hydride formation was found to come from the chemical interaction of hydrogen and metal atoms. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculation results; Chemical interactions; Density functional theory studies; Formation energies; Hydrogen-metal interaction; Intermediate structures; Pseudobinary compounds; Stabilizing effects; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Martensite; Nickel; Thermodynamics; Titanium alloys; Zirconium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891413361

AMI normally has a focal point on the boundary between the utility and the end consumer and thus has as the important function to allow the demand to become active based on the extended information that will be available for both the utility and the end customer. On the other side, the large volumes of energy flows for instance at generation delivery points are being metered with other systems and normally at lower periodicities than those implemented for most of the AMI projects developed now a days. The above is considered contradictory since smaller volumes of data will be measured at higher periodicities while larger ones will be available with fewer granularities and at slower data collection rates. This paper presents the concept of integrating the entire set of electric energy meters in an integral concept allowing the implementation of functions that may use energy data for operation and for other purposes such as energy balances. This integration will also take care of providing the utilities the observability of the energy stored at different voltage levels, storage that will play a fundamental role in the future Smart Grids. © 2013 IEEE.","Advanced Metering Infrastructure; Integral metering; Intelligent metering; losses control; power system balances","Data collection rates; Delivery point; Different voltages; Electric energies; End consumers; Integral metering; Intelligent integral; Intelligent metering; Digital storage; Smart power grids; Advanced metering infrastructures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890868071

Power balancing requirements resulting from the intermittency of wind power suggest using energy storage assistance to improve overall generation and load characteristics. The problems in generation imbalance for wind power require multi-criteria analysis for the decision makers. In addition to the required multi-criteria analysis, there is also a problem of uncertainty inherent in future changes as a result of interdependence among these criteria. To counter this two problems, this paper describes a systematic approach of Bayesian causal maps and systematic probability generation method. Bayesian causal maps, which is built from causal maps, is used to develop a proposed framework on scenario-based assessment of energy storage technologies for wind power generation. Causal maps provides a rich representation of ideas, through the modeling of complex structures, representing the chain of arguments, as networks. However, causal maps is not easy to define and the magnitude of the effect is difficult to express in numbers. Hence, Bayesian causal maps can be used to make inferences in causal maps. A systematic probability generation method is used to estimate the conditional probability tables, which can reduce biases and inconsistencies. © 2013 PICMET.",,"Complex structure; Conditional probability tables; Decision makers; Energy storage technologies; Generation method; Load characteristics; Multi Criteria Analysis; Renewable energy generation; Complex networks; Electric power generation; Wind power; Uncertainty analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890849816

Due to high energy demand and high input currents, a fast-charging station is placed close to the substation that contains a low frequency transformer. Inside the fast-charging station, an intermediate DC-bus connects energy storages, a supply grid rectifier and charging converters. Low voltage (570 V) causes high currents and results in high losses at busbars, magnetic components and semiconductor devices. We propose a high voltage input multiport converter topology with a high frequency isolation transformer for a fast charger of an electric vehicle. High input voltage enables currents and conduction losses to be kept low in the charging converter until the very last conversion stage that is connected to the electric vehicle battery. Also, the dimensions of magnetic components are reduced due to high frequency. Grid-side converter is realized using the back to back cascaded converter topology. Charging converters can be realized with the current doubler rectifier topology and bidirectional with a controllable full bridge rectifier/inverter as in this operational mode it has an advantage over a current doubler. The quasi Z source could be used as a filter/boost circuit. The proposed charging station topology was verified by computer simulations. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Cascaded converters; Converter topologies; Current doubler rectifiers; Electric vehicle batteries; Full bridge rectifier; Grid-side converter; High-frequency isolation transformers; Magnetic components; Charging (batteries); Computer simulation; Electric vehicles; Magnetic devices; Power electronics; Topology; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889063766

While most work has considered the interaction in the steady-state regime, here we demonstrate that a single-photon pulse shorter than any relaxation time in a medium propagates without energy loss and is consistently transformed into a zero-area pulse. A general analytical solution is found for photon passage through a cold ensemble of Λ-type atoms confined inside a hollow core of a single-mode photonic-crystal fiber. We use the robust far-off-resonant Raman scheme to control the pulse reshaping by an intense control laser beam and show that in the case of cw control field, for exact two-photon resonance, the outgoing photon displays an oscillating temporal distribution, which is the quantum counterpart of a classical field ringing, while for nonzero two-photon detuning a slow photon is produced. We demonstrate also that a train of readout control pulses coherently recalls the stored photon in many well-separated temporal modes, thus producing time-bin entangled single-photon states. Such states, which allow sharing quantum information among many users, are highly demanded for applications in long-distance quantum communication. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,"Coherent propagation; General analytical solution; Light-matter interactions; Single-photon pulse; Steady-state regime; Temporal distribution; Two-photon detuning; Two-photon resonance; Energy dissipation; Particle beams; Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Photons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890402415

Objective: To study the socio-demographic characteristics and the clinical presentation of IEM in Libyan children and to shed light on our experience in dealing with these disorders. Methods: This is a descriptive case series hospital-based study of 107 children attending the Metabolic Unit at El-Khadra Teaching Hospital (MUKH) in Tripoli, Libya. The study took place between January 2001 and December 2012. Information was collected from caregivers and from all available hospital records on the following variables: age, sex, birth order, place of residence, age at onset, presenting complaints and family history of the same illness. Results: During the 12-year study period, there were 55,422 live births at El-Khadra Teaching Hospital and 107 children were diagnosed with 46 different metabolic disorders. A significantly high consanguinity rate was observed (86.9%) among parents of the affected children. Family history of previous affected children was noted in 63.5% of cases. Male to female ratio was 1.18:1. The most frequent IEM cases were amino acids disorders (25%), carbohydrate disorders (14.9%), lysosomal storage diseases (14%), organic aciduria and energy metabolic defects (9.3% each). The main clinical presentations were jaundice, hepatomegaly and seizures. Most children presented between one and six months of age (43.4%); whereas the median age at diagnosis was eight months. Thirty-eight children (35.5%) were born at El-Khadra Hospital with IEM giving a birth prevalence of 1:1458 live births, (1:6158 for aminoaciduria and 1:6927 for carbohydrate disorders). Conclusion: IEM disorders are common in Libya. Efforts to enhance awareness among pediatricians and primary healthcare providers should be supported and encouraged as many diseases are still undiagnosed. It is very important to consider IEM among all children when they present any worrying or suspicious symptoms or signs which do not respond to conventional treatment. Although our findings are preliminary, and probably the first to be conducted in Libya, they suggest ideas for decision makers to plan services including newborn screening programs and country-wide research of IEM diseases. © 2013 AlObaidy, licensee Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals.","Consanguinity; Inborn errors of metabolism; Libya","amino acid; carbohydrate; aciduria; amino acid deficiency; aminoaciduria; Article; birth order; caregiver; child; childhood disease; clinical feature; consanguinity; demography; descriptive research; energy; family history; female; hepatomegaly; human; inborn error of metabolism; infant; jaundice; Libyan; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; live birth; lysosome storage disease; major clinical study; male; medical record; onset age; parent; residential area; seizure; social aspect; teaching hospital",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907897140

They range from simple and less efficient linear regulators, to more complex power electronic based converters. Therefore, based on the requirements of the system, more efforts should be focused on the design of the converter that links the PV generator to the load, in addition new and more sophisticated control strategies must be added into the system. Undoubtedly, energy storage system is one of the systems that require more efficiency at the conversion stage as well as adequate algorithms and control strategies, for ensuring long lasting at the energy storage device. In particular, the process of charging a battery requires a determinate number of stages, for ensuring long-life for the battery. At this paper, is exposed the design process of a 140W regulator for a battery based energy storage system. The regulator designed is a SEPIC converter that guarantees high efficiency under a wide range of operation. Additionally, the power converter is governed by a maximum power point tracking algorithm (MPPT) and control strategies that ensure an adequate process of charge for the batteries. Besides, a software tool was proposed for supervising the different stages of the charge as well as the complete energy storage system. The system was implemented and tested experimentally in order to verify the behavior under each stage of the battery charging process. © 2013 IEEE.","Charge regulator; DC/DC converter; MPPT; State feedback control","Charge regulator; Control strategies; Design and implementations; Different stages; Energy storage systems; Linear regulators; Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms; MPPT; Algorithms; DC-DC converters; Energy storage; State feedback; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897859139

Thelower emissions for natural gas are primarily due to differences in the current fleets' averageefficiency - 53 percent for natural gas versus 35 percent for coal, and a higher carbon contentper unit of energy for coal than natural gas. Even using unconventional natural gas, from tightsands, shale and coal beds, and compared with a 20-year global warming potential (GWP),natural gas-fired electricity has 39 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal perdelivered megawatt-hour (MWh) using current technology.In a life cycle analysis (LCA), comparisons must be based on providing an equivalentservice or function, which in this study is the delivery of 1 MWh of electricity to an end user.This life cycle greenhouse gas inventory also developed upstream (from extraction to deliveryto a power plant) emissions for delivered energy feedstocks, including six different domesticsources of natural gas, of which three are unconventional gas, and two types of coal, and thencombines them both into domestic mixes. These are important characterizations for the LCAcommunity, and can be used as inputs into a variety of processes. However, these upstream,or cradle-to-gate, results are not appropriate to compare when making energy policydecisions, since the two uncombusted fuels do not provide an equivalent function. Theseresults highlight the importance of specifying an end-use basis-not necessarily powerproduction-when comparing different fuels.Despite the conclusion that natural gas has lower greenhouse gases than coal on adelivered power basis, the extraction and delivery of the gas has a large climate impact -32percent of U.S. methane emissions and 3 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases (EPA, 2011b). AsFigure ES-2 shows, there are significant emissions and use of natural gas-13 percent at thecity or plant gate-even without considering final distribution to small end-users. The vastmajority of the reduction in extracted natural gas -64 percent cradle-to-gate-are notemitted to the atmosphere, but can be attributed to the use of the natural gas as fuel forextraction and transport processes such as compressor operations. Increasing compressorefficiency would lower both the rate of use and the CO2 emissions associated with thecombustion of the gas for energy. Note that this figure accounts for the total mass of naturalgas extracted from the earth, including water, acid gases, and other non-methane content. But, with methane making up 75 to 95 percent of the natural gas flow, there are manyopportunities for reducing the climate impact associated with direct venting to theatmosphere. A further 24 percent of the natural gas losses can be characterized as pointsource, and have the potential to be flared-essentially a conversion of GWP-potent methaneto carbon dioxide. The conclusions drawn from this analysis are robust to a wide array of assumptions.However, as with any inventory, they are dependent on the underlying data, and there aremany opportunities to enhance the information currently being collected. This analysis showsthat the results are both sensitive to and impacted by the uncertainty of a few key parameters:use and emission of natural gas along the pipeline transmission network; the rate of naturalgas emitted during unconventional gas extraction processes such as well completion andworkovers; and the lifetime production of wells, which determine the denominator overwhich lifetime emissions are placed.This analysis inventoried both average and marginal production rates for each natural gastype, with results shown in Table ES-1. The average represents natural gas produced from allwells, including older and low productivity stripper wells. The marginal production raterepresents natural gas from newer, higher productivity wells. The largest difference was foronshore conventional natural gas, which had a 41 percent reduction in upstream greenhousegas emissions from 20.1 to 34.2 lbs CO2e/MMBtu when going from marginal to averageproduction rates. This change has little impact on emissions from power production.This inventory and analysis are for greenhouse gases only, and there are many otherfactors that must be considered when comparing energy options. A full inventory ofconventional and toxic air emissions, water use and quality, and land use is currently underdevelopment, and will allow comparison of these fuels across multiple environmentalcategories. Further, all options need to be evaluated on a sustainable energy basis, consideringfull environmental performance, as well as economic and social performance, such as theability to maintain energy reliability and security. There are many opportunities fordecreasing the greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas and coal extraction, delivery andpower production, including reducing fugitive methane emissions at wells and mines, andimplementing advanced combustion technologies and carbon capture and storage. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895411090

To accomplish this, BCAP was charged with two tasks: (1) to support the establishment and production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy in selected areas, and (2) to assist agricultural and forest land owners and operators with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility.BCAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Farm Service Agency (FSA). BCAP provides two categories of financial assistance: annual and establishment payments, which share in the cost of establishing eligible biomass crops and maintaining production; and matching payments, which share in the cost of the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of biomass to an eligible biomass conversion facility. The payments have different eligibility and sign-up requirements, payment rates, and contract lengths. BCAP assistance for establishing and producing biomass crops is available within designated project areas. BCAP project areas are specific geographic areas where producers may enroll land into BCAP contracts and produce specified biomass crops. As of June 2012, eleven BCAP project areas had been approved.On June 11, 2009, FSA implemented one portion of BCAP-the Collection, Harvest, Storage, and Transportation (CHST) matching payment program-through a Notice of Funds Availability in the Federal Register. The partial implementation created a possible unintended consequence of market competition for wood shavings, wood chips, sawdust, and other wood ""scraps"" between traditional purchasers-namely landscapers and particleboard manufactures-and facilities that convert biomass to energy. The issuance of the BCAP proposed rule on February 8, 2010, suspended CHST program enrollment and proposed rules for the implementation of the remainder of the BCAP program. USDA issued the BCAP final rule on October 27, 2010, implementing both program components.Under the 2008 farm bill, BCAP was authorized to receive such sums as necessary, meaning that funding for BCAP is both mandatory through the Commodity Credit Corporation and open-ended since it depends on program participation. However, recent congressional actions (as part of the annual appropriations process) have capped program funding in FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. In response to funding reductions, USDA temporarily suspended the CHST matching payment portion of the program through FY2011, and re-prioritized future program funds in favor of uses that emphasize annual and establishment payments, especially under existing contracts, over CHST matching payments.While BCAP is in the early stages of implementation, concerns regarding eligibility, funding, and sustainability continue to be discussed. These issues could shape future congressional action on the program in the context of budgetary measures and possible reauthorization in the next farm bill. In particular, BCAP does not include ""baseline"" budget spending beyond FY2012. Based on current budgetary requirements, the authorizing committees could potentially need to secure offset funding if BCAP were to be reauthorized in the next farm bill.This could prove difficult given tight budgetary constraints and the more recent and higher projections of the program's cost compared to its initial cost estimates. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The system has large resources compared to the size of Iceland's economy. The main utilization practice for electrical energy hitherto has been bulk Energy Intensive Industry (EII) with relatively flat and constant load. A possible future interconnection to neighboring countries via High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) submarine cable could affect dramatically the operations planning framework, for instance with possibilities of linking to wind power, local and/or foreign and short term markets. This should affect factors such as operation strategies for hydro system and the planning and operations tools needed to realize this rent. Planning tools and modeling for hydro dominated systems may in some respects inherently be more complex than those of thermally dominated systems, due to the time-interdependence associated with reservoir storage and various constraints [4]. In this paper we give an overview of historical and current modeling practices used both as a tool to form system expansion policies and operations strategies in the long, medium and short term. The basic time frame requirements for such tools are discussed in this paper and how the may evolve in the future in terms of methodology and other important issues. Conclusions will be drawn regarding these planning tools and the future planning and operations framework in such a system, especialy the time frame issue. The long and medium term hydro-scheduling problem has been investigated since in the early part of the 20th century [14], applying various optimization and iterative simulation methodologies. The practices applied in the Icelandic system have traditionally been based on Scandinavian approaches, such as those originally suggested by [9], [17] and [2]. These methods in hydro dominated systems have been based on an iterative calculation of water value tables based on iterative dynamic programming like algorithms. Future methodology may involve LP or SDDP [16], but with a short term considerations (DTM, see below) to certain extent as outlined in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894200826

Considerable research has gone into developing simulation models to comprehensively study the energy dynamics of different types of data center equipment in order to better understand how best to conserve it. Most of this research has gone towards modeling of servers and switches but relatively less amount of work is available on Storage Area Networks (SAN). Storage Area Networks play a very vital role in the data center architecture by using specialized storage hardware to manage data. In this paper, we have extended the Green Cloud simulator for computing the energy consumed by different SAN components. A simulation environment for SAN has been presented using the 'Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling' (DVFS) and 'Dynamic Shutdown' (DNS) techniques. The simulation results obtained through two SAN prototype models shows the energy consumption of SAN components to vary with the network topology and type of technique used in scheduling of the workloads. Our experimental simulations revealed that there is an increasing percentage of energy savings in DNS mode for both topologies for an increasing number of servers.

For these purposes, an own model has been made, with calculations based on real wind and solar energy potential data. Two hybrid system configurations have been observed; the first where both generating facilities have equal installed capacities (i.e. 2 MW each) and the second where the installed capacity of the WPP is five times larger. Effects of implementing these hybrid power systems have been verified by carrying out a simulation study using a practical load demand profile, with a recorded maximum hourly value of 3.5 MW. The complementary nature is more expressed in the first hybrid system configuration, where a decrease in the output power variations from the hybrid system considered as a whole in comparison with variations when considering generating facilities individually, has been observed. But, this hybrid system configuration manages to meet hourly consumption in only 7.06% of time. The complementary effect is reduced in the second hybrid system configuration, and output power variations have been observed in a very wide range. However, this system manages to meet hourly consumer needs in 41% of the time. Neither one of the two cases can independently satisfy observed demand on hourly basis. Acknowledging the fact that in the second case there are periods of time when the generated electricity is up to 3.5 times higher than the hourly consumption, as well as the positive difference between generation and consumption on annual basis, an off grid system would be feasible with proper storage facilities. © 2013 IEEE.","complementary nature; hybrid system; load demand; power output variability; solar energy; wind energy","complementary nature; Electricity generation; Hybrid power systems; Load demand; Photovoltaic power plant; Power out put; Solar and wind energies; System configurations; Electricity; Energy conversion; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Hybrid systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893808544

The methodology utilises the time dimension of consumer power demand to generate a meaningful energy characteristic for each controllable household load. It is supposed that consumer preferences can be reflected entirely within the energy characteristic and hence controlling loads based on energy will result in better outcomes for the consumer. Hence guarantees can be placed on consumer satisfaction, while still near-optimally scheduling the resultant power flows. Simulation results for each second in a day are provided in MATLAB/Simulink for 7 typical New Zealand houses, and show that consumers with electric vehicles can save approximately 17% of their power bill without sacrificing comfort using practical time-of-use pricing rates. © 2013 IEEE.","Automatic control; Decentralized control; Distributed algorithms; Distributed power generation; Energy management; Energy storage; Home automation; Load management; Power demand; Smart grids; Smart homes","Consumer preferences; Consumer satisfactions; Demand side managements; Energy characteristics; Home automation; Power demands; Smart grid; Smart homes; Automation; Control; Decentralized control; Distributed power generation; Electric load management; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy storage; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Parallel algorithms; Industrial electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893554602

They contain reservoir rocks that have no presently exploitable resource within their pore system, perhaps because they lack a viable system for trapping buoyant fluids. The ultimate potential and impacts of CO2 injection into DSFs can only be assessed through dynamic simulations built on regional-scale static geocellular models. Static models must represent real geological heterogeneity of the DSF. Dynamic simulations must incorporate real hydrodynamic flow across boundaries of the DSF. Regulation of subsurface CO2 storage requires an assessment of likely interactions between CO2 storage operations and other subsurface resources. Basin-scale static models of DSFs in the Gippsland, Otway, and Surat basins of eastern Australia have been constructed for use in dynamic simulations of CO2 injection and storage. These simulations examine far-field effects of a variety of storage operations scenarios on the production of oil, gas, coal, groundwater, geothermal energy and on other competing uses of pore space basinwide.",,,Abstract Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893541050

With increased introduction of variable and renewable electricity production resources such as wind power and solar power, the need for power balancing also increases. If EV batteries can be used as individual and flexible storages performing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services with or without the possibility to inject power to the grid, this increased need for power balancing could be met. This paper investigates the potential for individual and flexible EV batteries to be used for V2G services by introducing a new model. With the model it is possible to estimate the potential for V2G power consumption and power injection with a well-developed charging infrastructure including dynamic EVC at electrified roads (ERs) and static EVC at parking sites. The model includes models for time-dependent V2G potential, dynamic EVC at ERs, static EVC at parking sites, vehicle mobility and vehicle driving power demand. A case study shows the resulting V2G potential for power consumption and power injection under different conditions with a charging infrastructure including both dynamic and static EVC infrastructure. © 2013 IEEE.","electric vehicle charging (EVC); Electric vehicles (EVs); electrified roads (ERs); plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); electrified roads (ERs); Plug-in-hybrid; Vehicleto-Grid (V2G); Electric vehicles; Hybrid vehicles; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Wind power; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893297039

Curves showing the system risk for different levels of demand are obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation approach that performs unit commitment and economic load dispatch, considering randomly generated outages and randomly selected synthetic wind and solar generation profiles created using a semi-parametric model.

A conventional LNG supply chain is not the best solution taking into consideration its high investment. The possibility of using a small scale LNG supply chain concept (Mini LNG) is recently sought by the government and private sectors in Indonesia. It is even more promising when we consider the amounts and number of stranded gas fields in the country. One of the main obstacles to the development plan is the geographical position of Indonesia as an archipelagic country. This paper presents a case study of LNG supply chain model of 10 mmscfd Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in Batam and its design of LNG transportation model from Batam to Siantan-West Kalimantan [1]. The distance between Batam and Siantan is approximately 392 nautical miles. Two main objectives are covered in this paper. The first one is an implementation of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to select the best location for mini LNG plant, and the second one is to design the LNG supply chain model based on optimization approach. The AHP model uses a pairwise comparison of 4 (four) qualitative attributes and 14 (fourteen) sub-attributes. 3 alternatives of location for mini LNG plant are evaluated, namely: Tanjung Uncang, Pemping Island and Janda Berhias Island. A sensitivity analysis by varying the weight of some critical attributes is also conducted to ensure that preferred location is sensitively selected with minimum error. The optimization of the LNG supply chain model is carried out by means of Gradually Reduced Gradient (GRG) methods. The Objective is to attain one design that will minimize investment (cost). Decision variables of the model are LNG plant capacity storage tank capacity in loading and receiving terminal, vessel size, number of round trip, number of operating vessels, regasification capacity at the receiving terminal, and others.

PV uses solar radiation, which is essentially a flux of elementary particles that promote photoreactions and generate a flow of electrons, whereas CSP harnesses irradiative solar energy, which is easily transformed into heat through absorption by gases, liquids, or solid materials and is then converted to mechanical energy and finally electrical energy. At the end of 2012, the world's PV installations totaled 32 Gw, compared to a cumulative 2.9 Gw of CSP capacity, the bulk concentrated in Spain (68%) and the US (28%). At least 7.3 Gw of new CSP capacity is in various stages of preconstruction development in the US, the Middle East and North Africa, and in China, India, and Australia. Saudi Arabia, notably, will lead a longer-term charge with its ambitions to generate 75 to 110 Tw-hr by 2032, which could require the installation of 25 Gw of capacity in Saudi Arabia alone. Yet, PV's growth is slated to soar to a staggering 41 Gw by 2014, an expansion that will be undertaken by all major world regions. Accounting for 84% of electricity generation costs of CSP, initial investment requirements range from $2,500 to $10,200/kw, depending on capacity factor and storage size. In contrast, solar PV's initial investment costs range from $3,500 to $6,000/kw.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893006487

Physiochemical properties of PCM and the capsules size are the two most effective properties of the storage system. Number of researchers investigated the performance of such systems under different designs and operating conditions. In this work a LTSS system is constructed with PCM capsules of different sizes and of different PCM properties. The capsules are packed with different capsules sizes and varying PCM properties along the bed to match the temperature profile best. The performance of the LTSS as described is investigated numerically and presented in terms of the bed temperature profiles function of location and charging time. The effectiveness of the storage system is presented in terms of time evolution of the liquid fraction of the PCM and in terms of the percentage of the energy storage in the PCM. The first represent the degree of utilization of the PCM and the later shows the effectiveness of the heat transfer and storage process of the LTSS for different system designs.

Individual states were simulated in which working conditions were set for the capability of solar absorption cooling to balance heat loads in the room. The research is based on an experimental device (absorption units with a performance of 10kW) developed at the STU in Bratislava (currently inputs and outputs of cold sources are being measured). Outputs in this paper are processed so that they connect the entire scheme of the solar absorption cooling system (i.e. the relationship between the solar systems hot and cold storage and the absorption unit).

A cathode chamber with cylindrical coaxial electrode is proposed. Regarding the transport properties of the cathode area, the flow regime in the cathode compratment is studied. The aim of the study is to formulate a flow model of the cathode cell and to characterize the flow field in view of increasing the cell potential for enhanced oxygen reduction. The task is solved by numerical modeling and simulation. Commercial computational flow dynamics (CFD) software was used. A two-phase quasi-homogeneous mixture model is formulated and used in couple with k- turbulence model. The key parameters of the flow field, i.e. pressure and fluid velocity distribution, as well as energy dissipation rate are determined and visualized. The results are compared with reference data from the literature. The model can be combined with the current distribution model (Ohm's law for ionic conduction), the electrode kinetic expressions (Butler-Volmer) and a diffusion convection equation for the ionic transport and can be implemented for complete description of current distribution and cell voltage thus promoting future analyses of the energy-storage system. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.","Cathode; CFD; Flow field analysis; Fuel cell","Computational flows; Current distribution; Diffusion-convection equations; Energy dissipation rate; Energy-storage systems; Flow field analysis; Model and simulation; Oxygen reduction reaction; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Ejectors (pumps); Electric current distribution measurement; Electrolytic reduction; Exhibitions; Flow fields; Fuel cells; Ionic conduction; Sulfur compounds; Turbulence models; Cathodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892558211

Despite the addition of a relatively small amount of carbon to the atmosphere, compared to natural fluxes from the oceans and land surface, the human perturbation to the carbon cycle is increasingly recognized as a main factor driving climate change over the past 50 years. If humans add only a small amount of CO2 to the atmosphere each year, why is that contribution important to global climate change? The answer is that the oceans, vegetation, and soils do not take up carbon released from human activities quickly enough to prevent CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere from increasing. Humans tap the huge pool of fossil carbon for energy, and affect the global carbon cycle by transferring fossil carbon-which took millions of years to accumulate underground-into the atmosphere over a relatively short time span. As a result, the atmosphere contains approximately 35% more CO2 today than prior to the beginning of the industrial revolution. As the CO2 concentration grows it increases the degree to which the atmosphere traps incoming radiation from the sun, which further warms the planet. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is mitigated to some extent by two huge reservoirs for carbon-the global oceans and the land surface-which currently take up more carbon than they release. They are net sinks for carbon. Currently, most of the total global carbon sink is referred to as the unmanaged, or background, carbon cycle. Very little carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored, or sequestered, by deliberate action. If the oceans, vegetation, and soils did not act as sinks, then the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would increase even more rapidly. Congress is considering legislative strategies to reduce U.S. emissions of CO2 and/or increase the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. Congress may also opt to consider how land management practices, such as afforestation, conservation tillage, and other techniques, might increase the net flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the land surface. Some land management practices may be eligible to receive carbon offsets in cap-and-trade legislation that is under consideration. A capand-trade system designed to include carbon offsets would likely need an accurate and precise accounting for the tons of carbon sequestered deliberately by land management practices. How the ocean sink could be managed to store more carbon is unclear. Iron fertilization and deep ocean injection of CO2 are in an experimental stage, and their promise for long-term enhancement of carbon uptake by the oceans is not well understood. Of additional concern is how the ocean and land surface sinks will behave over the coming decades and longer, and whether they will continue to take up more carbon than they release. The uncertainty in the future behavior of carbon sinks implies that accurately predicting the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in the future is also uncertain, even if the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere could be controlled precisely. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Large, industrial sources of CO2, such as electricity-generating plants, are likely initial candidates for CCS because they are predominantly stationary, single-point sources. Electricity generation contributes over 40% of U.S. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Congressional interest has grown in CCS as part of legislative strategies to address climate change. On February 13, 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5), which included $3.4 billion for projects and programs related to CCS. Of that amount, $1.52 billion would be made available for a competitive solicitation for industrial carbon capture and energy efficiency improvement projects, $1 billion for the renewal of FutureGen, and $800 million for U.S. Department of Energy Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III solicitations, which specifically target coal-based systems that capture and sequester, or reuse, CO2 emissions. The $3.4 billion contained in ARRA greatly exceeds the federal government's cumulative outlays for CCS research and development since 1997. The large and rapid influx of funding for industrial-scale CCS projects may accelerate development and deployment of CO2 capture technologies. Currently, U.S. power plants do not capture large volumes of CO2 for CCS, even though technology is available that can potentially remove 80%-95% of CO2 from a point source. This is due, in part, to the absence of either an economic incentive (i.e., a price for captured CO2) or a regulatory requirement to curtail CO2 emissions. In addition, DOE estimates that CCS costs between $100 and $300 per metric ton (2,200 pounds) of carbon emissions avoided using current technologies. Those additional costs mean that power plants with CCS would require more fuel, and costs per kilowatt-hour would be higher than for plants without CCS. After CO2 is captured from the source and compressed into a liquid, pipelines or ships would likely convey the captured CO2 to storage sites to be injected underground. Three main types of geological formations are being considered for storing large amounts of CO2 as a liquid: oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. The deep ocean also has a huge potential to store carbon; however, direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean is still experimental, and environmental concerns have forestalled planned experiments in the open ocean. Mineral carbonation-reacting minerals with a stream of concentrated CO2 to form a solid carbonate-is well understood, but it also is still an experimental process for storing large quantities of CO2. The increase in funding for CCS provided for in ARRA and by other economic incentives may lead to less expensive and more effective technologies for capturing large quantities of CO2. Without a carbon price or a regulatory requirement to cap CO2 emissions, however, it will be difficult to predict or evaluate how the technology would be deployed throughout the U.S. energy sector. By comparison, transporting, injecting, and storing CO2 underground may be less daunting. A large pipeline infrastructure for transporting CO2 could be very costly, however, and considerable uncertainty remains over how large quantities of injected CO2 would be permanently stored underground. To help resolve these uncertainties, DOE has initiated large-scale CO2 injection tests in a variety of geologic reservoirs that are to take place over the next several years. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The questions are broadly representative of typical inquiries regarding the process and mechanics of storing CO2 underground, how much might be stored, and what might happen to CO2 once it is injected underground. Geologic sequestration is one step in a process termed carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. Following capture and transportation, CO2 would be injected into geologic formations that have suitable volume, or pore space, to retain large quantities of the captured gas. Currently, the most promising reservoirs for storing CO2 are oil and gas fields, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. Preventing CO2 from escaping a geologic formation would require careful reservoir characterization in advance of the injection phase of a project, as well as monitoring during and after CO2 injection. Knowledge gained from over 30 years of injecting CO2 underground to enhance oil recovery would be applied to storing CO2 for CCS purposes. In addition, a variety of techniques are currently available for monitoring leaks from a reservoir, and knowledge gained from field testing may lead to improved or new technologies for detecting CO2 leakage. Given the complexity of most geologic reservoirs, and the potentially huge volumes of CO2 that may be injected, risk of some CO2 leakage over time may never completely be eliminated. Even with careful characterization of a potential reservoir and monitoring of CO2 migration during and after injection, the detailed fate of CO2 stored underground may not be thoroughly understood. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has made an assessment of the potential sequestration capacity across the United States and parts of Canada and has determined that there exists sufficient volume to store approximately 600 years of CO2 produced from total U.S. fossil fuel emissions (at current rates). The sequestration capacity estimate is primarily drawn from existing information on the geology and depends on several assumptions about geologic sequestration mechanisms. How the DOE estimate will compare to the actual sequestration capacity will depend, in part, on the results from a series of seven large-scale CO2 injection experiments to be conducted by seven regional carbon sequestration partnerships across the United States. DOE has awarded funds totaling $456.7 million for the seven injection tests, which are scheduled to begin in 2009. Many people are unfamiliar with the concept of sequestering carbon-most likely in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2)-underground in geologic reservoirs. This chapter answers questions broadly representative of typical queries about why, where, and how CO2 may be stored underground, as well as how much CO2 might be stored. In addition, this chapter answers several questions about what might happen if CO2 escapes from underground storage. The term carbon sequestration includes carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), but it is also used to refer to the biological uptake of carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This chapter does not discuss biological sequestration.1 Capturing and storing CO2 in the ocea ns is another possible option for carbon sequestration, although currently it is not deemed as promising as underground sequestration.2 The only operating major commercial project dedicated solely to CO2 sequestration in a geologic reservoir today is the Sleipner Project, located approximately 150 miles off the coast of Norway in the North Sea. Two other operating commercial-scale CO2 sequestration ventures-the Weyburn Project in south central Canada and the In Salah Project in Algeria-use the injected CO2 to help recover oil and natural gas, respectively. In the United States, the oil and gas industry injects approximately 48 million metric tons of CO2 each year for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), but permanently sequestering CO2 has not been a focus of these EOR activities to date. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has sponsored carbon sequestration research and development since 1997, and is embarking on a third phase of its geologic carbon sequestration research and development program. DOE is planning seven large-scale CO2 sequestration injection experiments beginning in 2009. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This approach may require the transporting of captured carbon dioxide via pipeline to an underground storage reservoir with the intent of keeping it out of the atmosphere. Congress has begun to address this issue. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) contains measures to promote research and development of CCS technology, to assess sequestration capacity, and to clarify the framework for issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. Other legislative proposals have also sought to encourage the development of CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation technology. Further, measures were introduced in the 110th Congress, including the Carbon Dioxide Pipeline Study Act of 2007 (S. 2144), which would have required the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating a network of CO2 pipelines for CCS. Such a network could develop in the future with or without legislative action. If these pipelines were to cross state lines, it could raise important issues concerning regulatory jurisdiction over siting and pricing. This chapter discusses federal jurisdictional uncertainty over CO2 pipelines under existing law, as well as potential legislative activity to address any possible regulatory ""gap"" in jurisdiction. It should be noted that such a potential gap does not necessarily demand federal legislative resolution. Nevertheless, some analysts, drawing on the history of oil and natural gas pipeline development, anticipate a potential need for better defined federal legislative/regulatory authority over an interstate CO2 pipeline network. Accordingly, Congress may be called upon to consider whether existing federal jurisdictional disclaimers and the state-by-state regulatory structure for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) pipelines is an appropriate regulatory scheme for a possible interstate CO2 pipeline network in support of CCS. Congress could amend existing statutes, such as those related to the interstate pipeline jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to provide for definitive CO2 pipeline rate jurisdiction by the federal government if it does not favor the existing regulatory scheme. Alternatively, Congress could establish another federal regulator of CO2 pipelines or possibly other legislation to amend the existing regulatory scheme. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One approach is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) - capturing CO2 at its source (e.g., a power plant) and storing it indefinitely (e.g., underground) to avoid its release to the atmosphere. A common requirement among the various techniques for CCS is a dedicated pipeline network for transporting CO2 from capture sites to storage sites. In the 110th Congress, there has been considerable debate on the capture and sequestration aspects of carbon sequestration, while there has been relatively less focus on transportation. Nonetheless, there is increasing understanding in Congress that a national CCS program could require the construction of a substantial network of interstate CO2 pipelines. S. 2144 and S. 2191 would require the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such a network of pipelines. S. 2323 would require carbon sequestration projects to evaluate the most cost-efficient ways to integrate CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation. S. 2149 would allow seven-year accelerated depreciation for qualifying CO2 pipelines. P.L. 110-140, signed by President Bush on December 19, 2007, requires the Secretary of the Interior to recommend legislation to clarify the issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. That CCS and related legislation have been more focused on the capture and storage of CO2 than on its transportation, reflects a perception that transporting CO2 via pipelines does not present a significant barrier to implementing large-scale CCS. Notwithstanding this perception, and even though regional CO2 pipeline networks already operate in the United States for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), developing a more expansive national CO2 pipeline network for CCS could pose numerous new regulatory and economic challenges. There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of CO2 itself, and pipeline safety. Furthermore, because CO2 pipelines for EOR are already in use today, policy decisions affecting CO2 pipelines take on an urgency that is, perhaps, unrecognized by many. Federal classification of CO2 as both a commodity (by the Bureau of Land Management) and as a pollutant (by the Environmental Protection Agency) could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation, but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with CO2 pipeline operations today. In addition to these issues, Congress may examine how CO2 pipelines fit into the nation's overall strategies for energy supply and environmental protection. If policy makers encourage continued consumption of fossil fuels under CCS, then the need to foster the other energy options may be diminished - and vice versa. Thus decisions about CO2 pipeline infrastructure could have consequences for a broader array of energy and environmental policies. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However the application of WO3 as an EC material was rarely reported. Therefore in this research EC was prepared from WO3 nanomaterial synthesized by a sol-gel process. The WO3 gel was spin-coated on graphite substrates and calcined at various temperatures of 300°C, 400°C, 500°C and 600°C for 1 h. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were used to observe the capacitive property of the WO3 samples. SEM, XRD, FTIR and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses were used to characterize the material structures. WO3 calcined at 400°C was proved to have the highest capacitance of 233.63 F·g-1 (1869 mF·cm-2) at a scan rate of 2 mV·s-1 in 1 mol/L H2SO4 between potentials -0.4 and 0.4 V vs. SCE. Moreover it also showed the most symmetric CV curves as the indication of a good EC. Hence WO3 calcined at 400°C is a potential candidate for EC material of pseudocapacitor type. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","calcination; electrochemical capacitor (EC); sol-gel process; WO3 nanomaterial",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890103263

The proposed method minimizes the cost to operate the microgrid while meeting various resource constraints. Forecast load and renewable resource power profiles are used to generate linear constraints. Storage conversion losses, which can be much more significant in microgrids, are innovatively accounted for within LP using auxiliary variables.

One method is to use electric vehicle (EV) batteries, connected through fast bidirectional chargers, as short time scale storage devices for intermittent power sources. This allows the high frequency components of intermittent power to be diverted to the EV battery, while the remaining, slowly changing power is fed to the AC distribution system. However, studies of lithium-ion (Li-ion) EV batteries have shown that frequent and rapid charging and discharging reduces battery lifetime. Using an empirically validated Li-ion battery degradation model, this paper demonstrates that the effect of intermittency mitigation (IM) on battery lifetime is small.

To optimise their survival probability, fish must balance the need to out-grow predators by maximising their growth, while also accumulating sufficient energy reserves to sustain them through winter. We tested the hypothesis that resource allocation in Chrysophrys auratus changed from maximising growth to maximising energy storage over their first summer-autumn by measuring recent growth rates from otolith increments, and lipid, protein and carbohydrate concentrations in fish. Lipid concentrations showed the greatest change over the growing season, increasing three-fold between summer and mid-autumn. Growth rates showed the opposite trend, being significantly lower in mid-autumn than in summer. The relationships between growth rate and lipid or protein concentrations were consistent with a shift in resource allocation from growth to storage. During summer and early autumn, growth rates were independent of protein or lipid concentrations, but during mid-autumn there were significant positive correlations between the variables. Biochemical concentrations were independent of fish size, indicating that the accumulation of sufficient energy reserves for winter is determined by the timing of settlement and subsequent feeding conditions, which are likely to affect interannual recruitment variability of this important species. © CSIRO 2013.","Carbohydrates; Daily otolith increments; Energy allocation; Lipids; Nutritional condition; Pagrus auratus; Proteins; Seasonal changes","carbohydrate; energy; feeding; fish; growing season; growth rate; juvenile; lipid; otolith; perciform; probability; protein; recruitment (population dynamics); resource allocation; summer; survival; temperate environment; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886791409

One of the problems normally faced in tropical countries is pest infestation by the insect Sitophilus zeamais Motsch during the storage of maize in silo. This research aimed to study the influence of microwave treatment to the mortality of insect pest Sitophilus zeamais Motsch and to the content of starch and protein of treated maize. The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Agicultural Energy and Laboratory of Food Chemistry, Bogor Agicultural University. The sample of 200 g of dry maize was invested by 50 insects and heated in a microwave exposed at 240, 480 and 720 W, respectively, for 60, 90 and 120 s. The results showed that 100% mortality could be achieved using microwave treatment with 720 W in 60 s which generated temperature of 74°C. The treatment used a very short time (60 s) compared to the use of hot air oven which needed 22 min exposure for a similar temperature. The short time heating by microwave had an advantage to maintain 68.5% starch content, and 9.4% protein while killing the insect pest totally.","Maize; Microwave treatment; Sitophilus zeamais Motsch","Hexapoda; Sitophilus zeamais; Zea mays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889033044

Along with this cancellation, effective manipulation and storage of an atomic population in various dressed states of this one-atom quantum system are also explored.

This is measured in terms of LPSP (Loss of Power Supply Probability), which is computed by simulation. The proposed method allows the possibility to supply excess power generated by the HES to the utility grid at a fixed sales price or through a Net Metering scheme. The system and design method proposed represent a viable alternative for grid-only power supply in rural/remote communities. As an example, a concrete case study is presented involving 15 homes (1 block) in Hanga Roa city of Easter Island, Chile. Results indicate that the grid-connected HES is highly beneficial for the block since it reduces long term costs of electricity generation and supply while at the same time supporting their energy consumption with cleaner, renewable energy sources, and contributing to reduce the load size of the utility grid power supply. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Business optimal design; Easter Island; Grid-connected HES (hybrid energy system); Hybrid PV (photovoltaic)-wind energy system; Life cycle cost; Net Metering","Energy utilization; Life cycle; Optimal systems; Photovoltaic cells; Wind power; Easter island; Hybrid energy system; Lifecycle costs; Net metering; Optimal design; Wind energy systems; Electric power distribution; design method; electricity generation; energy; energy use; hybrid; life cycle; photovoltaic system; simulation; Chile; Easter Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885948703

Volatiles released during storage at 20°C for 24h were monitored using on-line Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (m/. z 21-180). Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) was used to evaluate possible correlations between enzymes and volatiles released during storage. The results showed that temperature treatment had significant effect on all enzymes, except LOX. Temperature treatment at 70°C resulted in at least 65% decrease in POD and AAO activity. In contrast, SOD and CAT activities generally increased during storage after temperature treatments. PLSR2 results showed that volatiles released after different temperature treatments and 24h storage had a strong correlation with the residual activity of POD, AAO and SOD but not CAT and LOX. PLSR1 results suggested that POD had the highest correlation to volatile release during storage of processed broccoli followed by AAO, SOD, CAT and LOX (the least). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Broccoli; Enzyme activity; Storage; Temperature treatment; Volatile release","Ascorbic acid oxidase; Broccoli; Effects of temperature; Partial least square regression; Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometries; Superoxide dismutases; Temperature treatments; Volatile release; Energy storage; Enzyme activity; Mass spectrometry; Oxygen; Temperature; Enzymes; Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. italica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879779672

Where do they grow and what can be done to boost the levels of production? What impact does their cultivation have on the environment and development? The book starts with aspects of biomass accumulation, harvesting, transportation and storage, as well as conversion technologies for biofuels. This is followed by a look at the environmental impact and economic and social dimensions, including prospects for renewable energy. The book then goes on to cover all the main potential energy crops. For each main species it gives a brief description, outlines the ecological requirements, methods of propagation, crop management, rotation and production, harvesting, handling and storage, processing and utilization, then finishes with selected references.

Mitochondrial function (MF) analysis allows direct measurement of cellular metabolic function and may provide an additional index of hepatic health. Conventional MF analysis requires substantial tissue samples (.100 mg) obtained at open surgery. Here we report a method to assess MF using ,3 mg of tissue obtained by a Tru-cutH biopsy needle making it suitable for percutaneous application. Methods: An 18G BardH Max-coreH biopsy instrument was used to collect samples. The optimal Tru-cutH sample weight, stability in ice-cold University of Wisconsin solution, reproducibility and protocol utility was initially evaluated in Wistar rat livers then confirmed in human samples. MF was measured in saponin-permeabilized samples using high-resolution respirometry. Results:The average mass of a single rat and human liver Tru-cutH biopsy was 5.6060.30 and 5.1660.15 mg, respectively (mean; standard error of mean). Two milligram of sample was found the lowest feasible mass for the MF assay. Tissue MF declined after 1 hour of cold storage. Six replicate measurements within rats and humans (n = 6 each) showed low coefficient of variation (,10%) in measurements of State-III respiration, electron transport chain (ETC) capacity and respiratory control ratio (RCR). Ischemic rat and human liver samples consistently showed lower State-III respiration, ETC capacity and RCR, compared to normal perfused liver samples. Conclusion: Consistent measurement of liver MF and detection of derangement in a disease state was successfully demonstrated using less than half the tissue from a single Tru-cutH biopsy. Using this technique outpatient assessment of liver MF is now feasible, providing a new assay for the evaluation of hepatic function. © 2013 Chu et al.",,"animal tissue; Article; cell assay; cell function; clinical article; controlled study; electron transport chain capacity; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver mitochondrion; liver perfusion; liver weight; male; mitochondrial respiration; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; physical parameters; rat; respiratory chain; respiratory control ratio; respirometry; species difference; tissue characterization; animal; biopsy; electron transport; energy metabolism; evaluation study; homeostasis; liver function test; mitochondrion; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; Wistar rat; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus; Animals; Biopsy; Electron Transport; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Humans; Liver Function Tests; Male; Mitochondria; Rats, Wistar; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925552962

Flow periods and reservoir boundary types are easily delineated and identified with the use of these curves. Furthermore, near wellbore characterization results are now more reliable. In this study, type curves for a reservoir subject to bottom water energy and a vertical well completion are developed to reveal specific signatures that can be used to achieve efficient pressure test analysis. Both early and late flow periods were considered for a wellbore of negligible skin and wellbore storage influences. Results obtained show that dimensionless pressures depart from infinite-acting behavior and attain steady state at dimensionless time of order proportional to the square of dimensionless reservoir thickness. Wellbore dimensionless radius affects dimensionless time of attainment of steady state inversely, which is rather accelerated by large fluid withdrawal rates (large pressure drawdown). On the other hand, dimensionless pressure derivatives show gradual collapse to zero after expiration of infinite flow. The rate of collapse is strongly affected by wellbore properties and pressure drawdown. Radial flow is generally characterized by a constant slope of 1.151 during which period the dimensionless pressure derivative gave a value of 0.5. Following assumption of negligible wellbore skin and storage, no early time hump is observed on dimensionless derivative curves. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Bottom water; Dimensionless pressure; Dimensionless pressure derivative; Dimensionless time; Type curves; Vertical well","Bottom water; Dimensionless time; Pressure derivatives; Type curves; Vertical wells; Well completion; Well testing; Oil field equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885988891

Diesel generator is allocated only when the demand cannot be met by the renewable energy source including battery bank. From the results of the simulation, it was shown that the PV-Diesel hybrid system provide a reduction of the operational costs and air pollutants emitted to the atmosphere when compared with diesel only system. The hybrid system also gives an opportunity for renewable energy to supply 63% of the annual energy demand of the digital library and results in 37% reduction on diesel use.","Component sizing; Diesel generator; Digital library; Energy simulation; Hybrid system; Renewable energy; System design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885827567

A combination of ideologically driven environmental activism and inadequate fossil fuel industry response has made electricity rates soar with little carbon emissions benefit. Climate change, which tied for first place in the 2007 national election, fell to fifth place in 2013. The country needs a coherent long-term, bipartisan energy and climate strategy that makes realistic strides toward carbon capture and storage, creates a grid which allows renewable sources to enter once they become feasible, and science and innovation to drive future costs down, according to Chris Greig. Australia's coalbed methane production is growing to replace dwindling conventional production, but its shale gas resources - which are considerable - are located in the central part of the country where water is scarce and markets are far away.

Overlapped large polaron tunneling was the observed mechanism of charge carriers in used temperature range. The presence of colossal dielectric constant in the system is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner type polarization.

Such issues include how to make investment decisions in the context of federal fiscal constraints; how to distribute investments between activities to meet new demands for water supplies and aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection; how to maintain and reinvest in an aging portfolio of federal infrastructure (e.g., locks, dams, and levees); and how to effectively respond to and prepare for flood and drought emergencies. These issues often arise at the regional level, but have a federal nexus. For example, Congress may continue to be faced with issues associated with flooding (e.g., Hurricane Sandy response and recovery), navigation and water supply challenges due to drought-induced low river flows, and balancing water supply needs of farm and urban communities with protection of threatened and endangered species. The water resource issues of the 113th Congress are in part shaped by the actions of past Congresses, including the 112th Congress. In addition to holding numerous oversight hearings on agency policies and activities, the 112th Congress provided regular annual and supplemental appropriations for major federal water research agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation). The 112th Congress did not formally consider an omnibus Corps project authorization and policy bill-typically called a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA)-but a draft Senate Environment and Public Works bill was circulated and discussed in the fall of 2012. The 112th Congress also considered legislation to augment developed water supplies (e.g., water storage, water reuse), settle Indian water rights claims, and facilitate small conduit hydropower development. The 112th Congress considered several bills related to aquatic ecosystem restoration throughout the country (e.g., Everglades, Gulf Coast, Great Lakes, Klamath Basin, and Chesapeake Bay). The 112th Congress also considered legislation related to the energy sector's water use and the water sector's energy use, as well as water research and development legislation, including research related to climate change, water resource availability, drought indicators and streamflow. The 113th Congress may consider measures similar to those left pending in the 112th Congress (e.g., a farm bill, a WRDA, hydropower development, and water research legislation), as well as other proposals. Because of current water conditions, disasters, or legal or agency developments, certain basin issues are particularly likely to receive congressional attention (e.g., operation of federal reservoirs in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin, Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins (Central Valley Project), and Missouri River Basin). Other related legislation may include the energy-water nexus and environmental policy. This report discusses recent congressional activity and possible topics for the 113th Congress. It provides an overview of the federal role in water resources development, management, and protection, including a discussion of the two major federal water resources agencies and related legislation. It also discusses overarching policy issues, such as flood and drought management and response; project funding and authorization priorities; and aquatic ecosystem restoration. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is shown that, despite small amounts of stored energy per unit of weight in terms of economic characteristics, PSPPs are not inferior to the best electrochemical ABs. It has been found that the optimum height of water (in the head tank), at which minimum values of stored energy are reached, is 20 m.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Thermogravimetry, Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometery were used to investigate the samples. XRD patterns confirm the formation of Y-type hexaferrite phase. SEM patterns show that mostly grains exhibit rod shape and some appear in the form of hexagonal platelet shape. The rod or rice shape hexaferrite may be used in catalysis, information storage, surface enhanced Raman scattering, imaging and sensing. The samples with hexagonal platelet-like shape particles may be suitable as microwave absorbing materials. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectrum shows the presence of dissolved reactants Sr, Co, La and Fe. The saturation magnetization (Ms) calculated using the law of approach to saturation decrease with the increasing of lanthanum (La3+) contents. The decrease in 'Ms' may be because of magnetic dilution and spin canting and hence reduction in the super-exchange interactions. The retentivity (M r) and coercivity (Hc) enhance with the increase of La3+ contents. The enhancement in coercivity from 193 to 598.6 Oe may be because of increase in the porosity of samples with the increase of La 3+ contents. The coercivity of the synthesized materials is few hundred oersteds (Oe), which may be suitable for security, switching, sensing, high frequency applications and is also favorable for electromagnetic materials. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Hexaferrites; High frequency applications; Magnetic measurements; Microstructure; Sol-gel","Electromagnetic materials; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infra reds; Hexa-ferrites; High-frequency applications; Microwave absorbing materials; Structural and magnetic properties; Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Carbon dioxide; Coercive force; Differential scanning calorimetry; Magnetic variables measurement; Microstructure; Platelets; Scanning electron microscopy; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Surface scattering; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; Ferrite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887317019

Numerical experiments have been investigated on various low energy plasma focus devices with Kr and Xe filling gases using Lee model. The Lee model was applied to characterize and to find the optimum combination of soft X-ray yields (Ysxr) for krypton (~4 Å) and xenon (~3 Å) plasma focus.

The defense against excess cell swelling is accomplished also by a reduction of the intracellular osmolarity by synthesis of osmotically less active macromolecules from their specific subunits (proteosynthesis and lipogenesis). At the same time proteolysis and lipolysis is inhibited. Conversely, cell shrinkage stimulates lipolysis, degradation of proteins to amino acids, degradation of glycogen to glucosephosphate and simultaneously protein, lipid and glycogen synthesis is inibited. The degradation products are osmotically more active than the macromolecules and their breakdown generates cellular osmolarity resulting in water entry into cells. Recently new interesting view of chronic changes of the cell volume and its role in model of body weight loss and regain in obesity is considered; secretion profile of adipocytes is related to their size. Decrease of body weight is constituted by the drop of fat in adipocytes, they consequently shrink. Surrounding extracellular matrix has to adjust to traction forces. To ascertain a sufficient supply of glucose and fat for re-storage, adipocytes change their pattern of secreted adipokines altering the total body metabolism and promoting energy intake. Shrunken adipocytes show insulin resistance, whereas glucose uptake is facilitated in osmotically swollen adipocytes. Compensating mechanism in patients on very-low calorie diet during weight maintenance period includes increase in water content of adipose tissue correlating with increase of insulin sensitivity. Consideration of participation these mechanisms might bring new insight into understanding of obesity pathophysiology and treatment.","Adipokines; Chronic change of cell volume; Insulin; Obesity","adipocytokine; glucose; insulin; leptin; adipocyte; article; cell damage; cell volume; cytokine release; extracellular matrix; glucose transport; hormonal regulation; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipogenesis; lipolysis; low calory diet; obesity; protein synthesis; water content; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884556549

The change in the upstream reservoir operation from a conjunctive irrigation/hydropower mode to exclusively hydropower generation resulted in reducing the river flow downstream in the summer and increasing it in the winter. This phenomenon caused a downstream water shortage of 2,000- 3,000 Mm3/year in the summer and an excessive, often unutilized, flow of the same magnitude in the winter. This study suggests that the current practice of sequential in-channel reservoirs is not coping well with the needs of both upstream and downstream water users. Furthermore, it examines the alternative approach of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) in the upstream of Fergana Valley with a view to adapt to new water management reality. Favorable hydrogeology conditions prevailing in the Fergana Valley are envisaged to create benefits from MAR both at local and regional levels. The study follows a stepwise procedure of implementing MAR in the Fergana Valley, starting from the regional assessment of the MAR potential to testing MAR at the pilot scale through field and modeling studies. The regional assessment shows that over 500,000 ha, or 55% of the currently irrigated land in the Fergana Valley, can be shifted from canal irrigation to conjunctive surface water-groundwater irrigation. This will reduce the return flow to the river by 30% (or by 1,000 Mm3/year), and form free storages of 500 Mm3 in the command areas of main canals. Pilot-scale studies for Isfara and Sokh aquifers in the Fergana Valley support the results of regional assessment. Overall, groundwater development for irrigation and MAR in the Fergana Valley is expected to reduce the winter flow of the Syrdarya River at the valley outlet by 1,500 Mm3 /year, and consequently increase its summer flow by the same magnitude. This report proposes a major shift in the focus of development projects in the Fergana Valley, from rehabilitation of dense drainage systems to groundwater development for irrigation and MAR.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884255316

This system is composed of parabolic solar collectors, a packed-bed thermal storage tank, a Stirling engine and a multiple-effect evaporator (MEE) desalination plant. The operation is controlled by an Energy Management System (EMS), for an extended period of time, e.g. a year. The solar collectors are modeled by their heat rate loss equations. The packed bed storage system is discretized into layers reflecting the stratification in the tank, which allowed its partial differential equation to be transformed into several ordinary differential equations that are solved using the modified Euler method. The Stirling engine is modeled using a set of work rate equations representing its phases of operation. The MEE is modeled using a set of material and energy balance equations. The components' models are implemented and integrated into a system's model using an EMS, which is capable of simulating the operation of the system, given the design parameters, the meteorological data, and the electricity and water demand profiles. This software tool has been developed in MATLAB and is used to assess the sizes of the various components of the system based on their energy analysis requirement. These sizes are tuned using a sensitivity analysis approach, which would allow an estimation of the investment plant cost. The results of this tool will quantify the total energy supplied by the collectors to the Stirling engine and to the MEE desalination plant, the electric energy and the fresh water produced, and the components and overall system efficiencies. The operational cost is then calculated by carrying out a simulation of the system over an extended period of time, typically a year. Finally, a case study of a real-like system in a remote village, with no access to water or electricity, is investigated to determine the sizes of the different system components, the capital cost, the operating expenses, and the unit cost of water and electricity.",,"Desalination plant; Material and energy balances; Meteorological data; Model and simulation; Modified Euler method; Multiple-effect evaporator; Solar thermal electric; Solar thermal renewable; Collector efficiency; Computer simulation; Costs; Desalination; Economics; Electricity; Energy conversion; Heat storage; Investments; MATLAB; Meteorology; Ordinary differential equations; Packed beds; Partial differential equations; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Solar heating; Stirling engines; Tanks (containers); Water filtration; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883503122

It is observed that pre-treating Si and ePTFE substrates with different plasma modes results in significant changes of microstructures of as-deposited Mg and Mg-Ti films. After the hydrogenation of Mg films at 20 bar H2 pressure and 180 C temperature the formation of crystalline MgH2 phase is observed only for the films deposited on plasma non-treated Si substrates which had the films with smallest dimensions of its columnar structure. It is known that, usually, Ti additives has positive effect on hydrogenation properties of Mg, but in this study independently of the used substrate pre-treatment technique after the hydrogenation of Mg-Ti films their XRD analysis showed no peaks of the crystalline hydride phase. However, depending on the surface properties of the substrate after hydrogenation Mg-Ti films also have several disparities which are discussed and attributed to the potentially related substrate features. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Bearing in mind that hydrogen is important as an energy source in this paper we investigated the adsorption properties of sumanene toward hydrogen molecules. We used a theoretical and computational approach in the framework of density functional theory. Frontier molecular orbitals, HOMO and LUMO, are visualized and molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are created, in order to locate adsorption places. We determined H2 adsorption binding energies, for which we obtained the applicable results. The adsorption properties of sumanene molecules toward hydrogen molecules were discussed through analysis of the density of states, partial density of states and overlap population density of states. Our results indicate that the sumanene can be very useful in the practical application for storage of hydrogen, which is the basis for its successful energy implementation. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Water flood expansion was the key ingredient to provide the short term production assurance for the Asset. Field development activities have been progressing for two of the major stacked reservoirs with lion's share of incremental production (Mauddud & Upper Burgan), assuming that these reservoirs will get the benefit of water injection, to cope up with the enhanced level of production. Unfortunately, the water injection projects have been delayed till the end of 2013, leading to rapid decline in reservoir pressures and erosion in the well performance of the producers (naturally flowing as well as on artificial lift). A comprehensive review of the portfolio of all reservoirs was made vis-A-vis the drilling/ workover activities. Complete history of pressure-production data for last 40 years was analyzed using OFM. The output from the reservoir simulation models was analyzed & discussed with multi-disciplinary teams. Aggressive surveillance & data integration plan was made and implemented to identify the focus areas, from where ""new"" production can be accelerated and / or controlled, adhering to the best reservoir management practice. Isochronal reservoir pressure maps were updated with full field static bottom hole pressure surveys. Detailed analysis of the RFT/ PLT data was performed to optimize the perforations at layers with high reservoir pressure. New wells from shallower reservoirs were deepened to the reservoirs enjoying the active water drive and accordingly, completed for short term production till the water injection expansion project is commissioned. Integrated reservoir management approach was followed throughout the gamut of field development activities with multi-skill expertize reviewing as peers for smart decisions.The paper's objective is to share the integrated Reservoir management approach to beat the impact of delayed water injection projects on overall production portfolio, without compromising the technical requirement of voidage replacement ratio for depletion drive reservoirs with best practices approach.

It is unavoidable that the current fossil fuel economy will be replaced by a new economy. However, prospective alternative energy sources should conveniently replace fossil fuels and the transition from the old economy to a new one should take place smoothly. This can only happen if commonality is found between the goals of current major energy industries and the future new economy demands. Considering the significant consumption of hydrogen by the oil industry to convert crude oil into practical fuels, the most reasonable approach is to start with hydrogen as a commodity first prior to consider it as an alternative fuel. Because of the substantial emissions from the way hydrogen is produced, the best approach would be to adopt a new process which produces hydrogen with zero emissions. The use of concentrated solar energy can provide us the means to produce hydrogen with zero emissions. This would be the most appropriate first step in a transition where an alternative energy is used to produce another alternative energy source where in turn it serves in the refinement of the target fossil fuel. Once the new way of hydrogen production is fully adopted, it could be produced for consumption as a fuel as well. The main challenge, however, is to produce emission free hydrogen at a competitive cost so that it is attractive to industry. This paper presents a very promising technology for hydrogen production, which is called ""solar cracking"", where natural gas is decomposed into its components solar thermally with zero emissions. With this process, not only hydrogen but also another very valuable commodity is produced, namely carbon black. Emission free production of carbon black via this technique adds significant economic value and competitiveness into the process along with securing zero cost to CO2 sequestration, transportation, and storage. The paper defines the technical details on the challenges of this process to become commercial, and presents promising solutions to the problems of hydrogen producing solar cracking reactors. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Carbon black; Hydrogen; Iris mechanism; Natural gas; Reactor clogging; Solar thermal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883422825

Through this wireless function EVs get charged by microwave beam from transmitter and then receiver will capture this microwave beam which is transferred into DC power and finally stored in various electrochemical storages (e.g. Lithium ion cell, Supercapacitors). For environmental safety the beam emission zone will be protected by barrier which surrounds the vehicle charging area so that it doesn't cause any hazard on humans. Here, Li-ion battery replaces traditional fossil fuel system of automotive vehicles. Because now-a-days Li-ion batteries are considered as the dominant power source for EVs due to its high energy density, good cycle life, and good power performance.

Phase change materials (PCMs) are used to store energy in the process of changing the aggregate state from solid to liquid. The energy balance equations for the various elements of the still as well as for the PCM are formulated and numerically solved. In meteorological conditions taken on 15th of June 2011 at the Errachidia city (Latitude: 31°58'N, Longitude: 4°20'W), Morocco, numerical calculations have been carried out for three kinds of PCMs which have different melting temperatures. To validate the simulation results, the brackish water temperature is compared with the analytical expression and the existing results in the literature. The obtained results show that the excess energy produced during sunshine times is stored in a PCM for use later during the night. Moreover, it is highlighted that the choice of the phase change material (PCM) depends closely on the maximum of the brackish water temperature that can reach by the brackish water in the basin. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Brackish water; Desalination; Heat energy storage; Phase change material (PCM); Solar still","Aggregate state; Analytical expressions; Brackish water; Energy balance equations; Heat energy storage; Meteorological condition; Numerical calculation; Solar stills; Computer simulation; Desalination; Distillation; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Solar heating; Temperature; Water filtration; Phase change materials; brackish water; desalination; distillation; numerical model; solar power; water temperature; Morocco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879566126

The composites were prepared employing the solvent casting technique. The degradation kinetic parameters were obtained using the Coats-Redfern integral method for the reaction order and the E 2 function methodology to calculate the activation energy (E a). The addition of HA to these polymers matrices increased their glass transition temperature. This was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetery and dynamic-mechanical-thermal analysis. Also, the presence of HA increased the crystallization temperature of PLLA, implying a nucleation effect. The PLLA-HA and PLGA-HA composites exhibited better thermal stability, higher decomposition temperature, and higher activation energy for the decomposition process than the neat polymers. Morphology and dispersion of the filler are highly responsible for the thermal and mechanical properties of the composites, the PLGA-HA composites showed a well dispersion but no improvement on storage modulus was found. On the other hand, the storage modulus (E′) of PLLA-HA was enhanced, with respect to the neat polymer, mainly at temperatures above the glass transition. © 2013 Society of Plastics Engineers.",,"Comparative analysis; Crystallization temperature; Decomposition process; Decomposition temperature; Degradation kinetics; Nucleation effect; Thermal and mechanical properties; Thermo-mechanical; Activation energy; Copolymers; Degradation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dispersions; Elastic moduli; Glass; Glass transition; Morphology; Thermoanalysis; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882259221

We show that a generation mix comprising 49% hydro, 23% wind, 13% geothermal, 14% pumped hydro energy storage peaking plant, and 1% biomass-fuelled generation on an installed capacity basis, was capable of ensuring security of supply over an historic 6-year period, which included the driest hydrological year on record in New Zealand since 1931. Hydro spillage was minimised, or eliminated, by curtailing a proportion of geothermal generation. Wind spillage was substantially reduced by utilising surplus generation for peaking purposes, resulting in up to 99.8% utilisation of wind energy. Peaking requirements were satisfied using 1550. MW of pumped hydro energy storage generation, with a capacity factor of 0.76% and an upper reservoir storage equivalent to 8% of existing hydro storage capacity. It is proposed that alternative peaking options, including biomass-fuelled gas turbines and demand-side measures, should be considered. As a transitional policy, the use of fossil-gas-fuelled gas turbines for peaking would result in a 99.8% renewable system on an energy basis. Further research into whether a market-based system is capable of delivering such a renewable electricity system is suggested. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity; Generation; Renewable","Generation; Hydrological years; Installed capacity; Market-Based Systems; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Renewable; Renewable electricity; Security of supply; Electricity; Energy storage; Gas turbines; Wind power; Energy security; alternative energy; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity supply; geothermal energy; hydroelectric power; renewable resource; turbine; wind power; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880328231

Wind power growth, in particular, is likely to require the support of dedicated fast-start reserve capacity. Moreover, in New Zealand, non-pumped hydroelectricity-based storage has only limited potential to meet seasonal variations of hydro inflows. This constraint has contributed to several 'dry-year' events over the last decade. This case study surveys New Zealand electricity sector experts as to the feasibility of meeting reserve capacity needs while reducing carbon emissions through the introduction of pumped hydro and utility-scale batteries by 2025. Most respondents project peak power demand to continue to increase, resulting in new-build centralised (∼150 MW) thermal reserve power sources. Pumped hydro is seen by most as prohibitively costly, but is almost universally viewed as technically capable of providing renewables support and peak power adequacy. Utility-scale batteries are seen as least cost-effective, with very high storage costs per kWh and most likely only to be used in NZ for very high-value applications where there is a strong technical advantage, such as the six-second instantaneous reserve. A price of carbon of around NZ$100/tCO2-e, however, was seen as making these technologies much more competitive, and climate change mitigation was seen as a strong driver of these storage options. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost of storage; Energy storage; New Zealand; Pumped hydropower; Reserve electricity generation; Utility-scale batteries","Carbon emissions; Centralised; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Electricity sector; Electricity storages; Hydro inflow; Most likely; New zealand; Peak power; Power sources; Pumped hydropower; Renewable electricity; Renewables; Reserve capacity; Seasonal variation; Storage costs; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Energy storage; Hydroelectric power; Wind power; Costs; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy resource; energy use; hydroelectric power; perception; renewable resource; seasonal variation; storage; thermal power; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874557020

By means of fuel cells, hydrogen can serve as a clean fuel, i.e. without the emission of pollutant gases, for the production of electricity in which it is known as the hydrogen economy. Another main advantage of hydrogen is that is the fuel, which provides the highest amount of energy per unit weight. However, the large-scale implementation of hydrogen requires significant advances in further lowering its production costs and finding efficient techniques for its storage and transportation. At present, there is also a strong interest to couple the inherent intermittent renewable energy systems with the production of hydrogen so that the hydrogen can return the energy stored by means of a fuel cell when the primary source (solar radiation, wind, etc.) is not available. In this chapter, we make a review of the most usual techniques for hydrogen production: steam methane reforming, gasification, electrolysis, renewable energies, etc., and costs. One important result from our findings is that hydrogen produced by biomass gasification can practically compete in costs with that produced from fossil fuels. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Alternative to fossil fuels; Biomass Gasification; Hydrogen economy; Production cost; Production of hydrogen; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Storage and transportations; Costs; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gasification; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Lead acid batteries; Renewable energy resources; Sun; Hydrogen storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883029058

CCS involves first the capture of the emitted CO2, mainly from power and industrial plants, its transportation and, finally, its injection in underground reservoirs for storage. In this chapter, we describe the four main technologies for CO2 capture: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, oxy-fuelling and chemical looping. Evidently, any of these capture techniques result in a significant energy penalty to the base plant. However, it is expected that in the future CCS will contribute to reduce global CO2 emissions. After the CO2 is captured, it should be compressed for transportation through high-pressure pipelines or ships, and finally stored into geological formations such as depleted gas reservoirs, saline formations and deep unmineable coal seams. Depending on the capture technology, the additional costs for generating electricity from a coal plant with CCS have been evaluated. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Additional costs; Carbon capture and storage; Chemical looping; Depleted gas reservoir; Energy penalties; Geological formation; Post-combustion captures; Saline formation; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Environmental impact; Industrial plants; Underground reservoirs; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883028426

Electricity storage is especially needed in distribution for loadlevelling and for integrating the frequently intermittent renewable resources. In the case of considerable hourly variations of the demand, the levelling of the load would substantially reduce the projected total generating capacity making it more efficient and less costly. In this chapter, we review the main electrical storage technologies. The most common storage devices are batteries, which are highly efficient. Batteries have evolved during the last decades from the lead-acid ones to the lithium ion, which are at present receiving the most attention. If high power, instead of energy management is needed, then the use of ultracapacitors is more appropriate. Evidently, if very large amounts of energy and power are needed, pumped hydro systems constitute the best choice. Other energy storage technologies reviewed in this chapter are compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel devices and superconducting systems. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Compressed air energy storage; Electrical grids; Electricity storages; Electricity supply and demands; Energy storage technologies; Generating capacity; Renewable resource; Storage technology; Compressed air; Economics; Environmental impact; Superconducting devices; Virtual storage; Electric energy storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882989848

The basic principle behind cooling is the sorption process by which coldness is generated by the evaporation of a solvent that is later adsorbed into another medium. Solar collectors for heating can be divided into flat-plate or air collectors, evacuated tube collectors and unglazed panels. In the case of air conditioning, the dominant technologies being used today are: closed chillers, which use either liquid or solid sorption materials, and open cooling cycles. In this chapter, different analyses about technology trends and how cost can be close to conventional heating and cooling systems are exposed. Moreover, it is appreciated how solar cooling systems operate more efficiently than for heating since the peak energy demand closely coincides with the highest solar irradiation. Within the field of SHC long-term energy storage is also considered to hold the heat (warm or cold) over time. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Basic principles; Conventional heating; Evacuated tube collectors; Peak energy demand; Solar cooling systems; Solar heating and cooling; Solar irradiation; Technology trends; Air conditioning; Cooling; Cost benefit analysis; Environmental impact; Solar radiation; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882953645

Generally, CSP uses concentrating high-reflective mirrors to generate high-temperature thermal energy that is fed into conventional steam or gas turbines for the production of utility-scale power. Within CSP systems, the most mature are the parabolic trough systems, which concentrate the energy from the sun by means of long cylindrical mirrors of parabolic cross section. Next in popularity are the tower systems, which use a large field of numerous flat mirrors (heliostats) to concentrate the solar direct radiation into a receiver located at the top of the tower. Also, parabolic dishes and linear Fresnel reflectors must be considered. These technologies are described in this chapter and grid parity is analysed and expected to be reached soon for locations with strong solar direct irradiation. Finally, in relation to CSP, it is important to emphasise how thermal storage as well as natural gas hybridisation can be easily added, thus practically eliminating the power intermittencies of other important renewable technologies. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Concentrated solar power; Concentrating solar power; Cylindrical mirror; Direct irradiation; Direct radiations; High-reflective mirrors; Linear fresnel reflector (LFR); Renewable technology; Environmental impact; Heat storage; Mirrors; Solar power generation; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882942651

Limiting current distortion to levels recommended in IEEE 519-1992 improves system efficiency, increases reliability, and limits voltage distortion that can adversely influence sensitive loads. This paper revisits a non regenerative active front end system that has been studied in the past but offers significant improvements to make it acceptable to the drives industry. A three-phase current injecting inductor, required in the topology, is constructed in a five limb fashion and is shown to be helpful in limiting non characteristic harmonics. Since the current injected into the split dc bus capacitor is a 360Hz ripple, it is proposed that the main dc bus capacitor be split into film capacitor for ripple current and optimally reduced electrolytic capacitor for the main energy storage requirements. Experimental results are given based on the suggested improvement and low distortion levels that were not achieved in the past have been shown to be attainable. Comparison between a standard three-limb inductor and a five-limb inductor is made to highlight the performance improvements achievable. Adoption of the topology for common dc bus applications is also proposed. © 2013 IEEE.","Active Harmonic Filter; Five-limb Inductor; Harmonic Mitigation; Non-regenerative Active Filter","Active harmonic filters; Discontinuous current; Five-limb Inductor; Harmonic mitigation; Non-characteristic harmonics; Non-regenerative; Performance improvements; Variable frequency drives; Active filters; Electric distortion; Electric machinery; Electrolytic capacitors; Harmonic analysis; Topology; Variable speed drives; Electric drives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881628478

Liivi 2, Tartu, Estonia","The increasing demand of the smartphones for processing power, storage space and energy saving is leading the rapid adaption of the mobile cloud computing (MCC) domain. Asynchronous mobile cloud communication is a two way process which in most cases is managed via REST (from mobile to cloud) and push technologies (from cloud to mobile). There are several push notification mechanisms provided by the cloud vendors and mobile operators for delivering messages to the mobile applications (e.g. GCM, APNS, MPNS, etc.). However, these mechanisms have certain constraints such as being platform specific, limited message payload and the number of the messages that can be sent to a single handset. This paper explored the possibility of implementing a messaging framework that can be used as open notification mechanism running at the cloud for handling asynchronous delegation of mobile tasks to cloud. The framework is developed by extending a XMPP-based IM infrastructure, which can be integrated with any application server and reconfigured on demand as the mobile workload grows or shrinks. The detailed analysis of the framework shows that it is possible to send messages to the smartphones with IM, at a quality of service similar to that of other push notification mechanisms. © 2013 ACM.","Middleware; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile delegation; Notification services; XMPP","Application Servers; Mobile applications; Mobile delegation; Mobile operators; Notification mechanism; Notification Service; Processing power; XMPP; Middleware; Quality of service; Smartphones; Mobile cloud computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881193613

In a similar way, multisegmented MNs (m-MNs) can be obtained by alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic materials during the fabrication process. In both cases, nanocylinders result axially parallel and forming triangular arrays immerse themselves within the membrane used to produce them. Due to shape anisotropy, each magnetic segment presents its magnetization pointing along the cylinder axis either inward or outward of the membrane plane. The as-grown system presents no global magnetization. A strong enough localized magnetic field can revert the magnetization of small groups of neighboring m-MNs. This feature can be used to inscribe ferromagnetic patterns (FP) over either membrane surface to store fixed information (security codes or firmware). Here, we study the total energy per cylinder for the case of a disc shaped FP inscribed over a circular membrane containing a huge amount of m-MNs.

Homeostatic control (HC) is a term introduced by Fred C. Schweppe and his group of collaborators at MIT back in 1979 and early 1980s and stems from the highly visionary work done by them. We build on this concept and take a new approach, presenting our model and simulation results, which show clearly how HC and regulation of energy intake and expenditure by consumers, along with the presence of energy storage and compensatory mechanisms in the microgrid can provide much insight on how to make these systems more efficient, sustainable and resilient, particularly when integrated to the mains.

Scientific sessions as well as keynote lectures on various topics of current interest have covered a wide range of materials science on ternary and multinary compounds, their synthesis, their properties, and their applications. About 40% of the presentations were devoted to ternary and quaternary materials for thin film photovoltaics as the traditional main topic of the ICTMC conference series, but also new topics emerged, like materials for energy storage and thermoelectrics. Interestingly, about 10% of the contributions were devoted to ab-initio calculations of electron and phonon spectra of ternary and quaternary materials for energy conversion or storage. The scientific programme of the ICTMC-18 included 6 exciting keynote lectures and 42 interesting oral contributions. Three poster sessions provided time for scientific discussions. Most of these contributions are included in the present proceedings. We were happy about a broad participation. Colleagues from 21 countries set the basis for an exciting meeting: Japan, Germany, Azerbaijan, France, Austria, Taiwan, Italy, Great Britain, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, China, India, Belarus, Portugal, The Netherlands and Spain (order according to the number of participants).

Box 6091, Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic","Numerical experiments have been investigated on UNU/ICTP PFF low energy plasma focus device with oxygen filling gas. In these numerical experiments, the temperature window of 119-260 eV has been used as a suitable temperature range for generating oxygen soft X-rays. The Lee model was applied to characterize the UNU/ICTP PFF plasma focus. The optimum soft X-ray yield (Ysxr) was found to be 0.75 J, with the corresponding efficiency of about 0.03 % at pressure of 2.36 Torr and the end axial speed was va = 5 cm/μs. The practical optimum combination of p0, z0 and 'a' for oxygen Ysxr was found to be 0.69 Torr, 4.8 cm and 2.366 cm respectively, with the outer radius b = 3.2 cm. This combination gives Y sxr ~ 5 J, with the corresponding efficiency of about 0.16 %. Thus we expect to increase the oxygen Ysxr of UNU/ICTP PFF, without changing the capacitor bank, merely by changing the electrode configuration and operating pressure. Scaling laws on oxygen soft X-ray yield, in terms of storage energies E0, peak discharge current Ipeak and focus pinch current Ipinch were found over the range from 1 kJ to 1 MJ. It was found that the oxygen soft X-ray yields scale well with Ysxr = 2 × 10- 7Ipinch3.45 and Ysxr = 6 × 10- 7Ipeak2. 9 2 for the low inductance (L0 = 30 nH) (where yields are in J and currents in kA). While the soft X-ray yield scaling laws in terms of storage energies were found to be as Ysxr,O = 5.354 × E01.12 (E 0 in kJ and Ysxr in J) with the scaling showing gradual deterioration as E0 rises over the range. The oxygen soft X-ray yield emitted from plasma focus is found to be about 8.7 kJ for storage energy of 1 MJ. The optimum efficiency for soft X-ray yield (1.1 %) is with capacitor bank energy of 120 kJ. This indicates that oxygen plasma focus is a good soft X-ray source when properly designed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Lee model code; Oxygen gas; Plasma focus; Scaling Law; Soft X-ray","Electrode configurations; Lee model; Low energy plasma focus; Numerical experiments; Optimum combination; Oxygen gas; Plasma focus; Soft X-ray; Capacitors; Experiments; Oxygen; Plasma devices; Plasmas; Scaling laws; Sun; X rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879840928

Thamrin No. 8, Jakarta, Indonesia","The intermittent wind power in a stand-alone microgrid power system may cause a serious problem of frequency fluctuation. Energy storage (ES) such as a battery, super capacitor, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) etc., can be used to reduce the frequency fluctuation. However, ES is extremely expensive especially for developing countries. They still prefer to minimize the use of battery or apply cheaper technology to suppress the frequency oscillation such as controllable load. This paper proposes the design of robust PI controllable load to stabilize frequency fluctuation in a remote microgrid power system. The proposed controller is a conventional first-order PI controller. To guarantee the robustness of the proposed PI controller, an inverse additive perturbation is formulated as an optimization problem and a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to tune and optimize the proposed PI control parameters. Simulation studies have been done to verify the performance and robustness of the proposed robust PI controllable load on remote hybrid wind-diesel power system against various disturbances and system uncertainties. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Genetic algorithm; Microgrid power system; Robust PI control; Smart load control; System uncertainties","Frequency fluctuation; Frequency oscillations; Frequency stabilization; Inverse additive perturbation; Optimization problems; PI control; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; System uncertainties; Controllers; Developing countries; Electric energy storage; Optimization; Standby power systems; Two term control systems; Wind power; Genetic algorithms; developing world; diesel; energy conservation; frequency analysis; genetic algorithm; stabilization; superconductivity; uncertainty analysis; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875495518

The primary processing of milk includes its storage, separation, homogenization and the pasteurization process as well. The latter is a kind of heat treatment, which has been used to extend the storage life of food since the late 18th century. Although heat treatment of milk can be achieved through the use of microwave technology, the inhomogeneity of electromagnetic fields leads to an uneven distribution of temperature in the food products, therefore precluding their use in industry. The pasteurization operation is very often Critical Controll Point (CCP) according of food safety systems. In recent years our research team has developed continuously operating heat treatment pilot-plant equipment, capable of measuring and contrasting the effects of different heat treatment methods, such as thermostat-controlled water baths and microwave energy, on liquid food products. We examined and compared protein, fat and bacterial content in samples of fresh cow milk with heat-treated cow milk samples. In addition, storage experiments were carried out under a microscope and recordings made of fat globules. Our results so far show that the microwave heat treatment is equivalent to the convection manner pasteurization technology, as we found no difference between the heat-treated products. © 2013 Potravinarstvo.","Critical Controll Point (CCP); Heat treatment; Microwave; Milk; Primary processing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880665156

The PCM is a latent heat thermal energy storage system which could be a new option of performance improvement of a household refrigerator by enhancing heat transfer of the evaporator. The PCM is located behind the five sides of the evaporator cabinet in which the evaporator coil is immersed. The refrigeration system has been tested with two different PCMs (Water and Eutectic solution of melting point 0 and - 5°C, respectively) at different thermal loads. Experimental results show that the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the refrigeration cycle with PCM is considerably higher than that of without PCM. Depending on the types of PCM and thermal load, around 20-27% COP improvement of the refrigeration cycle has been observed with PCM in respect to without PCM. With the increase of the quantity of PCM (0.003-0.00425 m3) COP increases about 6%. Between two different PCMs the COP improvement for Eutectic solution is higher than Water. The experimental results with BCM confirm that, depending on the thermal load and the types of BCM average compressor running time per cycle is reduced significantly and it is found about 2-36% as compared to without BCM. © 2013 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.","Compressor; COP; Energy consumption; Household refrigerator; Phase change material",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880413179

In C15 Laves phases, hydrogen can occupy three possible interstitial positions: 96g, 32e, and 8b. To determine which one of these interstitials is the most favorable for storing hydrogen, enthalpies of formation were calculated for every site, with different concentrations of hydrogen. In order to investigate the change in electronic structure before and after hydrogenation, we calculated the electric field gradients induced by hydrogen on the vanadium, and compared them with the existing nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. This comparison enabled us to study the distribution of hydrogen atoms in the crystal lattice, as well as the occupation of possible interstitials.

But the efficient and reliable operation of these hybrid systems depends on 1) their availability at all times, and 2) the control strategies of their controller. We address the topic of a unified controller for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in distributed hybrid PV, wind and fuel-cell energy systems. The power produced by a PV module depends on the solar irradiance and temperature. The power produced by a wind turbine depends on the wind speed. The power produced by a fuel-cell depends on the level of hydrogen consumption. The maximum power controllers adaptively search and maintain operation at the maximum power point for changing irradiance, wind speed and hydrogen-consumption conditions, thus maximizing the system output power and consequently minimizing the overall system cost. A variety of conventional MPPT algorithms have been created for ideal conditions, not many algorithms were derived to extract true maximum power under abrupt changes in wind velocity, partial shading, and temperature conditions. Under these dynamically changing conditions, the conventional MPPT controllers can't find the true MPP (global MPP) and are often track to a local one. In this work, results are obtained for a tracking algorithm based on Bayesian information fusion combined with swarm intelligence. Compared to state-of-the-art trackers, the system achieves global maximum power tracking and higher efficiency for hybrid systems with different optimal current, caused by continuously changing environmental and load conditions. © 2013 IEEE.","Bayesian fusion; computational intelligence; fuel-cell power generation; particle swarm optimization; photovoltaic system; Solar power generation; wind power generation","Bayesian fusion; Bayesian information; Hydrogen consumption; Maximum power point; Maximum power point tracker; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Photovoltaic systems; Temperature conditions; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Automobile exhibitions; Cells; Ecology; Electric power generation; Fuel cells; Fuels; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Lead acid batteries; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Wind effects; Wind power; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879990549

Here homeostatic regulation (HR) and control play a vital role in reaching efficient equilibrium towards reconciling power supply and demand response management. Unlike most of the work reviewed in the literature, the focus here is on supervisory control of grid-connected micro-generation systems without energy storage, aiming towards building energy efficiency, thriftiness and sustainability in energy consumption. Building on homeostatic control (HC) principles first introduced by F.C. Schweppe in 1979, the paper explores the concepts of sustainability and sustainable hybrid energy systems (SHES) applied to micro-generation, focusing on operational aspects rather than on socio-economic, environmental or regulatory ones. A concrete theoretical model for building a SHES is presented for a proposed grid-connected renewable microgrid. The model seeks to reconcile power supply and demand towards efficient equilibrium (homeostasis) proposing reward-based criteria for controlling renewable electricity supply and consumption in rural communities in Chile. Discussion and recommendations are also offered stating that energy sustainability (ES) is essentially a systems issue, and one where ES is first and foremost a structural, organizational and operational property which is in the very nature of the system itself - it is built into it - rather than explained by exogenous factors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Homeostatic control; Rural communities; Sustainable hybrid energy systems","Building energy efficiency; Complex adaptive systems; Homeostatic control; Homeostatic regulations; Hybrid energy system; Operational properties; Renewable electricity; Rural community; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879817859

To do such computations, the activation energies for different elementary processes have been estimated. Moreover, the different thermodynamical quantities of interest are determined by performing the ab-initio calculations. Then, we discuss the hydrogen diffusion in magnesium hydride (such as adsorption, diffusion and desorption). More precisely, we study the effect of each elementary mechanism on the diffusion that we characterize through the density distribution of hydrogen atoms including filling ratios, diffusion time, temperature and pressure. Among others, we show that all elementary mechanisms are needed to reproduce a behavior of ab/desorption which correlates well with the experimental results reported in literature. In particular, at high temperature and pressure, the results of simulations indicate that the studied material involves slow kinetics. © Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Some types, such as storage hydro, have very good power control capabilities. On the other hand, electricity production of wind power plants is strongly dependent on the wind that is forecasted with some degree of uncertainty. If wind power plant production misses the schedule submitted to transmission system operator, the production of another power plant has to be altered in order to compensate mismatch of scheduled power production. This specially refers to sudden changes caused by outage of wind generators as a result of high wind speed.

Among technologies that will lead the surge in demand for energy storage are vanadium redox batteries, sodium-sulfur, sodium-nickel chloride, and zinc-bromine flow batteries. Lithium-ion batteries will take a smaller share, while flywheels will retain just 2% of the market in 2017. Several key developments for energy storage are seen. DOE's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has identified two possible sites in eastern Washington state to build compressed air energy storage facilities that could temporarily store the Northwest?s excess wind power. The California Energy Commission and Pacific Gas and Electric Co unveiled the Yerba Buena Battery Energy Storage System Pilot Project, a system in east San Jose, CA, that charges a utility-scale sodium-sulfur battery.

The Coats-Redfern and E2 function methodologies were used to calculate the reaction order and the activation energy (Ea) of the thermal degradation process. It was found that the addition of nanoparticles increased the glass transition temperature (T g) of the composites. Also, higher degradation temperatures and Ea values were obtained for PLGA-HA composites and compared with the neat copolymer, and the opposite behavior was exhibited by PLGA-CNT composites. The thermal and mechanical properties were highly dependent on the morphology and dispersion of the filler. The functionalization process of CNT promoted, to some extent, a better distribution and dispersion of CNT into the matrix, and these composites exhibited a slight enhancement on storage modulus.

Furthermore, the diet plays a key role in a number of complex diseases including obesity and diabetes. The impact of diet and altered genetic backgrounds on human metabolism may be studied by using computational modeling. A metabolic reconstruction of human sIECs was manually assembled using the literature. The resulting sIEC model was subjected to two different diets to obtain condition-specific metabolic models. Fifty defined metabolic tasks evaluated the functionalities of these models, along with the respective secretion profiles, which distinguished between impacts of different dietary regimes. Under the average American diet, the sIEC model resulted in higher secretion flux for metabolites implicated in metabolic syndrome. In addition, enzymopathies were analyzed in the context of the sIEC metabolism. Computed results were compared with reported gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies and biochemical defects as well as with biomarker patterns used in their diagnosis. Based on our simulations, we propose that (i) sIEC metabolism is perturbed by numerous enzymopathies, which can be used to study cellular adaptive mechanisms specific for such disorders, and in the identification of novel co-morbidities, (ii) porphyrias are associated with both heme synthesis and degradation and (iii) disturbed intestinal gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis may be linked to neurological manifestations of various enzymopathies. Taken together, the sIEC model represents a comprehensive, biochemically accurate platform for studying the function of sIEC and their role in whole body metabolism. © The Author 2013.

This study investigated the effect of changes in loading and contact friction on hoof deflections and elastic energy storage by varying the boundary conditions applied to finite element models. For all cases a load of 10Nkg-1, typical of the peak load in the trot gait, was used. In one scenario the coefficient of contact friction was varied from 0 (frictionless) to 1, at a constant non-zero joint moment, to simulate the effects of restriction of the hoof at the ground surface. In the other scenario a varying joint moment, with contact friction set at 0, was used to move the centre of pressure (COP) forward. Both increasing the ground surface friction and moving the COP forward caused the hoof capsule deflections and stored elastic energy to decrease. Peak strain energy in the capsule occurred when the frictional coefficient was 0 and when the COP was below the centre of rotation of the distal interphalangeal joint. Minimum strain energy occurred when the frictional coefficient was 1.0 and when the COP location was 30mm forward of the joint centre. Hoof expansion and elastic energy storage are considerably influenced by ground surface friction and centre of pressure location. Therefore model validation studies should account for these parameters. Maximising the energy absorption may explain why heel first landing is preferred. •Sensitivity of a finite element hoof model to loading conditions investigated.•Moving centre of pressure back increases hoof capsule deflections and stored energy.•Restriction of ground surface decreases capsule deflection and stored energy.•Hoof capsule compliance may be related to the hoof's ability to absorb concussion. © 2013 IAgrE.",,"Biomechanical effects; Centre of pressure; Contact - frictions; Distal interphalangeal joint; Elastic energy storage; Finite element models; Frictional coefficients; Ground reaction forces; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Deflection (structures); Elasticity; Energy storage; Finite element method; Friction; Loads (forces); Strain energy; Tribology; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878045380

The main conditioning operation before preparation of herbaceous biomass compositions for solid biofuel production is shredding. Shredding can increase bulk density up to 165 kg m-3. Biomass compacting represents technology for the conversion of biomass into a solid biomass fuel in the shape of briquettes and pellets. Compacting of biomass is one of the important processes for effective handling, transport and storage of this biomass fuel material. The purpose of the work was to investigate reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) comminuting energy, bulk density and briquetting energy dependence on hammer mill screen opening sizes. For comminuting was used a hammer mill, equipped with four different screens with opening sizes 20, 12, 6 and 1.5 mm. Comminuting energy for these opening sizes was stated within 11-236 kJ kg-1. Bulk density for reed canary grass by comminuting can be increased up to 165 kg m-3 if hammer mill screen with opening size 1.5 mm is used. For briquetting experiments were used a hydraulic laboratory press, where for compacting were used five different pressure levels - 90, 120, 150, 180 and 210 MPa. Maximum density 899-964 kg m-3 had been achieved for compacting pressure 210 MPa. Summary energy consumption for comminuting and briquetting is approximately 50 kJ kg-1 if screen opening sizes are 12 and 20 mm in comminuting. For these sizes briquette density is 899 and 915 kg m-3.","Briquetting; Comminuting; Herbaceous biomass","Phalaris; Phalaris arundinacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878984735

In this study, the effects of nanodomain structure and particle size distribution on the electrochemical intercalation of Li+ in Li 4Mn5O12 are examined by applying powder X-ray diffractions, TEM and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The composite structure of XRD-pure Li4Mn5O12 comprises layered- and spinel-like nanodomains. The formation of nanodomain structure, as well as the particle size distribution, is effectively controlled by applying two methods of synthesis: the oxalate and the acetate precursor techniques. The electrochemical intercalation of Li+ into the spinel compositions is analysed in model lithium cells in galvanostatic mode. The surface interaction of Li4Mn5O12 with the electrolyte solution is followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results obtained reveal that the capacity in the 3 V-range is determined by the extent of the non-homogeneous distribution of Mn4+, while the cycling stability is a result from the particle morphology. The interaction between electrode and electrolyte bears the impact of the particle sizes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Bellstar) during prolonged storage and subsequent mechanical processing. The initial content of total ascorbic acid and glutathione in broccoli florets averaged at 5.18 ± 0.23 and 0.70 ± 0.03 μmol/g fresh weight, respectively. Results showed that the content of ascorbic acid and glutathione in broccoli degraded during storage at 23 °C, for at least 4.5-fold after 6 days of storage. On each day of storage, broccoli florets were mechanically processed, but the content of total ascorbic acid and glutathione was not significantly affected. When the mechanically processed broccoli florets were further incubated for up to 6 h, the amount of ascorbic acid was greatly reduced as compared to glutathione. To obtain an in-depth understanding on the degradation of ascorbic acid and glutathione, the activity of enzymes involved in plant antioxidative system via ascorbate-glutathione cycle, as a response towards oxidative stress that took place during storage was determined in this study. The content of total ascorbic acid and glutathione in broccoli florets before and after mechanical processing were found to decrease concurrently with the activity of ascorbic acid peroxidase and glutathione reductase over the experimental storage duration. Meanwhile, the effect of oxidative stress on the content of ascorbic acid and glutathione was apparent during the 6 h of incubation after mechanical processing. This phenomenon was demonstrated by the level of oxidative stress biomarkers examined, in which the formation of lipid peroxides, protein carbonyls and DNA oxidised products was positively associated with the degradation of total ascorbic acid and glutathione. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assessed the effect of ARG on some anthropometric parameters of MES in normal rats. Female wistar rats (60-80 g) were randomized into two groups (n = 8 animals) and exposed to 60 mg kg-1 (b.wt.) of ARG and 3 inL kg-1 b.wt. of distilled water respectively as treated and control groups. Twenty eight days oral exposure to ARG caused a significant (p&lt;0.01) increase in feed efficiency (4.83±0.06 or 19.26%) and total water consumption (0.83±0.17 L or 25.75%), but a significant (p&lt;0.01) decrease in total feed intake (0.31±0.06 kg or 20.51%), indicating suppressed calorie storage or decreased energy balance that may improve MES. Changes observed in the rats final length (0.30±0.01 m or 3.45%), total body weight gam (0.05±0.01 kg or 16.66%), body mass index(1.24±0.15kgm-2 or 1.59%) and lean body weight (0.27±0.03 kg or 0.73%) though insightful, were not significant (p&gt;0.05), warranting follow up. From the results of Pearson correlations analysis, feed efficiency correlated negatively with total feed intake (p = 0.01) but positively (p = 0.05) with total water consumption, suggesting apparent synergy in the ARG-induced effects. Thus, ARG significantly improved some anthropometric parameters of MES, hence may improve some MES features related to excessive calorie build up or storage in the female rats. The findings warrant similar studies on a longer duration for meticulousness.","Anthropometric parameters; Body mass index (BMI); Feed efficiency (FE); Lean body weight (LBW); Metabolic syndrome (MES)","arginine; animal experiment; anthropometric parameters; article; body height; body mass; controlled study; energy balance; female; fluid intake; food intake; lean body weight; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; rat; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877993010

It is produced in large quantities (20 kg per 100 L of produced beer) throughout the year at a low cost or no cost, and due to its high protein and carbohydrates content it can be used as a raw material in biotechnology. Biotechnological processes based on renewable agro-industrial by-products have ecological (zero CO2 emission, ecofriendly by-products) and economical (cheap raw materials and reduction of storage costs) advantages. The use of brewer's spent grain is still limited, being basically used as animal feed. Researchers are trying to improve the application of brewer's spent grain by finding alternative uses apart from the current general use as an animal feed. Its possible applications are in human nutrition, as a raw material in biotechnology, energy production, charcoal production, paper manufacture, as a brick component, and adsorbent. In biotechnology brewer's spent grain could be used as a substrate for cultivation of microorganisms and enzyme production, additive or yeast carrier in beer fermentation, raw material in production of lactic acid, bioethanol, biogas, phenolic acids, xylitol, and pullulan. Some possible applications for brewer's spent grain are described in this article, includeing pre-treatment conditions (different procedures for polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and cellulose hydrolysis), working microorganisms, fermentation parameters and obtained yields. The chemical composition of brewer's spent grain varies according to barley variety, harvesting time, malting and mashing conditions, and a quality and type of unmalted raw material used in beer production. Brewer's spent grain is lignocellulosic material rich in protein and fibre, which account for approximately 20 and 70% of its composition, respectively.","Bioethanol; Biotechnology; Brewer's spent grain; Enzymes; Lactic acid",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877722604

Those schemes try to approach page mapping performance and flexibility while seeking block mapping memory usage. Furthermore, flash-specific cache systems were designed (1) to maximize lifetime by absorbing some erase operations, and (2) to reveal sequentiality from random write operations. Indeed, random writes represent the Achilles' heel of flash memories. Both cache systems and FTL schemes were designed independently from each other. This paper presents a scalable (in terms of mapping table size) and flexible (in terms of I/O workload support) Cache-Aware Configurable Hybrid (CACH) FTL. CACH-FTL uses a common feature of flash-specific cache systems that is flushing groups of pages from the same block. CACH-FTL partitions the flash memory space into two regions: (1) a data Block Mapped Region (BMR) collecting large groups of pages from the above cache (sequential I/Os), and (2) a small Page Mapped over-provisioning Region (PMR) which purpose is to collect/buffer small groups of pages coming from the cache (random I/Os) before moving them to BMR. CACH-FTL is flexible as it offers many configuration possibilities and can be adapted according to the I/O workload. CACH-FTL approaches the ideal page mapping FTL performance as it gives less than 15% performance difference in most cases. © 2013 IEEE.","Cache; Flash Translation Layer (FTL); NAND Flash Memory; Solid State Drive (SSD); Storage","Achilles' heel; Cache; Common features; Erase operation; Flash translation layer; NAND flash memory; Solid state drives (SSD); Write operations; Digital storage; Energy storage; Mapping; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877647349

The system under study consists of two DC microgrids coupled to a multi-bus AC system. The supervisory controller of each of the two microgrids continuously communicates with the main controller of the AC grid, sending the available amount of apparent power and receiving power commands. The AC grid is monitored and controlled using a wide area measurement system in which measurements of the different nodes in the system are synchronized to a unified pulse signal. In case of voltage violation at any of the buses, the minimum reactive power needed from each of the micrgrids in order to restore the voltage magnitude to a value that is between the permissible limits is determined in real time by solving an optimization problem.

Unfortunately, supercapacitors have significantly lower energy densities than batteries, which limit the applications for supercapacitors. The addition of pseudocapacitance, that is, chemical reactions similar to those in batteries but which behave electrically like a capacitance, can be used to increase the energy density of supercapacitors. This work focuses on increasing the capacitance of carbon nanotube (CNT)- or graphene-based supercapacitors by adding pseudocapacitive manganese oxide nanoparticles. A number of methods have been investigated for fabrication of CNT/graphene/manganese oxide composites. Manganese oxide nanoparticle pseudocapacitance has been successfully incorporated into CNT/graphene-based supercapacitors. Further optimization of the composite compositions and electrode fabrication methods is still required to optimize the energy densities of these devices. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this work, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is used to fill CoFe2O4 and DC magnetron sputtering is used to fill Fe and NiCo in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The filled CNTs are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), magnetic force microscopy (MFM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Magnetization measurements in-plane and out-of-plane with respect to the sample's surface of CNTs filled with CoFe2O4 indicates a reasonable coercivity of 0.4 T. The magnetic anisotropy is, however, found out to be randomly oriented indicating a polycrystalline structure. The unique difference between the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetizations is the sharing produced by the demagnetizing field in the perpendicular direction. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Where both are required on site this can deliver carbon savings of up to 30 per cent. There are 27 million UK dwellings spread across a vast range of housing stock, some of which date back to Victorian times. There are also 1.8 million non-domestic buildings. To decarbonize space heating in buildings, a lot is expected from heat networks, which supply heat from a central facility to a number of buildings, usually through underground pipes.

It is a widespread belief that the combination of the two renewable technologies generally improves the reliability and supply quality of electricity generation. Indeed, there are some locations where wind speeds are definitely larger during the nights because of the increased stability of the atmospheric boundary layer. However, a proper decision making requires to study the supposed benefits at the very location of designed installations. Here, we report on a model study, where the whole area of Hungary is evenly covered by wind generators and solar photovoltaic units of various composition and total rated power. The combined model output is compared to the recorded electricity consumption in Hungary. Our results indicate that the integrated output of combined renewable production can be definitely lower than the output of ""pure"" (either solar or wind) resource network of the same rated power. The main reasons are the lack of daily cycle of wind strength and the strong annual seasonality of insolation in the Carpathian basin. Benefits of combined production show up at unrealistically high rated power values which is a consequence of limited capacity factors of both renewable sources around Hungary. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Electricity generation; Electricity-consumption; Renewable sources; Renewable technology; Solar electricity; Solar photovoltaic units; Unsolved problems; Wind generator systems; Energy management; Energy resources; Rating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879956430

Forests sequester carbon by conducting photosynthesis, which is the process of converting light energy to chemical energy and storing it in the chemical bonds of sugar. Carbon sequestration through forestry has the potential to play a significant role in ameliorating global environmental problems such as atmospheric accumulation of GHG's and climate change. The present investigation was carried out to determine carbon sequestration potential of hybrid Eucalyptus. This study was conducted primarily to develop a prediction model of carbon storage capacity for plantation forest of hybrid Eucalyptus in Aek Nauli, Simalungun District, North Sumatera. Models were tested and assessed for statistical validity and accuracy in predicting biomass and carbon, based on determination coefficient (R2) and correlation coefficient (r), aggregative deviation percentage (AgD), and the average deviation percentage (AvD). The best general model to estimate the biomass of hybrid Eucalyptus was Y = 1351,09x0,876.e (0,094x). Results showed that hybrid Eucalyptus had an average above-ground biomass in year 0 (the land without the eucalyptus trees) up to year 3 as large as 1.36, 11.56, 43.18, and 63.84 t ha-1.

Congress may consider options to increase the carbon stored (sequestered) in forests as it debates this and related issues. Forests are a significant part of the global carbon cycle. Plants use sunlight to convert CO2""water""and nutrients into sugars and carbohydrates""which accumulate in leaves""twigs""stems""and roots. Plants also respire""releasing CO2. Plants eventually die""releasing their stored carbon to the atmosphere quickly or to the soil where it decomposes slowly and increases soil carbon levels. However""little information exists on the processes and diverse rates of soil carbon change. How to account for changes in forest carbon has been contentious. Land use changes-especially afforestation and deforestation-can have major impacts on carbon storage. Foresters often cut some vegetation to enhance growth of desired trees. Enhanced growth stores more carbon""but the cut vegetation releases CO2; the net effect depends on manyfactors""such as prior and subsequent growth rates and the quantity and disposal of cut vegetation. Rising atmospheric CO2 may stimulate tree growth""but limited availability of other nutrients may constrain that growth. In this context""timber harvesting is an especially controversial forestry practice. Some argue that the carbon released by cutting exceeds the carbon stored in wood products and in tree growth by new forests. Others counter that old-growth forests store little or no additional carbon""and that new forest growth and efficient wood use can increase net carbon storage. The impacts vary widely""and depend on many factors""including soil impacts""treatment of residual forest biomass""proportion of carbon removed from the site""and duration and disposal of the products. To date""the quantitative relationships between these factors and net carbon storage have not been established. Some observers are concerned that ""leakage"" will undermine any U.S. efforts to sequester carbon by protecting domestic forests. By leakage""they mean that wood supply might shift to other sites""including other countries""exacerbating global climate change and causing other environmental problems""or that wood products might be replaced by other products that use more energy to manufacture (thus releasing more CO2). Others counter that the ?leakage{norm of matrix} arguments ignore the enormous disparity in ecological systems and product preferences""and discount possible technological solutions. Several federal government programs affect forestry practices and thus carbon sequestration. Activities in federal forests affect carbon storage and release; timber harvesting is the most controversial such activity. Federal programs also provide technical and financial help for managing and protecting private forests""and tax provisions affect private forest management. Various federal programs can also affect the extent of forested area""by supporting development (which may cause deforestation) or encouraging tree planting in open areas""such as pastures. Global climate change is a widespread and growing concern that has led to extensive international discussions and negotiations.1 Responses to this concern have focused on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases""especially carbon dioxide""and on measuring carbon absorbed by and stored in forests""soils""and oceans. One option for slowing the rise of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere""and thus possible climate change""is to increase the amount of carbon removed by and stored in forests.

Recent expansion in natural gas production, primarily as a result of new or improved technologies (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, directional drilling) used on unconventional resources (e.g., shale gas, coal-bed methane), has made natural gas an increasingly significant component in the U.S. energy supply. This expansion, however, has prompted renewed questions about the industry's potential impacts on human health and the environment, including impacts on air quality. But unlike the debate over groundwater contamination or induced seismicity-where questions remain as to whether or not production activities contribute significantly to these impacts-there is little question that natural gas systems emit air pollutants. The concerns, instead, are: · which pollutants?· how much of each pollutant?· from which sources?· what are the impacts of the emissions?· how much is the cost of abatement? and,· what is the role of the federal government?Air pollutants are released in natural gas systems through the leaking, venting, and combustion of raw natural gas; the combustion of other fossil fuel resources; and the discharge of particulate matter during associated operations. Pollutants include, most prominently, methane and volatile organic compounds-of which the natural gas industry is one of the highest emitting industrial sectors in the United States-as well as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and various forms of hazardous air toxics. Emissions sources include pad, road, and pipeline construction; drilling, completion, and flowback activities; and gas processing and transmission equipment such as controllers, compressors, dehydrators, pipelines, and storage vessels.EPA's New Air StandardsThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in response to a consent decree issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, promulgated air standards for new and modified source categories in crude oil and natural gas systems on August 16, 2012. These standards-effective October 15, 2012-revised existing rules and promulgated new ones to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from many source categories that had never before been covered by federal oversight. Since natural gas is both the product and a pollutant of the industry, compliance to the standards has the potential to translate into economic benefits, as producers can offset pollution abatement costs with the value of products recovered and sold at market. With this expectation, EPA reported the annual environmental and the economic benefits of the standards to be VOCs reductions of 190,000 tons, HAPs reductions of 12,000 tons, methane reductions of 1.0 million tons, and a net cost savings of $11 million to $19 million. Industry and other stakeholders have disputed these figures as both too high and too low. Further, the expansion of both industry production and government regulation of natural gas has sparked debate on a number of critical issues, including:· establishing comprehensive emissions data,· determining the proper coverage of pollutants and sources,· understanding the human health and environmental impacts of emissions,· estimating total compliance costs, and· managing the role of local, state, and federal governments.Scope and Purpose of This ReportThe focus of this report is on natural gas-both as a saleable product and as a potential air pollutant. After briefly outlining the production, processing, transmission, and distribution phases of the natural gas industry, the report characterizes the types and sources of pollutants. It then turns to the role of the federal government in regulating these emissions, including the provisions in the Clean Air Act and the regulatory activities of the EPA.

Without developments to the IC, improvements such as the start-stop function, brake energy regeneration and all types of electrification would have never been possible. The second direction is toward full hybridization or full electric vehicles. This is quite uncertain due to limitation of the presently available electrical energy storage technologies. Time will show when it will be possible to successfully launch mature electric vehicle solutions to the market.

It plans to bring 16 Gw of new nuclear power capacity online by 2025 to help reduce the country's carbon emissions and offset its looming electricity supply crunch. Around 20% of the UK's existing electricity generation capacity will be shut down over the next 10 yr as aging coal and nuclear power plants close.

The present work demonstrates the convenience of employing economic feasibility assessments together with engineering analyses before applying solar strategies during the design stages, in order to convince house owners that these solar technologies can be economically viable. In a case study, this approach is tested for a real house project developed in North Cyprus (NC) in which solar energy applications for electricity generation, hot water preparation, space heating and passive cooling are investigated. It is reported that grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems would be economically feasible with savings-to-investment ratio (SIR) values of 2.9 to 3.4. A thermal performance analysis is carried out for a thermal storage wall (TSW) together with a direct solar gain (DSG) window in the living room. It is discovered that the temperature range of the living room was within 18-22°C throughout the majority of winter days. This application is also proved to be economically feasible with an SIR of 1.3, compared to installing an 18,000Btu/h heat pump. It is determined that both locally produced solar water heaters and imported solar water heaters (ISWHs) are economically viable compared to using a 3-kW storage-type electric water heater. Their SIR values are estimated to be 7.5 and 3.7, respectively. A solar-assisted stack-effect ventilation (SEV) system is verified to have techno-economic feasibility and is also useful in concealing the unattractive cold and hot water storage tanks on the roof. The prospective house owner decides to invest 3840 EUR in installing a grid-connected PV system of 1 kWp, an ISWH, a DSG window, building a TSW for space heating and a SEV system with an overall SIR value of 3.2. This procedure can be developed into a government policy where all these assessments are made mandatory to increase the awareness of the home builders before they make their decisions about the final designs of their houses.

Effect of γ-irradiation on seed color, functional and pasting properties of six selected cowpea cultivars was investigated. Color (L*a* b*) of non- and γ-irradiated cowpea cultivars was measured, and the deltachroma (ΔC), color difference (ΔE) and hue angle were calculated. Functional and physicochemical (pasting) of the milled cowpeas were determined using standards methods and rapid visco-analyzer, respectively. Generally, L*, a* and b* values of cowpea seeds were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) affected by irradiation dose. Calculated chroma, color intensity and hue angle varied with cultivar and γ-irradiation dose. Oil absorption capacities of the nonirradiated and irradiated cowpea flours varied from 1.08 to 1.30 and 0.94-1.20 g oil/ g sample, while the water absorption capacities ranged from 1.59 to 2.00 and 1.58-2.01 g water/g sample, respectively. Nonirradiated cowpea flours showed higher pasting properties (peak, trough, breakdown, final and setback viscosities) than the irradiated cowpea. Aside from breakdown viscosity, the pasting properties decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with increased γ-irradiation dose. The IT96D-610 and IT97K-568-18 cultivars showed significantly higher peak, trough, final and setback viscosities compared with other cowpeas. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Exposing foods to ionizing radiations such as gamma rays emitted from the radioisotopes 60Co and 137Cs, or high energy electrons and X-rays produced by machine sources, helps to destroy microorganisms or insects present in the food. Depending on the absorbed radiation dose, various effects can be achieved resulting in reduced storage losses, extended shelf life and/or improved microbiological and parasitological safety of foods. Microorganisms and pests can no longer proliferate and continue their activities, and insect gametes do not survive or become incapable of proliferation. Large quantities of stored legumes are lost annually as a result of mould contamination and insect attack which continues after harvesting even to storage. Irradiation of cowpea is a viable alternative to the use of chemicals, which have adverse effects on both food and environment, associated with residues and ozone depletion, and are perceived to be carcinogenic. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Absorbed radiation; Breakdown viscosity; Extended shelf lives; High-energy electron; Mould contaminations; Oil absorption capacity; Vigna unguiculata; Water absorption capacity; Chemical contamination; Color; Color computer graphics; Food safety; Gamma rays; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Microorganisms; Ozone layer; Plants (botany); Viscosity; Oils and fats; Hexapoda; Vigna unguiculata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875490265

Mathematical description for the circuit part between the inverter output and the grid is presented. Detailed researches of PV system were carried out by means of the mathematical simulation. The researches disclosed dependence of the system reactive power on the phase of sinusoidal modulation voltage of the inverter. It is defined that phase of the modulation voltage must be positive and can vary in the range 0÷20 degrees. Researches show that researched PV system can generate the capacitive reactive power for compensation of the inductive reactive power of the grid. Operation mode of the system when the reactive power is equal to zero can be achieved in this system. It is defined that electromagnetic distortion (THD) of the grid has maximal value at the point when the reactive power is equal to zero.

The decisive trend in its utilization relative to other fossil fuels is as a result of the following. (1) The growing energy demand from an expanding world economy. (2) Environmental pressure for the use of a fossil fuel free from environmental degradations. (3) Market development and improved technologies for its production, processing, transportation, storage and more importantly, its abundance in nature. Presently, the world has a proven reserve of about 156 trillion cubic meters (5,500 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas. Out of this, approximately 31% is discovered in Russia, 36% in the Middle East and 8% in the Asia-Pacific region, with overall consumption of about 2.5 trillion cubic meters per year. The overall demand will continue to increase, especially in the Asia-Pacific region where most countries are pressing ahead with energy-intensive industrialization projects. Natural gas prospects are high, with the market improving appreciatively since the advent of LNG and CNG technologies, where over 4,660 refuelling stations with approximately 2.7 million vehicles are running on CNG globally. More so, we envisage more growth in the natural gas market in 2020 with the recent projects on GTL from countries like Qatar, which is currently constructing GTL plants up to 15 trains.",,,Abstract Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065452918

The simulations demonstrate that the parabola has stable, periodic motion, while the wedge and hyperbola (at high driving frequencies) appear chaotic. The hyperbola, at low driving frequencies, behaves similarly to the parabola, i.e., has regular motion.

Combining renewable energy generation like solar power with superior storage and conversion technology such as hydrogen storage, fuel cells and batteries offers a potential solution for a stand-alone power system. The aim of this paper was to assess the techno-economic feasibility of using a hybrid energy system with hydrogen fuel cell for application in an eco-house that will be built in Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman. Actual load data for a typical Omani house of a similar size as the eco-house was considered as the stand-alone load with an average energy consumption of 40 kW/day and 5 kW peak power demand. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Hybrid Optimisation Model for Electric Renewable software was used as a sizing and optimisation tool for the system. It was found that the total annual electrical energy production is 42,255 kW and the cost of energy for this hybrid system is 0.582 $/kW. During daylight time, when the solar radiation is high, the photovoltaics (PV) panels supplied most of the load requirements. Moreover, during the evening time the fuel cell mainly serves the house with the help of the batteries. The proposed system is capable of providing the required energy to the eco-house during the whole year using only the solar irradiance as the primary source. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","battery; eco-house; fuel cell; hybrid energy system; PV","Alternative energy resources; battery; Built in; Conversion technology; Cost of energies; eco-house; Electrical energy; Energy demands; Hybrid energy system; Load data; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Optimisation models; Optimisations; Peak power; Photovoltaics; Pollution level; Potential solutions; Pre-feasibility studies; Primary sources; PV; Renewable energy generation; Solar irradiances; Stand alone power systems; Techno-economic feasibility; Digital storage; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Sun; Houses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873956726

Manukian 1, 375025 Yerevan, Armenia","Within the framework of the Hook's generalized law and using the experimental data for characteristic crystallographic parameters and stiffness constants available from literature, the individual elastic properties of constituent octahedral layers and interlayers of the (0 0 0 1) atomic planes in the Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 crystal lattices are theoretically quantified from intermolecular interaction energy. It is shown that, under uniaxial type of deformation applied along the (0 0 0 1) basal planes, in the ""load-deformation response"" the octahedral layers and interlayers exhibit the positive and negative Poisson's ratio, respectively. Manifestation of such a type strong elastic anisotropy in the basal atomic planes and auxetic elastic behavior of the hydrogen sub-lattice (interlayers) upon applied uniaxial load result from a large difference in the strength of bonding within octahedral layers and interlayers. The intermolecular binding energy is contributed both by ""hydroxyl-hydroxyl"" and ""metal atom-hydroxyl"" dispersion interactions, whereas the Young's modulus in the direction parallel to a (0 0 0 1) plane is practically contributed only by the former interaction. For this Young's modulus, an approximate analytical expression is derived, which is convenient for a physical analysis and presumably is also applicable to other metal hydroxides with brucite structure. The proposed theoretical model may be extended to hydrostatic type loading of metal hydroxides for analysis of the hydrogen associated bonding under high-pressure conditions. The approach applied in this study to estimate the dispersive energy may be useful in the evaluation of the physisorption energy for system ""H2-metal hydroxide"" in terms of the potential application of metal hydroxides as hydrogen storage materials. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Apple peel constitutes a waste of dried apple manufacture, although it contains more phenolics than the fruit pulp. This fraction can be preserved by drying. However, it is important to consider that the dehydrated product obtained requires protection. The objective of this research was to study the stability of drum dried apple peel powder in order to select the suitable packing material: high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or metalized films of high barrier (MFHB). The samples were stored under accelerated (38 °C, 90% RH) and conventional (25, 10 and 4 °C, 60-70% RH) conditions during 120 days. Kinetic modelings for the attributes degradation were evaluated. Total phenolics and moisture levels are largely dependent on the type of packing and storage conditions. The apple peel powder samples packed in MFHB pouches preserved most of the phenolic compounds, and exhibited lesser moisture increase.

The study area is part of an orogenically active region along the northwestern collision zone of Indian-Eurasian plates. During spring and summer suspended sediment load is highest, but least in winter. Sediment load of all rivers studied is directly proportional to the melting of glaciers and/or high rainfall during spring and summer. Glacier melt, rainfall, lithology of rocks (shale, slate, phyllite, mudstone, and siltstone), discharge, and other anthropogenic factors caused the high suspended load in rivers. Mostly the fine sediments settle during winter due to flow velocity of rivers reducing appreciably and residence time of water increasing in reservoirs. The high sediment influx deposition in major reservoirs like the Terbella and Warsak, etc. reduces their storage capacity as well as power generation capacity. So it is proposed that life span of these reservoirs can be lengthened by the construction of small check dams (silt control dams) on upstream, dam cleaning tactics, effective watershed management, extensive afforestation on the steep mountain slopes upstream of the lake, and the use of runoff rivers for electricity generation using steep gradient and fast flow velocity.","Environment; Hydel power; Indus River; Siltation in dams; Soft rocks; Suspended load",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872901445

X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the orthorhombic phase of prepared material. Transmission electron microscope images revealed the formation of nanorods having diameter ∼20 nm and length ∼100 nm to ∼150 nm. Impedance and modulus plane plots from 20 Hz to 2 MHz show presence of bulk and grain boundary phases in Bi2S3 at each measurement temperature from 310 K to 400 K.

The study employed the bivariate cointegration technique to estimate the long-run relationship between the variables; an error correction model was used to determine the short-run dynamics of the system, while Granger causality test was used to find the directions between these variables. The study investigates the relation between four energy consumption variables (i.e., oil/petroleum consumption, gas consumption, electricity consumption and coal consumption) and four macroeconomic factors which have further sub-classifications, i.e., balance of payment (BOP) factors (i.e., exports, imports, trade deficit, worker's remittances and current account balance), fuel factors (i.e., carbon dioxide emissions, natural resource depletion and net forest depletion), agricultural crops yield per hectare (i.e., wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize and cotton) and industrial production items (i.e., beverages, cigarettes, motor tyres, motor tubes, cycle tyres and cycle tubes) in order to manage robust data analysis. The result confirms the long-run relationship between total commercial energy consumption and macroeconomic factors in Pakistan, as oil/petroleum consumption increases exports, fuel factors, agricultural crops yield per hectare and industrial items; however, the intensity of these factors are different in nature. Carbon dioxide emissions, net forest depletion, beverages, motor tyres and motor tubes are more elastic with oil/petroleum consumption. However, oil/petroleum consumption decreases trade deficit and workers' remittances in Pakistan. Gas, electricity and coal consumption increases agricultural crops yield per hectare and industrial production which shows that as agriculture and industry modernizes, energy demand increases. Energizing the food production chain is an essential feature of agricultural development which is a prime factor in helping to achieve food security in Pakistan. The empirical results only moderately support the conventional view that energy consumption has significant long-run casual effect on macroeconomic variables in Pakistan. The present study finds evident of unidirectional causality between the commercial energy consumption factors and macroeconomic factors in Pakistan. However, there is some bidirectional causality exist which is running between electricity consumption (EC) and exports, EC to imports, EC to carbon emissions, EC to natural resource depletion (NRD) and EC to wheat. The results conclude that macroeconomic variables tend to positively respond to total primary energy consumption. This indicates that increasing total commercial energy consumption may cause growth variables which show that Pakistan is an input-driven economy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal consumption; Commercial energy consumption; Electricity consumption; Fuel factors; Gas consumption; Oil consumption; Pakistan","Coal consumption; Electricity-consumption; Gas consumption; Oil consumption; Pakistan; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Crops; Deforestation; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Error correction; Food supply; Fuels; Gas fuel analysis; Global warming; Industry; Information management; International trade; Natural resources; Oils and fats; Tires; Tubes (components); Factor analysis; Carbon Dioxide; Coal; Crude Oil; Deforestation; Energy Consumption; Farm Crops; Foreign Trade; Natural Gas; Pakistan; Tires; Tubes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871802576

HEP will convert an existing refined products pipeline to crude oil service, construct several pipeline segments, expand an existing pipeline, and build truck unloading stations and crude storage capacity. Excluding the value of the existing pipeline to be converted, total expenditures are expected to be $35-$40 million.

Since recent, water shortages have been experienced towards end of cropping seasons severely affecting the livelihoods of people settled in the scheme. If the reservoir capacity can be increased, additional diversions from Mahaweli are possible to mitigate the problem. Reservoir is located in a developed area and inundation is a serious limitation when increasing the capacity. With the adoption of PKW, capacity could be increased by 15% without increasing dam height and with minimum inundation. An optimized stepped slope configuration for energy dissipation was incorporated in downstream to minimize tail works.

To reach a reasonable sensitivity, high altitude mountain sites have been selected and detectors are deployed in eight different countries of Latin America. This work describes the initial testing and performance of a WCD prototype that has been implemented in Escuela Politécnica del Chimborazo in Riobamba, Ecuador, at 2784 m a.s.l. We use a commercial water tank (1100 l) and low cost accessories to build the detector, which will be later installed at 4800 m a.s.l. on the Chimborazo snowcap foothills. Data acquisition and post processing is done using the new electronic system designed for the LAGO detectors, which was developed by the LAGO Argentina team and is based on a digitizer board and a FPGA. This new hardware allows the storage of the time structure of all signals produced in the detector with 25 ns of time resolution. In addition, a water protocol procedure is described, which guarantees a stable performance of the WCD through time. Computer-aided simulations are being carried out during this year in order to calculate the theoretical efficiency of the WCD, properly calibrate the detector, and standardize the data with other LAGO WCD detectors. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Fisica.

However, a bottleneck has formed through the inability of the energy networks to respond to the needs of DR at the volumes which would reflect the aspirations of the policy makers. This paper explores the idea that if the connection requirements of DR were integrated into the NSPs' planning processes then, more convenience and assurance could be achieved for DR proponents, thereby reducing the well-known non-price barriers to DR connection that has been a back-wind in realising the energy policies of many jurisdictions. The approach suggested in the paper, is to consider the accommodation by NSPs of the needs of DR, (whether it be wind resource, or PV, or a range of other resources such as intermittent storage), as a range of new Network Services that an NSP needs to provide at its points of interconnection with the grid. Then, through the normal Planning Process, and through the governance provided by the regulator, an NSP can work systematically, a) to define the levels of the new Network Services that it is able to provide at each POI; and b) to match the network capability to the expected demands for these Services that will manifest over the current planning cycle. Any shortfall can then be made good through the normal regulatory approval of CAPEX. Certainty is provided to prospective DR connectors through framing the new Network Services so as to be supportive and complying with their needs.

They are not easy to compare because of variation in the definitions and performance levels—nZEB definitions have not yet been available when these buildings have been designed. It is important to check which energy uses are included in the calculated and measured energy performance and are the results reported as delivered or primary energy. Tenant’s electricity (appliances, lighting) is often not included. Simulated primary energy is typically between 50 and 100 kWh/(m2 a) for high-performance nZEB buildings with on-site renewable energy production if all energy uses are included. Such buildings may be extremely complicated, e.g. control of mixed mode ventilation or integrated energy supply solutions with storage and many operation modes. “Overkill” complexity may have implications on operation and maintenance as nobody cannot manage systems, which are not easy to control and operate. Another trend that can be seen is simple and reliable solutions based on high-performance components and careful system design and fitting with building properties. In the following, five nZEB buildings across the Europe are reported. Three of them are with measured energy data, indicating that strict targets are not always easy to achieve; however, some deviations have been caused also by unrealistic energy calculation input data. Technical solutions used show that there are many alternative ways to achieve high performance; however, strong differences in design bases and basic solutions in similar climate may also show that optimal solutions are always not known or found. Four first case studies are mostly focused on description of technical solutions, but the last one also describes the tuning of systems needed in the first year of operation to achieve the targets. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Cellulose; Dust; Europe; Mercury; Platinum","Buildings; Cellulose; Digital storage; Dust; Mercury (metal); Platinum; Renewable energy resources; Energy calculation; Energy performance; Europe; High-performance components; Mixed-mode ventilations; Operation and maintenance; Renewable energies; Technical solutions; Structural design",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965146364

Design and optimization of an RE power system to serve the lighting in a University of the South Pacific car park was carried out using HOMER software and compared to manual calculations. Resource analysis showed that on average the site received 3.8 kWh m−2 day−1 of solar energy, with 1,387 full sun hours annually. Monthly average wind speed of 3.88 m s−1 at 10 m above ground level extrapolated to 15 m (the hub height of the wind turbine) resulted in an average wind speed of 4 m s−1, with power density of 70 Wm−2. With this wind resource, a Whisper 100 wind turbine would be in operation for approximately 50 % of the time in the year. The complementary nature of solar and wind resources showed good potential for a solar-wind hybrid system. In this study three possible systems—a PV system, a wind power system, and a hybrid power system (PV-wind)—were analyzed. It was found that a hybrid system is the best and most cost-effective option, as it is able to provide reliable power whilst minimizing the need for battery storage compared to a single RE power system. The optimum system comprised 0.270 kWp PV combined with a 900 W Whisper wind turbine with total battery storage capacity of 440 Ah at 12 V.

Here we review the state of the art on the synthesis but also on the physical and chemical properties of semiconductor nanowires functionalized with noble metal nanoparticles such as Ag, Au, Pt and Pd with particular emphasis on their application for gas sensors, surface enhanced raman scaterring sensors, resistance switching memories, supercapacitors and batteries but also for their application in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Aspect ratio; Catalysis; Chemical properties; Electrocatalysis; MOS devices; Nanowires; Oxide semiconductors; Precious metals; Silicon compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Device performance; High aspect ratio; Metal oxide semiconductor; Nanoparticle assemblies; Physical and chemical properties; Resistance switching; Semiconductor nanowire; Surface enhanced Raman; Metal nanoparticles",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951776433

Nuclear reactors can produce potentially vast amounts of energy with relatively low consumption of natural resources and emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. However, facilities that produce nuclear fuel for civilian power reactors can also produce materials for nuclear weapons. The process of nuclear fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) to generate power also results in the production of radioactive material that must be contained in the reactor and can remain hazardous for thousands of years. How to manage the weapons proliferation and safety risks of nuclear power, or whether nuclear power is worth those risks, are issues that have long been debated in Congress. The 104 licensed nuclear power reactors at 65 sites in the United States generate about 20% of the nation's electricity. Five new reactors are currently licensed for construction. About a dozen more are planned, but whether they move forward will depend largely on their economic competitiveness with natural gas and coal plants. Throughout the world, 436 reactors are currently in service, and 62 more are under construction. The March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Japan increased attention to nuclear safety throughout the world. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which issues and enforces nuclear safety requirements, established a task force to identify lessons from Fukushima applicable to U.S. reactors. The task force's report led to NRC's first Fukushima-related regulatory requirements on March 12, 2012. Several other countries, such as Germany and Japan, eliminated or reduced their planned future reliance on nuclear power after the accident. Highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel that is regularly removed from nuclear power plants is currently stored at plant sites in the United States. Plans for a permanent underground repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, were abandoned by the Obama Administration, although that decision is being challenged in court. The Obama Administration appointed the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to recommend an alternative nuclear waste policy. The Commission recommended in January 2012 that new candidate sites for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities be selected through a ""consent based"" process. The level of security that must be provided at nuclear power plants has been a highprofile issue since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. Since those attacks, NRC issued a series of orders and regulations that substantially increased nuclear plant security requirements, although industry critics contend that those measures are still insufficient. Encouraging exports of U.S. civilian nuclear products, services, and technology while making sure they are not used for foreign nuclear weapons programs has long been a fundamental goal of U.S. nuclear energy policy. Recent proposals to build nuclear power plants in several countries in the less developed world, including the Middle East, have prompted concerns that international controls may prove inadequate. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear reactors; Nuclear weapons; Radioactive materials; Radioactive wastes; Safety engineering; Terrorism; Waste disposal; Economic competitiveness; Fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power plants; Fundamental characteristics; Nuclear power reactors; Regulatory requirements; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Underground repositories; Weapons proliferation; Radioactive waste disposal",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947104420

The need for SNF storage, even after the first repository is opened, will continue for a few reasons. First, the Obama Administration terminated work on the only planned permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, which was intended to provide a destination for most of the stored SNF. Also, the Yucca Mountain project was not funded by Congress in FY2011 and FY2012, and not included in the Administration's budget request for FY2013. Second, even if the planned repository had been completed, the quantity of SNF and other high-level waste in storage awaiting final disposal now exceeds the legal limit for the first repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). Third, the expected rate of shipment of SNF to the repository would require decades to remove existing SNF from interim storage. Accordingly, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and reactor operators are considering extended SNF storage lasting for more than 100 years. The debate about SNF typically involves where and how it is stored, as well as what strategies and institutions should govern SNF storage. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and resulting damage to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, caused some in Congress and NRC to consider the adequacy of protective measures at U.S. reactors. The NRC Near-Term Task Force on the disaster concluded it has ""not identified any issues that undermine our confidence in the continued safety and emergency planning of U.S. plants."" Nonetheless, NRC has accepted a number of staff recommendations on near-term safety enhancement, including requirements affecting spent fuel storage and prevention and coping with station blackout. NRC is not requiring accelerated transfer of SNF from wet pools to dry casks, but the SNF storage data from the last several years indicate that accelerated transfer has already been occurring. As of December 2011, more than 67,000 metric tons of SNF, in more than 174,000 assemblies, is stored at 77 sites (including 4 Department of Energy (DOE) facilities) in the United States located in 35 states (see Table 1 and Figure 5), and increases at a rate of roughly 2,000 metric tons per year. Approximately 80% of commercial SNF is stored east of the Mississippi River. At 9 commercial SNF storage sites there are no operating nuclear reactors (so-called ""stranded"" SNF), and at the 4 DOE sites reactor operations largely ceased in the 1980s, but DOE-owned and some commercial SNF continues to be stored at DOE facilities. In the United States, SNF is stored largely at nuclear reactor sites where it was generated. Of the 104 operating nuclear reactors in the United States, all necessarily have wet storage pools for storing SNF (wet pools are required to allow for a safe ""cooling off"" period of 1 to 5 years after discharge of SNF from a reactor). Wet storage pools are used for storage of approximately 73% (49,338 out of 67,450 metric tons of uranium, or MTU) of the current commercial SNF inventory, whereas the remaining 27% (18,112 MTU) of commercial SNF is stored in dry casks on concrete pads or in vaults. As wet storage pools become filled to capacity using ""dense packing"" storage methods, dry storage is increasingly being used, although there are 27 sites with 36 wet storage pools with no dry cask storage capabilities. This chapter focuses on the current situation with spent nuclear fuel storage in the United States. It does not address all of the issues associated with permanent disposal of SNF, but rather focuses on the SNF storage situation, primarily at current and former reactor facilities for the potentially foreseeable future. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Budget control; Digital storage; Fuels; Lakes; Landforms; Nuclear fuel cladding; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Waste disposal; Department of Energy; Earthquake and tsunamis; Fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power plants; High level nuclear wastes; Nuclear waste policy acts; Spent nuclear fuels; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Yucca Mountain Project; Fuel storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946923873

The Center for Research in Transportation Technologies at Makerere University is exploring electric vehicle transportation technology as a plausible solution to traffic issues in Uganda's urban centers and cities. Electric vehicle transportation in Africa's cities is a practical solution due to the fact that most of these cities are on a relatively small area; distances involved are small. This paper presents the technical, operational and functional aspects that were considered in the design of the KAYOOLA Electric City Bus, which has a drive cycle that suits the public transport system in Kampala City in Uganda. Since Battery Electric Vehicles have specific on-board energy, the powertrain for the KAYOOLA electric city bus was designed following the specific road-load requirements of typical city drive cycle from data obtained from actual road measurements in Kampala city. For range extension, On-board solar charging is incorporated. To accurately predict performance, Autonomie-Modeling and simulation tool kit for light and heavy duty vehicles developed by Argonne National Laboratory was used to model and simulate the entire powertrain, noting effects of the grades, range, speed and drive cycles on the battery SOC and voltage. Design iterations are made to meet performance targets. This approach was employed to reduce time between concept development and prototyping while maximizing efficiency.

In the testing phase of plastic materials we use many times different inserts that are made from standard tool steels, such as OCR12VM. In case of tool steel inserts after some years of usage a few micro-cracks can occur in the early stage, which can later quickly spread according to the applied loading. With the help of different non-destructive testing methods we know that we can most certainly detect possible formation of cracks on the tool steel inserts. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to present a detailed review of the applicability of acoustic emission (AE) method for the detection of cracks on the tool steel insert during a regular molding production cycle of standard test specimens. In this paper, we focused exclusively on the acoustic emission signal acquisition by using two resonant 150 kHz piezoelectric AE sensors on such tool steel inserts that are already affected by macro-cracks. On such tool steel insert the obtained acoustic emission results were compared with those obtained from a brand new tool steel insert. The final obtained acoustic emission results on the crack defected tool steel insert revealed as expected that the energy and intensity of the captured AE signals is higher compared with the ones that were captured on the brand new engraving insert under same processing conditions.","Acoustic emission; Cracks; PZT sensors; Test Specimens; Tool Steel Insert","Acoustic emissions; Bridge decks; Crack detection; Cracks; Injection molding; Materials testing; Molding; Nondestructive examination; Plastic products; Signal detection; Signal processing; Steel; Steel testing; Tool steel; Tools; Acoustic emission method; Acoustic emission signal; Industrial production; Nondestructive testing method; Plastic materials; Processing condition; PZT sensors; Test specimens; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930899959

Although these systems can be bought commercially, the commercial systems are generally intended for larger solar panels than those of nanosatellites and therefore are not very cost-efficient to use, especially in more complex power harvesting architectures that require the simulation of many independent solar panels at once.

Certification must be achieved by supplementing historical nuclear test data with use of computer calculations. AWE therefore regularly procures, installs and operates large supercomputers, and complements this with high end storage, network, visualisation and desktop systems that enable the supercomputers to be exploited effectively. This High Performance Computing (HPC) environment is useless without computer programmes or 'codes' to run on it. Multi-physics algorithms are developed to solve the equations of compressible fluid flow coupled to transport algorithms and other required physics such as fusion burn. These state-of-the-art algorithms are in turn worthless without material property data. It is particularly challenging to obtain required material properties such as opacity and equation of state in the extreme conditions of interest. The requirements span timescales of many orders of magnitude and pressures up to Gigabars with temperatures ranging up to tens of millions of degrees. The regimes of hot dense matter (HDM) and warm dense matter (WDM) are pertinent, representing material that is heated while remaining at a density close to solid; similar conditions exist in the cores of large planets and in the sun. In some cases it is possible to harness the power of HPC to calculate the material properties but even if this is the case, it is always important to underpin calculated properties with measurements in appropriate conditions. Once the material property data have been incorporated into the multi-physics codes, meaningful calculations become possible. It is then necessary to carry out further experiments to validate the codes and indeed the designers who are using them. It turns out that an excellent way to meet many of the requirements for material property data and to provide confidence in the validity of the algorithms is through experiments carried out on high power laser systems. © 2013 The Optical Society.",,"Algorithms; Codes (symbols); Equations of state; Experiments; High power lasers; Supercomputers; Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; Compressible fluid flow; Computer calculation; High energy density physics; High performance computing (HPC); High-power laser systems; Material property datum; State-of-the-art algorithms; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903753069

Parabolic trough technology is nowadays the most extended solar system for electricity production or steam generation for industrial processes. It is the most proven, lowest cost and large-scale solar power technology available today. It is basically composed of a concentrator collector field which converts solar irradiation into thermal energy that will be used as input for a Rankine power cycle. In such plants, a storage system can be implemented in order to increase plant production. This work aimed to conclude with a simulation model of a solar thermal power plant using a parabol solar concentrator. The Euro Trough (ET) Concentrator was used as case study. MATLAB software was used for the analysis and performance evaluation. Different working fluids were used in the simulation which were: Pressurized water, Boiling water and Oil (Therminol- VP1). It was found that using water (pressurized or boiling) in the receiver tube is better than the Therminol-VP1 oil. And the pressurized water has the highest value of efficiency compared to the boiling water and Therminol- VP1 oil. The oil using system presented the highest energy losses system, and the lowest efficiencies. The ET performance was tested at different places in Jordan, and the distribution of direct solar irradiance at different days around the year was calculate and exhibited for Ma'an city as a case study.

Customdesigned TES evaporator coil at compressor-aided, partial storage mode with maximum design ice thickness of 2.95 in (74.93 mm) was used for the TES facility with computed maximum cooling demand of 326.2 TR (1,147 kW). The model was developed for ice formation rates based on relevant and validated researches. The governing equations for freezing were formed to solve for the weight of water converted to ice and prevailing TES bulk water temperature. All the thermophysical properties of ice expressed as a function of bulk ice temperature with correlated compressor capacity based on actual refrigeration system operating parameters was used. Performance and cost analyses showed that the customdesigned TES cooling coil requires an increase in initial investment by about 14.26% compared to conventional water chiller of similar capacity by only considering the addition of TES tank, excluding electrical and piping requirements of the chiller and TES systems. Benefits from time-of-use (TOU) rates, wherein electricity is cheaper at night, and coefficient of performance (COP) improvement due to lower ambient temperature at night translate to 31.88% internal rate of return (IRR) at 5-year cash flow or simple payback period of 2.55 years.

However, maintaining of acid value of sesame seeds below 6 is an extremely difficult task because, incremental increase of acid value steadily takes place during storage, due to the influence of storage temperature, seed moisture and enzymes present in the seed itself. Therefore, a study was conducted using 30kg of seed with known initial acid value (3.3) as described in the methodology. Results revealed that acid values of raw sesame seeds increased steadily from 33 to 4.05, while blanched sesame seeds showed a declining acid value from 3.20 to 3.13 during the 60 day testing period. In the case of decorticated raw and blanched sesame seeds, acid values continuously declined from 2.1 to 1.2 and from 1.7 to 1.1 respectively throughout the storage period. However, as the decortication process involved water, it is an unproductive method because of the extra energy and time needed for drying. Therefore, storing of blanched undeeortkated sesame seeds is recommended as a productive treatment for extracting edible grade sesame oil. The data obtained from the study on ""acid value against period of storage for un decorticated sesame seeds were subjected to regression analysis in order to develop quantified relationships, between Y = Acid value, x = Age of the seeds - Month). These were Y = 3.3086+ 0.0081X and Y = 3.205-0.0014X for raw and blanched sesame seeds respectively. © 2013 Trop. Agric.

Lithium batteries are utilized as power storage in electric cars considering their advantages. Nevertheless, they are prone to external disturbances, such as physical shock or metal debris which may cause electric short and lead to fire. Design and testing of platform structure as a protection to electric batteries during crash impact has been done. Platform structure is specifically designed, so it can be built as a prototype for further developments. Computational simulations shows that during front impact test, stresses are distributed in the front side of platform, while addition of stiffener offers more concentrated stresses to certain location. Moreover, for side impact test, critical point is located in corner side near the location for batteries, which means reinforcement is needed to improve protection for batteries during side impact. Additional scenario of rear impact test is also done. Result shows critical point around rear side of batteries, means that reinforcement should be added in rear side of platform to improve protection for batteries. © 2013 IEEE.","crashworthiness; electric vehicle; impact; lithium battery; platform","Communication systems; Crashworthiness; Electric vehicles; Information technology; Reinforcement; Computational simulation; Concentrated stress; External disturbances; Fossil-fuel depletions; Further development; impact; platform; Power storage; Lithium batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901396043

Under isoenergetic conditions there is evidence of a macronutrient hierarchy for satiety (protein > CHO > fat), energy density (ED) plays a major role, but the causal relationships and underpinning mechanisms of the macronutrients are still being elicited. Effects of CHOs on food intake are greatly complicated by the wide variety of forms in which CHO is consumed. Numerous theories have been proposed as to the effect of CHO on satiety, with conflicting recommendations made both for increase and decrease in our daily diet, and these are discussed in this chapter. Hypotheses include effects on circulation and storage CHOs, including Mayer's original glucostatic theory of low circulating blood glucose and Flatt's glycogenostatic theory of low glycogen stores in liver and muscle both triggering hunger, and the glycaemic index (GI) theory of 'fast release' available CHO causing rapid high spikes and rebound low troughs in blood glucose to also stimulate hunger. Conversely, there are the peptide theory of CHO-driven secretion of circulating satiety biomarkers and/or peptides, and the high-fibre theory wherein foods with a high fibre content and/or a low GI and/or enhanced large bowel microbiota suppress hunger. In addition, low ED theory supports complex/fibrous CHO/low energy foods for suppression of hunger, whilst the low CHO theory, wherein total CHO intake is restricted, predicts suppression of both GI and hunger. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.","Beverages; Carbohydrate; Fibre; Fructose; Glucose; Glycaemic index; Microbiota; Wholegrain foods",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899889936

The economic viability of retrofitting these assets to enable - instrumentation for seamless data capture, remote transmission, storage and integration with engineering applications is sometimes challenged. A methodology and practical approach for designing and implementing integrated field (i-field) in a mature joint venture asset in Chevron Nigeria is presented in this paper. The various fields span several kilometers cutting across different terrain including land, swamp and shallow offshore locations with maximum water depth of 150 ft. The first well spudded in December 1963 came on production in March 1965 and still producing 48 years later (in 2013). There are more than thirty fields currently producing across over 2.2 MM acres. The extent of the geographical spread not only comes with different terrains but also presents complexity with design and application of i-field within Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL). The identification, prioritization and deployment of petro-technical transformational workflows were discussed. The implementation of a robust IT architectural foundation is pivotal to the adoption of existing and emerging solutions. The methodology for ranking the assets was largely based on current production and remaining reserves, existing downhole or wellhead instrumentation, availability of SCADA network and ease of implementation through a proof of concept (POC). Using a phased approach, multiple components of the i-field program were implemented. The first wave of solutions recorded a value of $2.5 MM in 2012 from better collaboration, production optimization, and management by exception. In addition, significant savings resulting from improved productivity, safety and operation excellence was attained in several assets/fields that are more than 40 years old. The overall impacts of these deployments have resulted in early gains resulting from reduction in OPEX and loss production opportunity (LPO) and improved reliability. Some of the challenges encountered include ability to retrofit existing wells and facilities especially with diminishing reserves and aging facilities. Value proposition for marginal field and lack or limited infrastructure related to bandwidth for communication was a big challenge. In addition, best practices and lessons learned for development and deployment of i-field initiatives in mature brown fields are presented Copyright 2013, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Digital storage; Offshore oil well production; Design and application; Different terrains; Economic viability; Engineering applications; Multiple components; Offshore locations; Production optimization; Remote transmissions; Retrofitting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899462499

In order to maximize profit while meeting battery lifetime constraints, it is necessary to select the capacity and charge/discharge schedule of the battery. This paper proposes a methodology to calculate the necessary ESU battery capacity for a given power rating and the lifetime profitability of the ESU. Because the price of electricity is not known more than 24 hours in advance, forecasting is necessary when scheduling the ESU. The reduction in profitability of the ESU because of forecasting errors must be taken into account. The methodology applies ridge regression for price forecasting to overcome the problem of having many highly correlated inputs, which lead to poor performance of the forecaster. The methodology demonstrates the encouraging result that the profitability of an ESU is not highly sensitive to forecaster error, as the scheduler is insensitive to the types of errors introduced by the forecaster. This is because of the nature of the variance in electricity market price. © 2013 IEEE.","electricity price forecasting; Energy storage sizing; linear programming; model-predictive control; regularization; ridge regression; scheduling","Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric power system interconnection; Energy storage; Linear programming; Model predictive control; Power electronics; Regression analysis; Scheduling; Economic assessments; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Energy storage unit; Multiple services; Real time pricing; regularization; Ridge regression; Profitability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899411198

Between all sources of energy that we have, the batteries and renewable sources of energy such as photovoltaic and wind contain the highest specified energy. In contrast to fossil energy, renewable energy must be harvested when it is available, and to maintain a balance between production and consumption, some sort of energy storage is needed or at least of value.

Coal is used for power generation as the major fuel in the world. However it is true that control of global warming should be applied to coal power generations. Therefore, many people expect CO2 reduction by technical innovation such as efficiency improvement, Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS). In case of coal power plant are considered for improving efficiency. Some of them have already put into commercial operation but others are still under R&amp;D stage. Especially, the technical development prospect of the power plant is very important for planning the energy strategy in the resource-importing country. Japan Coal Energy Center (JCOAL) constructed a program to forecast the share of advanced coal fired plants/natural gas power plants towards the year of 2050. Then, we simulated the future prediction about 2 cases (the Japanese scenario and the world scenario). The fuel price and the existence of CCS were considered in the forecast of the technical development of the thermal power generation. Especially in the Japanese scenario, we considered the CO2 reduction target which is 80% reduction in 1990. In the world scenario, coal price had almost no influence on the share of coal fired plant. However, when the gas price increased 1.5% or more, the share of coal fired plant increased. In that case, CO2 emissions increased because coal-fired plant increased. Compared with both cases, the amount of CO2 in 2050 without CCS case was 50% higher than that of with CCS case. In Japanese scenario, achievement of 80% CO2 reduction target is impossible without CCS. If CCS is introduced into all the new establishment coal fired plant, CO2 reduction target can be attained. In the Japanese scenario, the gas price more expensive than a coal price so that the amount of the coal fired plant does not decline. Since the reduction of the amount of CO2 will be needed in all over the world, introductory promotion and technical development of CCS are very important not only Japan but also all over the world.","CCS; Coal fired plant; Forecast; JCOAL model",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898750718

The biggest advantage of solar energy compared with other forms of clean energy is that it can provide without any environmental pollution. In addition, Gaza Strip is facing continuous electricity cut off due to the encountered siege. Therefore, the current article presents a pilot project conducted in Islamic University of Gaza by Environmental Resources Sustainability Research Group (ERSRG) to use Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), to be as electricity provider. CSP consists of: solar field with solar transfer circuit (Parabolic Trough), storage system, and power plant block with turbine, generator and cooling circuit. This article presents the output of the experiment conducted in the first part of the system: parabolic trough. ERSRG made a design of the parabolic trough that able to generate 1 KW. To achieve this result, the medium temperature thermal output should be around 200 °C. Based on some computations taken from the literature, the parabolic trough length was 5 m, the width was 2.5 m and the depth was 0.75 m. Parabolic trough collector material is from steel and layer of mirror reflectors and a heat collection element (pipe) with selective coating (glazing) was used. The experiment was conducted in July using oil and water separately. The temperature of the oil was 101 °C while for the water was 98 °C. The lack of thermal efficiency of the system and the large loss of energy was due to inaccuracy in reflection of solar energy, sun tracking system is manual, lack of smoothness mirrors and coating glass pipe was not available. ERSRG is working in modifying the system to increase the thermal efficiency and complete the other two parts of CSP. © 2013 The Authors.

Actually, other than fatty acids and lipid moieties, WAT secretes a wide range of bioactive factors, considerably different in therms of structure and functions, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, complement system molecules, acute phase reactants, and hormones, among which the products predominantly or exclusively synthesized by and released from adipocytes are categorized as ""adipokines"". The adipokine expression is intimately linked to various parameters of adiposity (such as total body fat, percentage of body fat, and fat distribution), resulting generally (with very few exceptions, such as adiponectin, omentin, and Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein) in positive correlation with WAT mass. The adipokine profiles undergo opposite changes in WAT excess or deficiency/dystrophy. In obese subjects, the altered adipokine network strikingly contributes to the development of systemic low-grade inflammation, as well as of obesity-related metabolic/CV comorbidities, that collectively define the so called metabolic syndrome. Adipokine dysregulation has been also observed in patients with chronic inflammatory/autoimmune disorders, such as connective tissue diseases, and adipokine pathway targeting has been thought to represent a potential innovative therapeutic perspective.

The aim of this research is to present a new control strategy that is based on distributed autonomous control strategies and Multi Agent Systems Architectures. This new control algorithm is more robust to gain maximum benefits expected from microgrid. A microgrid testbed is being constructed which is consists of identified energy resources, storages and loads for commercial buildings or large apartments.

Perfect knowledge of a users' power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. An in-home storage system, which provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without the inconvenience (delay) caused by demand response, can also be used to maintain the privacy of a user's power profile. In this work, the design of battery charging and discharging algorithms in response to time varying demand and prices are studied. In particular, a fundamental tradeoff between how much privacy can be provided to individual consumers by a finite capacity battery and the cost savings that can be achieved assuming a zero tolerance for delay is studied using a Markov process model for user's demands and instantaneous electricity prices. When the demands and prices follow a Markovian evolution, the optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with belief dependent rewards (ρ-POMDP). Due to high computational complexity of the model, computable inner and upper bounds are presented on the optimal tradeoff. In particular, inner bounds are derived using specific strategies for battery scheduling including the cost optimal, optimal fixed deterministic strategy and the greedy algorithm. Upper bounds are provided using a standard rate-distortion optimization. These bounds are derived for a binary model, where the battery state is binary, and the demand and prices are distributed i.i.d.

The first approach is based on spectral analysis and fuzzy logic and the second one uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) analysis and feed-forward back-propagation neural networks. As human speech is imprecise and ambiguous, fuzzy logic - the base of which is indeed linguistic ambiguity, could serve as a precise tool for analyzing and recognizing human speech. The authors' systems revolve around the visual representations of voiced signals - the Fourier energy spectrum and the MFCC. The essences of a Fourier energy spectrum and the MFCC are matrices that include information about properties of a sound by storing energy and frequency in discrete time. The decision making process of their systems is based on fuzzy logic and neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that their fuzzy logic based system is 86% accurate whereas the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based system is 90% accurate compared to a commercial Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based speech recognizer that shows 73% accuracy on an average. Moreover, the authors' research derives that, even though ANN gives a better recognition accuracy than the fuzzy logic based system, the fuzzy logic based system is more accurate when it comes to ""more difficult"" or "" polysyllabic"" words. In terms of runtime performance, the fuzzy logic based system outperforms the ANN based Bangla speech recognition system.

This paper conducts a review of how to optimize the concentrated solar power plant by increasing the stored energy capacity or by stabilizing the absorptance and emittance in the solar absorber. The additional stages in the CSP may increase thermal efficiency. The stages consist of two oriented solar absorber to create superheated steam fed to the steam turbine and one regenerator to optimally regenerate heat for working fluid before pumped to solar absorber. A suitable treatment for superheated steam from solar absorber can optimally supply the turbine with a continually stable steam. The continuous stable steam can be controlled using steam accumulator right before the superheated steam fed into turbine. The thermal energy storage in the cycle can be optimally selected based on the stored energy capacity per kg of compared material used. The final modification was made using recently developed absorber material of hafnium molybdenum nitride to create four layer tandem absorber of HfMoN(H)/HfMoN(L)/HfON/Al2O3. The tandem absorber indicates a stable absorptance and emittance up until 600°C (in vacuum) and 525°C (in air).

The system, which is based on control moment gyroscope (CMG) principles, utilises the gyroscopic response of a gimballed flywheel mounted within an AUV body to generate energy from the wave induced rotational motions of the vehicle. By utilising the wave induced rotational motions of an AUV and the relative motion/torque created by a precessing gimballed flywheel promises to enable AUVs to generate energy in-situ and from a renewable source. This novel approach has several advantages. As the system is housed internally it is not exposed to the harsh underwater environment, is not susceptible to bio-fouling and does not add any hydrodynamic drag. In addition, the system can be positioned anywhere within the AUV body and the technology has the potential to be developed into an integrated energy harvesting, storage and motion control system; whereby the wave induced gyroscopic precession of the flywheel can be used to generate energy, the flywheel kinetic energy (spin) can be utilised for energy storage (similar to Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems or KERS) and motion control can be provided by precession control of the flywheel (providing a stable platform for improved monitoring/recording capabilities). In this paper a theoretical description of the system is provided including a derivation of the governing equations of motion following a momentum (Newton-Euler) approach. A numerical model is also described and simulation results for a pitching 2m AUV system are presented. The results show that the system could be used to periodically recharge an AUV remotely, enabling longer AUV deployments at sea. © 2013 MTS.","Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs); Gyroscopic systems; Renewable energy; Wave energy","Automobile bodies; Equations of motion; Flywheels; Gyroscopes; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Motion control; Oceanography; Rotational flow; Wave energy conversion; Wheels; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV); Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); Control moment gyroscope; Governing equations of motion; Gyroscopic system; Renewable energies; Underwater environments; Wave energy; Autonomous underwater vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896340167

This presentation follows a brief description of supercapacitive behavior and origin of pseudo-capacitive response of noble metal oxides. For all the investigated materials, the electrical charging/discharging equivalent of the EIS response was found to obey the transmission line model envisaged as a so-called ""resistor/capacitor (RC) ladder"". The ladder features are correlated to material physicochemical properties, its composition and the composition of the electrolyte. Fitting of the EIS data of different supercapacitive materials to appropriate RC ladders enables in-depth profiling of the capacitance and pore resistance of their porous thin-layers and finally the complete revelation of capacitive energy storage issues.

In stark contrast, Nigeria's associated gas is continually flared and treated as a huge liability despite gas proven environmental advantage and heating efficiency in industrial and domestic processes. It is sad to note, for example, that the perennial flaring of gas in the Niger Delta has ever existed along side perennial kerosene scarcity all over Nigeria. The main challenge with the utilization of associated gas in Nigeria is the low pressure and volume of the gas available at a particular producing station. Harnessing these low-pressured, scattered gas resources using conventional technologies will require expensive gathering, compression and transportation systems. In this paper, the authors explore the potential contribution of activated carbon in gas utilization efforts in Nigeria. Activated carbon allows the adsorptive storage of natural gas at a relatively low pressure. The natural pressure of the produced gas may be sufficient or a low capacity compressor may be installed for this purpose. This could allow the setting up of small activated carbon adsorption units wherever gas is routinely flared in the Niger Delta. From an environmental and economic view point, this is a game changer as flaring is reduced and gas is made available for productive purposes.

Going through a typical set of Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) we can see the following vessels: •Separators (2-phase & 3-phase) •Free Water Knock-Out Drum •Gas Scrubbers •Flare Knock-Out Drums •Slug Catcher • Degassing Drum • Gas Separator • Storage Tank • Feed Flash Drum • Reflux Accumulator • Day Tank • Surge Drum • Suction Scrubber • Slug Catcher • Lube Oil Separator • Head Tank • Deaerator Although each of these is essentially a simple vessel or tank with or without any special internal structure, each serves a different purpose. Once it is clear what the purpose of a piece of equipment is, and how it functions, it will also be clear how to control and protect it. Different purposes need different controls. Vessels and tanks are probably the most hazardous pieces of equipment in any plant. This may seem a little surprising until one considers that they store energy as well as material. In the control of vessels and tanks, two separate control parameters are implied: Level and flow. Although controlling these parameters separately and independently is relatively simple, in most applications, a combination of the two parameters is required to be controlled simultaneously. Interface level control means the control of interface between two liquids such as oil and water. Correct installation of level instrument is an interdisciplinary effort involving Process, who sets the basic functional requirements, Mechanical, who has various constraints such as distance of taps from seams, Piping, who has accessibility and orientation requirements; and Instrumentation, who must select from a finite catalogue of available instruments. Most vessel and tank content measurements are made in the form of level. When true volume is required for such purposes as custody transfer, the tank volumes are calculated taking into account all details of their geometry as well as dimensional changes resulting from the pressure exerted by the density of the liquid. This paper looks into the different types of controls of multiple parameters in each of the vessels mentioned here. It also describes in detail the types of vessels listed in this abstract. It then looks into the benefits and dangers of various fluid media used for vessel pressure-testing.

Until now BCNTs could be fabricated mostly by nitrogen doping, but the use of nitrogen-containing organic compound is toxic and it makes the synthesis more complicated. Here, we present a simple method for the selective growth of bamboo-like CNTs. We employed high energy ball milling method for preparing Fe-Co-Cu (2.5-2.5-1wt%) catalysts on Al2O3 support to synthesize bamboo-like CNTs by hydrogen-assisted catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) from acetylene at 720°C. The effect of milling time on the growth of bamboo-like CNTs was investigated. Morphology and structure of the carbon deposits were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The growth mechanism of the as-prepared bamboo-like CNTs, and the role of copper containing catalyst were studied. Their properties theoretically make them ideal for gas storage and can be used as matrix fillers in composite materials, where the improved electrical conductivity with the mechanical properties of the tubes are the novel factor.

Solar is extremely variable and to use it reliably thermal storage is necessary. Heat recovery loops (HRL) are an indirect method for transferring heat from one process to another using an intermediate fluid (e.g. water, oil). With HRL's thermal storage is also necessary to effectively meet the stop/start time dependent nature of the multiple source and sink streams. Combining solar heating with HRL's makes sense as a means of reducing costs by sharing common storage infrastructure and pipe transport systems and by lowering non-renewable hot utility demand. To maximise the value of solar in a HRL, the means of controlling the HRL needs to be considered. In this paper, the HRL example and design method of Walmsley et al. (2013) is employed to demonstrate the potential benefits of applying solar heating using the HRL variable temperature storage (VTS) approach and the conventional HRL constant temperature storage (CTS) approach. Results show the VTS approach is superior to the CTS approach for both the non-solar and solar integration cases. When the pinch is around the hot storage temperature the CST approach is constrained and the addition of solar heating to the HRL decreases hot utility at the expenses of increased cold utility. For the VTS approach the hot storage pinch shifts to a cold storage pinch and increased heat recovery is possible for the same exchanger area without solar. With solar the VTS approach can maintain the same heat recovery while also reducing hot utility still further due to the presence of solar, but only with additional area. When the pinch is located around the cold storage temperature, solar heating can be treated as an additional heat source and the benefits of CTS and VTS are comparable.

The use of such materials in composites has increased due to their relative cheapness, their ability to recycle and their mechanical and physical properties. Composites based on natural fibbers have many advantages over their synthetic counterparts owing to their low cost, low density, high specific strength and stiffness, excellent sound-absorbing and high impact energy absorption. The technical hemp as fast-growing plant has prospect in the construction field in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. A special attention is paid to the use of fibrous hemp as well as hemp hurds (nonfibrous fraction hemp stalk) in the building materials preparing in various forms, such as insulation boards, mass-spraying hempcrete for the production of lightweight composites, where it is in the role of filler. The presence of surface impurities and the large amount of hydroxyl groups make plant fibbers less attractive for reinforcement of composites. Incompability of interface between fibres and matrix, the tendency to form aggregates during processing and poor resistance to moisture can be eliminated by physical/chemical treatments of fibbers and/or matrix or the use of coupling agents. In this paper, some aspects of durability of hardened composites based on chemically modified of hemp hurds slices and MgO-cement as binding agents after long termed storage in deionised water by testing on some important material properties as water absorbability, thermal conductivity coefficient, apparent density and compressive strength was studied.

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to structure the problem and quantify the relative preference of each option with respect to four criteria namely environmental effectiveness (EE), economic viability (EV), technical implementability (TI), and social acceptability (SA).Results from the decision model indicate that the most important criterion is environmental effectiveness, and the least important is social acceptability. With respect to environmental effectiveness, their most preferred CCMO was solar energy whereas their least preferred is nuclear energy mainly because of the risk posed by the generated nuclear wastes. With respect to economic viability, their most preferred CCMO was geothermal energy, and the least preferred was nuclear energy. With respect to technical implementability, the respondents gave the highest preference weight on geothermal energy and the least preferred is nuclear energy. With respect to social acceptability, the most preferred was wind energy andagain, the least preferred was nuclear energy.","AHP; Carbon capture and storage; Climate change; Nuclear energy; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885220411

The energy storage elements incorporated in the coupled-SEPIC converter possess parasitic resistances. The particular effects of parasitics have been taken into concern for improving model accuracy, stability as well as the dynamic performance of the converter in MPPT applications. Detail model of coupled-SEPIC including inductive parasitic were developed. The performance of the converter in tracking MPP at different irradiance levels was analyzed for variation in parasitic resistance. The influence of converter as well as converter parameters on system behavior was investigated. It was found that the MPPT circuit reaches the maximum power point very fast followed by nearly free of start-up transient overshoot for reduced value of parasitic elements. For the similar load and at different weather conditions the MPPT efficiency was calculated. The maximum MPPT efficiency by using the coupled inductor SEPIC has been found 99.93%. The obtained simulation results validated the converter model in MPPT circuit.","Energy storage elements.; Magnetic coupling; Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT); Parasitic burden; Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems; Single ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885103178

They may be used for selecting the best technologies or policies based on environmental, technical, and socio-economic criteria. Among the many available MADM techniques, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has become one of the most widely used due to its effective hierarchical decomposition of complex problems. However, AHP may be tedious due to the large number of pairwise comparisons needed in large problems. Furthermore, in many cases, relevant information may also be available for determining criteria weights based on past decisions that have proven satisfactory in retrospect. Thus, we propose a simple methodology for augmenting sparse pairwise comparisons in AHP through a non-linear programming model that extracts a set of consistent weights from a priori ranking of a subset of alternatives. Two case studies on the ranking of bioethanol feedstocks and of CO2 storage sites are then shown to illustrate this technique. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Bioethanol feedstock; Multiple-attribute decision making (MADM); Non-linear programming (NLP)","Analytic hierarchy process; Bioethanol; Environmental technology; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Hierarchical systems; Nonlinear programming; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Energy engineering; Hierarchical decompositions; Multiple attribute decision making; Pair-wise comparison; Pairwise comparison matrices; Selection problems; Socio-economic criterion; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884921068

The methodology for working this out is set down by the German Institute of Standards. But how close is this figure to dwellings' actual heating energy consumption, and how does this affect the real energy savings potential through thermal retrofits? This chapter examines existing data on 3,400 representative German homes, their calculated energy rating plotted against their actual measured consumption. The results indicate that occupants consume, on average, 30% less heating energy than the calculated rating. This phenomenon, which we call the 'prebound' effect, increases with the calculated rating. The opposite phenomenon, the rebound effect, tends to occur for low-energy dwellings, where occupants consume more than the rating. A similar phenomenon has been recognized in recent Dutch, Belgian, French, and UK studies, suggesting policy implications in two directions. First, using a dwelling's energy rating to predict fuel and CO2 savings through retrofits tends to overestimate savings, underestimate payback time, and possibly discourage cost-effective, incremental improvements. Second, the potential fuel and CO2 savings through nontechnical measures like occupant behavior may well be far larger than is generally assumed in policies, so policymakers need a better understanding of what drives or inhibits occupants' decisions. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.","Energy rating; Heating energy consumption; Occupant behavior; Prebound effect; Thermal retrofit","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Fuels; Heating; Housing; Public policy; Energy rating; Heating energy consumption; Occupant behavior; Prebound effect; Thermal retrofit; Retrofitting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883633489

The concept of simultaneously injecting CO2 in a gas reservoir for long term storage while at the same time accelerating production of the gas reservoir is intriguing and promising. CO2 may also interact with carbonate matrix by changing porosity and permeability of the host rock; this is true for reservoirs that are found in the Gulf Region. Core floods experiments with carbon dioxide aging were conducted in a core sample analogue to carbonate at reservoir conditions. CO2 interaction in carbonate formation was evaluated by XRF and SEM analysis; furthermore mineral trapping was also investigated by AFM. The results of the laboratory study showed that the CO 2 would dissolve some of the rock at high pressure aging. Dissolved carbonate was found also to be precipitated along the core after decreasing the pressure of the system. The results of this study are directly applicable for evaluating CO2 Huff-n-Puff, a process that can potentially raise the reservoir pressure back above the original dew point. Results of this experiment help answer some critical questions related to introducing CO2 in wet gas reservoirs and its interaction with carbonate reservoirs.

In this network, a few nodes become cluster head which causes the energetic heterogeneity of the network, therefore the behavior of the sensor network becomes very unstable as soon as the life of the first node is elapsed. SEP has proposed the extension of time to network stability before the death of the first node and the reduction of unstable time before the death of the last node. This protocol is based on the election of cluster head by the balance of the probabilities of the remaining energy for each node. In this paper, we propose to improve SEP by fuzzy logic (SEP-FL). We show by simulation in MATLAB that the proposed method increases the stability period and decreases the instability of the sensor network compared with LEACH, LEACH-FL and SEP taking into account the energy level and the distance to the base station. We conclude by studying the parameters of heterogeneity as the protocol proposed (SEP-FL) provides a longer interval of stability for large values of additional energy brought by the more powerful nodes (advanced). © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

At its one end there is kwashiorkor and on the other is nutritional marasmus, all the developing countries are at great risk of developing PEM among children. The main objective of study was to assess the nutritional status of primary school children. It was achieved by well designed questionnaire using anthropometric, dietary patterns and clinical signs of children belonging from different socio-economic statuses. Total 46 urban school age children less than 12 years were selected through simple random sampling technique. It was found that young children (both boys and girls) were suffering from PEM were under weight than that of their normal requirement. They use to belong to big family size as indicating unavailability of food or imbalanced nutrition because they hardly take milk or milk products; eat meat, vegetable, fat or cereal group food daily. Only a few children took iron/vitamin syrups. This was expressed in their anthropometric measurements. Most of the children usually lacked apathy impression of skin, turned their hair colour brown, white or grayish, dry and thin. They largely had: enlarged thyroid glands, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly pot belly. They usually had ailments during last six months. They use to face diarrhea, fever diseases and malaria. They mainly use to suffer from phagophagia. Therefore it is suggested that raising the awareness of policy makers on the current magnitude of child malnutrition, country wide and in special subgroups, at city level, enhancing food security by improving storage and distribution systems. Nutrition education should be enhanced thus enabling the individual to distinguish the balanced diet from a deficient one. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2013.","Dietary patterns; Food security; Protein energy malnutrition; School age children","iron; vitamin; article; cereal; child; dairy product; diarrhea; family size; feeding disorder; female; fever; food deprivation; goiter; hair color; hepatomegaly; human; malaria; male; meat; milk; Pakistan; preschool child; prevalence; protein calorie malnutrition; random sample; school child; splenomegaly; stunting; urban population; vegetable",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879272247

During 2013-2014, the economy is estimated to gain strength, therefore sparking an upsurge in industrial demand. NWGA attributes this future boost in demand to the industry renewing pre-recession production levels or switching to natural gas. Generation demand is measured to have a growth rate of 1%/yr. The Pacific Northwest is using more natural gas to generate electricity, which is estimated to continue. With the upcoming flood of supply and uptick in demand, midstream infrastructure is a prime concern. Future peak day demand could meet or surpass the Pacific Northwest's current 48,000-mi network of transmission and distribution pipelines. Currently, the regions' pipeline network and peak storage facilities can support over 6.5 million Dtherm/day of natural gas. If the infrastructure is pushed to maximum capacity, the system could become stressed. Three key expansions have been proposed in the Pacific Northwest and deferred due to a decrease in estimated demand. The Sumas I-5 Expansion, proposed by Williams Northwest Pipeline, would increase transportation from Sumas, WA, to the I-5 corridor.

Electricity generation accounts for almost half of the emission; besides, conventional electrical production based on fossil fuel is becoming more and more expensive. One approach to significantly slow down global warming is to drive our society away from the current fossil fuel fiesta and use only renewable power such as solar and wind energy. Another approach is to improve the management of energy production, transmission, and distribution. Part of the latter solution is on the supply side, where one possible solution is to develop continent-wide smart power grids and energy storage systems. However, an equally important part of the solution is on the demand side, where technologies and applications that can work with this type of unpredictable energy consumption are becoming necessary. The smart power grid with new sources of data, fast growth of information, and proactive management requires new strategy for business and operational management. In this paper we discuss how Cloud computing model can be used for developing Smart Grid solutions. The Cloud computing model is based on the delivery of computing as a service, whereby storage, software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a commodity over the Internet. The advantages of Cloud computing - reduced costs, increased storage, on-demand performance, and better flexibility - have motivated many companies in recent years to move their IT operations to the cloud; the same advantages can be used to achieve the most important future goals of a large-scale Smart Grid, such as energy savings, two-way communication, and demand resource management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Information and communication technology; Renewable energy sources; Smart power grid","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Green computing; Wind power; Electricity generation; Energy storage systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Operational management; Renewable energy source; Solar and wind energies; Technologies and applications; Two way communications; Smart power grids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877336844

The analysis covers topologies of the parallel and the series plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which are driven according to different strategies of depletion of the electric storage devices (ESs). These results are benchmarked against results of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). The Tank-to-Wheel (TtW) data are obtained by a forward facing vehicle simulation model, whereas Well-to-Tank (WtT) analysis covers CO2 intensity of the Diesel fuel and four different realistic CO2 intensities of electric energy production. To ensure comprehensiveness of the study vehicles were also operated according to two drive cycles that feature significantly different velocity profiles. In addition, influences of different control strategies of powertrain components were also analyzed. This broad portfolio of scenarios reveals insightful WtW CO2 emissions guidelines for introducing plug-in hybrid electric trucks to different regions. The results indicate that the propulsion electrification in medium duty trucks has, in comparison to passenger cars, a smaller potential for reduction of Well-to-Wheel CO2 emissions because of the higher efficiencies of the internal combustion engine in such trucks. Results of this study were also used to identify the threshold value of the CO2 intensity of electric energy production that favors the operational switch from Charge Depleting (CD) to Charge Sustaining (CS) mode. Additionally, it was shown that for longer recharge intervals, operation in the blended mode with less intensive depletion rate of the ES can feature lower WtW CO2 emissions of the PHEVs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","ICEV; Medium duty truck; PHEV; Transient drive cycle","Automobiles; Computer simulation; Diesel fuels; Electric switches; Electric utilities; Internal combustion engines; Power quality; Powertrains; Propulsion; Tanks (containers); Topology; Trucks; Vehicle wheels; Vehicles; Virtual storage; Electric energies; ICEV; Internal combustion engine vehicles; PHEV; Plug-in hybrid electric truck; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Powertrain components; Transient drive; Carbon dioxide; benchmarking; carbon dioxide; control system; electric vehicle; electrical power; electrification; guideline; power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876343422

The three salty water zones (upper convective, non-convective and heat storage) were formed by filling the pond with salty water of various densities. 16 thermocouples (type T) were used to measure the temperature profile within the pond. In the theoretical part, a MatLAB code was developed to predict the temperature distribution along the solar pond. A maximum temperature of 47 °C was recorded in the heat storage zone in spring time (April 2010).

A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Free cooling; Phase change material (PCM)","Airconditioning systems; Climatic conditions; Commercial building; Cool air; Cooling applications; Cooling of buildings; Environmentally-friendly; Free-cooling systems; Heating technology; High storage density; In-buildings; Phase Change Material (PCM); Phase change temperature; Potential reduction; Thermal Performance; Thermo-physical property; Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Cooling systems; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Office buildings; Storage (materials); Thermoelectric equipment; Phase change materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870372464

Outdoor experiments are carried out to demonstrate the potential of the storage solar system for water heating. The performance of the system is evaluated by calculating the various performance factors of the collector. The plate temperature is found to increase up to a distance of 2.5. m from entrance, after which an almost steady temperature is noticed. Such trend was in contrast to the increasing trend previously noticed for a similar system without the PCM back layer. During off-sunshine hours, the liquid PCM transferred heat to the absorber, part of which was conducted as a useful heat in the circulating water.

The properties of biofuel containing C. sativa oil methyl esters (CMEs) were compared with the properties of fossil diesel fuel and standardized rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and fossil diesel fuel blends. To ensure compliance with the requirements for fatty acid methyl esters established by the EN 14214 standard, pure CMEs were blended with methyl esters of animal origin, the content of which accounted for 32% of the blend. Motor studies were carried out in the VALMET 320 DMG diesel engine while using fuel blends consisting of 30% of a mixture of C. sativa oil and pork lard methyl esters and 70% fossil diesel fuel. Environmental and energy indicators were compared with indicators related to RME and fossil diesel fuel. In the course of the experiments, it was established that when no anti-oxidant was used, the C. sativa oil and pork lard methyl ester mixtures met the requirements of the oxidation standard only during the first month of storage, whereas the physical properties did not change considerably during the whole storage period. Due to the properties of fuels containing C. sativa oil methyl esters, they can be used in cold climate areas in summertime. As a result of performing measurements of emissions of hazardous components, it was observed that throughout the storage period, the maximum reduction of CO reached 7-10%, whereas the decrease in HC was - 5-8% and that of NOx was approximately 4%.

A mandatory quota system requires that 5% of the electricity generated in the country must come from renewable energy sources, gradually increasing to 10% by 2024. As of 2010, solar energy has received attention only for small-scale future demonstration projects. Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are an interesting option for the country, especially when considering the high levels of solar radiation and clearness index that are available in northern Chile. Here we present a thermal and economic analysis of CSP plants of the parabolic trough type, comparing five different configurations including thermal energy storage and fossil fuel backup. The electricity yields are obtained from hourly simulations that consider radiation levels, solar field, and power plant characteristics. An economic model that includes the costs of construction, operation and maintenance allows predicting the levelized electricity cost (LEC) as a function of plant configuration and location. The results indicate that the plants can produce dispatchable electricity at a cost that is competitive and inversely proportional to radiation levels. A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the influence of solar field area and radiation levels, and the optimal plant configuration and solar field area are obtained as a result. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Chile; Parabolic trough; Solar power","Chile; Clearness indices; Concentrated solar power; Demonstration project; Economic models; Hourly simulation; LEC; Levelized electricity cost; Northern Chile; Operation and maintenance; Parabolic trough; Quota systems; Radiation levels; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar fields; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Sun; Electricity; economic analysis; electricity generation; power plant; resource assessment; solar power; solar radiation; state role; uncertainty analysis; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866539301

The latter is very important for Cyprus as seaside areas are very expensive. Such a solar power station however should be located near the sea close to an existing power station. An additional reason is that such a solar plant can be combined with solar desalination to produce fresh water from seawater which is also a precious commodity for Cyprus. Based mainly on their industrial maturity and the advantages mentioned in this paper, the parabolic trough system seems to be to best one to apply.
