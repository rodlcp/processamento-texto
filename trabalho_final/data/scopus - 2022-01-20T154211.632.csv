Safra Campus, Jerusalem, 9190401, Israel","Temperature-induced structural transformations of a direct hexagonal mesophase were investigated by SAXS, rheology, DSC, and NMR. The investigated mesophase region consists of two distinct direct hexagonal structures. The primary structure, detected at lower water content (33.0–39.0 wt%, 25 °C), is oriented as a bidiscontinuous assembly; it is composed of “occluded hydration centers” (OHCs) and direct surfactant-oil aggregates. The secondary structure, detected at higher water content (39.5–42.5 wt% water, 25 °C), is composed of an unbound water continuous phase and direct surfactant-oil aggregates. The OHCs within the bidiscontinuous mesophase were found to enhance the mesophase's order (correlation length (ξ)) and storage modulus (G′). The content of the unbound water occluded within the OHCs is temperature dependent, due to the ethoxylates’ water binding properties. At temperatures below 18 °C, the water in the bidiscontinuous mesophase (<39.0 wt% water) remains bound, resulting in a decreased mesophase order (correlation length (ξ)) and storage modulus (G′). Elevated temperatures increase the unbound water content, causing the unbound water domains to swell. Above the critical swelling point, the unbound water domains interlink to form a continuous phase, reducing the systems’ range order (ξ) and the storage modulus (G′). Better understanding the temperature dependence of the direct hexagonal mesophase enables mapping of the critical factors affecting the controlled delivery vehicles for non-bioavailable drugs. © 2021","Bidiscontinuous; Ethoxylated surfactants; Hexagonal mesophase; Hydration centers; Lyotropic liquid crystals; Temperature sensitive","Aggregates; Binding energy; Elastic moduli; Liquid crystals; Surface active agents; Temperature distribution; Bidiscontinuous; Continuous phase; Correlation lengths; Ethoxylated surfactants; Hexagonal mesophases; Hydration center; Lyotropic liquid crystal; Mesophase ordering; Mesophases; Temperature sensitive; Hydration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117416514

Valorization of agro-waste emerges as a potential strategy to cover the demand for wood-based fuels partially. Oat husk (OH) is a widely available waste, and its combination with pine sawdust (PS) can be a suitable alternative towards biofuel production. In this work, the conversion of OH-PS mixtures via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was investigated. Optimization of HTC process parameters in terms of mixing ratio (21.7–78.3% of OH loading) and reaction temperature (164.6–235.4 °C) was performed using the response surface methodology to maximize hydrochar yield (HY) and higher heating value (HHV) and to minimize ash content (AC). The optimal hydrochar was obtained at 21.7% OH and 228.3 °C after the responses were simultaneously optimized. Remarkably, the application of the optimized hydrochar was evaluated by combustion tests using a domestic pellet stove. Results revealed decreased emissions from incomplete combustion such as CO and particulate matter, far lower than local and global requirements. Besides, hydrochar pellets also exhibited decreased moisture uptake and enhanced durability, facilitating transportation and storage, especially when facing adverse conditions. These findings demonstrate the valorization of residual biomass via HTC is a viable approach to tackle the air pollution control associated with residential heating. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrochar combustion; Hydrothermal carbonization; Residential combustion; Response surface methodology; Waste biomass valorization","Air quality; Biofuels; Carbonization; Heating; Housing; Surface properties; Thermochemistry; Waste incineration; Biofuel production; Biomass valorizations; Hydrochar combustion; Hydrothermal carbonization; Oat husks; Pine sawdust; Residential combustion; Response-surface methodology; Waste biomass; Waste biomass valorization; Pelletizing; air quality; alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; hydrothermal activity; pine; pollution control; response surface methodology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118484481

Microwave plasma decomposition of organic precursors forms a high-temperature environment, above 3000 K, where the process of catalyst-free dehydrogenation and consequent formation of C2 molecules leads to nucleation and growth of high-quality few-layer graphene (FLG). In this work, we show experimental evidence that a high-temperature environment with a gas mixture of H2 and acetylene, C2H2, leads to a transition from amorphous to highly crystalline material proving the suggested dehydrogenation mechanism. The overall conversion efficiency of carbon to FLG reached up to 47%, three times as much as for methane or ethanol, and increased with increasing microwave power (i.e. with the size of the high-temperature zone) and hydrocarbon flow rate. The yield decreased with decreasing C:H ratio while the best quality FLG (low D/G-0.5 and high 2D/G-1.5 Raman band ratio) was achieved for C:H ratio of 1:3. The structures contained less than 1 at% of oxygen. No additional hydrogen was necessary for the synthesis of FLG from higher alcohols having the same stoichiometry, 1-propanol and isopropanol, but the yield was lower, 15%, and dependent on the atom arrangement of the precursor. The prepared FLG nanopowder was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, Raman, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry.

Many heterogeneously catalyzed reactions like this involve the adsorption of charged species on metals. DFT calculations of charged systems, with periodic boundaries, face serious problems, concerning convergence and reliability of the results. To study the heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, a simple method to calculate the adsorption energy of charged systems in metallic periodic cells is proposed. In this method, a counter ion is placed at a non-interactive distance, in an aqueous medium, so that the calculated system is neutral. Bader analysis is used to validate that the calculated couple is charged correctly. Adsorption energies of F-, Cl-, Br-, OH-, BH4-, ClO4- and H- ions on the Ag(111) surface in an aqueous medium were determined using Na+ and K+ as counter ions, to evaluate the performance of this method. The adsorption of the divalent ions S2-, Se2- and SO42- on different surfaces was studied as well. Then this method was used to explore the hydrolysis of BH4- ions, which have a high theoretical hydrogen storage capacity, on the Ag(111) surface. The results point out that during the catalytic hydrolysis only one hydrogen atom from borohydride is transferred to the surface. In the first step one hydrogen atom from BH4- is transferred to the silver surface; this H atom reacts with a hydrogen atom that is released from an adsorbed water molecule; in addition, a hydrogen molecule is released in the second step (one atom from ∗BH4- and one from ∗H2O). Thus, the mechanisms of the catalyzed reductions by BH4- and the hydrogen evolution reactions must be reconsidered.

Throughout this study, a neural network based on home energy management system (NNHEMS) has been developed to set optimal consumer priorities considering many factors, such as load priority, load profiles, environmental aspects, and user comfort. This NNHEMS; has been applied to a grid-connected photovoltaic system with a storage battery to power a house. Based on the available energy of the PV system and the loads type and priority (critical and not-critical loads), the authors design an advanced control system incorporating artificial neural network (ANN) concepts in order to satisfy the energy needs of home users and increase the performance of electricity networks. In this approach, the type of the ANN is the multi-level feedback network (MLFN); interconnection is provided by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; in which data and computations flow in a specific direction from input to output. The efficiency of the proposed NNHEMS; is demonstrated in an installed house in Bouismail (Algeria) during a summer week (July 2019) with favorable weather conditions. Results demonstrate that the developed NNHEMS could achieve an optimal energy management in this solar house by saving 24.6% of energy consumption.

The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of different types of dehydrated fruits (dehydrated bars, dehydrated slices or powder) on the storage ability of 2 ecotypes of Opuntia-ficus fruit harvested in South of Portugal (“Orange” and “Green”). Fruits were prepared without peel and cut in slices or mixed as pulp then dried at 60°C. Afterwards, slices were stored, and pulp prepared as dehydrated bars or powder, then stored at room temperature for 9 months. Initially and at the end of storage period, colour (CIELab), soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity, water activity (aw), total fibre content, ash content, protein content, phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, betalains and antioxidant activity were determined and as well microbial contamination and sensory panels. Prickly pear dried food products showed very good nutritional quality attributes. Apart from colour, there were no significant differences between ecotype quality. The fruit powder was lower in SSC than the fruit bars and higher in bioactive compounds (total phenols, tannins, flavonoids and betalains) and antioxidant activity. Dehydrated sliced fruits, although they are nutritionally rich, do not seem to be commercially viable because they contain too many seeds in the opinion of the taste panel. Fruit bars are a good source of energy and with good overall acceptance by the taste panel.

The magnetic anisotropy constant of almost spherical CoFe2O4 MNPs is much higher than that of magnetite (Fe3O4) MNPs of similar geometrical parameters due to the magnetocrystalline contribution. CoFe2O4 shows significant magnetization at saturation, high coercive field and Curie temperature, and good chemical and magnetic stability, being therefore preferable to the most usual Fe3O4 MNPs.

In this work, novel red onion waste-derived self-doped porous biocarbons were successfully obtained by a simple thermochemical process. The effect of increasing temperature during thermal treatment on their structural features, porous complexity, and surface chemistry was analyzed. In addition, these properties were correlated with the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and specific capacitance of the biocarbons, both evaluated in alkaline media. The most active metal-free biocarbon electrocatalyst, heat treated at 800 °C and labelled as RWB800, showed a remarkable high catalytic activity for the ORR, with an onset potential of 0.97 V vs. RHE, an electron transfer number (n) of 3.95 and a percentage of hydrogen peroxide species (%HO2-) produced between 1.2 and 12%. Moreover, RWB800 demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 309 F g−1. It can be highlighted that the process to produce the biocarbons shown in this work can be easily scalable, thus offering an alternative for the sustainable use of onion wastes in large-scale production of electrodes for clean energy generation and storage electrochemical devices, such as anion exchange membrane fuel cells and supercapacitors.

We investigate how the aluminum industry can maximally integrate variable renewable energy resources while remaining competitive. This can be achieved by (i) modulating production and (ii) utilizing storage. We develop an hourly linear optimization system for integrating variable energy sources and apply it for identifying the optimal configuration and operational profile for UAE-located smelter. Operating with the optimal renewable energy and fossil mix and a novel power modulation scheme, consistently reduces costs between 2.2% and 5.3% for fuel prices ranging between $2.4-$8 per MMBtu and integrating more than 40% of power by solar PV without storage. This reduces process emissions intensity from 5.13 to 2.87 tCO2/tAl. In all cases of RE integration, modulation confers a significant cost advantage with savings ranging from 7.5% to 10% for the fuel price range. Operating the smelter with 100% renewable energy portfolio could be achieved by installing 5.4 GWp single-axis tracking PV, 0.2 GWp wind, 18 GWh of battery storage and 47 GWh of hydrogen storage but with a 26% premium for 2020 high gas-price system costs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminum industry; Energy transition; industrial Energy transition; Renewable energy","Aluminum; Aluminum plants; Costs; Electric energy storage; Hydrogen storage; Linear programming; Modulation; Outages; Aluminium smelter; Aluminum industry; Energy transitions; Fuel prices; Industrial energy; Industrial energy transition; Power supply; Renewable energies; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; aluminum; energy resource; fossil fuel; optimization; smelting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114438423

We studied the transport dynamics of several local anesthetics from the extracellular fluid across biological membranes to the axoplasm, in order to understand the effect of pH on their pharmacodynamic properties. By using experimental pKa values and n-octanol/water partition coefficients, we calculated pH-dependent distribution coefficients and therewith associated relative populations and free energy profiles between extracellular fluid, membrane, and axoplasm. We estimated the local anesthetic capacity of neural tissue, using a simple 2D model. All values were calculated under physiological conditions and under the effect of local acidosis. Under physiological conditions, local anesthetics were most prevalent in the membrane. Change of free energy for transfer across biological membrane and the difference in relative population between extracellular fluid and axoplasm was dependent only on the difference of pH values between both environments, and not on pKa values. Estimated storage capacities for long-lasting local anesthetics are higher by a factor of 10 or 100 than for short-lasting local anesthetics. The membrane does not represent a barrier for local anesthetic diffusion. Local anesthetics move from the compartment with higher pH to the compartment with lower pH, due to favorable solvation free energy of protonated species. The rate of transfer across biological membrane is diffusion-controlled and is similar for all local anesthetics. Neural tissue has a higher storage capacity for highly lipophilic local anesthetics, which can explain their longer duration of action. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","distribution coefficient; local anesthetics; membrane transport; solvation free energy","Alcohols; Biological membranes; Cytology; Diffusion in liquids; Free energy; Physiology; Protonation; Tissue; Transport properties; Diffusion controlled; Distribution coefficient; Extracellular fluid; Local anesthetics; Physiological condition; Protonated species; Solvation free energies; Transport dynamics; Anesthetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113137411

In this context, this study develops a simultaneous Mg2+ and B3+ extraction system, which could be a contribution to the elimination of precipitation stages and the generation of high purity lithium brine. This dual system composed of a dialkylphosphate ionic liquid and a 2-ethylhexanol/kerosene mixture as magnesium and boron extractors, respectively, was optimized by a mathematical and statistical method known as response surface methodology (RSM). The RSM method identified, through a small number of experiments, the interdependencies of the parameters involved in the extraction process, and calculated their optimal values to achieve the maximum extraction efficiency of Mg2+ and B3+. The optimization was performed from two approaches. The first, maximizing the extraction of Mg2+ and B3+, resulted in experimental efficiencies of 99.17% of Mg2+, 99.36% of B3+ and 23.54% of Li+; whereas the second, in which lithium co-extraction was minimized, yielded efficiencies of 83.56% Mg2+, 99.22% B3+ and 3.36% Li+, results that demonstrate the high extraction capacity of the system, as well as proving the validity of the statistical model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Boron extraction; Ionic liquid; Lithium brine purification; Magnesium extraction; Response surface methodology","Boron; Ionic liquids; Lithium; Magnesium; Purification; Surface properties; Boron extraction; Electromobility; High demand; Li$++$; Lithium brine purification; Magnesium extraction; Mg$-2$; Mg$-2$/; Optimisations; Response-surface methodology; Extraction; boron; brine; efficiency measurement; element mobility; experimental study; extraction method; lithium; magnesium; optimization; purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111616136

The interest in employing metabolomics in SC research has consistently grown and emphasis is, here, given to developments reported in the past five years. This text informs on the existing methodologies and their complementarity regarding the information provided, comprising untargeted/targeted approaches, which couple mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with multivariate analysis (and, in some cases, pathway analysis and integration with other omics), and more specific analytical approaches, namely isotope tracing to highlight particular metabolic pathways, or in tandem microscopic strategies to pinpoint characteristics within a single cell. The bulk of this review covers the existing applications in various aspects of mesenchymal SC behavior, followed by pluripotent and neural SCs, with a few reports addressing other SC types. Some of the central ideas investigated comprise the metabolic/biological impacts of different tissue/donor sources and differentiation conditions, including the importance of considering 3D culture environments, mechanical cues and/or media enrichment to guide differentiation into specific lineages. Metabolomic analysis has considered cell endometabolomes and exometabolomes (fingerprinting and footprinting, respectively), having measured both lipid species and polar metabolites involved in a variety of metabolic pathways.

Here, we have designed two-dimensional vertical ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures and estimated their electronic and optical properties and the effects of applying strain using hybrid density functional theory calculations. The energetic, dynamic and thermal stabilities were verified via the interface adhesion energy, phonon dispersion curve and molecular dynamics simulations. ZrS2(HfS2) and BiOCl are stacked through weak van der Waals forces, leading to easy growth of the heterostructures. The results show that ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures possess an intrinsic type-II band alignment that could efficiently reduce the recombination rate of charge carriers. Moreover, the in-plane biaxial strain tunes the bandgap and induces a transition from indirect to direct semiconductor. Additionally, the ZrS2/BiOCl heterostructure band alignment can straddle the water redox potential at pH 0-7. Our theoretical findings are beneficial in revealing the mechanism of enhanced photocatalysis and provide strategies to improve the performance of 2D monolayer materials in solar energy conversion and optoelectronic devices.

However, only a few dozen 2D materials have been successfully synthesized or exfoliated. Motivated by the recent discovery of 2D gallenene, we have explored new 2D allotropes of β-Ga2O3, an emerging wide-band gap transparent conductive oxide (TCO) with a wide range of semiconducting applications. All the possible 2D allotropes of β-Ga2O3 with high energetic stability have been predicted using particle swarm optimization, combined with density functional theory calculations. The structural and dynamical stability of the predicted 2D allotropes has been analyzed. Although β-Ga2O3 is not a van der Waals material, results predict that one or two allotropes of β-Ga2O3 are stable. In addition, the accurate band structures of these 2D semiconducting oxides have been calculated using both the GGA and LDA-1/2 approach. Remarkably, monolayer Ga2O3(100) has a larger indirect band gap of 4 eV, demonstrating a new avenue for the discovery of 2D β-Ga2O3 based nano-devices with enhanced electronic properties. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","2D β-Ga2O3; CALYPSO; density functional calculations; electron localization function; GGA and LDA-1/2 approximations","Calculations; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Gallium compounds; Monolayers; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Stability; Van der Waals forces; 2d β-ga2O3; CALYPSO; Density-functional calculations; Electron localization function; Electronic energies; Energy conversion technologies; First principles; GGA and LDA-1/2 approximation; Optical and mechanical properties; Two-dimensional; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117439670

Here, the interfacial interactions in mixtures of [Emim][TFSI] and [Hmim][TFSI] with GDYNT are uncovered and compared to the interactions in mixtures of those ionic liquids with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The porosity of GDYNT, in addition to its less stiff sidewall, allows an increased proximity between ions and the carbon sidewall, when compared to CNTs. It was demonstrated that hydrogen atoms (from cations) and fluorine atoms (from anions) assume preferential positions near the center of GDYNT's pores, and, while [Emim] cations permit an almost crystal like packing of the ionic liquid inside GDYNT, the large alkyl “tail” of [Hmim] cation impedes that layer ordering. It was also found that the porous nature of GDYNT acts partially as a very fine sieve, “gluing” smaller atoms to its surface, while removing the remainders, which was not observed in mixtures of ionic liquids with CNTs.

It determines the energy flexibility potential of buildings in relation to their physical characteristics and heat supply systems with respect to external boundary conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The emphasis of the evaluation is based on the timing and the amount of shiftable and storable thermal loads in buildings under defined indoor thermal comfort conditions. Dynamic building simulation is used to evaluate the potential of selected building characteristics to shift heating loads away from peak demand periods. Insights on the energy flexibility potential of individual technologies are gained by examining the thermal behaviour of single-zone simulation models as different input parameters are varied. For this purpose, parameters such as envelope qualities, construction materials, control systems for heating are modified. Findings: The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of the different building parameters and their variations on their energy shifting potential under “laboratory conditions” with steady boundaries. It suggests that the investigated boundary conditions such as outside temperature, infiltration, envelope quality and user behaviour, which influence the heating load of a building, also influence the resulting potential for energy flexibility. The findings show that the combination of a slowly reacting heat transfer system, such as concrete core activation and a readily available storage mass in the room, and a high insulation standard proved to have a high potential to shift heating loads. Originality/value: In this paper, energy-flexible components were evaluated in a steady-state simulation approach. Outside temperature, solar irradiation and internal loads over the simulation duration were set constant over time to provide laboratory conditions for the potential analysis. On the basis of both duration and performance of the load shifting or storage event, the components were then quantified in a parametric simulation. The determined energy flexibility is directly related to the power of the heating, cooling, hot water and ventilation system, which can be switched on or off. In general, it can be seen that high power (high loads) demand usually can be switched on and off for a short duration, and low power demand usually for a longer duration. The investigated boundary conditions such as outside temperature, infiltration, envelope quality and user behaviour, which influence the load of a building, also influence the resulting potential for energy flexibility. Higher insulation standards, for example, lead to lower loads that can be switched on or off, but increase the duration of the event (flexibility time). So that, in particular, the shiftable load potential is low but results in a long switch-off duration. Furthermore, passive storage potential in buildings like the storage mass inside the room and the type of heat/cooling transfer system can affect the flexibility potential by more than three times. Especially the combination of a high storage mass and a concrete core heat transfer system can significantly increase the flexibility. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Energy flexibility of buildings; Load shifting; Storage potential of buildings",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085046968

In this work, thermal catalytic cracking of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at elevated temperatures employing concentrated solar tower is considered to produce clean hydrogen (CO2-free) and studied in terms of life cycle emissions. The generated hydrogen is utilized for clean ammonia synthesis in a Haber-Bosch reactor. The proposed system is initially assessed from a thermodynamic perspective, considering energy and exergy analyses emphasizing optimization of operating conditions. Then, the proposed system's life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to analyze ammonia synthesis's environmental impacts. The aggregate environmental impact of the proposed system is quantified and compared with conventional production processes. Through the utilization of solar energy resources, ammonia production can be attained, avoiding high harmful emissions. The LCA study is carried out in GaBi software, and the selected impact assessment methodology is ReCiPe. The impact categories studied in this work are global warming potential (GWP), terrestrial acidification, human toxicity, and particulate matter formation potential. Considering 30 years of use phase and allocation, the predicted GWP is approximately 0.616 kg CO2 (eq.)/kg NH3, showing the potential to reduce up to 69.2% of the GWP compared to the global average value. Concerning human toxicity and fine particulate matter formation impact categories, the system produces about 3.32E-2 kg 1,4-DB (eq.) and 5.96E-4 kg PM2.5 (eq.), respectively, per kg NH3.

Despite the fast deactivation, limestone is still considered the major candidate sorbent material, due to its high availability and low cost. Herein, the phenomena governing the activity loss of limestone under calcium looping conditions are investigated and a comprehensive model is proposed. The carbonation conversion was found to linearly depend on the CaO porosity before reaction. Sintering of CaO during each calcination stage affects porosity. On the contrary, CaCO3 sintering does not affect the deactivation of the material. Apart from CaO sintering, it was found that structural changes during cycling greatly enhance the loss of activity. In-situ XRD experiments revealed that after each calcination step CaO crystal size increases leading to a gradual loss of porosity and surface area with cycles.

The proposed system consists of two sources for the production of renewable energy, solar cell (PV) and fuel cell (FC). These units work to integrate production and achieve stability, where PV is considered the primary source of production, in the case of the availability of ideal conditions from radiation and temperature, FC compensates for the lack of energy when any defect occurs in the PV unit. Two types of storage units, Battery (Bat.) and a super-capacitor (SC), were linked, each complementing the other to get a fast and long-term response. These units are linked with DC_bus by inverters. DC_bus and AC_bus were used with AC and DC loads. By using two types of control methods PID and Flatness to obtain a constant voltage For AC and DC loads, Also the PSO method was used to track the production of units PV to obtain the highest energy from the available solar radiation MPPT, where the super-capacitor SC controls the voltage of DC and AC bus.

As VRE has a high peak to average output, the Single Electricity Market of the island of Ireland (SEM) will need to consider how best to balance the lost value of curtailment against the extra costs of higher Simultaneous Non-Synchronous Penetration (SNSP), more interconnector capacity and/or more storage. The paper develops a spreadsheet model to explore these options for the 2026 VRE targets in the SEM and her neighbours. Raising SNSP from 75 % to 85 % reduces curtailment from 13.3 % to 8.0 %, saving 1338 GWh/yr of spilled wind. Adding the Celtic Link of 700 MW at SNSP of 75 % reduces curtailment to 12.4 % and saves 235 GWh. Adding 100 MW of batteries saves 19 GWh/yr, but the costs of delivering these savings are high. The marginal spilled wind can be four times the average, creating a potentially significant market distortion and reducing the value of adding further VRE. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric storage; BES; CCGT; CHP; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine; Combined Heat and Power; electric vehicle; EV; Minimum Stable Generation; MSG; National Energy and Climate Plan; NCEP; SEM; Simultaneous non-synchronous penetration; Single Electricity Market of the island of Ireland; SNSP; Variable Renewable Electricity; VRE","Battery storage; Cogeneration plants; Combined cycle power plants; Electric industry; Gas turbines; Secondary batteries; Battery electric storage; BES; CCGT; CHP; Combined cycle gas turbine; Combined-Heat and Power; Energy; EV; Ireland; Minimum stable generation; MSG; National energy and climate plan; NCEP; Renewable electricity; Simultaneous non-synchronoi penetration; Single electricity market of the island of ireland; Variable renewable electricity; Power markets; alternative energy; climate change; combined heat and power; electric vehicle; energy market; energy use; environmental planning; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114668245

Globally, the various renewable resources are distinguished by their origin into firm, variable and uncertain. To cope with the impact of variable and uncertain renewables on residual load, system operators need to plan-ahead adequate spinning reserves. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for addressing the dynamic spinning reserve formulation, that is capable of accounting for the largely unaddressed challenge of the volatile behavior of different power inputs in the presence of storage. Based on realistic models and spinning reserve clusters, our solution leverages widely adopted robust approaches in the field, providing optimum cost/risk trade-off without deteriorating the computational burden. The proposed framework relies on a hybrid optimization mechanism to enable the effective unit commitment and allow for the minimization of spinning reserve deficits, renewable energy curtailment and load shedding. In the presence of storage, our formulation improves not only the annual total cost, but also allows for renewable generation enhancement at the maximum reliability level. The annual improvement accounts for 1.18% increases in renewable penetration, reduced costs in the range of €9M-€27 M and 3.75–9.45 GWh of services that are not withheld. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity storage; Hybrid optimization; Load shedding; Spinning-reserve clusters; Unit commitment; Variable renewable energy sources","Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Electric power plant loads; Renewable energy resources; Cluster-based; Dynamics modelling; Electricity storages; Hybrid optimization; Load-shedding; Power; Spinning reserves; Spinning-reserve cluster; Unit Commitment; Variable renewable energy source; Electric load shedding; alternative energy; cluster analysis; detection method; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; trade-off; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108888150

A case study is developed for the Chilean power system, which is currently undergoing an ambitious coal phase-out process, including the analysis of a scenario that leads to a completely renewable generation mix. The results show that highly renewable generation mixes are feasible, but rely on an effective balance of the key flexibility attributes of the system including ramping, storage, and transmission capacities.

Using life-cycle analysis (LCA) conducted in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards, this paper explores the climate change impacts of two deep EGS. The first study was in Reykjanes, Iceland, where a single well, IDDP-2/DEEPEGS, was drilled to a depth of 4.6 km for the purposes of additional electricity production from an existing power plant. The second study involved two wells with side-tracks (depth > 5000 m), drilled to serve a new heat and power co-generation plant located on an old oil field site in Vendenheim, France. Climate change impacts for the sites were estimated in the range 1.6–17.4 gCO2e/kWh and 6.9–13.9 gCO2e/kWh for Reykjanes and Vendenheim, respectively. Although the EGS projects are very different, both outcomes are low when compared to non-renewable alternatives and akin to best-in-class renewable alternatives. The main impact at the Reykjanes demonstration site were the greenhouse gas emissions released from the borehole, an effect that could be avoided by carbon capture and storage/mineralisation/utilisation. In the case of Vendenheim, further reductions in emissions could be achieved via more extensive adoption of circular economy principles in design and procurement. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep geothermal energy; Environmental impacts; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hotspots; Life-cycle assessment","Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Geothermal fields; Greenhouse effect; Infill drilling; Life cycle; Oil field equipment; Oil fields; Academic literature; Case-studies; Climate change impact; Climate impacts; Deep geothermal energy; Enhanced geothermal systems; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hot spot; Icelands; Lifecycle analysis; Greenhouse gases; borehole; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; electricity generation; geothermal system; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; oil field; power plant; France; Iceland; Reykjanes Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108203072

Four parameters were considered to analyze and compare the performance of these algorithms: integral of squared error (ISE), integral of absolute error (IAE), integral of time-weighted absolute error (ITAE), and the integral of time-weighted squared error (ITSE). Analyses of variances (ANOVA) were proposed for each of the parameters studied. The PSO and RPSO algorithms presented the best performance in terms of the mean and the standard deviation of the ISE, IAE, ITAE, and ITSE parameters. Significant differences were not found between the three algorithms in terms of the parameters considered. However, significant differences did exist when comparing groups (pairs) of algorithms considering a significance level of 5%. The ANOVA analysis showed that ITAE was the most affected parameter by population size, while the IAE and ITSE parameters were the less affected. In the optimization, the PSO algorithm obtained the best performance in terms of convergence with values of 0.1110 USD/kWh (LCOE), 4.6971 years (PBP), 1114 USD/kWh (SIC), and 173.64 kW (Wnet).

The potential of this van der Waals material lies in its optoelectronic and chemical properties. However, pure free-standing germanene cannot be found in nature, and the synthesis methods are hindering the potentially fascinating properties of germanene. Herein, we report a single-step synthesis of few-layer germanene by electrochemical exfoliation in a nonaqueous environment. As a result of simultaneous decalcification and intercalation of the electrolyte's active ions, we achieved low-level hydrogenation of germanene that occurs at the edges of the material. The obtained edge-hydrogenated germanene flakes have a lateral size of several micrometers and possess a cubic structure. We have pioneered the potential application of edge-hydrogenated germanene for vapor sensing and demonstrated its specific sensitivity to methanol and ethanol. Furthermore, we have shown a selective behavior of the germanene-based sensor that appears to increase the electrical resistance in the vapors where methanol prevails. We anticipate that these results can provide an approach for emerging layered materials with the potential utility in advanced gas sensing. ©","edge-hydrogenated germanene; electrochemical exfoliation; semiconductor; top-down synthesis; vapor sensing","Electrolytes; Methanol; Van der Waals forces; Edge-hydrogenated germanene; Electrochemical exfoliation; Electrochemicals; Germanene; Top-down synthesis; Topdown; Two-dimensional; Van der Waal; Vapor sensing; Vapour sensors; Hydrogenation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116559726

The synergistic effect of highly polar nitrile and jeffamine segments enabled the generation of amorphous semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) whose physico-chemical behavior was triggered by the grafting position of the nitrile unit on the aromatic hard segment. This was evident in various characteristics like solubility, morphology, thermal stability, mechanical strength and moreover, dielectric constant, conductivity, breakdown strength and energy density storage. The SIPN films were tough and highly stretchable, with a maximum strain at break of 516%, meanwhile self-sticky when they come in contact with each other or with other materials. The judicious structural variation in the nitrile-containing segment allowed modulation of the dielectric constant that reached 19 at 106 Hz, which is among the highest reported to date for a neat polyimide material. The resulting SIPNs displayed noticeable breakdown strength, up to 220 V μm-1, and energy storage density up to 1.092 J cm-3. A new insight into the molecular dynamics and charge carrier conductivity of these all-organic high-k polymer dielectrics is also provided to set the premises for use in stretchable electronics. © 2021 the Partner Organisations.",,"Electric breakdown; Grafting (chemical); High-k dielectric; Molecular dynamics; Morphology; Polyimides; Adhesivity; Breakdown strengths; Electronics applications; High- k; Jeffamines; Physico-chemicals; Semiinterpenetrating polymer networks (semi-ipns); Structural elements; Synergistic effect; Synthetic pathways; Cyanides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117054362

Proper storage requires no evaporation or leakage, which causes isotopic drift and bias. Surveys by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) show most isotope laboratories use glass or plastic bottles to store working reference materials, with frequent opening and closings that pose evaporation risks. Practical small (ca. 2–5 L) storage-dispensing solutions free of air exposure, evaporation, and leakage are needed. We also tested several smaller-scale bottles for day-to-day aliquots. Methods: We tested low-cost, conveniently sized (4 L) adaptations of a common stainless-steel beverage keg with a liquid dispenser, with minor modifications to facilitate low-flow dispensing and pressurization (1–2 bar) with Ar or N2. We tested three kegs (100%, 75%, 50% initial fills) for a 2-year period along with monthly dispensing to assess long-term storage viability for maintaining δ18O and δ2H integrity and dispensing, and day-to-day aliquot bottles for 6 months. Results: Test results showed these small keg storage systems fully maintained the isotopic integrity of water over the 2-year testing period with no trend in the isotopic data that would reveal evaporative loss or leakage (e.g., pressure or mass loss) regardless of starting fill level. However, evaporated water in the outlet tube assembly must be eliminated by discarding 15–20 mL before dispensing into appropriate daily-use laboratory standard bottles (30–100 mL). Glass bottles for daily aliquots showed good integrity properties, but only if their fill level was &gt;50%. Conclusions: The use of a low-cost pressurized metal beverage keg dispensing system provides a robust solution to enable laboratories to maintain the integrity of their water isotope working reference materials over several years. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114597280

PPC has several advantages over traditional full power converters: low power losses, lower cost, and higher power density. The proposed current-fed isolated full bridge buck-boost topology has shown excellent characteristics in PPC configuration, interfacing such nonlinear energy sources as PV panels. For experimental verification of PV partial power interface converter into a 350 V DC microgrid a 3.3 kW laboratory prototype with current-fed isolated full bridge buck-boost topology was designed, built, and tested.

A real LVDC MG is used for these tests, containing photovoltaic generation system (PVS), battery energy storage system (BESS), DC load, and protective devices. A protective device uses a solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) integrated with a DC microgrid digital relay (DCMDR) or a fast-acting fuse (FAF) to protect the microgrid. The islanded operation mode of LVDC MG is selected for doing staged fault tests at several possible faulted locations. The fast protection system of LVDC MG can detect, locate and isolate a faulted point by using multiple protection modules including derivative modules of current and voltage, overcurrent module, undervoltage module, and the i2t characteristic of fuses. The obtained results of staged fault tests show that the DCMDR-integrated SSCBs can quickly trip to isolate the faulted location in a few milliseconds as well as get high selectivity of the protection system. Moreover, the FAFs can efficiently operate as the backup protection of the DCMDR-integrated SSCBs in order to not only protect the BESS and load sections in the microgrid but also still ensure the fast operation of MG protection system. © 2021 IEEE.","DC microgrid; Digital relay; Fast-acting fuse; Solid-state circuit breaker; Staged fault tests","Electric power system protection; Electric relays; Testing; Timing circuits; DC microgrid; Digital relays; Fast-acting fuse; Fault tests; Low voltages; Microgrid; Protection systems; Solid State Circuit Breaker; Staged fault test; Voltage DC; Electric circuit breakers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119407277

Moreover, Natuna is famous for aquaculture fisheries of Napoleon (Cheilinus undulatus) with allowed-export capacity up to 30,000 kg. However, resource development in Natuna is often constrained by poor infrastructure such as limited fish unloading berths and natural gas pipelines, obscure electricity, and inadequate energy resources. Thus, the utilization of resources in Natuna has not been maximized. Currently, Natuna has been partially improved on distribution services through the sea toll and the establishment of the Integrated Marine and Fisheries Centre (SKPT) of the Lampa Strait. To carry out the challenge and manifest the resources in Natuna, researches on marine renewable energy in Natuna have been conducted and revealed significant wave height up to â 1.5 m, ocean current velocity per year ranged from 0.255 to 0.340 m/s, and thermal gradient's Carnot efficiency up to 0.67. Despite these lacking numbers on ocean currents, waves, and thermal gradients for renewable energy development, this study exhibits that the Natuna region has a great energy potential from wind farm and solar power plant development. There are four recommended sites namely Pulau Tiga, Sabang Mawang, Sedanau Island, and SKPT Natuna as places to develop hybrid renewable energy development from pumped hydro storage system, wind farm, and/or solar power plant.

We develop a system dynamics model of the interactions between the demand of CO2-EOR to sustain oil output as reservoirs age, the country's production targets, and the required carbon prices to accelerate the adoption of CO2-EOR with CCS. We simulate 12 scenarios that represents different pathways for oil production, CO2 emissions growth and performance of CO2-EOR. The scenarios consider the sensitivity to key parameters: net utilization factor of CO2 for the marginal barrel of oil produced, the time it takes for injected CO2 to reach the production well (breakthrough time), and the share of EOR wells going to CO2-EOR operation. We find that a carbon price of 10–15 $/t CO2 in the first decade is needed in order to offset the cost of the CCS operations with the potential of breaking even by 2030. The large-scale adoption of CO2-EOR with CCS in the UAE can help in meeting 2.2–39.2% of the UAE 2nd national committed reduction target, i.e., 72.85 million tons of CO2 reduction per year by 2030, depending on CO2 breakthrough time and its net utilization factor. It may also help in freeing natural gas that could supply 12–20% of local energy needs extending its use with the CCS system. This study demonstrates a systematic modeling approach that quantifies complex interactions at the system level towards cleaner production practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; CO2-EOR; Enhanced oil recovery; System dynamics","Carbon capture; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Pollution control; System theory; Breakthrough time; Carbon price; CO2-enhanced oil recovery; Enhanced-oil recoveries; Greenhouse gas emissions; Large-scales; System dynamics modelling; United Arab Emirates; Utilization factor; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon storage; enhanced oil recovery; greenhouse gas; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116867659

Capacitors fabricated by using the Ionic liquid (IL) based Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have been attracted tremendously as eco-friendly energy sources based on their unique features such as satisfactory specific capacitance, good cycle ability, and good stability. The present study reports about a redox capacitor fabricated with the IL, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumbis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (1E3Mbis(TF)I) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (CF3NaO3S - NaTF). Reported highest room temperature conductivity was 7.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 with the composition of 1 Polyvinyl chloride (PVC):1 1E3MIbis(TF)I:2 NaTF. The conductivity mechanism of GPEs follows free volume theory. The redox capacitor with the configuration, polypyrrole (PPy):NaTF/1 PVC:1 1E3MIbis(TF)I:2 NaTF/PPy:NaTF showed a single electrode specific capacitance (CSC) of 31.5 F g−1 based on Nyquist plot. Its relaxation time was 13.6 s and this confirms fairly fast charge storage process. Initial CSC of the redox capacitor was about 126.3 F g−1 for the potential window from −1.2 V to 1.2 V. Initial single electrode discharge capacitance (Csd) observed by Galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) test under a constant current of 240 μA was 24.1 F g−1. It was gradually decreased to 9.57 F g−1 with cycling due to the formation of a passivation layer on the electrode and the degradation of electrolyte/electrode interface. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ionic liquid based gel polymer electrolyte; PPy based electrode; Redox capacitors; Single electrode specific capacitance","Capacitance; Chlorine compounds; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Passivation; Polyelectrolytes; Polypyrroles; Polyvinyl chlorides; Gel polymer electrolytes; Ionic liquid based gel polymer electrolyte; ITS applications; Performance; Polypyrrole based electrode; Polyvinyls; Redox capacitor; Single electrode specific capacitance; Single electrodes; Specific capacitance; Ionic liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113997994

For this, five polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) film-type sensors are mounted on different interphalangeal joints of the fingers. A 68 μF/25 V ceramic capacitor is used as a storage device. A battery-less power management circuit (PMC) is proposed to isolate the capacitor from the load to reduce the current consumption while charging. When the voltage across the capacitor reaches a threshold voltage, the user decides when to transfer the energy to the electronic load. To test the proposed system, the harvested and conditioned energy is used to power both the PMC and a battery-less cardiac pulse detection circuit, achieving an autonomy of 20 s. This time depends on the voltage stored in the capacitor and the current consumption of the load. Using the proposed wearable system, it is possible to store up to 700 μJ in the capacitor when a subject manipulates a computer or a cellular phone for 10 min.

The magneto-bipolaron energies of ground and first excited states are evaluated using the Pekar variational method. The decoherence time and entropy are also evaluated. All these calculations are intended to show firstly the effect of both the magnetic and the electric fields on the quasi-particles’ properties in the quantum dot. Our results show that all studied quasi-particles properties in the quantum dot are closely influenced by magnetic and electric fields. The decoherence time increases with increasing of the electric field strength, and decreases with increasing of the magnetic field strength and the electron–phonon coupling constant. From our analysis, it is obvious to see that the application of electric field and magnetic field have opposite effects on the qubit. Comparing both fields, the electric field is advantageous for qubit survival and information storage, while the magnetic field is detrimental to qubit survival and information storage, respectively. The entropy increases with increasing of the electric field strength, and decreases with increasing of the magnetic field strength. We also observe that in the absence of magnetic and electric fields, the entropy varies very slightly with the increase of the confinement strength. We can deduce that, these external fields can help us to modulate the period of information transfer in the system, and hence can be used to control its coherence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Lee-Low-Pines Pekar variational methods; Magneto-bipolaron; Quantum dot; Qubit","Electric fields; Entropy; Magnetic storage; Nanocrystals; Qubits; Semiconductor quantum dots; Confinement strength; Electric field and magnetic field; Electric field strength; External electric field; First excited state; Information transfers; Magnetic and electric fields; Magnetic field strengths; Magnetic field effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112328582

One promising strategy to meet the growing demand for biomass for energy production is to re-cultivate abandoned arable land. The digestate fertilisation approach for the sake of increased biomass yields is the key strategy towards more sustainable biogas generation in many regions. To minimise digestate utilisation costs, biogas plant operators seek to spread the liquid digestate as close as possible to its storage location. The present work is focused on the evaluation of the digestate impact on the eroded agricultural soil, the improved biomass yield of semi-natural grassland biomass and its biogas potential. Three-year field experiment results indicate the positive effect of solid and liquid digestate on soil fertility and quality. The amount of dissolved organic carbon in eroded loamy Retisol increased 3.7% and 15% in soil 0–10 cm layer with fertilisation rate of 170 kg ha−1 N of liquid and solid digestate, respectively. In terms of total nitrogen, 11.6% and 20% increases were achieved using 170 kg ha−1 N of liquid and solid digestate compared to unfertilised. Furthermore, the grass fresh biomass yield was up to 3 times higher compared to the unfertilised yield. The biomethane yield of biomass from digestate-fertilised fields was higher for every fertilisation rate applied. The highest biomethane yield was for 170 kg N ha−1 liquid digestate applied, yielding 19% more biogas compared to untreated field biomass due to both increased biogas yield and increased methane content. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas potential; Digestate impact; Semi-natural grass","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Liquids; Organic carbon; Soils; Anaerobics; Biogas potential; Biomass yield; Biomethane; Digestate; Digestate impact; Energy productions; Fertilisation; Fertilization rates; Semi-natural grass; Biogas; alternative energy; anaerobic digestion; biogas; biomass power; demand analysis; economic activity; grass; power generation; soil fertility; soil property; Lithuania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111106926

This decarbonization system is based on chemical absorption - desorption cycle using alkanolamine solutions. In this work, the reactive gas–liquid absorption was assessed from techno-economic and environmental perspective for decarbonization of super-critical power plants as well as to improve the plant time flexibility. The assessed coal and lignite plant concepts generate 1000 MW net output with 90% carbon capture rate. As benchmark cases, the plant designs without CO2 capture were also assessed to quantify the decarbonization energy and cost penalties. Detailed evaluations cover the following aspects: decarbonized power generation by chemical scrubbing with / without solvent storage facilities; set-up of an integrated assessment methodology; evaluation of main techno-economic and environmental performance indicators. A key novelty element of this work represents the usage of solvent storage to improve the flexibility of decarbonized power plant.

Such discussion is considered highly important considering the role of finance, an abundance of fossil fuel and industrial value-added on economic activities and environmental issues. Meanwhile, few empirical studies in this line of discussions have documented policy options for projecting the path towards sustainable development in Argentina from 1971 to 2018. To contribute to the extant literature in filling this gap, this study examines whether finance can escalate a long-lasting economic shift that will change the path of carbon emission in Argentina using the novel econometric technique, dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag simulations. The modelling protocol incorporates the impact of the following economic agents such as population, economic growth, trade openness, and government consumption expenditure. Our result suggests that all the variables are cointegrated under the ARDL-bounds testing framework. The long and short-term estimates from the dynamic ARDL simulation show that finance and industrial value added interestingly offer policy options for CO2 mitigation in Argentina. Fossil fuel, population, economic growth, and government consumption expenditure have increasing an impact on CO2 emissions, exacerbating sustainability challenges in Argentina. In sum, improved finance and industrial restructuring are needed economic acumen that can accelerate a quick transition to a low-carbon development in Argentina, while fossil fuel, population, economic growth, and government consumption expenditure generate environmental challenges. Policy options in consideration of investors’ safety in carbonated companies in Argentina, these companies owe shareholders an obligation to invest in a resilient carbon capture and storage technology in a bid to decrease environmental degradation and align with environmental goals set by the Argentine government. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Argentina; DARDL simulation; Energy mix; Finance; Industrial value-added","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; environmental degradation; environmental issue; environmental protection; finance; industrial restructuring; industrial technology; sustainability; sustainable development; Argentina; Argentinidae; carbon; Argentina; economic development; policy; sustainable development; Argentina; Carbon; Economic Development; Policy; Sustainable Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107872651

Consideration of the electron beam size shows that in real conditions the radiation propagating in the plane of the equilibrium orbit will not be completely polarized, and the shape and dimensions of the angular distribution of radiation will be distorted. The motion of electrons in the uniform magnetic field and SR of the beam of relativistic particles in the storage ring of ""NESTOR"" are considered. The effect of the size of the electron beam with the energy of E=225 MeV in the 6-dimensional space on the formation of images of the flux of quanta of SR is analyzed. It is shown that the main contribution to the formation of images is made by the two-dimensional distribution of particles along the vertical direction axis and vertical oscillations. A software simulation code has been developed, the use of which made it possible to simulate the process of optical image formations by the flux of SR quanta (Этого предложения нет в русской аннотации). The formation of images of the radiation of electrons with an energy of E=225 MeV with change in the longitudinal distance L to the registration plane is considered. It is determined that at small longitudinal distances the main contribution to the image is made by the vertical distribution of particles in the beam. With an increase in the basic distance L, the contribution of the distribution of particles over vertical oscillations increases, which becomes decisive for large L value. Numerical simulation of image formation has been carried out. For the base distance of 300 cm and beam parameters with the vertical root mean square size σy of 0.2 mm and a vertical root mean square size σy´of 0.15 mrad, the family of angular distributions is presented in the form of two-dimensional histograms for wavelengths λ = 0.5 λc, λ= λc, λ = 2 λc, where λc, is the critical wavelength of SR. The dimensions of the optical window are obtained, the size of which makes it possible to reliably register the entire flux of SR quanta for the indicated registration characteristics. © A.

In general, electricity price will be more expensive at night when the load demand is at its highest and cheaper when the demand is at its minimum. From a consumer standpoint, dynamic pricing will cause a large increase to their electricity bills. A system with renewable electricity generator is one of the method to answer this problem. By using generation component such as a solar panel, the consumer can use the generated energy during the daytime or storing it in a storage component like a battery to use it in peak-time when the tariff is much higher. Even more so, the excess energy from solar panel can be sold to the grid to reduce the spending on electricity bills.

The energy used in everyday life will usually be related to fossil fuels. Alternative fuels are needed as a solution to these problems, including Biodiesel. However, the use of Biodiesel still has problems in its resistance to oxidative degradation during storage. The double bonds in the Biodiesel molecule produce a high level of reactivity with oxygen, especially when placed in contact with air. As a result of the storage for a long time can cause degradation of fuel properties that affect the quality of Biodiesel itself. This research was carried out for 12 weeks with storage conditions in stainless steel tanks such as in fuel storage tanks that are commonly used. Variations for storage conditions are: (1) storage indoors at ambient temperature, (2) tanks stored on ships with coastal/marine air conditions with direct air circulation into tanks, (3) tanks stored on ships with conditions beach / sea air with air filters on the tank. To get the characteristics of molecular changes that occur as a result of variations in storage conditions, biodiesel testing is carried out with the FTIR test method. The results obtained show that at the beginning of the month there were peaks in the functional groups of carboxylic acid compounds and aldehyde acids with a delta transmittance of 9.48% at the beginning of last month decreasing to 9.4% in the third month for Low RH, whereas for High RH there was a peak with a transmittance delta of 10.91% at the beginning of last month, down to 9.48% in the third month.

The efficiency of polymer solar cells comprising a bulk heterojunction photoactive film of an anthracene containing poly(p-aryleneethynylene)-alt-poly(p-arylenevinylene)/1-(3methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl[6,6] and phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester has increased from 3.6% to 4.6% from the standard to the inverted architecture with Al concentrations of 0.6%, respectively. After this concentration, the efficiency starts to decrease. The reasons for these results are discussed based on the AC electrical process and magnetoconductance (MC) measurements under open-circuit conditions at room temperature. The frequency (f) dependence of the real part (Z′) and the imaginary part (Z′′) of the complex impedance with various Al concentrations at open-circuit conditions at room temperature show three f regimes: low, mid, and high f. The Cole-Cole plots (Z′′ vs Z′) demonstrate an increase in the semicircle radius from the standard to the inverted architectures for Al concentrations of 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. After this concentration (0.6%), the semicircle radius starts to decrease. Afterward, the present proposed impedance model shows some important physical parameters such as electron diffusion time (τdiff), the recombination time (τrec), the diffusion constant (Dn), the diffusion length (Ln), and the electron mobility (μn). From the dielectric measurements, all devices have a unique relaxation process, which is the property of the Debye relaxation mechanism. Moreover, the dielectric constant (ϵ′) showed a strong dependence on f and the type of architecture. In addition, the dielectric loss (ϵ″) decreased significantly with f, and as a result, it has sparked a lot of interest in these materials' possible uses in electrical energy storage. The dielectric loss tangent (tan(δ))) peaks shifted a little bit toward higher f from the standard to the inverted structures, indicating reduction of relaxation time. Furthermore, we found an MC memory effect in the inverted cells. Then the mechanism responsible for the MC was determined with the current density versus the applied voltage in the log-log scale for the different elaborated cells at VOC. The results suggested that the applied voltage (VOC) corresponds to the trapped charge limited current (TCLC) regime, with traps acting as recombination centers for electron-hole (e-h) pairs, preventing the formation of double carriers MC. For this reason, the MC in the device may be described using a stochastic Liouville equation in the context of the e-h pair model. ©",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Dielectric devices; Dielectric losses; Diffusion; Heterojunctions; II-VI semiconductors; Open circuit voltage; Polymer solar cells; Timing circuits; Zinc oxide; Al-concentration; Applied voltages; Electron hole pairs; Inverted architectures; Inverted polymer solar cells; Magnetoconductance; Open circuit conditions; Open-circuit voltages; Short-circuit currents; Static dynamics; Butyric acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115616156

Sustainable designs mainly consider the economic and environmental impact of the cluster. A trade-off normally exists between profit and reducing environmental impact. Therefore, there is a need for optimization techniques that consider these factors simultaneously to achieve sustainable designs. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) allows the consideration of multiple objectives to generate Pareto optimal solutions. This work optimizes resource integration (both material and energy) networks for different sustainability objectives to develop sustainable cluster designs using the augmented ε-constraint method. The method was applied to a cluster that uses green technologies and renewable energy for maximum economic return, minimum CO2 and water footprint. The approach generates a 3D Pareto optimal surface, where each point corresponds to a unique resource integration network.

In this work, a novel noble metal-free MoSe2–Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrocatalyst is synthesized using a multi-step hydrothermal technique for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The morphology, structural, chemical composition, and functional features of the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized using different techniques that include scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman analysis. The new developed MoSe2–Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite combines a high active surface area with a high chemical stability, generating a novel material with a synergistic effect that enhances water splitting process performance. Thus, an outstanding low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1 is accomplished in the hydrogen evolution reaction. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Electrocatalysis; Hydrogen evolution; MoSe2–Ni(OH)2; Nanoflowers; Water splitting","Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen production; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Nanoflowers; Precious metals; Scanning electron microscopy; Slope stability; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction; Electrochemicals; High efficient; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Hydrogen-evolution; Low-costs; Mose2–ni(OH)2; OH$+-$; Renewable energies; Synthesised; Water splitting; Electrocatalysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111967937

This paper focuses on the reactive power flow at the TSO/DSO interface. The motivation is to add the control ability of reactive power by a market-based approach where so far untapped flexible inverter-based resources connected to the distribution system are used as controllable assets. This development benefits the Distribution System Operator and the work opens new business opportunities especially to asset owners and aggregators. A local reactive power market is demonstrated as a novel solution. As a part of the market concept, a forecast of reactive power at the $T$SO/DSO interface was developed and utilized by the Distribution System Operator. The reactive power demonstration was performed with two assets, a battery energy storage system and a photovoltaic power plant. The assets were controlled by an aggregator. The demonstration period was successfully performed. The work presented in this paper has been done as a part of the Finnish demonstration of the EU-SysFlex project. The presented approach also builds upon the current EU targets for the development of various market-based flexibility services. However, the development of these applications also challenges the aggregators and flexibility providers, since the control of manifold types of assets requires various technical solutions that may be case dependent.

Some of them include avoiding the costs of expensive centralized electricity generation and its environmental impact. However, existing electricity market arrangements aiming at rewarding these benefits present large externalities and therefore fail to reward well the true societal benefits of energy storage. In particular, ESS could be operated to avoid the emissions of polluting centralized generation. Thus, ESS could also avoid the damage cost of those emissions such as the social cost of climate change and the damage on population health. These large externalities are likely much higher than typically seen carbon taxes and prices. In this paper, we present an empirical assessment of the locational societal benefits of energy storage in a real electricity system that has a significant presence of solar and hydro power generation, and important transmission constraints. The assessment is performed via a linear programming model that is applicable for small scale ESS. Major conflicts were found between energy and emission arbitrage in zones with hydrothermal generation, yet strong synergies in zones with high solar generation. Transmission congestion has a significant impact on this. Energy storage benefits associated with the provision of reserve services are the highest source of societal benefit. Finally, it is shown that a battery system may be an attractive investment from a societal perspective. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Climate change; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Investments; Linear programming; Solar power generation; Centralised; Centralized generation; Damage costs; Electricity system; Electricity-generation; Market arrangements; Renewables; Social cost; Societal benefits; Storage systems; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118212428

In this work, a real case study in Nusa Penida Island, Bali Province, Indonesia, is conducted for studying the optimal sizing and performance assessment of a hybrid diesel-PV-BESS system limited by a Take-or-Pay contract of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The island’s solar irradiance is 5,36 kWh/m2/day and 7 x 1.7 MW diesel power plant stations are currently run for fulfilling the island’s electricity demand. The stations are embedded into an existing 20 kV distribution grid. Using the electricity demand projection of several representative days in a year, HOMER software is utilized in this work for designing and optimizing the size of PV and BESS integrated to the diesel power generators. In this study, the performance of configurations with four different sizes of PV and BESS are assessed using load flow analysis, short circuit analysis and transient stability analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the optimal sizing of the hybrid system consists of 10 MWp PV and 10 MWh BESS with Levelized Cost of Energy of 9.45 cents USD/kWh. It lowers 40% of the current cost. Considering the initial, maintenance, replacement and fuel costs, the net present cost of the optimal configuration is 135,306,800 USD. This study confirms that the renewable energy penetration in remote and rural islands can be increased by optimally utilizing energy storage. © 2021.

Over several years, photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems, in which, during daytime, each PV module generates electricity and forms the absorbing surface of a solar thermal collector with heat generated transferred to air or water for space or water heating applications, where the objective in such systems is to achieve an optimal simultaneous useful electrical and heat output, were designed, constructed and tested. The current study aims to evaluate the thermal performance of a hybrid PVT system by integrating it with an external PCM storage unit. Two similar hybrid PVT systems simultaneously conducted experiments to achieve the desired goal, one integrating with a PCM volume and the other without it, using a water flow rate ranging from (0.72 to 1.2) LPM. Simulations of both systems compared for the extent to which PCM contributes to improving the performance of PVT collectors. Experiments have been conducted on both hybrid PV/T collectors simultaneously under actual weather condition of the city of Kirkuk - Iraq for four months, starting from January until the end of April 2021. The simulation results showed that the addition of the PCM storage unit to the PV/T collector had contributed to increasing the thermal performance of the WPVT collector by twice the thermal performance of the TPVT collector. The result obtained from the present study agrees well with other similar works. © 2021.

Fullerenes form stable covalent and non-covalent complexes with phosphorene depending on their molecular size. A continuum solvation model indicates that complexes are stable in solution, independent of the solvent polarity. Two classes of covalent complexes arise by cycloaddition-like reactions (nanobuds): the first class, where short-range effects (charge-transfer and polarization) determine the stability; the second one, where short-range effects decay to avoid steric repulsion, and long-range forces (electrostatics and dispersion) favors the stability. High-size fullerenes (C50–C70) only form non-covalent complexes as experimentally obtained due to strong repulsion at shorter intermolecular distances and lack of dissociation barriers. Fullerenes also act as mild p-dopants for phosphorene, increasing its polar character and ability to acquire induced dipole moments. Moreover, small energy-bandgap (low-size) fullerenes increase the phosphorene metallic character. Fullerenes also act as active sites for orbital-controlled interactions and maximize the phosphorene light absorbance at the UV–Vis region.

The shift from hydropower to thermal power supply increases the competition for water between agriculture and energy generation, accelerates depletion of fossil energy resources, and increases greenhouse gas emissions. Because of the competition for scarce water between agriculture and energy generation, brackish groundwater irrigation has been explored as an option to cover the water deficit in Central Asia's lift irrigation zones. This study examines the combination of aquifer storage and recovery with drip irrigation to improve brackish groundwater quality in the Karshi Main Canal zone. In this zone, a cascade of sequential pump stations is used to lift water from the transboundary Amudarya River. The method used to evaluate the technology is a pilot-scale field study.

Hybrid energy storage systems including electrical vehicles, fuel cells, redox flow batteries and superconducting magnetic energy storage have been introduced to improve the overall MG frequency dynamic performances in case of renewable energy integration and load disturbances. To improve the interconnected MG tie-lines power control, flexible alternating current transmission systems are added. For an optimal and robust solution, an artificial intelligence strategy is proposed, combining a load frequency control-based cascade Fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative controller with filter (PIDN). In doing so, a recently meta-heuristic algorithm that mimics the social behavior of elephants in nature, named Elephant Herding Optimization, has been employed to optimize the Fuzzy-PIDN controller gains. To show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy, various scenarios are carried out. A comparative study in view of a settling time and peak over/undershoot has been performed. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy gives good performances for MG power management and control under RESs integration and load disturbances scenarios. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","elephant herding optimization; energy storage systems; fuzzy logic; load shedding; microgrid control and management; renewable energy","Artificial intelligence; Controllers; Electric energy storage; Electric frequency control; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission; Electromagnetic wave emission; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Fuzzy filters; Heuristic algorithms; Magnetic storage; Microgrids; Optimization; Power control; Power management; Proportional control systems; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Superconducting magnets; Two term control systems; Flexible alternating current transmission systems; Fuzzy proportional integral derivative controller; Hybrid energy storage systems; Intelligent load shedding; Meta heuristic algorithm; Power management and control; Renewable energy integrations; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Electric load shedding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105036540

Functional groups, heteroatoms and a more accessible hierarchical porous structure would be advantageous for many of these applications. This paper describes the generation of carbonaceous monoliths with hierarchically porous structures and nitrogen functionalities by using a one-pot, simultaneous combination of hydrogel synthesis and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) that involves templating within high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs). A carbon monolith with a density of 0.058 g cm−3, a highly interconnected, bimodal porous structure and an apparent specific surface area (SBET) of 101 m2 g−1 was produced by carbonizing a HTC monolith based on 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) at 450 °C. SBET of 1540 m2 g−1 was produced through subsequent chemical activation with ZnCl2 at 700 °C, but the overall residual mass (Rm) was only 9 wt%. Direct chemical activation of the HTC monolith, on the other hand, generated SBET of 1250 m2 g−1 and an overall Rm of 28 wt%, corresponding to a higher apparent surface area per mass of HTC monolith. Carbon monoliths with N/C ratios of 0.09 and 0.07 were achieved using nitrogen-rich monomers (acrylamide and vinylimidazole, respectively) as compared to the HEMA-based carbon monolith with an N/C ratio of 0.03. This work demonstrates that the hierarchically porous structures and the chemical structures of these highly porous monoliths can be fine-tuned by modifying the HIPE composition and/or the processing conditions. © 2021 Society of Industrial Chemistry. © 2021 Society of Industrial Chemistry.","chemical activation; emulsion templating; hierarchical porosity; hydrothermal carbonization; microporosity","Amides; Carbon; Carbonization; Chlorine compounds; Emulsification; Fuel cells; Hydrogels; Hydrogen storage; Hydrothermal synthesis; Porosity; Porous materials; Thermochemistry; Zinc chloride; 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate; Bimodal Porous Structure; Hierarchical porous structures; Hierarchically porous; High internal phase emulsions; Hydrothermal carbonization; Industrial chemistry; Nitrogen functionalities; Chemical activation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103052699

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to identify phase transitions. High-temperature X-ray diffraction (HTXRD) is used to identify phases and determine their contents and crystallographic parameters. Both alloys are found to contain αH (hcp) and βH (bcc) solid solutions, as well as δa (fcc) and δb (fcc) hydrides after hydrogenation. δa is found to decompose between room temperature and 350 °C to αH (in both alloys) plus either βH and δb (wrought alloy) or δb only (EBM alloy). δb fully decomposes at either 450 °C (wrought alloy) or 600 °C (EBM alloy) to αH plus H2 desorption (which starts at 300 and 350 °C in the wrought and EBM alloys, respectively). In the case of the wrought alloy, βH is also formed in this decomposition reaction due to faster diffusion of hydrogen. The non-continuous, finer needle-like morphology of the β-phase in the as-printed EBM alloy combined with its smaller lattice constants seem to inhibit hydrogen diffusion into the bulk alloy through the β-phase, thus triggering δa dissociation into δb (rather than to βH+δb) and δb decomposition into αH (rather than to αH + βH). Hydrogen incorporation in the αH phase results in its expansion in the c direction in both alloys. HTXRD allows to conclude that both δa and δb hydrides decompose up to 600 °C. Hydrogen peaks measured at higher temperatures are due to hydrogen desorption from the hydride that is decomposed from the sample's bulk and/or hydrogen desorption from βH and/or αH during heating. These findings indicate that the EBM Ti–6Al–4V alloy might be more prone to hydrogen damage at elevated temperatures than its wrought counterpart when both have a similar β-phase content. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Additive manufacturing (AM); Electron beam melting (EBM); High-temperature X-ray diffraction (HTXRD); Titanium hydride; Ti–6Al–4V alloy","3D printers; Activation energy; Desorption; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Lattice constants; Thermolysis; Titanium alloys; Titanium carbide; X ray diffraction; Additive manufacturing; Electron beam melting; Electron-beam melting; High-temperature X-ray diffraction; Melting alloys; Thermal; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Titanium hydride; Wrought alloys; Hydrides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110483999

The households are assumed to be equipped with distributed energy resources (electric vehicle, energy storage system, photovoltaic panel) besides the grid. The model is established to shift major loads and to allow energy exchangeability among the households. The common objective is to minimize the total electricity costs by maximizing local energy usage at the household and neighborhood levels. A noncooperative game-theoretic model, combined with a mixed-integer-programming model, is developed to satisfy the neighbor-hood's economic and energetic needs.

One AM (Li, Na, K) or AEM (Be, Mg, Ca) atom was placed on the 2D-SiGe surface, and several H2 molecules were placed in the vicinity of the adatom. The results demonstrate that the most favorable siligene site for the adsorption of Li, Na, K and Be atoms is the hollow site, while for the Mg and Ca atoms is the down site. The AM atoms are the only ones with considerable binding energies on the SiGe nanosheets. Pristine 2D-SiGe slightly adsorbs one H2 molecule per hollow site and, therefore, it is not suitable for hydrogen storage. In some of the AM- and AEM-decorated 2D-SiGe, several hydrogen molecules can be physisorbed. In particular, the Na-, K- and Ca-functionalized 2D-SiGe can adsorb six hydrogen molecules, whereas Li and Mg atoms adsorbed three hydrogen molecules, and the Be adatom only adsorbed one hydrogen molecule. The complexes formed by hydrogen molecules adsorbed on the analyzed metal decorated 2D-SiGe are energetically stable, indicating that functionalized 2D-SiGe could be an efficient molecular hydrogen storage media. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","2D materials; Alkali metals; DFT; Hydrogen storage; Renewable energy; Siligene","Adatoms; Atoms; Binding energy; Density functional theory; Magnesium; Metals; Molecules; Si-Ge alloys; Silicon; Adsorption of li; Alkali earth metal; Functionalized; High capacity; Hollow sites; Hydrogen molecule; Hydrogen storage capacities; Molecular hydrogen; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096161957

In many cases, the proposed algorithms target binary pre-processed versions of the image, which may cause insufficient results due to poor quality document images. Recently, more papers present solutions that work directly on gray-level images [1,2,7,12,15]. In this paper, we present a novel robust, and efficient algorithm to extract text-lines directly from gray-level document images. The proposed approach uses a combination of two variants of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), followed by minimal energy seam extraction. The first ConvNet is a modified version of the autoencoder used for biomedical image segmentation [8]. The second is a deep convolutional Neural Network, working on overlapping vertical slices of the original image. The two variants are combined to one neural net after re-attaching the resulting slices of the second net. The merged results of the two nets are used as a preprocessed image to obtain an energy map for a second phase. In the second step, we use the algorithm presented in [2], to track minimal energy sub-seams accumulated to perform a full local minimal/maximal separating and medial seam defining the text baselines and the text line regions. We have tested our approach on multi-lingual various datasets written at a range of image quality based on the ICDAR datasets. © 2021 ACM.","convolutional neural networks; historical document image analysis; image processing; line extraction; local projection profile; minimal seams; seam carving; text line extraction","Character recognition; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Digital image storage; Extraction; Image segmentation; Biomedical image segmentation; Document images; Gray level image; Minimal energy; Original images; Text recognition; Text-line extractions; Vertical slices; Deep learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113610367

Two electroreducible oxygen-containing functional groups were identified: quinone and epoxide. Since the nanomaterial was found to be surface-bounded to the electrode, the surface coverage of quinone and epoxide groups was quantified to appraise the effect of synthesis experimental conditions on the relative amounts of the two functionalization groups. The synthesis conditions were investigated in terms of the electrolytic solution composition (ionic strength and pH) and duration of the graphite polarization under galvanostatic polarization. Most appropriate experimental conditions to generate quinone rather than epoxide moieties (Γquin/Γep = 2.5) were found when the nanomaterial was generated in a 3 h-assay using a neutral pH phosphate solution with low ionic strength (I = 0.1).

Yet short driving distances render the country a testbed for a full electric vehicle fleet. Based on EU climate goals, passenger vehicles and buses were considered 100% electric by 2050. Spanning between 2018 and 2050, herein we present the future electricity needs and vehicle fleet size, which currently account for 77% of the island's emissions. In parallel, four distinct scenarios, namely, the Least Cost (LCSc), the Business As Usual (BAU), the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCSc) and the Renewables (RESc) are presented. Weekly hourly profiles of electricity production and consumption were deduced during the winter and summer seasons. Passenger vehicle-to-grid units and desalination plants helped estimate the grid's electrical load. Projections demonstrated that the RESc in 2050 yields the costliest electricity (0.115€/kWh) accompanied by the highest electricity losses (40%). A domestic battery storage of 5,600MWh is required, whereas Europe's current battery capacity is 3,400MWh. In the context of EC's goals, the BAU and LCSc cases fail to meet the 2 °C emissions threshold while the CCSc abides with the preceding target.

The evaluated power plants generate 1000 MW net electricity with 90% CO2 capture rate. As fuels, natural gas was assessed for combined cycle power plants since coal and lignite were assessed for super-critical power plants. As comparison benchmark systems, the correspondent plants with non-capture feature and with carbon capture using reactive gas–liquid absorption were also assessed. As the results show, both calcium and magnesium carbonate looping concepts applied in solid fossil fuel super-critical plants induce lower carbon capture energy penalty compared to the reactive gas–liquid absorption by about 1–2.2 net efficiency percentage points. The Calcium Looping (CaL) cycle shows higher net power efficiency than the Magnesium Looping (MgL) cycle by about 1–1.4 net percentage points. In case of natural gas combined cycle plants, the chemical absorption system has higher net power efficiency than CaL and MgL systems by about 4–6 percentage points.

The carbonyl functional groups and the π-electrons constitute redox centers, which can reversibly interact with divalent ions. This phenomenon was clearly uncovered by combined electrochemistry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction analyses.

Some of the more developed arid countries employ fossil fuel driven desalination plants to meet water demands. While effective, these plants are subject to fuel price fluctuations, and are not environmentally sustainable. The motive of the present project is to enhance the traditional solar still concept as a potential solution for the looming crisis. A solar still purifies saline waters by using solar radiation to produce, condense, and subsequently collect pure water. The primary objective of this project is to speed up a conventional solar still process by harnessing solar energy in nanoparticle-doped desert sand using the Plasmonic Effect. A secondary objective of this research will be to provide a portable, low-cost thermal energy storage system where thermal energy heats the water. This novel approach has proven successful as temperatures of around 400 degrees Celsius temperatures was attained within our heating element. © 2021 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112723115

This variability is considered relevant information for fishery management. In the squid Dosidicus gigas, an important fishery resource, we analyzed adult males (immature vs. mature) and females (immature I vs. immature II) off the coast of Chile. Their bioenergetic fuel (protein, glucose, lipid and fatty acid content-FAs) was quantified in different organs of the body (digestive gland, gonad and mantle). When comparing the organs of males at both stages of maturity, a greater amount of glucose and lipids were observed in the digestive gland than in the gonad and mantle, while a higher protein content was recorded in the gonad. In turn, the same tendency of biochemical variations among the organs was observed for the female at both stages. Regarding the FA profiles of the analyzed organs, the digestive gland had the highest mean proportion of FAs. However, no significant differences were observed related to sex and sexual maturity. According to the multivariate analyses for both sexes and maturity stages, the FA profiles of the mantle and gonad showed overlap and a high similarity, while the profile of the digestive gland was completely dissimilar. Our findings indicate that D. gigas from Chilean coastal waters showed, mainly in the digestive gland, high levels of all biochemical constituents, which are obtained through food and stored in their organs as bioenergetic fuel, and may then be used for the subsequent process of migration and reproduction in oceanic waters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergetic fuel; Cephalopods; Energy storage dynamics; Humboldt current system; Organs; Sexual maturity","Cephalopoda; Dosidicus gigas; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108897588

The solar energy system proposed for analysis has provided the back-up energy through two types of state-of-the-art energy storage technologies: (a) Tesla batteries and (b) hydrogen vector energy, obtained electrolytically on-site. Starting from the main imposed condition that all the building's electric energy demand be provided by the solar resource, sustainable technical solutions for renewable energy storage are of crucial importance for the successful implementation of power systems based on clean solar energy. New solar energy storage technologies are imperative for the superior harnessing of solar resources at the production site, whether it is short-term energy storage such as Tesla batteries or long-term energy storage such as hydrogen energy vector. The main objective of this work is to assess the feasibility of the proposed grid-independent energy system, which is pairing solar power to sustainable energy storage technologies within an existing residential building with conventional electric energy demand. This study aims to evaluate the optimal sizing of the solar units implemented in the design along with the optimal back-up energy storage capacities to fulfil the building's daily electricity demand in an uninterrupted mode. This article investigates the possibility of supplying 100% solar power to the existing residential building with conventional electric energy demand under constraints and limitations conditions due to the stochastic nature of building electricity consumption, volatile and intermittent nature of solar resources, local meteorological conditions specific to the building's placement and space limitations for the positioning of the photovoltaic panels. The average daily load that has been calculated for the building has a value of 6.50 kWh. To reach the proposed target of integral solar power supply, photovoltaic panels with an installed power of 7.84 kWp paired with a Tesla batteries bank with a storage capacity of 7.4 kWh are needed, and in the case of storing solar energy in the form of electrolytic hydrogen it is necessary to pair the photovoltaic panels with an installed power of 15.12 kWp, 3 kW electrolyser, 2 kW fuel cell and H2 tank of 7 kg. The annual energy demand of 2369 kWh is achieved of 43.27% directly from photovoltaic panels and 56.73% through the back-up energy in case of pairing the batteries as an energy storage medium, and in case of pairing hydrogen as an energy vector, 41.53% is powered directly by photovoltaic panels and 58.46% comes from the energy reserve stored through hydrogen technologies. The environmental analysis highlights an average decrease of up to 85% in carbon dioxide emissions generated by the implementation of clean energy systems analysed compared to the grid electricity. Also, the results of this study show that the investment costs in photovoltaic panels and storage systems are still high, limiting their use in residential buildings, but we are witnessing technological developments to improve the performance and durability of these electricity storage solutions at low costs, which will allow them to be marketed on a large scale, particularly widespread for residential applications. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","back-up energy; battery; electrolytic hydrogen; green energy system; hydrogen energy vector; residential building with conventional electric energy demand; solar energy; solar power storage; sustainable energy storage technologies","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Energy management; Fuel cells; Fuel tanks; Global warming; Housing; Hydrogen storage; Microgrids; Photovoltaic cells; Solar buildings; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Stochastic systems; Carbon dioxide emissions; Electricity-consumption; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage technologies; Existing residential buildings; Meteorological condition; Renewable energy storages; Technological development; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108291267

There are some existing strategies and technologies for health and high performance buildings; however, applications to other types of buildings come at large energy penalty: cost; design, regulations and standards changes, and varied public perception. In the present work, different factors and strategies are reviewed and discussed and suggested mitigations and solutions are provided including the required air flowrates with the presence of infectors with and without mask and disinfection techniques including ultraviolet (UV) light. Experimental and numerical research in open literature suggests that the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficiently likely. However, in situ detailed experimental studies are still needed to understand the different scenarios of the virus spread. Displacement ventilation, underfloor air distribution, chilled beams, radiant ceiling panels, and laminar flow systems have varied effectiveness. High-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters and UV light can clean viruses but at high energy cost. Suggested solutions to reduce the infection probability include recommended levels of ventilation and a combination of virus sampling technologies including cyclones, liquid impinger, filters, electrostatic precipitators, and water-based condensation. © 2020 by ASME.","Air emissions from fossil fuel combustion; Airborne transmission; COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2; Cyclones; Energy conversion/systems; Energy systems analysis; Fresh air rate; Heat energy generation/storage/transfer; HVAC systems; UV light; Virus samplers","Diseases; Electrostatic precipitators; Laminar flow; Ventilation; Viruses; Airborne transmission; Displacement ventilation; Energy perspectives; High performance buildings; Laminar flow systems; Numerical research; Ultraviolet lights; Underfloor air distributions; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107857873

The ORR was investigated in aqueous H2SO4 solution and micellar medium of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at glassy carbon and platinum electrodes using cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric techniques. The ORR studied in both media was found to be an irreversible, diffusion-controlled process. The diffusion coefficient (Do2) and the saturation concentration of O2 (Co2) were determined by studying the ORR with chronoamperometry and steady-state voltammetry. The Do2 was found to be lower in micellar system compared to the aqueous solution, whereas the Co2 determined in 0.200 M micellar medium of SDS was about 15-fold higher than that of H2SO4 solution. The characteristics of the ORR studied and the values of Do2 and Co2 determined in micellar media were verified by simulation software for cyclic voltammetry. Higher solubility of O2 is revealed in the hydrophobic micro-domains of micelles that behave as a nest for the residence of O2 and may serve as a high-density, slow-releasing warehouse of molecular O2. This study opens a noble route for designing molecular shuttles assisting O2 to maintain its flow in a system containing O2 permeable membranes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Diffusion coefficient; Micellar medium; Oxygen reduction reaction; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Solubility of oxygen","Carbon dioxide; Chronoamperometry; Computer software; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrolytic reduction; Glass membrane electrodes; Light scattering; Micelles; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Solubility; Sulfur compounds; Electrochemical energy; Electrochemical studies; Energy generations; Generation systems; Micellar medium; Oxygen reduction reaction; Reduction reaction; Sodium dodecyl sulphate; Solubility of oxygen; Storage systems; Diffusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106909075

The priorities set concentrate on decarbonizing the energy sector, mainly by promoting renewables. At the same time, it is of great importance to effectively manage the energy generated in-situ within a community. That community can be approached as a micro-grid able either to be connected to the main grid or to be independent. In addition to this, storage of electricity seems the unavoidable solution for the effective energy management with the micro-grid. Due to the technological developments and the reduction in production costs that are expected to decrease even further in the coming years (50% reduction), batteries are a crucial factor for the effective integration of renewables on a residential scale. Thereafter, the proper size of a battery system plays an important role for the total minimization of system's cost during its lifetime. The purpose of the paper is to present a mathematical tool, able to manage the energy produced by residential photovoltaic panels, the energy stored in the batteries and the energy purchased from the main grid. Continuing with the energy management, the framework should come up with an optimized life cycle cost solution, regarding both the energy management within the grid and the optimum size of energy battery system. Main findings of the paper indicate that storage is a feasible option, whenever selling electricity to the main grid is not applicable, as for that case the battery capital cost should decrease to 400 (€/kWh); this is a 20% cost reduction compared to current prices and 30 (€/kWh). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Batteries; Dimensioning; Life cycle cost; Micro-grid; Optimization; Photovoltaic panels","Battery storage; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Electric batteries; Energy policy; Global warming; Housing; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; % reductions; 'current; Battery systems; Dimensioning; Energy; Life-cycle cost optimisation; Micro grid; Optimisations; Photovoltaic panels; Residential photovoltaic; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105887753

The control mode of power converters interfacing battery energy storage systems to the grid can be based on grid-forming type structures given its superior performance with respect to the mitigation of network frequency disturbances. Nevertheless, in case of network faults, the interactions between existing synchronous units and the grid-forming type converters may adversely affect the global system behavior. Therefore, this paper addresses the study-case of a MW-scale isolated power system with large shares of converter-interfaced renewable generation, operating with both synchronous machines and a grid-forming type power converter. An optimal grid-forming control parameter tuning procedure considering different disturbances is presented, aiming to reduce the associated battery energy storage system power regulating effort following the disturbances. Moreover, it is proposed and discussed the need of a novel rule-based adaptive control solution to switch between different sets of control parameters used in grid-forming type converters depending on the network status following a fault-type disturbance. Extensive numerical simulations performed over different operating scenarios illustrate the performance of the proposed solution. © 2021","Grid-forming inverter; Islanded power systems; Self-adaptive control; Transient stability; Virtual synchronous machine","Adaptive control systems; Battery storage; Control system stability; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Frequency stability; Renewable energy resources; Uninterruptible power systems; Battery energy storage systems; Control parameters; Grid-forming inverte; Islanded power systems; Isolated power system; Performance; Power; Rule based; Self adaptive control; Virtual synchronoi machine; Synchronous machinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105878165

Gold/water nanofluids were prepared using citrate (CIT) reduction, then coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) by physical/chemical ligand adsorption. All nanofluids retained their monodispersity and extinction efficiency after ambient storage for three years. These long-term aged nanofluids were then subjected to accelerated indoor tests that mimic the prolonged and cyclic exposure to both full-spectrum and specific-band radiation. This included continuous exposure to broadband solar radiation at various intensities and focused near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation for different durations, as well as cyclic exposure (in irradiation/darkening periods) to both solar and NUV radiation. Assessment of post-test stability has been realized using complementary characterization techniques. Results showed that stability was variable to the coating type, radiation exposure mode, and radiation spectrum. Subtle physicochemical transitions in the polymeric coatings, even in the absence of ligand desorption and particle clustering, were shown to alter the optical properties and wettability of the nanofluids. While the gold cores remained intact, some photoinduced instabilities occurred in the adsorbed polymeric coatings, including chain scission of PEG, conformational collapse of PVP, and partial denaturation of BSA. Largely attributed to the strong polymer-Au interactions and high surface grafting densities, and despite their coating transformations, AuNPs maintained a high level of photostability. This work marks important progress towards realizing photothermally superior, yet colloidally stable, solar nanofluids compatible with a wide range of direct-absorption photothermal applications in the water and energy sectors. © 2021","Direct absorption solar collector; Gold nanoparticle; Nanofluid; Photostability; Photothermal conversion; Ultraviolet radiation","Fiber optic sensors; Gold nanoparticles; Grafting (chemical); Ligands; Mammals; Metal nanoparticles; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Plasmonics; Sols; Ultraviolet radiation; Water absorption; Bovine serum albumins; Cyclic exposures; Direct absorption; Direct absorption solar collector; Gold nano-particles; Gold nanoparticle; Nanofluids; Photo-stability; Photo-thermal conversions; Polyvinyl pyrrolidone; Nanofluidics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104810320

In comparison to all other energy sources, fossil fuels account for the majority of electricity production in this country. Due to lack of smart distribution of energy, the country unable to meets the demand of electricity. Therefore, this research has been taken virtual power plant (VPP) as a solution to develop smart energy distribution system in the country. Basically, VPP can be termed as a combination of distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems, regulated loads etc., which operated by an energy management system (EMS) in order to control the distributed generation, and improve its exposure in the power markets. Right now, VPP has widely contributing in European and American energy markets, but Bangladesh has yet to introduce it as a new technology for more efficient energy delivery. Due to the shortage of resources, it requires a comprehensive study to investigate the implementation strategy of such kind of technology in perspective of Bangladesh. The main consideration of this work is cost reduction and reliability enhancement of energy delivery. For the case study of Bangladesh, a VPP model is designed for a university campus named IIUC campus, and the developed system is capable of sharing power to the grid. The whole system is controlled by control coordination center (CCC) which is developed by using a logic algorithm. The VPP design and simulations are carried out by using MATLAB -SIMULINK 2016a environment. Finally, the techno-economic analysis is done to compare its effectiveness with respective to the existing system. Results show that the designed VPP-based energy management system reduces about 53% cost with respect to the existing energy distribution system.

CO oxidation efficiency during TWC can be significantly improved by adding CeO2-active support known for its oxygen storage capacity (OSC). In this work, the CO oxidation mechanism of Rh nanoparticles on CeO2(111) and CeO2(110) was studied with the focus on oxygen exchange between catalytic particles and active support. This exchange is analyzed utilizing isotopically labeled 18O. We prepared ∼20 Å oriented CeO2 layer by evaporation on Rh(111) and Rh(110) single crystals followed by Rh deposition of 10-20 nm particles. These model catalysts are studied by means of TDS, MB adsorption, TPR, AFM, LEED, and XPS. The reaction achieves higher performance on Rh/CeO2(110). It is explained by the slightly weaker CO-Rh bond and the higher oxygen exchange activity. CO desorption energies at zero coverage are 2.39(7) × 10-19 J for Rh/CeO2(111) and 2.28(7) × 10-19 J for Rh/CeO2(110). We observed the diffusion of oxygen from molecular beams into the CeO2 support and measured a contribution of CeO2 oxygen to the reaction. During low-pressure reaction cycles with temperature range 300-770 K, the produced CO2 contains 53% of oxygen from the support for Rh/CeO2(111) and 70% for Rh/CeO2(110). © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Cerium oxide; Molecular beams; Oxidation; Catalytic particles; Desorption energy; Diffusion of oxygens; Isotopically labeled; Oxygen storage capacity; Rh nanoparticles; Temperature range; Three-way catalysis; Molecular oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111597241

There is a worldwide interest in hydrogen (H2) and its incorporation into legal systems. In Mexico there are large legal gaps that question the legality of H2, because it is not recognized in a federal law and is only considered in technical standards of voluntary application. Also, Mexico has forest, agricultural, and livestock waste that, if properly used, can cover the energy demand of communities. The main findings of this study refer to the fact that, according to international standards for the management of H2 and taking into account the regulatory limitations in Mexico, it is possible to promote, an Official Mexican Standard exclusively aimed at establishing the minimum requirements for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of H2 storage, considering the areas of the opportunity offered by foreign experiences, according to the Mexican context. It is concluded that the parameters of legality exist in the instruments of environmental policy, to support the existence of an Official Mexican Standard of H2. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Environmental policy instruments; Hydrogen; Legality; Official mexican standard","Agriculture; Decarbonization; Environmental protection; Laws and legislation; Standardization; Decarbonisation; Environmental policy; Environmental policy instrument; Federal law; Legal system; Legality; Me-xico; Official mexican standard; Technical standards; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101956713

Gajah Mada No. 8, Central, Jakarta, 10120, Indonesia","Rare earth metals are elements (REE) of lanthanides metal which are mostly made use in industrial and medical fields. Smelting process of tin or zircon will produce TENORM (Technologically enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material) materials, such as monazite, zircon, and ilmenite. The TENORM minerals will contain rare earth metals. There are many smelting industries of tin or zircon in Indonesia. Therefore, they show a high potency of rare earth metals in this country. BAPETEN Chairman's Regulation (BCR) No. 16 Year 2013 (BCR No. 16/2013) [1], concerning Radiation Safety of Storage of TENORM, allows TENORM producers to take out the metal or non-metal minerals in the TENORM materials after they get a technical recommendation from BAPETEN. This paper aims to provide a consideration concerning the criterion to gain a technical recommendation. This paper organized and reviewed BCR No. 16/2013 and compared it to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) safety standard. Rare earth minerals are always present together with other elements, including radionuclides from U or Th series. REE minerals from Bangka Island contain monazite and xenotime, radioactive elements like Th which detected at 6-7 % in monazite and less than 2 % in xenotime, respectively. While safety report series of IAEA states that content of rare earth ore consists of 5-6 % REEs and 0.04 % Th oxide (or 4.7 % REEs and 0.035 % Th). The TENORM material utilization as regulated on BCR 16/2013 is the same with conditional clearance terminology for radioactive materials. Trivial dose approach that is a conditional clearance can be considered as a technical recommendation criterion. This is because it does not need radiation protection pre-requisites after getting the technical recommendation. The upper level of trivial individual effective dose is equivalent to 100 μSv per year. The dose assessment should consider the exposure pathways to the non-radiation workers (public), specifically those who get involved in external and internal exposure. © 2021 Author(s).","effective dose; rare earth; TENORM materials",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112078515

An overloaded sensor can harm the data integrity, or even completely reject incoming messages. The problem gets even worse when data should be received from many nodes, as missing data becomes a more common phenomenon as deployed WSNs grow in scale. As a solution, we consider the Backup Placement problem in networks in the network management distributed setting: Given a network graph G = (V,E), the goal of each vertex v Element V is selecting a neighbor, such that the maximum number of vertices in V that select the same vertex is minimized. In cases of an overflow, our Distributed Adaptive Clustering algorithm (D-ACR) reconfigures the network, by adaptively and hierarchically re-clustering parts of it, based on the rate of incoming data packages in order to minimize the energy-consumption, and prevent premature death of nodes. In the network management setting of a grid, we proved that a backup placement of load at most O(1) can be maintained within O(log2 n) update time, and an O(n log2 n) energy consumption using the constructed ACR tree. © 2021 IEEE.","Backup placement; Network management distributed setting; Wsns","Clustering algorithms; Flash memory; Graph theory; Network management; Random access storage; Sensor nodes; Backup placement; Data integrity; Data sampling; Energy-consumption; In networks; Missing data; Network management distributed setting; Networks management; Placement problems; Wsns; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116864577

Besides the energy cost, water utilities worldwide are also facing with the water loss problem. More water loss occurring in WDSs will require pumps to work much more to supply extra flows and pressures for compensating the water loss amount. As a result, clean water is wasted and at the same time more energy cost is expensed without any benefit for water utilities. For this reason, optimizing operations of pump stations for minimizing only the energy cost by taking advantage of electrical tariff structure is indeed inadequate since the water loss cost may be higher than the energy cost. To be capable of practical implementation and preserve clean water resources, operational optimization of WDSs should take both energy cost and water loss cost into account for deducing optimal pump scheduling. This paper investigated the potential application of variable speed pumps (VSPs) for decreasing both energy cost and water leakage cost for operations of WDSs with storage tanks. The comparisons of the uses of VSPs and fixed speed pumps (FSPs) for many scenarios are also carried out demonstrating that the application of VSPs outperforms the use of FSPs in decrease of the total cost of energy and water loss. © 2021 IEEE.","Energy cost; optimal pump scheduling; Optimization; Water distribution systems; water loss","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Leakage (fluid); Operating costs; Pumps; Scheduling; Water resources; Clean water resources; Cost of energies; Operational optimization; Pump scheduling; Tariff structures; Variable-speed pumps; Water distribution system (WDSs); Water utility; Water distribution systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115068620

However, inherent problems are encountered during their operation. The process of acceleration of a motor-pump unit from standstill to rated speed provokes shock loading both for the unit's parts and for the electric power system. After switching on the motor-pump unit is loaded at fool load, which is practically not controllable during the operation, i.e. the motor is responsive neither to the changes in frequency nor to the occurrence of congestions and contingencies. In order to avoid these deficiencies, special devices are required. This paper describes a new approach for mitigation of the start-up process and increasing efficiency, reliability and responsibility of ternary pump storage units. The essence of the suggestion is a complementary, third sleeve added to known hydraulic scheme of a pump storage power plant. This third sleeve is a conduit comprising a spherical valve and one or a set of ejectors installed into the suction tube between the pump impeller and the shut-off valve/gate of the suction conduit.

In that sense, it is important to evaluate the degradation kinetics of these components, in order to establish the stability under different processing and/or storage conditions. This study provides experimental and simulated results about the degradation of betalains in microencapsulated beetroot juice. Maltodextrin solution (MDX 10%) and sweet potato starch solution (SPS 2%) in proportions of 40MDX:60SPS, 20MDX:80SPS and 0MDX:100SPS were used as microencapsulating agents. The thermal degradation of betalains in the microencapsulated powders was evaluated at three temperatures (6, 19 and 30 °C) in order to predict the behavior under different conditions, using the first-order kinetic model. The kinetic parameters were identified using linear regression on the logarithmic curves of the experimental data to obtain the Arrhenius equations. The highest content of betalains was 2.58 mg/g and the lowest activation energy value was 48.71 KJ/mol, with both values corresponding to the powder that was microencapsulated with 20MDX:80SPS. The above results suggest high betalain stability in this powder, since there was less sensitivity to temperature in comparison to the rest of the powders. Additionally, some thermodynamic parameters were evaluated, which confirmed that the process is non-spontaneous and irreversible. The results obtained from this study, could be a useful tool to predict the minimal losses during processing, and gives the possibility to improve and select the food products where this kind of natural colorant can be applied. © 2021 Universidad Nacional de Trujillo.

A comparison between manual and semi-automated segmentation was conducted. Further, abdominal VAT and SAT sex-based comparison in healthy Arab adults was piloted. Meth-ods: A cross-sectional design was followed to recruit subjects. Abdominal VAT and SAT were determined on T2-weighted MRI manually and semi-automatically. Body composition was assessed using a BIA machine. Statistical differences between the abdominal VAT areas defined by BIA, manual, and semi-automated MRI were compared. Correlation between all methods was assessed, and statistical differences between sex abdominal VAT/SAT defined areas were compared. Results: A total of 165 abdominal T2-weighted MR images taken for 55 overweight/obese adult subjects were analyzed Differences between manual and semi-automated MRI-ob-tained abdominal VAT and SAT were found statistically significant (P<0.001) for all subjects. Mean abdominal VAT using the BIA technique was found to correlate significantly with manually and semi-automated T2-weighted MRI defined VAT (r=0.7436; P<0.001 and r=0.8275; P<0.001, respectively). Abdominal VAT was significantly (P<0.001) different between male and female subjects accumulating at different abdominal lev-els. Conclusion: Semi-automatic segmentation showed a stronger significant correlation with BIA compared to manual segmentation, implying a more reliable quantification of abdominal VAT/SAT. A Segmental multi-fre-quency BIA machine may display an initial estimation for the visceral adiposity in obese subjects that warrants further confirmation by MRI or other accurate techniques.

Improved mobility control of CO2 is needed to accelerate and improve the value-creation from subsurface CO2 projects, both in terms of energy produced and volumes of CO2 stored. Field-proven conformance and mobility control techniques, such as foam, provide a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to overcome geological and process constraints observed with CO2 flow in reservoirs. In this laboratory study, we have investigated CO2 mobility control by foam in sandstone core samples at typical North Sea reservoir conditions, 220 barg and 100°C, respectively. Two important aspects related to any field application of foam have been evaluated and discussed: I) Can strong CO2-foams be generated at reservoir conditions using AOS surfactant? If not, II) can relatively simple modifications to the foam system be made to improve foam properties and CO2 mobility control? Our results show that only high-mobility CO2-foams with low degree of CO2 mobility reduction are obtained at 220 barg and 100°C. An easy way to improve the foam properties at reservoir conditions is suggested by changing the gas-phase in foam to nitrogen (N2). The N2-foams display improved foam generation performance, larger mobility control in terms of mobility reduction factors (MRF) and ability to block subsequent CO2 injection. An alternative strategy for applying foam for CO2 conformance and mobility control in subsurface CO2 projects, which emerges from this study, is to initiate the foam treatment with nitrogen followed by subsequent CO2 injection to change the main direction of CO2 flow to enhance the displacement area or reduce uncontrolled CO2 production between the injecting and producing wells (as illustrated in the graphical abstract). The possible mechanisms explaining the observed differences in foam properties using CO2 versus N2, including implications that could be helpful for future studies and CO2 field applications are discussed further in more detail. The efficiency and limitations of miscible CO2 flooding to recover oil and simultaneously store CO2 after extensive water flooding are also demonstrated in this article, which are relevant to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and subsequent CO2 storage applications, known as the Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS). © 2021","CO2 EOR; CO2 mobility control; CO2 storage; CO2-foam vs. N2-foam; Reservoir conditions","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Enhanced recovery; Floods; Injection (oil wells); Magnetorheological fluids; Nitrogen; Offshore gas fields; Oil well flooding; Porous materials; Secondary recovery; Enhanced oil recovery; High Pressure and High Temperature conditions; Laboratory studies; Mobility reduction; Possible mechanisms; Process constraints; Reservoir conditions; Simple modifications; Foam control; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; element mobility; enhanced oil recovery; foam; high pressure; high temperature; reservoir rock; sandstone; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109201763

Factors considered were compressor (single/variable speed, SS/VS), ambient temperature (21.1/32.2 °C), food load (22.5/39 kg), doors (closed/opening cycles), and fixed/movable samples (simulating breakfast use). APIT(t) based on 48 h temperature-dependent Listeria monocytogenes exponential growth ranged 0.23–0.36 log CFU/g at 32.2 °C/VS for all sample types and loads. The API value at the recommended 5 °C for ham (API5 °C, 0.155 log CFU/g) defined RPI = APIT(t)/API5 °C with values &lt;1, ~1, &gt;1 indicating a better, similar or worse preservation than constant 5 °C storage. The highest RPI value (2.32) was observed for VS/32.2 °C/high load/movable samples; however, it reached 1.10 when the entire ham temperature profile was lowered by 3.7 °C, the maximum possible without risking product freezing. A probabilistic analysis considering the variability of predictive microbiology parameters and temperature measurements, yielded high 95% percentile RPI values for all conditions. Although the SS compressor showed better RPIs, operating strategies for all compressor types should be modified to ensure lower-temperatures and shorter temperature recovery times while still meeting energy use regulations. The higher energy efficiency and multiple adjustments possible of VS compressors suggest that they should deliver better food preservation than SS compressors.

The results show that TiBn ((Formula presented.)) clusters possess the ability to storage up to four H2 molecules, reaching a mass fraction of 6.12%. Further, the hydrogen release temperature is analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations with a variable temperature. It turns out that the TiB7 and TiB9 clusters release the H2 molecules at T ≲ 700 K, while TiB8 requires higher temperature due to stronger interactions with the H2 molecules, confirmed by the electronic density of states. The size-dependent properties and odd–even nuclearity on the clusters can be useful for applications with controlled temperature.

Most of the current approaches only consider some of these models, then the complete modelling is uncommon, leading to simplified system representations. As a solution, this paper presents a three-stage approach to easily integrate the generation and storage system models into the dq0 control algorithm of a voltage source converter (VSC), useful in microgrid studies. The considered DERs, correspond to battery energy storage system (BESS), wind generation and photovoltaic (PV) generation systems; then, the model influence and the variation of the primary energy source modify the control references. This approach allows an appropriate balance between model accuracy and simplicity of steady-state and dynamic equivalent models for converter integrated DER (CIDER).

Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were adopted for the current systematic review, including studies having evaluated body fat with bioelectrical impedance analysis, air displacement plethysmography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or magnetic resonance imaging. Results: A total of 31 studies was included. The balance of evidence suggests that small for gestation infants have decreased fat mass at birth; postnatally they experience increased adiposity. In the long term, however, the evidence is inconclusive, since some studies suggest that foetal-restricted children with increased catch-up growth are at increased risk of fat accumulation, whereas other studies suggest a neutral or even negative association. Large for gestation infants have increased fat mass at birth, but in the long term, they have a lower body fat ratio, especially when they develop a catch-down growth. Conclusion: Some studies suggested that foetal-restricted children with increased catch-up growth are at increased risk of later adiposity, while other studies suggested a neutral or negative association. Given that the evidence is inconclusive, further studies are warranted. Large for gestation subjects have lower body fat when they develop catch-down growth. © 2021 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) can prove to be a technically and economically feasible alternative to a grid reinforcement. This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of a BESS used to maintain the voltage level in a low-voltage network with periodically large voltage drops. The Backward/ Forward Sweep (BFS) algorithm is used to perform a power flow analysis in a rural distribution grid supplying a cabin field in Norway. The grid-connected BESS has an operating strategy so that voltage deviations in the grid larger than a preset limit are avoided. The BESS also operates efficiently to lower the installed capacity. The costs of installing a BESS to satisfy the operating requirements were found to be 77 % higher than the corresponding line costs. Another important finding is how sensitive the BESS installation is to small changes in the system and that it depends heavily on the time perspective, while these factors barely affect the grid installation. © 2021 IEEE.","AC power flow analysis; backward/ forward sweep algorithm; battery energy storage system; low-voltage grid; peak shaving; voltage deviation","Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Reinforcement; Battery energy storage systems; Feasible alternatives; Low voltage network; Operating requirements; Operating strategy; Power flow analysis; Rural distributions; Techno-Economic analysis; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112395926

The unavoidable transition of passive DNs toward smart grids calls for fast-deployment of cost-effective flexible options, both grid controllable assets (e.g. on-load tap changer transformers) and DER (e.g. DG, storage batteries and flexible loads), to enable distribution system operators (DSOs) in maintaining reliable operation. To this end, this paper proposes a novel centralized stochastic multi-period AC optimal power flow (S-MPOPF) model allowing DSOs to procure at minimum cost from DER ancillary services for voltage control and congestion relief in medium voltage DNs. The main novelty lies on the joint optimization of a comprehensive set of flexible options. The full-flexibility options model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem while some combinations of flexible options lead to simpler NLP problems. Furthermore, a meaningful approximation of MINLP problem as an NLP is explored. The results obtained for the optimal operation of a modified 34-bus benchmark DN on 24 hours demonstrate the relative effectiveness of various flexible options as well as that off-the-shelf MINLP and NLP solvers require generally low computation effort. © 2021 IEEE.","distribution networks; flexibility; multi-period optimal power flow; stochastic optimization; uncertainty","Acoustic generators; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric load flow; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Integer programming; Internet protocols; Nonlinear programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Voltage control; Ac optimal power flows; Distributed energy resource; Distribution systems; Joint optimization; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; On-load tap changer transformers; Reliable operation; Renewable distributed generations; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112384143

The purpose is to map out potential wind parks and their integration using a hydro scheduling operations model. First, the properties of the measured wind speed series are studied, using standard conversion characteristics, and then potential wind parks are postulated and integrated into the electricity generation.In many respects the Icelandic system is a perfect match for wind generation. It has large hydro energy storage in reservoirs which can be used as backup generation, when the wind is not blowing. The interaction of wind and hydro calls for studying the load serving capability of the wind generation. This leads to calculating a capacity metric for the wind parks.

The goal of the paper is to evaluate whether and under which conditions ESSs are effective in reducing these frequency deviations. With this aim, the paper first discusses a dynamic market model with inclusion of ESSs. Then, it provides a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the ESS control parameters based on time domain simulations. Results indicate that ESSs can significantly reduce the long-term frequency deviations. However, the capacities of the ESSs as well as the deadband and droop coefficient of the ESS controllers have to be carefully designed to avoid the outbreak of unexpected dynamic behaviors. © 2021 IEEE.","automatic generation control; energy storage systems; Power system dynamic performance; real-time electricity market","Commerce; Control system analysis; Electric energy storage; Sensitivity analysis; Time domain analysis; Control parameters; Dynamic behaviors; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Frequency deviation; Power system dynamic performance; Power system frequencies; Time-domain simulations; Real time systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112366018

The performance of the proposed energy harvesting element is analyzed for its applicability to charge a supercapacitor (SC). Two possible power management systems are studied and recommendation for using is given based on the charging rate. It is found that the combination of quantum dots with lead-free perovskites expands the absorption in the visible spectrum below 500 nm, which improves the spectral sensitivity of the cell and stabilizes its response at white light. It is found that the power processing system with discrete components exhibits maximum charging rate of 1.2 mV/min, vs. 53 μV/min obtained with monolithic DC-DC convertor, which results in faster reaching the full capacity of the SC for less than 5 hours (the typical charging time of the selected storage element). The temperature instability of the output electrical power during this time is 1.8 %/°C at maximum light intensity of 10 000 cd/m2.

In this work, we tested the adsorption of H2 on a pristine (001) graphite surface, being 1.71 eV the minimum energy required. The addition of nickel to the graphite surface was tested on three different configurations, being the center of the hexagonal-graphite ring the most favorable site with a ΔE = −2.47 eV. The adsorption of H2 molecules on Ni atoms was also tested on three configurations: Ni on a C atom, on a C vacancy and on the center of the C-ring, being the first configuration the most favorable geometry for the adsorption of up to two H2 molecules.

Thus resulting kinetic parameters should correspond with kinetic parameters valid in storage temperature range from 10^{\circ}\mathrm{C} to 30^{\circ}\mathrm{C} enabling to make reliable models of stabilizer depletion during storage. AKA-II shows very low order of reaction and high activation energy leading to considerably long shelf life but harsh stabilizer depletion when the end of shelf life is nearing. Propellants stabilized by DPA shows common values of kinetic parameters and pretty predictable primary stabilizer depletion. EC shows very low reactivity and thus very long shelf life.

The cohesive energy indicates that interaction between AM (TM) atoms and germanene is strong. The values of the adsorption energies of H2 molecules on the AM or TM atoms are in the range physisorption. The K-decorated germanene has the largest storage capacity, being able to bind up to six H2 molecules, whereas the Au and Na atoms adsorbed five and four H2 molecules, respectively. Li and Ag atoms can bind a maximum of three H2 molecules, while Cu-decorated germanene only adsorbed one H2 molecule. Formation energies show that all the studied cases of H2 molecules adsorbed on AM and TM atom-decorated germanene are energetically favorable.

The results show that the favourable position for all adsorbed metal atoms is above a Si atom. These metal atoms are chemisorbed to the SiC-ML, except for Mg which is physisorbed. The adsorbed atoms act in turn as adsorption sites for H2 molecules. The single-sided K-functionalized SiC-ML can store up to six H2 molecules. For double-side K-decorated SiC-ML, up to ten H2 molecules can be captured. In all cases, the H2 molecules are physisorbed. This is beneficial because the breaking of chemical bonds, which otherwise would be needed to make use of the stored H2, is energetically expensive. These results find decorated SiC-ML as a promising material for hydrogen storage systems. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","2D monolayers; Adsorption energy; DFT; Hydrogen storage; Silicon carbide","Alkaline earth metals; Alkalinity; Atoms; Bond strength (chemical); Density functional theory; Gas adsorption; Magnesium printing plates; Molecules; Monolayers; Silicon carbide; Adsorption energies; Adsorption site; Alkaline earth metal atoms; First-principles study; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage system; Theoretical density; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082754783

The largest category of feet for active individuals with a transtibial amputation is energy storage and return (ESR) feet. These feet are typically constructed of carbon fiber composite materials. Recently, a prosthetic foot composed of a fiberglass composite has emerged in the market. However, there are no comparative studies of these devices. OBJECTIVES: Compare the biomechanical performance and prosthesis-related quality of life when using a fiberglass prosthetic foot design compared with traditional carbon fiber ESR designs. STUDY DESIGN: This is a repeated-measures randomized cross-over trial. METHODS: Gait analysis was performed on 10 experienced male subjects with unilateral transtibial amputations (K-level III) while walking on level ground and a ramp. Patient-reported outcomes were collected using the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire. RESULTS: Gait data demonstrated increased ankle dorsiflexion (P < .01), similar ankle moments (P = .07), and increased ankle power generation (P = .01) when using the fiberglass foot. The increased power generation occurred at the correct time in the gait cycle such that the timing and magnitude of peak knee flexion was unaffected (P > .19). The fiberglass foot had greater energy absorption during gait (P = .01) with no difference in energy return (P = .37). The subjects expressed improved prosthesis-related quality of life with the fiberglass foot (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that the new ESR foot comprising a fiberglass material had better performance than traditional designs using a carbon fiber material.

Three molar ratios for acetate/Fe3+ were evaluated (2/16, 3.4/27 and 6.9/55 mM). The percentages of Fe3+ reduction were in a range of 80–90, 60–70 and 40–50% for the MFCs at closed circuit for the molar ratios of 2/16, 3.4/27 and 6.9/55 mM, respectively. Acetate consumption was in a range of 80–90% in all cases. The results obtained at closed circuit for current density were: 11.37 mA/m2, 4.5 mA/m2 and 7.37 mA/m2 for the molar ratios of 2/16, 3.4/27 and 6.9/55 mM, respectively. Some microorganisms that were isolated and identified in the MFCs were Azospira oryzae, Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, Enterobacter bugandensis 247BMC, Citrobacter freundii ATCC8090 and Citrobacter murliniae CDC2970-59, these bacteria have been reported as exoelectrogens in MFC and in MFC involving metals removal but not all of them have been reported to utilize acetate as preferred substrate. The results demonstrate that the isolates can utilize acetate as the sole source of carbon and suggest that Fe3+ reduction was carried out by a combination of different mechanisms (direct contact and redox mediators) utilized by the bacteria identified in the MFC. Storage of the energy generated from the 2/16 mM MFC system arranged in a series of three demonstrated that it is possible to utilize the energy to charge a battery.

The overall goals of the program are to minimize energy consumption of industrial tomato drying while ensuring high product quality and to give small businesses access to low-cost dryers. The drying time of tomatoes and the drying air properties are calculated from experimentally obtained drying kinetics and then used as inputs for the TRNSYS thermodynamic model of the complete solar dryer system. The latter recycles the air leaving the drying chamber and adjusts its humidity by mixing it with the right proportion of ambient air. The temperature of the air is then adjusted to the desired value through an air–water heat exchanger. The water loop includes solar water collector, a storage tank, a heat exchanger and two pumps. The TRNSYS model allowed the dimensioning, optimization and dynamic simulation of the entire system including the solar collector, the storage reservoir, the water–air heat exchanger, the air-mixing chamber and the dryer. The present work demonstrated the technical feasibility of the concept. The optimization of the system dimensions showed that, for Tunis and a 315 kg of fresh tomatoes dryer capacity, a 45 m2 evacuated tube collector is needed with a 3600 m3 water reservoir. © 2021, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Dimensioning; Drying kinetics; Dynamic simulation; Optimization; Solar dryer; Tomato drying","Costs; Dryers (equipment); Energy utilization; Fruits; Heat exchangers; Mixing; Reservoirs (water); Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar water heaters; Design and optimization; Drying chambers; Evacuated tube collectors; Research programs; Solar water collectors; Storage reservoirs; System dimension; Thermodynamic model; Drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106306885

In opposition to this storage function, brown adipose tissue (BAT) counters obesity, by consuming fat through thermogenesis. Obese individuals display lower BAT mitochondrial oxidative capacity and altered mitochondrial morphology. A promising strategy to fight obesity is dietary polyphenols, which increase BAT mass and function, stimulating energy expenditure (EE). Calafate, a polyphenol-rich Chilean native fruit, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. The effect of a Calafate extract (50 mg [total polyphenols]/kg body weight/day) on EE and mitochondrial function and morphology in BAT from obese mice was assessed. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were subdivided into four treatments for 18 weeks: control diet (C), control diet + Calafate (CC), high-fat diet (HF), high-fat diet + Calafate (HFC). Calafate extract decreased high-fat diet-induced body weight gain from week 6 of treatment (p<0,05) and increased EE at rest (p = 0.03). In BAT, Calafate extract reversed the decrease in UCP-1 protein levels generated by the high-fat diet (p = 0.004). Also, Calafate extract improved mitochondrial transmembrane potential (p = 0.04). The extract did not substantially modify mitochondrial morphology, although it increased the expression of optic atrophy protein 1 (p = 0.01), a mitochondrial fusion-related protein. In sum, consumption of a polyphenol-rich Calafate extract prevents high-fat diet-induced obesity, concomitant with higher energy expenditure, and improved BAT mitochondrial function in obese mice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Brown adipose tissue; Calafate; Mitochondria; Polyphenols; Thermogenesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103327875

In this context, new classes of porous physisorbents, exemplified by porous coordination networks (PCNs), have emerged. There are now >100 000 entries in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) metal-organic framework (MOF) subset and the rate of publication, >5000 per year, grows unabatedly. The number of PCNs makes it infeasible to test all of them for sorption performance and it is therefore timely to introduce a classification approach based upon taxonomy to supplement topological classification of PCNs. This taxonomic approach complements existing databases such as the CSD and enable the design (crystal engineering) of new families of PCNs. It also categorizes existing PCNs in a manner useful to crystal engineers. The internal consistency of the taxonomic approach is verified by case studies of several well-known PCNs whereas its utility is demonstrated upon understudied topologies and hard-to-rationalize infinite rod building blocks. Overall, taxonomic classification enables a traffic light system to direct crystal engineers towards finding a “needle in haystack,” that is, a family (platform) of PCNs that is amenable to crystal engineering and systematic structure/property studies. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","crystal engineering; gas sorption; metal-organic frameworks; porous coordination networks; topology","Air purification; Crystal engineering; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Topology; Traffic signs; Building blockes; Cambridge structural database; Classification approach; Internal consistency; New approaches; Porous coordination networks; Sorption performance; Topological classification; Crystal structure; metal organic framework; gas; porosity; Gases; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Porosity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102423882

To evaluate the efficiency of a photovoltaic water pumping system, hydraulic performance needs to be determined under solar irradiance available. Performance ratio (PR) was used to determine the hydraulic performance of a photovoltaic pumping system, operated by a variable frequency inverter coupled to a conventional alternating current surface pump. For days with solar irradiance above 7.3 peak sun hours (PSH), the system could operate more than 5 h with pressures over 4.7 bar and pump a volume over 45 m3 of water per day. For days with low solar irradiance, below 3 PSH, the system pumped up to 8 m3 of water with pressure over 4.1 bar. The results obtained confirm that this kind of PV system is valid option of power for water pumping for irrigation or storage systems.

This work models a 100% renewable power system considering 473 climate projections based on IPCC RCP4.5 and 8.5, using Portugal in 2050 as a case study. Five demand-flexibility scenarios are explored, combining different levels of electricity demand and system flexibility. It is found that demand and climate variability are crucial to the planning of power systems. When planning for a median climate, the required capacity varies 3-fold for the range of demand scenarios considered. For the system to be resilient under unfavorable climates, cross-border interconnection power capacity should be doubled while storage should increase up to 200-fold, compared to the system designed for the median climate. Modeling for unfavorable climates leads to +54% renewable power capacity and a 6-fold increase in curtailment of renewable energy generation, thus increasing electricity cost. It is therefore shown that the design of a fully decarbonized power system ought not to be based only on median future climates but should take into account its interannual variability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate variability; Electrification; Future electricity demand; Power system; Renewables; Resilience","Climatology; Costs; Electric power system planning; Renewable energy resources; Climate projection; Climate variability; Electricity costs; Electricity demands; Interannual variability; Renewable energy generation; Renewable power systems; System flexibility; Climate models; alternative energy; annual variation; climate variation; cost analysis; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; emission control; scenario analysis; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101551595

In contrary to the conventional LSPR materials (noble metals), the semiconductors LSPR NCs allow a wide range of wavelength tunability of LSPRs from visible towards the near-infrared region (NIR) and further to mid-IR. That led to the adoption of those NCs in various applications wherein the effective tuning of IR characteristics is relevant for biological therapeutic window and tissue attenuation curves, solar spectrum, telecom window, waste heat spectral region, etc. The presented paper briefly reviews the library of semiconductor LSPR NCs, describes the mechanisms of LSPR tuning within NIR and mid-IR, and focuses on the state-of-the-art achievements in implementing LSPR NCs in various energy subjects such as solar energy harvesting via photovoltaics and steam generation, devices for effective energy use and storage, water splitting i.e. hydrogen evolution, elucidates the nature of above processes.

One of the most frequent pests of wheat is the grain weevil (Sitophilus granarius L.). Cleverly hidden, the immature stages of this destructive pest are very difficult to identify. Protecting stored grains has become an agricultural challenge. In the present study, the essential oil (EO) distillated from Citrus limonum (L.) (Burm. F., 1768) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed the presence of 47 compounds with (Z)-citral (30.74%), dl-limonene (19.81%) and geranyl propionate (16.28%) as major components. In a second series of experiment, its fumigant (using filter paper), repellent (by semi circles joined discs) and residual (persistent insecticidal activity) activities were examined against Sitophilus granarius (L.) adults. The total nutrition (carbohydrates and lipids) depletion index (NDI) was also calculated. Residual toxicity and repellency of EO were demonstrated after fumigation against S. granarius with a dose-response relationship. The effectiveness of EO was exposure time dependent and its residual activity persisted up to 30 h following mortality. Moreover, data showed that treatment of S. granarius adults had adverse effects on the depletion of their energy reserves. C. limonum EO declined the lipid and carbohydrate contents in adults. Obtained data prove that botanical essential oils could be considered as potent biorational alternatives to synthetic insecticides for pest control of stored products in a sustainable manner. © 2020, African Association of Insect Scientists.","Citrus limonum; Fumigant toxicity; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS); Persistence; Repellency; Sitophilus granarius",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096085169

The capacity and relevance of nomadic computing are evident with the quick propagation of wireless devices like laptops, wireless sensors, and smartphones. A MANET is a non-temporary infrastructure, consisting of a group of mobile hosts which have no central management and dynamically create their network or connections. This type of network introduces complexities such as regular changes to the topology. The constraints of bandwidth, low energy, and storage capacities of such mobile nodes impose severe limitations on their abilities. Some nodes also cannot communicate directly as there are generally small transmission ranges within nodes in MANETs. Therefore, routing paths can be of multiple hops, and it is the responsibility of neighbouring nodes to operate as routers. A comparative analysis using qualitative techniques is performed by categorizing different routing protocols as proactive, reactive, hybrid and nature-inspired.

However, as a result of the properties and character of hydrogen, its storage is not easy. Therefore, there is a need for systems such as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), which fulfill safety standards and are a flexible medium for the storage and transmission of sustainable energy. The heat transfer oil dibenzyltoluene is a novel LOHC system which can offer superior hydrogen storage capacity. Dibenzyltoluene has a good thermal stability and excellent physicochemical properties for LOHC applications in industry (Do, G. et al. Hydrogenation of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier compound dibenzyltoluene − reaction pathway determination by 1H NMR spectroscopy. React. Chem. Eng. 2016, 1, 313−320). In this Review, the experimental study of dibenzyltoluene with the use of catalysts and the theoretical study of dibenzyltoluene through computational modeling and simulations are explored and discussed. The focus is on heterogeneous catalysts which can be used in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of dibenzyltoluene. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Automotive fuels; Catalysts; Fuel cells; Heat transfer; Hydrogenation; Liquids; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Physicochemical properties; 1H NMR spectroscopy; Computational modeling and simulation; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydrogen carriers; Hydrogen storage capacities; Reaction pathways; Sustainable energy; Theoretical study; Hydrogen storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106446978

The large-scale integration of these vehicles will impact the operations and planning of the power grid. In this paper, we focused on an electric vehicle charging/discharging (V2G) (Vehicle to grid) energy management system based on a Tree-based decision algorithm for peak shaving, load balancing, and valley filling in a grid-connected microgrid. The main objective is to provide an optimal clipping strategy based on the use of EV as mobile storage means to reduce critical customer demand, fill off-peak periods by considering vehicle requirements, load demand, and electricity price variation. The study developed in MATLAB/Simulink is applied on a grid-connected microgrid that includes a grid-connected photovoltaic array, a variable hybrid load (industrial and residential), and an EV charging station that receives 10 vehicles during the day depending on the users' lifestyle. Two load peaks are expected during the day (one due to the start-up of industrial areas and another due to high consumption in the evening) are tested to see the behavior of the management system in peak reduction. The simulation results demonstrated the performance of the V2G technology in peak management applications. The analysis of the results proved the robustness of this solution in peak shaving during high demand periods and valley filling during off-peak hours by allowing a smoothing of the load curve and better exploitation of the micro grids. © 2021 IEEE.","Grid connected Microgrid; Peak shaving; V2G; Valley filling","Curve fitting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management systems; Filling; Landforms; MATLAB; Microgrids; Photovoltaic cells; Trees (mathematics); Vehicles; Decision algorithms; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity price variations; Environmental issues; Ev charging stations; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Management applications; Sustainable energy sources; Vehicle-to-grid",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115192348

An energy management strategy is integrated into a dynamic simulator in order to share the power flow during the system operation. A parametric sensitivities-optimization method based on a genetic algorithm allows us to find the best configuration between the PV array areas, the wind turbine swept area and the capacity of the storage tanks with a reduced process time. The best configuration is predicted on the basis of the minimum primary energy requirement (environmental indicator) with an Loss of Power Supply Probability equal to 0% (reliability indicator).

Furthermore, fresh figs are characterized by short harvest period and shelf-life so they are mostly processed. Drying is the oldest and the most common fig preservation method. Dried figs are valuable due to remained beneficial composition and therefore often used as an ingredient for various food products. It is a desirable ingredient for smoothies, fortified juices, energy bars, dairy desserts and many other inventive products recently patented as health care noodles, flour coated powder for fried food, dried soup, etc. This study aimed to contribute to the development of a new fig product: minimally processed potatoes filled with grated dried figs (MPFP) in order to produce a new gastronomic and nutritionally enriched potato product. Minimal processing includes peeling, slicing and packaging, where obtained products are convenient, but very perishable. In this study, potato was peeled, filled with cut dried figs, vacuum packed in PA/PE bag and stored at 8°C for 7 days. On the 1st, 4th and 7th days of storage, samples were baked and sensory evaluated by QDA method. Phenolic compositions of raw and baked potato, as well as figs, were separately determined. Until the 4th day potato quality was classified as desirable (i.e., taste and color) from the sensory point of view, but on the 7th day, it became unacceptably firm. Chlorogenic acid (CHA), rutin, catechin, epicatechin and kaempherol-3-rutinoside in decreasing sequence were determined in potato, where all were pretty stable during storage and baking, except CHA. In dried fig, quercetin-3-rutinoside was detected and remained stable during storage and baking. The product sensory quality was well accepted and stayed stable for 4 days, where phenols were mostly retained during storage and baking. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The spatial distribution of Urban Energy Balance (UEB) was analyzed by calculating indices: the sensible heat index (χ), the evaporation index (γ), the storage index (Λ) and Bowen ratio (β). In the city central sectors there is a preponderance of sensible heat fluxes warming the atmosphere closest to the surface. Bahía Blanca estuary has the highest latent heat flux magnitudes, followed by coastal areas and islands associated. Peri-urban land surfaces and suburbs have greater magnitudes of latent heat flux since they are composed of a high percentage of permeable surfaces. A marked variability is observed in the daytime and nighttime QF anthropogenic heat fluxes, with maximums during the day. During the night, QF values decrease in magnitude throughout the urban area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Latin American intermediate cities; Local Climate Zones (LCZ); SUEWS; Urban energy flux",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104927852

To address this, the present study introduces and analyzes a novel regenerative thermo-mechanical refrigeration system that can be powered by renewable heat sources (solar, geothermal, or waste heat). The system consists of a novel expander-compressor unit (ECU) integrated with a vapor-compression refrigeration system. The integrated system operates at the higher-performance supercritical conditions of the working fluids as opposed to the lower-performance subcritical conditions. The performance of the system is evaluated based on several indicators including the power loop efficiency, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the cooling loop, and the expander-compressor diameters. Several working fluids were selected and compared for their suitability based on their performance and environmental effects. It was found that for heat source temperature below 100 °C, adding the regenerator to the system has no benefit. However, the regenerator increases the power efficiency by about 1% for a heat source temperature above 130 °C. This was achieved with a very small size regenerator (Dr=6.5 mm, Lr=142 mm). Results show that there is a tradeoff between high-performance fluids and their environmental effects. Using R32 as a working fluid at heat source temperature Th =150 °C and cold temperature Tc1=40 °C, the system produces a cooling capacity of 1 kW with power efficiency of 10.23%, expander diameter of 53.12 mm, and compressor diameter of 75.4 mm. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

The cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) is mapped to find the optimal parameters of BESS, and its efficiency is compared with that of genetic algorithm, sunflower optimization, and pathfinder algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed problem has been evaluated on two test systems.

The stability of sodium nitroprusside in aqueous solution in the presence of light has been intensively studied related to its medical applications as a potent hypotensive agent. The stability of the corresponding transition metal salts in environmental conditions, where water molecules and light are always present, remains undocumented, and it is relevant for such potential applications as functional materials. In this contribution, we are reporting the results of a study on the effect of water and light on the stability of these solids in aqueous suspension under illumination and in the darkness, and in environmental conditions. The degradation process in water suspension was monitored from pH measurements and the recovered solid fractions were characterized by IR and and Mössbauer spectroscopies. The observed behavior evidences that the metal linked at the N end of CN ligands in the nitroprusside building block plays a relevant role in the extent of photodegradation. A metal with a high ability to subtract electron density from the nitroprusside ion generates a higher photostability for this last one. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior of transition metal nitroprussides on aging; Degradation of transition metal nitroprussides; Hydrolysis of ferrous nitroprusside; Proton conduction in transition metal nitroprussides",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102130411

Interim storage of spent nuclear fuel is a very important part in the whole cycle of nuclear energy generation, so the casks must be designed according to relevant safety standards. Like criticality and doses, thermal safety is an important condition for spent nuclear fuel storage in a dry spent nuclear fuel storage facility and should be analyzed thoroughly. During the entire period of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel, normal operation and emergency situations should be investigated. Analysis of various accident scenarios is one of the means to prevent damage of storage casks and spent nuclear fuel. There are many publications on thermal cask behavior during normal operation conditions, yet publications on cask behavior during accidents are rather limited. There are a few publications presenting fire impact analysis of thermal behavior of casks during transportation. Therefore, this paper presents a numerical study that has been performed to evaluate thermal behavior of a cask under fire condition loaded with spent nuclear fuel stored in an open type dry storage facility pre-stored in a water pool for five years. Thermal performance of a 2D vertical CASTOR RBMK-1500 cask under such conditions (steady-state, fire, post-fire) has been numerically studied by using the ANSYS Fluent code. Also, a local sensitivity analysis of parameters that mostly influence the cask's temperature was performed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cast iron CASTOR cask; Fire conditions; Interim storage; RBMK-1500 spent nuclear fuel; Thermal analysis","Fires; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear reactor accidents; Sensitivity analysis; Accident scenarios; Analysis of various; Emergency situation; Local sensitivity analysis; Nuclear energy generation; Spent nuclear fuels; Thermal behaviors; Thermal Performance; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101628520

European Union policies urge energy management systems installation in buildings, to achieve the nZEB targets and mitigate the climate change. Except for renewable energy sources, the incorporation of energy storage units (ESUs) is of major importance for building energy management, in order to increase self-consumption levels. The present work contributes to the mass installation of ESUs in building sector, as a tool to provide flexibility in the distributed production of energy. This concept is an enhanced version of nZEBs that is able to compete in the Electricity Market, and to contribute to the reliability and flexibility of the electricity grid as an alternative to centralized ESUs investments. In this context, the present work proposes a new type of grid ancillary services for building sector and a novel Grid Support Scheme (GSS) that considers both the energy fluctuations of the available energy in the ESU as well as the energy transactions with the grid.

The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine with important role not only in the regulation of inflammation, but also in the modulation of energy metabolism in the liver. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of Mif deficiency in fructose-induced disturbances of hepatic lipid metabolism and ectopic lipid accumulation. Wild type (WT) and Mif deficient (MIF−/−) C57Bl/6J mice were used to analyze the effects of 9-week 20% fructose-enriched diet on hepatic lipid metabolism (both lipogenesis and β-oxidation) and histology, inflammatory status and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. The results showed fructose-induced elevation of lipogenic genes (fatty acid synthase (Fas) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1) and transcriptional lipogenic regulators (liver X receptor (LXR), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP)). However, microvesicular fatty changes, accompanied with enhanced inflammation, were observable only in fructose-fed Mif deficient animals, and were most likely result of GR activation and facilitated uptake and decreased β-oxidation of FFA, as evidenced by elevated protein level of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) and decreased carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) level. In conclusion, the results show that Mif deficiency aggravates the effects of energy-rich fructose diet on hepatic lipid accumulation, most likely through enhanced inflammation and activation of GR signaling pathway. © 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","fructose; hepatic steatosis; inflammation; lipid metabolism; liver; macrophage migration inhibitory factor","acyl coenzyme A desaturase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; CD36 antigen; fatty acid synthase; glucocorticoid receptor; liver X receptor; macrophage migration inhibition factor; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; fatty acid oxidation; fatty liver; high-fructose diet; histopathology; in vivo study; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; male; mouse; nonhuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100042295

In addition, they increase the efficiency of real power transfer. These benefits are amplified in an extra-high-voltage (EHV) system built from longer transmission lines, with expectations for higher reliability. Therefore, a reliable and practical design of EHV shunt capacitor banks is significantly needed. American Electric Power Company (AEP) developed a high-margin, EHV shunt capacitor bank design and protection scheme to reduce the number of failures and ensure proper protection of equipment. In addition, shunt capacitor bank switching may cause transients that can result in damage and misoperations of the capacitor and nearby equipment. This paper describes the design of the EHV (i.e., 345 kV) shunt capacitor bank equipment, protection scheme and transient response and mitigation-with the goal of improving the capacitor's availability and the system's reliability. The findings from this case study may be useful for other similar projects in the industry. © 2021 IEEE.","breaker; capacitor; design; pre-insertion resistor; protection; reactor; switching; transient analysis","Availability; Electric utilities; Energy transfer; Random access storage; Transient analysis; American electric power; Extra high voltage; Protection schemes; Real power; Shunt capacitor banks; Transmission and distribution; EHV power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105723078

In this context the ever increasing penetration of photovoltaic power will have a huge impact on the steady state and transient stability of the grid. However, future power grids are to face the reality that renewable energy sources have the inherently intermittent characteristics of rapidly changing generation capacity depending heavily on weather conditions, along with the reduced inertia of the whole system. This paper analyzed the effects on transient stability of power grids in scenarios with increasing penetration of photovoltaic power plants in terms of analysis of different penetration levels of photovoltaic power plants carried out on an IEEE test power system model.

We investigated light-driven H2 production by three novel organisms, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Citrobacter freundii, and Shewanella oneidensis, self-photosensitized with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, and compared their performance to Escherichia coli. All biohybrid systems produced H2 from light, with D. desulfuricans-CdS demonstrating the best activity overall and outperforming the other microbial systems even in the absence of a mediator. With this system, H2 was continuously produced for more than 10 days with a specific rate of 36 μmol gdcw−1 h−1.

One of the significant applications of BESSs is to control and damp the frequency deviations in power grids. In this paper, we consider a two-area four-machine power grid system with large-scale battery integration. We model the battery energy storage with two dynamic models in d-q axis for charging and discharging modes and augment the battery model with the rest of the power grid system. For each of these modes, we design an optimum controller using linear quadratic regulator (LQR) techniques to damp the frequency deviations of all generators in the case study. Unlike the majority of existing studies merely focus on the active power of BESSs, we consider both active and reactive powers of BESSs. Next, we design a hybrid controller with a switching policy to select the battery's operating mode based on the cost functions of optimal controllers (LQRs). The hybrid controller selects the minimum cost function for each time interval and updates all states of the power system accordingly. The simulation results of the proposed methodology are provided in SIMULINK/MATLAB to illustrate this approach's effectiveness. © 2021 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; disturbance rejection; hybrid control; load frequency control; small-signal stability","Battery management systems; Battery storage; Circuit oscillations; Controllers; Cost functions; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; State feedback; Active and reactive power; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Frequency deviation; Inter-area oscillations; Linear quadratic regulator; Optimum controllers; Renewable energy source; Electric power system stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113360006

It entails modeling four main processes: production of hydrogen by electrolysis, its compression by an electrochemical process, a high-pressure storage, and a fuel-cell car-dispensing system. The Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis model is based on an equivalent circuit to compute the electric energy needed for a certain demand of hydrogen. A thermal model is integrated to determine the operating temperature during the electrolysis. The second phase of the model deals with the compression of hydrogen using an electrochemical compressor whose operating advantages are highlighted and compared to a mechanical compressor. A thermal model is also integrated to the compression process. Modeling the storage of the high-pressure reservoir and hydrogen dispensing are based on fundamental thermodynamics; change in internal energy is studied to determine temperature, then pressure is deduced using the Redlich-Kwong equation of state. The dispensing sub-model involves pressure boosting and precooling subsystems to allow fuel cell cars to perform a fill of their tanks for a wide range of initial pressures. Finally, the integration of all sub-models is carried out using smart control of the precooling system based on a lookup table of the initial pressures in the reservoir and the car tank, which would enable automated filling within the safety limits of the tank. © 2021 SAE International.

The films were synthesized by spin-coating deposition technique. The precursors were prepared from common chemical reagents. Sample's surface microstructure, elemental composition and optical properties were investigated. The microstructural studies of the deposited bilayers show that the Co3O4 underlayer comprises crystalline grains with some overgrown clusters. Nanorod arrays of MoO3 adhering to the underlying Co3O4 layer with no chemical interaction are observed. In the second sample, the V2O5 top layer completely laminated the proximate Co3O4 film. Optical properties of the samples were examined from the UV/Vis spectra data. Energy band gap and band tail width changed with the adherence of top layer. Optical skin depths were also analyzed to reaffirm the suitability of the structures as potential window in thin film photovoltaics. The study demonstrated cheap process of developing interfacial layers of some transition metal oxide materials with high photoresponse. It also showed that the layers can offer the advantage of enhancing light harvesting, charge transport and storage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bilayer structure; Crystalline; Intercalation; Light harvesting; Microstructure; Spin coating",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101082638

Respectively, pyrolysis is described as an appropriate thermochemical process of agro-waste conversion due to a significant reduction in the volume/mass ratio of agro-wastes, thus limiting the problem associated with their disposal or waste storage, in addition to producing value-added products. Various approaches and modifications of “classical” pyrolysis are sought as well in order to direct biomass pyrolysis process to a greater extent to one or another product or to obtain a product with certain characteristics. In this regard, thermal decomposition reactions studies are important, firstly to fundamentally clarify the mechanisms, i.e. the mechanism of reactions, the parameters that affect them and respectively the consequences on the yield and characteristics of the final products, and secondly to implement industrially the developed thermochemical technologies, which require in depth understanding of the kinetics of thermal decomposition. In the current study the thermal stability and kinetic parameters of pyrolysis of virgin and impregnated with ZnCl2 almond shells were investigated and compared. Unequivocally the treatment with ZnCl2 solution of initial almond shells leads to changes in the matrix of almond shells, which affects both, i.e. the process of pyrolysis and the final characteristics of the obtained pyrolytic products. The impregnation alters the thermal decomposition mechanism and it appears that the activation energy of pyrolysis does not depend on the conversion degree and is lower for preliminary untreated almond shells. Based on kinetic parameters, the thermodynamic functions describing the formation of activated complex were determined as well. It appears that preliminary treatment of almonds shells with ZnCl2 solution leads to higher speed proceeding pyrolysis and yields of pyrolytic solid product (char) with well-developed porosity. However pyrolysis of ZnCl2 solution treated shells requires higher energy consumption. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Almond shell; Kinetic parameters; Non-isothermal kinetics; Pyrolysis; Zinc dichloride solution activation","Activation energy; Chlorine compounds; Energy utilization; Kinetic parameters; Pyrolysis; Shells (structures); Thermolysis; Waste disposal; Zinc chloride; Environmental concerns; In-depth understanding; Preliminary treatment; Thermal decomposition mechanism; Thermal decomposition reaction; Thermo chemical process; Thermochemical technologies; Thermodynamic functions; Impregnation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100258108

The principle is based on the fact that tree species with outstanding sprouting capacities are able to leaf after being felled and are physiologically active as long as they have enough water. The course of wood drying (the stems) was examined in relation to their subsequent foliage creation and ongoing evapotranspiration, and how those factors related to other factors (climatic factors, storage). The experiment was realized with two fast-growing tree species (special clones): Hybrid poplar (Populus maximowiczii A. Henry × Populus nigra L. ‘Max 4-5’) and Salix × smithiana Willd. (Salix caprea L. and Salix viminalis L.). In the case of poplar wood samples, the presence of roof cover significantly affects the rate of moisture content decrease in wood samples. Wood samples dried slower under the roof. The buds left on the stems probably accelerate the drying process in case of poplar samples. Willow wood samples were in terms of rate of moisture content decrease in four experimental variants indifferent. Presence of roof or buds had no significant effect on the rate of sample moisture content decrease. These findings may help achieve more efficient handling of the timber from fast-growing species in relation to their processing and storage. © 2021","Energy coppices; Poplar; Willow; Wood drying/timber seasoning; Wood storage","Drying; Evapotranspiration; Moisture; Moisture determination; Plants (botany); Roofs; Wood products; Climatic factors; Drying process; Fast-growing species; Hybrid poplar; Populus maximowiczii; Populus nigra; Salix viminalis; Under the roofs; Forestry; Populus; Populus maximowiczii; Populus nigra; Salix caprea; Salix smithiana; Salix viminalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099664414

However, the use of these sources should be accompanied with adequate safety and security measures. In Lebanon, large number of radioactive sources, including Category I and Category II sources, have been used since the 1960s in different sectors. These sources require high-security levels, improved protection and control, and restricted access to authorized persons during the whole life cycle. The Lebanese government had exerted efforts to combat illicit trafficking, enhance physical protection of radiological facilities, and assure adequate management of sources of Category I and Category II, especially after the end of their life cycle. Several missions were conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency upon request of the Lebanese government in order to enhance the national capabilities to develop physical protection measures for radiological and nuclear materials, combat illicit trafficking, and establish a comprehensive nuclear security regime. The Lebanese Integrated Nuclear Security Support prepared in 2008, and updated in 2012, 2016, and 2019 is described here. This paper describes the national context to manage disused sources of Category I and Category II and materials out of regulatory control.

However, the optimum SEPA operating conditions and their effects on the quality and shelf-life of juice are still unmastered. The Doehlert experimental design was used to optimize the SEPA process of juice from Justicia secunda leaves. Optimum conditions for vitamin C retention were temperature (80°C), quantity of ginger (2.6 g/100 ml) and time (20 min) which gave a vitamin C concentration of 4.61 mg/100 ml. The second part of the study evaluated the stability of juice using ginger powder as a natural stabilizer. Results showed that juice produced with and without ginger (WOG) retained 81.27 and 51.18% of their initial vitamin C contents on Day 9 of storage, respectively. Vitamin C content, pH, and acidity showed that addition of ginger preserved the quality of the juice better than that WOG throughout the storage period. Ginger is a natural source of preservative that contributes to the vitamin C content of the juice and extends its shelf-life from 3 to 9 days for storage at room temperature. Practical applications: This work describes simple procedures that can be used to extract and pasteurize juice from plant material with simple equipment simultaneously. The optimum conditions that retain more than 90% of the initial vitamin C content of the juice are defined and the use of ginger as a natural preservative that prolongs the shelf-life of the drink at room temperature makes the process very appealing. The process can be easily adapted and used at both laboratory, local and industrial levels to produce juice of good quality. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,"Ascorbic acid; Energy utilization; Extraction; Food additives; Pasteurization; Plants (botany); Wood preservation; Juice processing; Natural preservatives; Natural stabilizers; Operating condition; Optimum conditions; Simultaneous extractions; Vitamin c contents; Vitamin C retention; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099363708

The calculated binding energies have been corrected with basis set superposition error (BSSE) and with zero-point energy (ZPE). Beside structural properties and thermochemistry, natural population analysis charges and natural bond orbital analysis have been elucidated. Results showed an influence of substitution site and atom size on binding energies, through a comparison with pristine sumanene.

In the current scenario, everybody searches for cheaper and environmentally friendly approaches in accessing electricity. In order to mitigate falling into a huge energy crisis, both the utility and consumer could involve in energy management which is a convenient and trending approach. We believe it should be started from the ground level, which is the consumer scope. This paper proposes a method for a smart Residential Energy Management System (REMS) using Machine Learning. Specifically, the proposed system (REMS) effectively switches pre-prioritized possible loads without limiting consumption, between the grid and renewably energized local storage with rooftop solar at the residential premises, using Machine Learning algorithms. Reduction of the electricity bill with a reliable power supply as much as possible in residential premises is also concerned, with the use of by load shifting algorithm.

During senescence, chlorophyll degradation is highly regulated in order to diminish toxicity of the free chlorophyll molecule due to its photoactivity. The first step in the chlorophyll degradation pathway is the conversion of chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a by means of two consecutive reactions catalyzed by enzymes coded by NYC1 (NON-YELLOW COLORING 1), NOL (NYC1-LIKE) and HCAR. RESULTS: In this work, we studied the expression of NOL and HCAR genes during postharvest senescence of broccoli. We found that the expression of BoNOL increase during the first days of storage and then decrease. In the case of BoHCAR, its expression is maintained during the first days and then it also diminishes. Additionally, the effect of different postharvest treatments on the expression of these genes was also analyzed. It was observed that the expression of BoNOL is lower in the treatments performed with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BAP) and modified atmospheres, while BoHCAR expression showed an increase in these same treatments, and a decrease in the treatment with ethylene. There were no variations in the expression of both genes in heat treatment, UV-C treatment and visible light treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both BoHCAR and BoNOL show a lower regulation of their expression than other genes involved in chlorophyll degradation during senescence. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","broccoli; chlorophyll degradation; gene expression; postharvest treatments; senescence","chlorophyll; chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; plant protein; Brassica; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Brassica; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091014357

On the contrary, it is a process in which we are already deeply enrolled. The main step towards the creation of a carbon-neutral society is the implementation of renewable energy sources (RES) as replacements for fossil fuels. Given the intermittency of RES, energy storage has an essential role to play in this transition. Hydrogen technology with its many advances was recognized to be the most promising choice. As multiple hydrogen applications were researched relatively recently, the current development of its technology is not yet on the large-scale implementation level. With the increasing number of studies and initiated projects, the utilization of hydrogen's immense ecological potential is to be expected in the next few decades. New innovative solutions of hydrogen technology that includes hydrogen production, storage, distribution, and usage, are permeating all industry sectors. In a rapidly changing world, technological advances bring forth public discussions, that are a deciding factor whether society will be able to adapt and accept those new contributions or reject them. Currently, hydrogen is the best associated with fuel cell electric vehicles which emit only water vapour and warm air, producing no harmful tailpipe emissions. As various scientists are stressing the gravity of climate change effects that are reaching the physical environment, ecosystems, and humanity in general, concern for the future is becoming the main global topic. Consequently, governments are implementing new sustainable policies that promote RES as a substitute for fossil fuels. Increasing progress in hydrogen technology instigated nations worldwide to incorporate hydrogen in their energy legislations and national development plans, which resulted in numerous national hydrogen strategies. This work shows the progress of hydrogen taking its place as a key factor of the future green energy society. It reviews recent developments of hydrogen technologies, their social, industrial, and environmental standing, as well as the stage of transitioning economies of both advanced and beginner countries. An example of the ongoing energy transition is Croatia, which is in the process of implementing a hydrogen strategy with the ambition to be able to one day equally participates in the rapidly emerging hydrogen market. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Energy transition; Hydrogen; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen safety; Hydrogen society; Hydrogen strategy","Climate change; Ecology; Energy policy; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen production; Renewable energy resources; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Hydrogen technologies; Innovative solutions; National Development Plan; Physical environments; Renewable energy source; Sustainable policies; Technological advances; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099214937

Three composite resins (Amelogen, Filtek Z350 XT, and Filtek Bulk Fill) were analyzed at 4 different time periods: at baseline (T0) and after 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 3 (T3) months of storage. Thirty specimens of each material were prepared and divided into subgroups (n = 10) based on the type of solution in which they were immersed for 1 hour a day at 37°C: distilled water (control), Red Bull, and Gatorade. Color stability and fluorescence tests were performed at each timepoint. Three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to evaluate the influences of material, immersion solution, and time on the color stability and fluorescence values (α = 0.05). The Bonferroni test was used as a post hoc test to compare the mean values between the groups (α = 0.05). For color change, ANOVA showed a statistically significant influence of all isolated factors and their interactions. Overall, for all periods of analysis, Amelogen showed significantly higher fluorescence values than the other composite resins after storage in all solutions. In this in vitro study, energy and hydroelectrolytic beverages altered the color stability and fluorescence of the studied materials at all timepoints. The potential for future color alterations should be considered before anterior composite resin restorations are placed in patients who consume high quantities of these beverages.","color stability; composite resins; energy drinks; fluorescence; hydroelectrolytic beverages","dental material; resin; adverse event; beverage; color; human; materials testing; surface property; Beverages; Color; Composite Resins; Dental Materials; Humans; Materials Testing; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102605645

Thus, photovoltaic power prediction is very necessary to guarantee a balance between the produced energy and the solar car park requirements. The prediction of the photovoltaic energy is related to solar irradiation and ambient temperature forecasting. The aim of this study was to evaluate various methodologies for weather data estimation, namely, the empirical models, the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

We aimed to investigate the associations between dietary carbohydrate intake and insulin traits in post-pancreatitis versus healthy individuals, taking into account intrapancreatic fat deposition (IPFD). Methods: All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (using the same protocol and 3T scanner) to quantify IPFD. Dietary carbohydrate intake was assessed using a validated 131-item food frequency questionnaire. Insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β were determined in the fasted state. Linear regression and effect modification analyses were conducted in unadjusted and adjusted models (accounting for age, sex, body mass index, daily energy intake, use of anti-diabetic medications, and recurrence of acute pancreatitis). Results: The study included 111 post-pancreatitis individuals (categorized into low IPFD (n = 33), moderate IPFD (n = 40), high IPFD (n = 38)) and 47 healthy controls. In the high IPFD group, starch intake was negatively associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-β in both the unadjusted (p < 0.001 both) and fully adjusted models (p < 0.001 both); and with HOMA-IR in the fully adjusted model (p < 0.001) only. Total sugar intake was positively associated with fasting insulin (p = 0.015) and HOMA-β (p = 0.007) in the fully adjusted model but not associated with HOMA-IR. None of the above associations was statistically significant in the low IPFD, moderate IPFD, and healthy controls groups. The studied associations were more pronounced in the high IPFD group but not in the moderate IPFD or low IPFD groups (when compared with the healthy controls group). Conclusions: Dietary carbohydrate intake is differentially associated with insulin traits in individuals after an attack of pancreatitis and the associations are modified by IPFD. These findings will be helpful for the development of dietary guidelines specifically for individuals after an attack of pancreatitis. © 2021 IAP and EPC","Diet; Insulin traits; Intra-pancreatic fat; Pancreas; Pancreatitis","antidiabetic agent; insulin; insulin; acute pancreatitis; adult; age; aged; Article; body mass; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; food frequency questionnaire; homeostasis model assessment; human; linear regression analysis; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; sex; statistically significant result; sugar intake; acute disease; administration and dosage; body composition; carbohydrate diet; glucose blood level; metabolism; middle aged; pancreatitis; pathology; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Dietary Carbohydrates; Female; Humans; Insulin; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100577791

A LW blockage, often induced by river-crossing infrastructure, can strongly alter channel hydraulics and sediment transport patterns, thus inducing a ‘forced’ channel morphology. For studying the deposition of bedload gravel fractions in the presence of a rigid LW jam, a novel experimental setup is presented. Using a mobile bed stream table, the effects of a channel-spanning blockage (a ‘dam jam’), resting at a bridge pier, on sediment transport and scour dynamics are examined. Changes in channel morphology were measured using Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry and manually obtained bedload measurements. For the experiment without LW accumulation in place, natural bedload transport was observed over the entire channel length - about 20% of fed colour gravel was recovered from the sediment trap at the outlet, while a total bedload interruption occurred in presence of the LW accumulation, resulting in trapping all fed gravel material upstream of the obstructed cross-section. The volumetric deviation between SfM and manual measurements was less than 0,4%. The porosity characteristics of the LW accumulation were analysed using volumetric meshing techniques. With our experiments, we demonstrated that a relatively high log jam porosity has significant impact on channel morphology. By interrupting the hydraulic energy gradient, the movement of coarse sediment transport is damped, forcing deposition and initiating the development of a sediment wedge upstream of the infrastructure. Our quantitative results provide new insights into how LW can force channel morphology (particularly sediment storage) through the alteration of channel hydraulics. We further elaborate on how novel laboratory-based SfM techniques can be used to enhance the current understanding of complex flow-sediment-wood interaction processes at engineered in-stream structures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Flow-sediment-wood interaction; Hydraulic infrastructure; Large wood (LW) accumulations; Sediment yield assessment; Structure from Motion (SfM) in the laboratory","Bridge piers; Flow interactions; Gravel; Hydraulics; Morphology; Porosity; Scour; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Wood; Channel hydraulics; Coarse sediment transport; Instream structures; Manual measurements; Meshing techniques; Quantitative result; Sediment transport pattern; Structure from motion; Rivers; bedload; channel hydraulics; channel morphology; connectivity; experimental design; hydraulic structure; induced response; infrastructure; photogrammetry; sediment transport; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099831160

Thermogenesis is a process mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production, leading to the conversion of free fatty acids to heat. This process can be triggered by exposure to low ambient temperatures, caloric excess, and the immune system. Recently mitochondrial thermogenesis has also been associated with plasma lipoprotein transport system. Specifically, apolipoprotein (APO) E3 is shown to have a bimodal effect on WAT thermogenesis that is highly dependent on its site of expression. Similarly, APOE2 and APOE4 differentially affect BAT and WAT mitochondrial metabolic activity in processes highly modulated by APOA1. Furthermore, the absence of classical APOA1 containing HDL (APOA1-HDL), is associated with no measurable non-shivering thermogenesis in WAT of mice fed high fat diet. Based on these previous observations which indicate important regulatory roles for both APOA1 and APOE in adipose tissue mitochondrial metabolic activity, here we sought to investigate the potential roles of these apolipoproteins in BAT and WAT metabolic activation in mice, following stimulation by cold exposure (7 °C). Our data indicate that APOA1-HDL promotes metabolic activation of BAT only in the presence of very low levels (virtually undetectable) of APOE3-containing HDL (APOE3-HDL), which acts as an inhibitor in this process. In contrast, induction of WAT thermogenesis is subjected to a more complicated regulation which requires the combined presence of both APOA1-HDL and APOE3-HDL. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Apolipoprotein A1; Apolipoprotein E; Brown adipose tissue; Mitochondrial thermogenesis; Uncoupling protein 1, white adipose tissue","apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein C1; apolipoprotein C2; apolipoprotein C3; apolipoprotein E; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 1; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; Apoa1 protein, mouse; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein E3; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; body weight; brown adipose tissue; cell isolation; cholesterol blood level; cold exposure; controlled study; density gradient centrifugation; ectopic expression; energy metabolism; environmental temperature; food intake; gene transfer; genetic background; lipid blood level; lipid level; lipoprotein blood level; male; metabolic activation; metabolism; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion; mouse; nonhuman; nonshivering thermogenesis; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; protein analysis; protein determination; protein expression; protein protein interaction; thermogenesis; total cholesterol level; triacylglycerol blood level; Western blotting; white adipose tissue; animal; brown adipose tissue; C57BL mouse; cold; energy metabolism; metabolism; physiology; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoprotein E3; Cold Temperature; Energy Metabolism; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria; Protein Interaction Maps; Thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099195940

Peri and menopausal women are at risk of hyperglycemia, prediabetes and attendant metabolic disturbances. Hormone replacement therapy increases insulin receptor sensitivity, but may precipitate an increased cardiovascular risk, depending on the route, if not commenced within the proposed period denoted by the ‘timing hypothesis’. The therapeutic ideal of dietary modification with increased physical activity may have compliance issues. We theorize that selected antidiabetic agents reduce visceral fat deposits, restore insulin sensitivity and inhibit inflammatory mediator release. Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and even metformin are worthy interventions to treat menopausal-induced obesogenic metabolic conditions. Loss of visceral fat restores insulin receptor sensitivity, decreases central obesity and adipokines to halt dysmetabolic changes. © The Author(s) 2020.","Alternative therapies; perimenopause; postmenopause","adipocytokine; amfebutamone; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; C peptide; canagliflozin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; empagliflozin; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucose transporter 4; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; insulin receptor; liraglutide; metformin; naltrexone; phentermine; saxagliptin; semaglutide; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; topiramate; antidiabetic agent; abdominal obesity; alternative medicine; androgen therapy; anorexia; appetite; Article; body weight loss; caloric intake; cardiovascular risk; climacterium; clinical article; diabetes mellitus; dysglycemia; dyslipidemia; energy expenditure; fatty liver; female; glucose blood level; glucosuria; homeostasis model assessment; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypoglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; lipid storage; major depression; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; physical activity; postmenopause; receptor sensitivity; waist circumference; abdominal obesity; cardiovascular disease; menopause; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Menopause; Obesity, Abdominal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098070546

The galactomannans from Gt reduced starch gelatinization enthalpy, indicating that these polysaccharides limited water absorption and interfered with the thermal energy transmission to the granules. The galactomannans of Gt helped to improve the stiffness and to reduce or keep constant the brittleness of the combined starch gels at 7-day storage. Acid condition did not influence the hot paste behavior and cold paste properties at 25 °C of the systems composed of starch and galactomannans fraction from Gt, and practically, pH reduction did not change the gel texture properties. These results have demonstrated that the galactomannans fraction from Gt seeds could become a suitable alternative to be used as a food texture modifier for starch-based products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Galactomannan; Gel; Gelatinization; Gleditsia triacanthos; Pasting; Starch",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092021628

The aim was the selection of the optimum nonthermal processing technology for minimum effect on the fish quality and maximum shelf-life extension, based on pre-selected processing conditions for each technology. Air plasma was generated using a surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) source (3 kV, 45 kHz) applied for 15 min at 25 °C. PEMF (80 J/pulsed energy, 12.5 mT, 3 Hz) and OZ (1.3 mM of aqueous ozone, flow rate 640 ppm) were also applied for 15 min at 25 °C. HP treatment at 300 MPa/5 min at 25 °C was studied. Processed and unprocessed fillets were stored at 4 °C for 22 days. The fish fillets were analysed for their microbial load, pH, texture, colour, lipid oxidation, and sensorial characteristics, during storage. The shelf life of the product was extended by 4 and 2.5 days after HP and CAP processing, respectively. HP was more effective on the microbial load reduction compared to the other processes; nevertheless, colour and texture alteration of the fish fillets was observed. CAP processing decreased the initial total microbial load by 1.03 logCFU/g, while also resulted to reduced intension of the fish odour. PEMF and OZ affected slightly the quality indices nevertheless found to be less effective on the microbial load reduction with only 1 day shelf-life extension of the fillets. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cold atmospheric plasma; Fish fillets; High pressure; Nonthermal processing; Ozonation; Pulsed electromagnetic fields","Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Electromagnetic fields; Fish; Ozone; Ozonization; Plasma diagnostics; Textures; Cold atmospheric plasmas; Comparative studies; High pressure technology; Non-thermal processing; Processing condition; Pulsed electromagnetic fields; Shelf life extensions; Surface dielectric barrier discharge; High pressure effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089093483

The biscuits were subjected to chemical, phytochemical, and microbial evaluations. The crude protein, fat, and ash contents and the energy value of the biscuits increased with increasing percentage of wheat sprout powder. Adding sprouts resulted in higher values of phenolics, alpha-tocopherol, and antioxidant activity. There was no statistically significant difference in the contents of total phenolics and alpha-tocopherol between biscuits supplemented with 5% sprouts and biscuits substituted with 7.5% sprouts. The phenolic content in biscuits containing 7.5% sprouts was 245 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g dm compared with 110 mg GAE/100 g dm in control biscuits. Antioxidant activity was the highest in biscuits substituted with 7.5% sprouts. All levels of substitution of wheat flour with wheat sprouts had an effect on the nutritional properties of biscuits, but the substitution level of 2.5–5% is recommended for the improvement of their sensorial properties.

Existing work on the control of PSPPs is typically based on rather simplified system models, in particular of the (long) pipeline system. In this article, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy is proposed, which enables fast closed-loop dynamics while keeping all system constraints, including the pressure constraints along the pipeline system. The control strategy is based on a physics-based model, which enables easy parameterization and application to other plant sizes or topologies. To ensure real-time capability of the model predictive control (MPC) strategy, a number of measures are outlined in this article. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated by detailed simulation studies. An accurate tracking for fast changing desired grid powers as well as a high robustness with respect to parameter uncertainties is demonstrated. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Extended Kalman filter (EKF); model predictive control (MPC); model uncertainties; physics-based model; pipeline system; pressure waves; variable-speed pumped-storage power plant (PSPP)","Electric power system control; Nonlinear systems; Pipelines; Piping systems; Predictive control systems; Pumped storage power plants; Renewable energy resources; Topology; Water pipelines; Closed loop dynamic; Nonlinear model predictive control; Parameter uncertainty; Physics-based modeling; Power distribution grids; Pressure constraints; Real time capability; Renewable energy source; Model predictive control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085967609

The net metering (NEM) connection has been used to supply excess power to the grid. During the night the energy is taken from the grid to charge the vehicles. This eliminates the requirement of the batteries which reduces the investment significantly. The system can run without subsidy as there is no need for a battery storage system and their regular replacement. The generation from the PV system has been obtained from PVsyst simulation. Cost analysis between a PV system with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and a system with NEM has also been carried out.

nevertheless, their joint effect on endothelial functionality is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the joint effect of IR and VAT on endothelial functionality using the pulse-waveform analysis and explore the mediating role of VAT on the effect of IR on arterial pressure, arterial stiffness and incident arterial hypertension. Methods and results: We measured VAT (n = 586) using two methods (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and a clinical surrogate), arterial stiffness (with pulse-waveform velocity), and IR (using three methods: HOMA2-IR (n = 586), a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (n = 131) and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamping (n = 97)) to confirm the mediator effect of IR on VAT. The incidence of arterial hypertension attributable to the mediating effect of IR related to VAT was evaluated using a prospective cohort (n = 6850). Adjusted linear regression models, causal mediation analysis, and Cox-proportional hazard risk regression models were performed to test our objective. IR and VAT led to increased arterial stiffness and increased blood pressure; the combination of both further worsened vascular parameters. Nearly, 57% (ΔE→MY 95% CI: 31.7–100.0) of the effect of IR on altered pulse-wave velocity (PWV) analysis was mediated through VAT. Moreover, VAT acts as a mediator of the effect of IR on increased mean arterial pressure (ΔE→MY 35.7%, 95% CI: 23.8–59) and increased hypertension risk (ΔE→MY 69.1%, 95% CI: 46.1–78.8). Conclusion: VAT acts as a mediator of IR in promoting arterial stiffness and arterial hypertension. Both phenomena should be targeted to ameliorate the cardiometabolic risk. © 2020 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","Cardiometabolic risk; Cardiovascular health; METS-VF; VAT","cholesterol; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; biological marker; insulin; adipose tissue; adult; antihypertensive therapy; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; blood pressure; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular mortality; chemiluminescence immunoassay; cohort analysis; colorimetry; diastolic blood pressure; diet; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dyslipidemia; female; glucose blood level; heart rate; high performance liquid chromatography; HOMA index; human; hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique; hypertension; incidence; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; intravenous glucose tolerance test; lean body weight; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; Metabolic Score for Visceral Fat; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physical activity; prospective study; pulse wave velocity; scoring system; smoking; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; waist to height ratio; waveform; arterial pressure; blood; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; hypertension; intra-abdominal fat; metabolism; Mexico; obesity; pathophysiology; risk assessment; Adiposity; Adult; Arterial Pressure; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Vascular Stiffness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097080008

In the proposed method, the sending-end rectifier controls emulate a SM, whereas the receiving end inverter emulates a SG to transmit power from one grid to another. The two converters connected by a DC line provide a Synchronverter HVDC (SHVDC) link. A windfarm with a type 4 permanent magnet SG is integrated into the HVDC link through a rectifier. Depending on the wind speed, the proposed control strategy automatically shares and manages the wind generator power on the DC side by using a BESS connected to the HVDC link to stabilize the power fluctuations generated by the intermittency of the wind farm. The performance of the synchronverter-based HVDC transmission was verified by using a MATLAB Simulink model.

Therefore, we addressed the question how consumption of these nutrients affects changes in HFC in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Eight male non-obese non-diabetic patients with NAFLD underwent 6 experiments each lasting 8 hours: 1. fasting, 2. high-fat load (150 g of fat (dairy cream) at time 0), 3. glucose (three doses of 50 g at 0, 2, and 4 hours), 4. high-fat load with three doses of 50 g of glucose, 5. fructose (three doses of 50 g at 0, 2, and 4 hours), 6. high-fat load with three doses of 50 g of fructose. HFC was measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy prior to meal administration and 3 and 6 hours later. Plasma triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose and insulin were monitored throughout each experiment. HFC increased by 10.4 ± 6.9% six hours after a high-fat load and by 15.2 ± 12.5% after high-fat load with fructose. When co-administering glucose with fat, HFC rose only transiently to return to baseline at 6 hours. Importantly, NAFLD subjects accumulated almost five times more fat in their livers than healthy subjects with normal HFC. Consumption of a high-fat load results in fat accumulation in the liver of NAFLD patients. Fat accumulation after a fat load is diminished by glucose but not fructose co-administration. © 2021, Polish Physiological Society.

Voltages, Active and Reactive Power Levels are analyzed during a 24 hours period. Loading in transformers and distributions lines are analyzed too, in order to verify the electrical behavior during the operation of BESS. BESS do not increase considerably the voltage levels in the nodes but modify the active power pro-file during the peaks of the curves and change the reactive power levels in the LDS.

Hence, a new product was developed employing vacuum frying technology to minimize undesirable changes and provide longer shelf-life as the conditions under vacuum frying involves the use of low temperature and minimal exposure to oxygen. However, data on its quality is not yet available since the product is new. Thus, the development of sorption isotherm and understanding of isosteric heat of sorption to the newly developed product is essential for the quantitative approach to predicting stability and quality changes during packaging and storage. Isotherms of vacuum fried chicken “isaw” were measured at 20 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C by the static gravimetric method over a range of relative humidity (RH) from 7–75%. BET (up to 43% Aw), Smith, Kuhn, Oswin, Karel, and Peleg were the mathematical models used in fitting the experimental sorption data. Corresponding to BET, the monolayer moisture content (Xm) revealed that the vacuum fried chicken “isaw” must have a moisture content of 3.79%, 1.98%, and 1.96% at 20 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C, respectively to prevent auto-oxidation and to enhance product stability of vacuum fried chicken “isaw” during storage. The net isosteric heat was calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and was observed that as moisture content is decreased, the isosteric heat of sorption increases. With these data gathered, generating and understanding the product’s sorption isotherm, energy constants, and general equation at 20 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C would provide valuable information for predicting quality changes during storage and packaging and for convenience in its future processing in an attempt to improve its quality, safety, and profitability. © 2021, Department of Science and Technology.

In the second part, an experimental study on jute fiber inves-tigating chemical activation methods and properties of resultant ACFs are reported. Three key process parameters, that is, pretreatment method, activation temperature and concentration of activation agent were varied to get optimum result with respect to yield and adsorption capacity. Prepared ACFs were characterized by SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, iodine number and BET surface area test, and pore volume measurement. Additionally, adsorp-tion isotherms, adsorption kinetics and adsorption capacities of the ACF for two organic dyes – methylene blue (MB) and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), were investigated.

Recently, much has been discussed about the briquettes-binders system and the influence of binders on the resulting physical and combustion properties of briquettes. However, the present knowledge is insufficient on the binderless briquetting technology which is commonly used for producing lignite briquettes, as well as the resulting properties and beneficial effects when compared to briquettes produced with binders. The present review discusses the binderless briquetting technology in detail and its influence on the combustion and mechanical properties of the lignite briquettes. To a large extent, some properties of the lignite like hardness, surface structure, plasticity and elasticity can influence the binderless briquetting process. Reducing the plasticity or increasing the elasticity of lignite is advantageous to binderless briquetting. The various forms/theorems of binderless technology including capillary, adhesion, bituminous and humic acid, colloidal, denser water and cation membrane theorems were discussed. Under binderless briquetting system, the influence of briquetting parameters (temperature and pressure) and lignite coal properties (particle size distribution, moisture content, and hydrogen bonding) on briquette strength was extensively analyzed and discussed. This review study is concluded by presenting a comprehensive overview on the bonding mechanisms and several points of interest for future studies as regards the binderless technology for producing lignite briquettes. © 2020, The Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University.","Binderless technology; Energy content; Hydrogen bonding; Lignite briquettes; Moisture content",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084453550

The nanostructure of PP/nCu nanocomposites was also studied by WAXD, SEM and optical microscopy, while their hierarchical crystalline morphologies (e.g., spherulites, lamellas and unit cell) were studied during the crystallization progress through polarized optical microscopy and in situ X-ray scattering at small and wide angle, observing that the spherulite size was not influenced by the nCu’s, although the lamellas size and X-ray diffraction intensity increased with the incorporation of nanoparticles. The PP/nCu nanocomposites presented a mixture morphology with well-dispersed oxidized nanoparticles and some agglomerates, which were larger at higher concentration of particles. The crystallization results obtained by DSC indicated a displacement in the peak crystallization temperature at higher values. These results in combination with the kinetic of crystallization analyzed by the Jeziorny method clearly indicated an acceleration in the crystallization process. Additionally, the crystallization activation energy decreases for all nanoparticle’s concentration, indicating a possible nucleating effect. However, the nucleation activity analyzed by the Dobreva and Gutzow’s method showed that nCu could not be considered such as conventional heterogeneous nucleating agent of iPP. Conversely, the incorporation of nCu in the iPP matrix increased significantly the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites helping to the thermal dissipation from the melted macromolecules to the nCu’s, accelerating the non-isothermal crystallization process. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Copper nanoparticles; Crystallization; Isotactic polypropylene; Nanocomposites; Nucleation activity; Thermal dissipation","Activation energy; Crystallization; Differential scanning calorimetry; Isotherms; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Nucleation; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Thermal conductivity; Thermoanalysis; X ray scattering; Copper nanoparticles; Crystallization activation energy; Differential scanning calorimeters; Isotactic poly(propylene) (iPP); Isotactic polypropylene; Nonisothermal crystallization; Nucleation activity; Thermal dissipation; Polypropylenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082873415

The potential energy content of maize seeds, expressed as Metabolizable Energy (ME) is relatively high compared to other feed ingredients. However, they contain phytic acid, which acts in physiological functions (storage of main Phosphorus and cations). In Maize seeds, phosphorus is primarily stored as phytate (60-97%), and approximately 21-25% are found in the plant root. This study aims to determine the potential of phytase-producing endophytic bacteria, as an invisible avail for Zea mays L. High phytate levels in maize seeds is a problem encountered when used as raw material in poultry feed. The inability of poultry to produce phytase in hydrolyzing phytate feed in the digestive tract, reduces broiler digestibility of Phosphorus and other minerals banded by this element. This response is due to phytic acid effect, a potent chelator categorized as an antinutrient. Interestingly, it has the ability to bind to proteins and ions of several essential minerals, such as calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and copper, even forming complexes with digestive enzymes. A phytate problem-solving effort required the utilization of phytase enzyme from various sources, including those obtained from endophytic bacteria. The existence of phytic acid in phosphorus storage of maize plants, allows the presence of endophytic bacteria that utilize this acid as a metabolic substrate. Phytic acid is used as a source of Phosphorus for metabolic needs, and also engage in mutualism interaction with maize plants, since its life cycle does not have a detrimental impact on the host plant. By producing extracellular enzymes, phytic acid is hydrolysed by phytase, produced by endophytic bacteria. It is known that endophytic bacteria play a role in increasing plant growth and yield, suppressing contaminant pathogens, dissolving phosphates, or contributing nitrogen. Endophytic bacteria is one of the unique groups of organisms that have natural habitats in plant tissue, both in the root, leaves, stems, and seeds, and are fascinating to explore. Various secondary metabolites have been produced and studied, both as antibiotic, antiviral, anticancer, antioxidant, anti-insecticidal, antidiabetic, and anti-immunosuppressive compounds. The ability to produce phytase, applied in improving the quality of poultry feed was explored.

Vapor deposition techniques are the enabling platforms of the thin-film industry, offering high material versatility and good coverage ability on relatively flat surfaces, leading to frequent use in a large array of applications, especially nanoscale electronic devices such as sensors and electrodes. However, when surface topography exhibits high roughness, even depositions that are not limited to line-of-sight show only partial coverage, significantly hindering performances. Our manufacturing process of VACNT/Al2O3 nanocomposites has three vaporous steps: CNT growth by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), functionalization via controlled thermal oxidation, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of alumina. The same limited accessibility hinders each of these three steps. Morphological analyses show different CNT heights throughout the sample, with shorter CNTs in the middle, having less access to gases. As height differences between the center and peripheries escalate, sample centers may collapse under the tension. The limited accessibility of the center is manifested also in inhomogeneous oxygen contents, between sample centers and peripheries. Finally, a sharp transition in deposition quality occurs during the deposition process of Al2O3, from homogeneous to inconsistent, which is also linked to the accessibility differences between. Adjusting process parameters, we have successfully coated 1.8 mm-tall VACNT arrays with a homogeneous thin (few nm) Al2O3 layer and were able to increase the depth at which, thick (few dozens of nm) Al2O3 coating is uniform from 20 to 350 μm. However, when VACNTs were functionalized, the penetration depth was found to correlate negatively with center oxygen content. These results, indicating diffusion as a rate-setting step in complex topography coatings, can significantly improve deposition quality and enhance the performance of thin-film applications such as membranes, sensors, and electrodes for energy harvesting and storage. ©","atomic layer deposition (ALD); chemical vapor deposition (CVD); nanocomposites; surface treatment; vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs)","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical vapor deposition; Diffusion coatings; Electrodes; Electronics industry; Energy harvesting; Entertainment industry; Oxygen; Thermooxidation; Thin films; Topography; Chemical vapor depositions (CVD); Complex topographies; Manufacturing process; Morphological analysis; Nanoscale electronic devices; Thin-film depositions; Vapor-deposition techniques; Vertically aligned carbon nanotube; Atomic layer deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099014683

The unknown disruptions and uncertainties of NCES in GC mode are taken care by selective self tuning complex filter (SSTCF).

This algorithm is dedicated for the evaluating of quadrature sinusoidal fundamental component (Q-SFC). It improves overall system performance as it operates adequately in steady state and transient conditions. To control the NES in an IL mode, a control algorithm is used based on the proportionalplus resonant (P+R) control.

This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a fundamental energy flexibility quantification framework applicable to various energy systems commonly found in residential buildings (i.e., heat pumps, renewables, thermal and electrical storage systems). Using this framework, the interactions between these systems are analysed, as well as assessing the net energy cost of providing flexibility arising from demand response actions where onsite electricity production is present. A calibrated white-box model of a residential building developed using EnergyPlus (including inter alia a ground source heat pump, a battery storage system, and an electric vehicle) is utilised. To acquire daily energy flexibility mappings, hourly independent, and consecutive demand response actions are imposed for each energy system, using the proposed indicators. The obtained flexibility maps give insights into both the energy volumes associated with demand response actions and qualitative characteristics of the modulated electricity consumption curves. The flexibility potential of each studied energy system is determined by weather and occupant thermal comfort preferences as well as the use of appliances, lighting, etc. Finally, simulations show that zone and water tank thermostat modulations can be suitably combined to shift rebound occurrences away from peak demand periods. These insights can be used by electricity aggregators to evaluate a portfolio of buildings or optimally harness the flexibility of each energy system to shift peak demand consumption to off-peak periods or periods of excess onsite electricity generation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility indicators; Residential sector; Smart grid","Electric power generation; Housing; Water tanks; Battery storage system; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Electricity-consumption; Energy flexibility; Qualitative characteristics; Residential building; Thermal energy systems; Geothermal heat pumps; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy planning; energy use; pumping; residential energy; seasonality; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095946920

Previous backup placement algorithms suffer from obliviousness to main factors of heterogeneous wireless network. Specifically, there is no consideration of the nodes memory and storage capacities, and no reference to a case in which nodes have different energy capacity, and thus can leave (or join) the network at any time. These parameters are strongly correlated in wireless networks, as the load on different parts of the network can differ greatly, thus requiring more communication, energy, memory and storage. In order to fit the attributes of wireless networks, this work addresses a generalized version of the original problem, namely Backup K-Placement, in which each vertex selects K neighbors, for a positive parameter K. Our Backup K-Placement algorithm terminates within just one round. In addition we suggest two complementary algorithms which employ Backup K-Placement to obtain efficient virtual memory schemes for wireless networks. The first algorithm divides the memory of each node to many small parts. Each vertex is assigned the memories of a large subset of its neighbors. Thus more memory capacity for more vertices is gained, but with much fragmentation. The second algorithm requires greater round-complexity, but produces larger virtual memory for each vertex without any fragmentation. © 2021 ACM.",,"Heterogeneous networks; Virtual reality; Wireless networks; Energy capacity; Heterogeneous wireless network; Memory capacity; Placement algorithm; Placement problems; Round complexity; Storage capacity; Virtual memory; Graph theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098849710

Since sketches provide probabilistic estimates (hence accomplishing considerable reductions in storage and computational requirements), it seems that approximate hardware is appropriate for implementation providing an estimate rather than the exact value and enabling further improvements in metrics. In this paper, the use of voltage scaling in an approximate nanoscale FinFET-based memory for implementing sketches is studied and evaluated. To mitigate the errors introduced by the approximate memory, techniques to protect several widely used sketches when implemented in such voltage-scaled FinFET memory, are proposed. The proposed schemes preserve the sketches functionality with a negligible impact on the accuracy of their estimates and tolerate large bit error rates for sketches such as Minhash and HyperLogLog. The analysis and simulation results show that the intrinsic error tolerance of data sketches can be exploited to provide accurate estimates even when the memory suffers many errors due to the voltage scaling of the supply. Voltage scaling enables large power savings for Minhash and HyperLogLog. These initial results suggest that the use of approximate computing for data sketches is an interesting area for further research.

It involves the capture of CO2 from point sources such as power plants and subsequent storage in secure geological reservoirs. However, capture incurs parasitic power loss; thus, compensatory power from clean sources such as renewables will be needed to make up for the power losses. The conventional capture process is designed for steady-state operation, but flexible capture is possible to offset the intermittency of renewable energy. Systematic planning for robust CCS systems is needed to incorporate flexible mechanisms in CO2 capture. In this study, a mixed integer linear program (MILP) is developed to robust CCS retrofit subject to operational adjustments for multiple periods or scenarios. Retrofit decisions include options for flexible and non-flexible capture, accounting for trade-offs between the two options. Operational adjustments pertain to decisions to switch off the flexible capture plants to compensate for depressed renewable energy supply. A case study is presented to demonstrate the optimization model. From the case study, flexible mechanism can provide a more robust planning, where low availabilities of renewable energy can contribute up to 18% of the power demand. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122593064

The key objective is to investigate the adsorption suitability for Post-combustion Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Capture (PCC). Adsorption is a promising technology suitable for a high volume of diluted gas processing. Unlike commercialised amine-based absorption processes, adsorption seems to require less energy for sorbent regeneration and extends the sorbent lifetime. Two common industrial methods utilizing a difference in adsorption equilibrium of the gas components were investigated: 1) Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) including Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA), 2) Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA). A comparison of their energy consumption, suitability for industrial use with consideration of Carbon Capture and Storage standards is evaluated. A complex mathematical model for the adsorption step of the fixed bed adsorber was proposed and solved by the structural programming. Three adsorbent materials: Mg-MOF-74, UTSA-16, and Zeolite 13X were evaluated based on their CO2 adsorption capacity, selectivity, and market availability. Zeolite 13X was further explored. As a benchmark case, a medium-sized natural gas cogeneration unit was used to study the potential of VSA unit. The lower limit of CO2 capture efficiency in simulations was 75 %. The results presented in this paper suggest that adsorption can be a feasible CO2 capture solution for a low-carbon emission power generation technologies. Optimal parameters for the adsorption step and column configuration are proposed. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122580783

This has led to the emergence of various CO2reducing technologies, which differ in their economic and environmental performances. Considering only one side of the problem may be misleading, so this work introduces a novel high-level cost analysis methodology which assesses the different CO2 reduction options based on CO2 marginal abatement cost - MAC (an indicator that integrates environmental and economic performances). The study contributes to the existing literature by accounting for the impact of the temporal variations in power demand and renewable energy sources on the MAC of the considered options. The proposed approach is demonstrated through an analysis that explores integrated pathways for CO2 reduction through CCUS technologies and renewable energy technologies. Energy storage is considered for the intermittent renewable energy options. The results for the different scenarios are combined on a Mini-MAC curve, a recently developed cost analysis tool for planning CO2 reduction pathways, in which significant insights on the economics of the CO2 reduction are demonstrated and analyzed. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122579323

Start-up time taking minutes is an undeniable advantage of PSA technology compared to cryogenic air separation start-up time taking hours or days. The increasing share of renewable electricity causes intraday electricity price fluctuations. These fluctuations can be an opportunity to improve the economy of a plant and/or to accumulate electricity in the form of liquefied products. This paper aims to demonstrate the possibility of a flexible PSA unit connected to a small oxy-fuel combustion unit. Two options were analyzed: i) LOX supply at electricity price peak, and ii) liquid oxygen energy storage (LOES). The cold energy needed for oxygen liquefaction will be obtained utilizing liquefied nitrogen (LIN) delivered from a large air separation unit (ASU).

In addition, the reduction of fossil CO2 emissions from various energy-intensive industrial sectors needs to be addressed considering the issues of global warming and climate change. This paper evaluates the innovative Calcium Looping (CaL) cycle both as an energy-efficient post-combustion CO2 capture option and as a time-flexible thermo-chemical energy storage system. As illustrative energy conversion system to which the calcium looping cycle will be applied, a natural gas-based combined cycle power plant was considered. The net power output was about 400 - 500 MW with a 90 % CO2 capture rate. Corresponded non-decarbonized case was also considered to calculate the CO2 capture penalty. In-depth modelling, simulation and thermal integration evaluations were done to cover the following relevant operational elements: characterization of decarbonized combined cycle power plants with CaL cycle with/without solid sorbent storage; mass and energy integration issues; detailed techno-economic and environmental calculations of main performance indicators; flexible part load operation of the power plant to take advantages of CaL thermo-chemical energy storage characteristics etc. As the results show, the flexible time-operation of the decarbonized power plant integrated with CaL cycle using sorbent storage option improves the overall performances e.g., capital cost reduction up to 10 %, lower electricity production cost up to 5 % etc. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122567476

Their integration into RE systems is typically studied using energy systems modeling software that utilize either idealized models or complex models that require experimental data. Reduced-order modeling offers minimal experimental costs through the use of a multiphysics model in lieu of experimental battery data. In this work, a previously reported multiphysics model of a lithium-ion lithium iron phosphate (Li-ion LFP) battery was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics® and reduced into an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The reduced-order ECM was then implemented as a battery systems model in an energy systems modeling tool to perform RE-based hybridization studies. Techno-economic case studies were conducted on RE-based systems powering a household and an off-grid island to validate the reduced-order ECM with the idealized battery model with HOMER Pro. Optimal component sizes computed using the two software generally showed good agreement and deviations were attributed to electrical losses. The state of charge (SOC) vs. time graphs generated by the two software had an average root mean square error of 0.00173 SOC units across the different case studies. Discrepancies were observed during rapid charging or high SOC values, which were characteristic of the reduced-order ECM. This model reduction framework can be applied to other energy storage and conversion technologies, such as other Li-ion chemistries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors, to generate chemistry-specific models for energy systems research. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122567045

The present work aims at obtaining the critical decisions in the performance of a DC network at the operating level. End-users can be of different type (e.g., residential or commercial) with different demand profiles and an optimal strategy needs to be employed in order to satisfy the demand and minimise energy usage. In published literature the vast majority of the studies employ simplified mathematical models in order to describe the thermodynamic cycle used and only a handful of studies take into account the actual dynamics of the system transition from one state to the other as well as the time delay attributed to the cooling medium transfer through the network. The critical decisions involve the operating conditions and optimal allocation for the cooing of existing units in a suitable time interval, which form the basis for the satisfaction of requirements in cooling under demand variability. Although reduced order models of the process of ABR cycle are used, the time delay of the cooling medium transfer through the pipes is considered through the employment of validated first order plus time delay models. The proposed optimisation framework enables the identification of demand driven, highly performing solutions through the direct consideration of all interacting factors over a pre-defined time horizon.

With the objective of satisfying the microgrid's electricity and heat demands in a cost-optimal way, the microgrid includes several technologies such as micro combined heat and power units, gas turbines, heat pumps, renewable energy sources, exchanges with the main grid, as well as flexibility providers such as energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and demand response. One salient feature of the proposed framework is that it considers the contribution of power generating sources in the ancillary services provision, both up and down, providing an additional income for their operation and enhancing the grid operation. An illustrative case study has been used to test the applicability of the proposed approach in both economic and operational terms. The results underscore the significance of including the ancillary services market as a revenues source to the MES as well as the fact that the participation of various resources in both energy and ancillary services markets affects the operational scheduling of the microgrid, and the services provided by the flexibility providers play a major role in the overall cost reduction. System operators, aggregators, and market participants can utilize the proposed optimization framework to determine their operational and investment strategies for optimal resource utilization and portfolio selection.

The proposed reactor is an absorber tube exposed to concentrated solar radiation. This tube is also the riser of a circulating fluidised bed where the calcination reaction takes place. The proposed heat transfer process models are based on the core-annulus model and the hydrodynamic model is a modified version of the Kunii-Levenspiel model. The model considers the change in the mass flow rate of species and the density change of the phases in the axial direction of the reactor, usually considered constant in the models found in the literature. A higher calcination efficiency, up to 8 p.p., is obtained for the studied reference case when assuming constant density and mass flow rate. Simulations were performed by imposing a solar-driven non-uniform heat flux distribution on the reactor wall. The results show that a 6 m height reactor allows achieving a calcination efficiency of 66% for the reference conditions used. A sensitivity analysis shows that the solids mass flow rate and the inlet bed temperature are the parameters that most affect the calcination process efficiency.

This work presents a synthesis of sustainable renewable energy supply networks to achieve the transition to a 100 % renewable energy system in the EU by 2050, focusing on heat and power end users in various sectors to achieve more synergies between sectors and thus increase the overall efficiency of the energy system. The generation and supply of renewable electricity, heat, first, second and third generation biofuel, hydrogen and bioproducts from different renewable energy sources are considered together with storage technologies. A dynamic mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated with the maximization of the composite criterion Sustainability Net Present Value as the objective, optimizing all sustainability pillars simultaneously. The results show the impact of electrifying the residential sector, services and transport sector to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future. Heat pumps powered by renewable electricity seems to be a key technology for meeting heating demand in residential and service sector, accounting for 55 % and 61 % of final consumption. The results also reveal the role of biomass cogeneration systems, whose heat recovery could meet 33 % of the heat demand from renewable energy sources in the residential sector and 28 % in the services. The share of electricity in final energy consumption in the transport sector is projected to reach 52 %. The residential, services and transport sectors together are expected to almost double the current electricity demand by 2050.

Setting carbon reduction targets is the primary means policymakers employ to reduce emissions. The reduction is achieved by many pathways which include energy efficiency, fuel switching, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), renewable energy (RE) and more recently, negative emission technologies (NETs). An eco-industrial park (EIP) incorporates industrial symbiosis to implement these solutions by synergistically exchanging resources between its entities. While many works have integrated a single resource in EIPs, the integration of multiple resources is an emerging area with remarkable potential to achieve sustainable benefits. This work introduces an extension to multiple resource integration by allowing it to translate over a time horizon. Policies are designed to achieve a target over a specified time horizon. The emerging reduction pathways will therefore change over time either by adapting to a policy or by modifying itself to improve performance, thereby making policies critical to an EIP's design during its lifetime. The proposed method will employ a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize network configurations and planning strategies for a set of objectives over multiple time periods. The model will also assess the network's economic and environmental benefits to allow stakeholders to assess and implement changes in their facilities. The model is illustrated by developing a CO2 converting network that maximizes total profit and minimizes emissions while simultaneously adapting to systematic changes in environmental policies. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122483981

Without this power, modern civilized life cannot think for a moment. Thereby a huge amount of electrical energy is needed. We have to generate a considerable amount of electricity to meet the growing demand maintaining necessary conditions and constraints. A rapid diver-gent strategy called Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) has been introduced to distribute generated energy economically during times of crisis. The problem of economic load dispatch is solved with the help of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) formation. The OPF is a primary tool related to the optimum generation schedule available in an interconnected power system to reduce production costs subject to the limitations and constraints of the relevant system. The static economic dispatch optimizes over single dispatch intervals, which is called “ED static”. Due to high load variability and uncer-tainty, the ED-static is not working properly. Thereby a deterministic look-ahead dispatch is estab-lished, which takes care of the increasing renewable penetration. To take decisions against uncer-tainty, stochastic load dispatch is required. In this research paper, an economic study of the modified IEEE 5 bus power system will be presented. Moreover, some intelligent changes to this system will include the goal of reducing costs, including maximum power supply. The optimal power flow of the modified IEEE 5 bus system considering plausible scenario will represent based on stochastic load dispatch optimization model. Methods: The extension version of Economic load dispatch where load flow equations are applied, and as a system of supply-demand balance constraints is called optimal power flow. To solve the optimal power flow Lagrangian method is used. Karusk-Khun-Tucker (KKT) conditions are applied to solving the Lagrangian method. Results: The results show that during uncertainty and stochastic loads, the storage system with renewable power and generator is suitable for cost reduction with maximum supply. Conclusion: The results further show that for any type of loads, such as fixed load and stochastic load in IEEE 5Bus system, if both renewable energies, such as wind power, solar power, the storage devices are used in the generation system, which ensures maximum power supply with the cost is reduced. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Deterministic; ELD; OPF; Stochastic; Uncertainty; Wind energy","Acoustic generators; Buses; Cost reduction; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric power plant loads; Lagrange multipliers; Solar energy; Stochastic models; Virtual storage; Wind power; Condition; Deterministics; Economic load dispatch; Electrical energy; Energy; Optimal power flows; Power; Stochastic loads; Stochastics; Uncertainty; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122370958

Up to now and to the best of our knowledge, the use of full explicit dopants and additives for both ionic and electronic transport calculations has remained practically unexplored probably due to their high computational cost. The use of fewer artifacts and other common assumptions in our calculations allowed us to reveal some interesting behavior associated with the presence of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) dopants and dimethoxyethane (DME) additives on the mixed ionic-electronic transport in a wide temperature range. Our ionic and electronic conductivity calculations show a good correlation with the experimental reports of similar mixed ionic-electronic conductors in the very recent literature. For the electronic transport, our transfer integral (J) and reorientation energies (λ) values showed increment respect to typical unexplicit-doped calculations. Furthermore, we also introduce the role of the explicit dopant in the interchain, intrachain, ""effective""doping, and charge-transfer complex bonding distances, and their associated static and dynamic disorder effects on electronic transport. These new insights can be extremely helpful to unravel not only the doping mechanism but also, and simultaneously, the mixed ionic-electronic transport mechanism for organic semiconductors.

This paper proposes a generalized analytic solution to this problem, which reduces the complexity significantly and is readily applicable to converters with large number of SMs. The validity of this method is proved theoretically and verified with simulation and experimental results on both the MMC and CHB converter.

The CIPNLMS-MFX based current control technique includes asymmetry parameters and the optimized selection of these parameters, provides fast convergence speed, good steady state response and improved power quality at nonlinear loads. This PV system is also supported with the synchronization and mode transfer control, so that the PV system has autonomous operation under outage and recovery of the grid without disturbing the supply across the domestic loads.

The proposed devices have an integrated back-gate to control the flow of charge and spin currents. VSHE leads to the flow of opposite spins in divergent directions perpendicular to the WSe&#x2082; layer with valley/spin Hall angle ~1.

As such, efficient hardware support for NN search is highly desired. In-memory computing using emerging devices offers attractive solutions for NN search. Solutions based on ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) offer high energy and latency improvements for NN search at the expense of accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel distance function that can be natively evaluated with multi-bit content-addressable memories (MCAMs) based on ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) to perform a single-step, in-memory NN search. We evaluate the efficacy of FeFET MCAMs in the context of few-shot learning applications with different datasets. As an example, we achieve a 78.54% accuracy for a 5-way, 5-shot classification task for the mini-ImageNet dataset (only 1.5% lower than software-based implementations) when using a 3-bit MCAM for NN search. We consider the effects of FeFET threshold voltage variations on the application accuracy and analyze the area and search energy requirements of FeFET MCAMs for accurate operations. Our results indicate that MCAMs require 2x lower area and search energy than TCAMs to achieve the same accuracy. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a 2-bit implementation of FeFET MCAM using AND arrays from GLOBALFOUNDRIES to further validate the design concept.

This paper proposes a three-stage hierarchically coordinated voltage control strategy in seaport microgrids considering the optimal voyage navigation and scheduling of AES. In stage one, we first propose an arrival time estimation method for AES to reduce the potential voltage violation risk in different seaport microgrids. The optimal power flow (OPF) is then performed in each microgrid to determine the day-ahead dispatch of on-load tap changer (OLTC) and inverter-based renewable energy resources (RES). In stage two, the optimal route planning is carried out based on the sea states and the Dijkstra algorithm. The voyage and generation scheduling of AES are formulated as optimization problems and solved by CPLEX solvers. In stage three, a real-time local voltage control strategy is performed to mitigate fast voltage violations. To fully exploit the voltage support capability of energy storage systems (ESSs) on berthed-in AES, both constant charging mode and voltage control mode are designed to regulate voltages while ensuring sufficient SOC levels of ESS when leaving the seaport. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method both in saving the generation cost of AES and improving voltage profiles in seaport microgrids.

However, as the BES-qZSI is a fast-response power converter without any inertia, when applied as a grid-connected system, it leads to decreased power system inertia. The low inertia problem will degrade the system&#x2019;s performance and affect the system&#x2019;s stability. Moreover, The BES-qZSI PV power system usually employs a phase-locked loop and PR regulator to control the grid current to track the desired reference in phase with the grid voltage.

To enhance the system&#x2019;s frequency and voltage self-adjustment ability, a control strategy based on virtual synchronous generator (VSG) technique for the BES-qZSI PV power system is proposed in this paper. By introducing the concept of synchronous generator, the BES-qZSI PV power system has the characteristics of heavy moment of inertia, droop frequency-active, droop characteristic of Voltage-reactive power and so on.

But their need for expensive sensors and complex monitoring as well as control subsystems hinders their expansion. Estimating parameters of each module can substantially reduce the number of required sensors and/or communication components. However, the existing estimation methods for cascaded modular circuits neglect important parameters such as the internal resistance of the battery, resulting in large systematic errors and bias. This paper proposes an online estimator based on a dual-Kalman-filter (DKF) that exploits the slow dynamics of the battery compared to the load. The DKF algorithm estimates the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and internal resistance of each module by measuring only the output voltage and current of the system. Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed method is simpler and cheaper with only two sensors compared to N+2 (N is number of modules). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves a fast convergence through optimal learning rate. Simulations and experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed approach, achieving &lt;1.5% and &lt;5% estimation error for OCV and the internal resistance, respectively.

A 165.4-kWh daily electric load is established on the basis of a community-type profile, with a 20.5-kW peak load and a load factor of 0.34. Using simulation built-in features from HOMER Pro, optimum sizing for both a load profile driven by night-time energy demand and a load profile driven by day-time energy demand is carried out. A proposed solar-PV generation system, for a load driven by night-time energy demand, consists of an 81.5-kW solar PV generation system, a 657-kWh storage capacity, and a 44.87-kW DC-AC converter. On the other hand, a proposed solar-PV generation system, for a load driven by day-time energy demand, consists of a 103-kW solar PV generation system, a 443-kWh storage capacity, and a 29.2-kW DC-AC converter. A levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) approach is used for comparison purposes. Also, net present cost (NPC) is calculated for the proposed energy supply alternatives. It is concluded that for comparative cost analysis key aspects, such electric load profile and its correlation with solar radiation availability on hourly basis, play a significant role.

At present, the research on modulation strategy is basically symmetric phase shift, but it is not enough to generalize modulation strategy comprehensively. In this paper, an asymmetric phase-shifting strategy is proposed to control the power flow by simultaneously adjusting the asymmetric duty cycle and the phase-shifting angle. With this modulation scheme, the current stress and cyclic power loss can be reduced by adjusting the modulation ratio of the inductor current waveform. As a result, the light-load efficiency can be improved compared with the conventional symmetric modulation scheme. The power characteristic, current stress, soft switching characteristic and backflow power of this modulation strategy are analyzed and calculated comprehensively. Then, based on this asymmetric strategy, a hybrid modulation strategy that can achieve ZVS over the entire power range with low current stress, low return power and minimum rms current at light load is proposed. Finally, a 100V to 50V/300W prototype is built to verify the analysis.

Monitoring of the charge propagation along the single fiber has been performed using dielectric polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) fibers obtained by the electrospinning (ESP) method under the electron beam inside the scanning electron microscope chamber. The mechanical effect of the electron beam on the polymer fibers has been detected in a time-lapse mode. The influence of the polymer surface irregularities and mechanical defects on the fiber charging has been demonstrated. Plasma mechanism is typical not only for electrophysical phenomena but also for the control of mechanical movement of the fibers by the electron beam and the charge propagation during electron-beam-induced melting and in the presence of hydrodynamic polymer flows. It is assumed that the mechanical effect in the methods using an electron beam (and plasma on the dielectric surface) as an impact source can be determined by the following factors: pressure of the electron beam and the electric field, contribution of the secondary emission, thermal/thermomechanical factors, and dynamic balance or competition between all the forces affecting the sample (electron-beam pressure, gravity pressure, recoil pressure during evaporation, vapor pressure/surface tension, and so on). In addition to purely scientific interest, the above phenomena are also of significant applied interest since the influence of the polymer fiber charging on the separation procedure of aerosols in nonwoven filters is well known, and hence, charging of such polymer fibers is important for some energy storage devices.

Furthermore, in these architectures, each ALU operation requires fetching one instruction, generating one to three addresses, and accessing memory elements one to three times, imposing significant control and access overhead. SIMD architectures can alleviate these overheads. In SIMD, multiple ALUs perform the same instruction, and the processing unit accesses multiple consecutive words at once. Therefore, the control and access overhead is amortized among ALU operations. However, SIMD units cannot efficiently exploit the word-level parallelism for (i) operations with data/position dependency or (ii) operations with divergence (where different operations are performed on different words). A recent work, Fulcrum, proposes a subarray-level PIM design with high parallelism. This paper discusses how Fulcrum alleviates the control and access overhead while exploiting word-level parallelism for operations with data/position dependency and divergence.

The thesis of this work is that ICT is the predominant factor in the context of I4.0. To justify this claim, the progress of the scientific fields from which this factor consists is elaborated and its impact on other factors is highlighted with emphasis on the societal impact. It is claimed that the eventual fusion of these factors will lead to a single technological continuum. The eventual fusion of all factors is made possible because they all exploit a common technological (hardware) framework while we are entering the era where we can regulate and superintend a vast amount of heterogeneous technologies via open software. In the context of I4.0, this results in a tremendous boost in productivity as it will allow a user to switch between different activities dynamically. Moreover, through this process a whole rank of middlemen is made redundant, cutting down costs and inefficiencies. Finally, one-click customisation will rationalise production, creating the conditions where overproduction will gradually die out, promoting the resilience of the economy. Therefore, ICT-enabled I4.0 will redefine the notions of 'production' and 'work', as it will allow us to overcome over-fragmentation in specialisation, while reshaping our cities, our personal lives and our relationship with science. © 2021 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

In order to extract the full hydrograph, we also extrapolate the high and low flows outside of the range of operation of turbines, by employing empirical rules for representing the rising and falling limbs of the simulated hydrographs. This framework is demonstrated on a real-world system at Evinos River basin, Greece. By taking advantage of the proposed methodology, SHPPs may act as potential hydrometric stations and improve the existing information in poorly gauged areas. © 2021 IAHS.","efficiency curves; hydropower; renewable energy; run-of-river plants; simulation; uncertainty",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121421190

This has proliferated the use of power electronic based devices giving rise to a serious issue of deteriorating power quality (PQ) in the distribution system. In this context, this article presents a photovoltaic (PV) integrated unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) operating with a adaptive compensating technique based on variable leaky least mean square (VLLMS) algorithm. It is a soft computing oriented method that offers quicker convergence to the desired condition in an iterative approach keeping the weight of the updating parameters within the specified limit. VLLMS based algorithm eliminates the use of low pass or moving average filter for the extraction of fundamental components from polluted source voltage and load current to generate reference signal for the switching of shunt as well as series voltage source converters (VSC) of the UPQC. Due to the involvement of feed forward component of PV in the compensating technique of shunt VSC, it efficiently and smoothly manages power balance between grid, load and PV besides resolving the power quality issues of current harmonics and poor power factor at PCC. It also ensures the regulation of DC link voltage. The series converter maintains pure sinusoidal voltage at the load terminal irrespective of sag/swell and harmonics present in the grid voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified through simulation as well as hardware implementation under different static and dynamic operating conditions.

In practice, energy storage such as batteries can be adopted to reduce the PV energy discarding in such cases. On the other hand, concerning the system overall cost, single-stage series power converter configurations are becoming attractive. Such configurations bring more flexibilities by integrating PV systems and batteries. However, the implementation of FAPC functions in series power converter configurations has not been systematically investigated. To fill this gap, the PRRC, PLC, and PRC strategies for series-PV-battery systems are developed in this paper. With the proposed strategies, the power ramp-rate/limiting/reserve constraints are maintained by the coordinated control of individual converters. The reserved power is then distributed among all converters depending on the available power of individual PV converters, battery power and state-of-charge (SoC) conditions. Experimental tests performed on a 1.6-kW system have validated the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

The additional energy demand of electric vehicles (EVs) may cause increased peak loads, leading to growing burdens on the power system. In this regard, microgrids allow to cover the energy demand of EVs utilizing local renewable energy resources and a battery storage system, thereby lowering the utilization of the power system. This paper discusses a self-consumption operational strategy for a real-world microgrid at the EUREF-Campus in Berlin, Germany. A rule-based control algorithm for the sustainable energy supply of EV charging stations is implemented and validated. Measurements are recorded with high resolution over three years from 2017 to 2019. The performance of the microgrid operation is assessed with regards to three distinct key indicators: self-consumption, autarky, and emission rate. The influence of selected operating parameters under real-world and ideal operating conditions are investigated. The results indicate that self-consumption and autarky rates are sensitive to the rated power capacity of a battery storage system rather than to its rated energy capacity. Moreover, the reduction of emissions through battery deployment for EV charging amounts up to 30% under ideal operating conditions. This underlines the potential of the microgrid concept for the sustainable application of EVs in urban areas.

They are crucial in electric energy conversion and processing and for motion (torque, speed, position) control in all industries, for better productivity, energy savings and for less harm to environment. Traveling field electric machines are still standard as synchronous and induction machines. The former (synchronous) need d.c. rotor excitation, or permanent magnets (PMs) or magnetically salient rotor to create a-fixed-to-rotor traveling field while the latter (induction) implies a cage (or wound) rotor winding. The average torque is non-zero as stator and rotor traveling fields are at standstill to each other.

High magnetic saliency is implicit and requires a high ratio of pole pitch to airgap and a distributed a.c. stator winding, in the hope to meet the IEC 4,5 standards of efficiency. On the other hand, better magnetic materials (with lower core losses) and higher fundamental frequency provided by pulse width modulation (PWM) static power converter (including silicon carbide (SIC) arrival) up to 1 kHz, in general, and the high price (and scarcity) of high energy PMs has triggered formidable R&#x0026;D worldwide efforts to investigate many machine topologies without and with PMs (mainly ferrites or bonded NdFeB of lower cost), with mainly concentrated a.c. widings based on the principle of &#x201C;flux-modulation&#x201D; provided by variable reluctance (magnetic anisotropy) concept.

However, it faces the challenges in multi-mode operation and smooth mode transition, which rely on the complex mode detection scheme and cumbersome parameter tuning. In this paper, the inherent limitation is analyzed through inconsistent frequency response and noncontinuous duty cycle operation region aspects. Then, a model predictive control (MPC) method characterized by tuning-free cost function is presented to achieve multi-mode control and smooth transition simultaneously. With the goal of ensuring the reference current tracking under inconsistent frequency response, a duty cycle and current ripples prediction are presented for all switching combinations. Then, a tuning-free cost function is utilized to overcome the gaps in noncontinuous duty cycle operation region and a smooth mode transition is achieved. Further, the robustness of the current tracking capability is analyzed mathematically considering the inductance variation and stray resistance variation. Finally, a comparative experiment proves the effectiveness. And it shows that the method can improve the efficiency by 0.4% compared with the traditional four-mode control.

A long-term (10-year) operation is conducted by incorporating grid outages, operating reserve, detailed models of electricity prices, and components capacity degradations and costs. The number of grid outages per year as well as the days, starting time and duration of the outages are adopted using probability distribution functions. Interest and escalation rates are updated in each year of operation to update the retail price, feed-in-tariff, and penalty rate of the electricity provider for the unsupplied power during grid outages. A novel operation strategy is developed for islanded and grid-connected modes of operation. The renewable-battery system is optimized for two cases: 1) a resilient system without load interruption, and 2) a resiliency-constrained system with partial load interruption. A case study in South Australia is conducted by incorporating the load profile of an educational campus and the actual weather data for a project lifetime of 10 years. The resiliency-oriented optimal planning model is compared to the same system optimized by short-term data. It is found that the resiliency-constrained system achieves lower cost, battery capacity, and dumped energy with limited unsupplied energy compared to the resilient system which has zero unsupplied energy. The proposed long-term resilient system is found to need 2.2 MWh battery capacity to efficiently supply 17.58 MWh electricity during the grid outages.

The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources introduces several risks, and efficient energy storage technologies are developed to circumvent such issues. However, these storage methods also come with additional costs and uncertainties. Hydrogen is considered a viable option as an energy carrier and storage medium, offering versatility to the energy mix. This study reviews hydrogen production, storage, transmission, and applications avenues, describes the current global hydrogen market and compares national hydrogen strategies. A framework for evaluating the relative competitiveness of natural gas-exporting countries as hydrogen exporters is developed.

The design’s fabrication would comprise of locally available materials. The aim of the design is to save energy resources applied in tobacco curing processes such as solar, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal, electricity, firewood, and paddy husks as is the case in Sri Lanka. Several researchers have worked to introduce new fuel sources in tobacco curing. There has also been a major focus on structural improvement of tobacco barns through raising barn interior insulation levels, selection of ideal construction materials as well as plugging all existing and potential thermal leakage points during regular maintenance. No research has been carried out focusing on introduction of thermal energy storage systems to complement other energy utilization efficiency initiatives being taken. This paper specifically designs a thermal energy storage system comprising of brickwork and a steel dome as an energy efficiency improvement measure in tobacco curing.

Despite being in its infancy, significant efforts have been made in the development of high-efficient materials and in understanding the fundamental processes. However, little attention has been given to device architecture and scalability, which may prove equally important in bringing this technology closer to commercialization. This work is the first attempt at upscaling SRFCs, proposing an innovative 25 cm2 photoactive-area device: the SolarFlow25 cell. A computational fluid dynamics model is developed to implement design key features aiming at: maximizing light absorption by the semiconductor, ensuring effective diffusion and convection of redox species, and guaranteeing minimal electronic and ionic transport resistances. After being connected to a redox flow cell (RFC), the combined SRFC/RFC device is used to photocharge–discharge a ferrocyanide/anthraquinone (2,7-AQDS) chemistry continuously. A nanostructured hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoelectrode combined in series with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) produces an unbiased photocurrent of ≈40 mA. The solar-to-output-electricity-efficiency remains stable at ≈0.44%, fourfold higher than any other reported hematite-driven SRFC. The guidelines provided here are expected to help design and upscale future SRFC devices, making solar energy accessible in decentralized locations. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","ferrocyanide/anthraquinone; hematite photoelectrodes; large-area devices; solar energy storage; solar-redox flow cells","Cell engineering; Cyanides; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Hematite; Light absorption; Solar energy; Engineering challenges; Ferrocyanide/anthraquinone; Haematite; Hematite photoelectrode; Large area devices; Photoelectrode; Redox flow cell; Solar energy storages; Solar-redox flow cell; Upscaling; Computational fluid dynamics",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120922913

In such microgrids, the installation of two or more battery energy storage (BES) units is utilized to compensate the power imbalance between the sources and loads. Nevertheless, energy management with numerous BES units does not simultaneously consider the impacts of distributed generators (DGs) and constant power loads (CPLs). Since the inaccurate current sharing will shorten the lifetime of the batteries and cause instability problem, this article proposes a distributed secondary <formula> <tex> $H_{&#x221E;}$ </tex> </formula> consensus approach based on the dynamic event-triggered communication method to realize accurate current sharing and efficient operation in the presence of numerous DGs and CPLs. First, the whole state-space function model of the dc microgrid consisting of DGs, batteries, resistive loads, and CPLs, is first built in detail. This model is further transformed into standard linear heterogeneous multiagent systems, which provides an indispensable preprocessing for advanced control strategy application. Then, the distributed secondary <formula> <tex> $H_{&#x221E;}$ </tex> </formula> consensus approach based on the foresaid systems is designed to achieve accurate current sharing. For reducing the communication among batteries and the controller updating frequency, the dynamic event-triggered communication method is proposed.

Additionally, the proposed method can not only avoid the Zeno behavior, but also obtain the lowest bound of the sampled time interval. Finally, the numerical simulation results and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

The waste heat is released to the environment at a temperature of 38°C. This study aims to analyze the current situation and propose a sustainable solution to valorize these losses. According to the available data, it is proposed to use the heat for the refrigerated storage of ammonia through absorption machines. In fact, Ammonia is currently stored in the same chemical plant at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of-33°C. To keep it in a liquid state, large amounts of heat must be continuously removed by a compression refrigeration cycle. By switching to absorption heat pumps, most of the necessary energy can be drawn from the thermal discharges of the sulfuric unit. A comprehensive technical feasibility study was conducted in the present work to achieve this aim. The proposed solution is to use a heat recovery loop for the production of hot water from this waste. The hot water is then used to drive a half-effect absorption machine, running on NH3-LiNO3, which will keep ammonia at the liquid state. The heat recovery loop was simulated using HYSYS while the absorption refrigeration calculations were carried out using the Oldham and Merkel diagrams. According to these calculations, a COP of about 0.25 was obtained which is very significant for an absorption refrigeration cycle running on waste heat and cooling down to-33°C. The obtained results can serve as a valuable basis to guide future research efforts and decision-making in this regard. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Absorption refrigeration; Ammonia storage; COP; HYSYS; Sulfuric acid; Waste heat recovery","absorption; ammonia; pollutant removal; removal experiment; sulfuric acid; thermodynamics; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120879104

While computation offloading is a key feature in MEC to enable real-time services, offloading workflow tasks in MEC is an NP-hard problem. Typically, the problem of multi-workflow offloading with multi-objective optimization is still an open and challenging issue. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm called CHCE to minimize the cost and energy consumption of multi-workflow execution under the deadline constraint. Firstly, the sub-deadline constraint is added during initialization to generate more initial solutions that satisfy the deadline constraint. Then an adaptive clustering method is adopted to guide individuals to find a suitable mate during crossover operation. Finally, the probabilities of crossover and mutation are dynamically adjusted based on the historical information to control the evolution direction and convergence speed of algorithm.

It is essential to consider the effects of bilateral energy trading among multiple stakeholders at the planning level. In this paper, a bi-level robustly game-based planning framework is proposed for DN and MGs. To address the multiple non-convexities of traditional robust planning problems, a linear robust counterpart is developed to model the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. Then, the non- continuous robust planning problem is further transformed into an iterative process by alternating optimization procedure (AOP) for the proof of Nash equilibrium (NE) and convergence of distributed algorithms. In each iteration, the upper level utilizes the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to clear the bilateral transaction electricity and payments in the convex subset generated by the lower level, while the lower level determines the individual planning problem locally with fixed transaction contracts obtained from the upper level. It is proved that the bi-level planning framework benefits all investors and minimizes social costs. Meanwhile, distributed algorithms are adopted to ensure the synchronization and privacy of stakeholders. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

We aim to minimize their long-term operational cost by optimally distributing workload among data centers and operating energy storage. However, future spatio-temporally variant uncertainties in both workload and electricity prices have been the main impediment for a performanceguaranteed online data center operation strategy. To address this issue, we develop a fully distributed online algorithm that decouples workload distribution and storage operation across the network and time by introducing well-designed virtual queues for workload and batteries into the framework of Lyapunov optimization. Theoretically, an analytical gap between the long-term operational cost achieved by our algorithm and the theoretical optimum is provided to corroborate the desirable operation strategy. Extensive simulations using the real-world workload and electricity price data demonstrate the cost-delay tradeoff that our algorithm strikes and validate the theoretical results that we obtained.

This reaction is of importance as NaBH4 is considered as a hydrogen storage material. Nowadays, hydrogen is thought to be one of the most promising and efficient clean energy carriers. In order to control the rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), one has to understand the mechanism of its production. The H2O/D2O KIE of the reactions of NaBH4 and NaBD4 with water was studied in solutions containing a ratio of H2O/D2O = 1.00. The separation factor, α, of both reactions is α = 5.0 ± 1.0.

In order to handle the uncertainty and fluctuation of the wave power, the power system is generally designed to be highly dependent on short-time energy storage facilities such as battery packs. This means the cost of energy storage facility tends to dramatically increase when a large wave farm is deployed.Considering wave energy is more continuous and predictable among the renewable energy matrix, this paper proposes a model predictive control algorithm to realise the continuous power set-point tracking of a single 6 degree-of-freedom point absorber with multiple power take-off units, to mitigate the dependence of the energy storage in offshore power supply. The key controller settings that determine the power quality of the wave energy converter is analysed over various power set-points. Furthermore, the performance of power set-point tracking is assessed over significant wave heights and peak periods. It is found that although the power set-point tracking algorithm only achieves 10-27% of power generation capacity at the expense of reducing power fluctuation, the controlled point absorber is still capable to serve as a high-quality power source in some of offshore scenarios.

Nevertheless, the analysis of CLLC still remains challenging because of its complex multi-resonant nature and several storage elements. In this paper, a circuit analysis method based on change of variables is presented that maps the state space equations into two decoupled sets of equations. The analyses are carried out in two state-plane coordinate systems, then the results are mapped onto the original region. The proposed method is then used to thoroughly analyze the CLLC resonant converter operating in the continuous conduction mode (CCM). The voltage and current stresses of components, zero voltage switching condition, output voltage gain, output characteristic diagram, and mode boundary of CCM/DCM are then obtained. The accuracy of the proposed approach is verified by the experiments on a 3 kW bidirectional CLLC resonant converter with GaN transistors as the primary and secondary side switches. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed state plane analysis of the CLLC resonant converter operating in either direction of power transferring.

Research on blend films prepared through solution casting are typically done to investigate their properties, however, electrospun fibers are of particular interest especially on technologies requiring mechanically robust and high surface area functional materials. In this work, poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(ionic liquid) (PVdF/PIL) nanofibers were produced through electrospinning. The PIL, poly(1-hexyl-3-vinyl imidazolium bromide), was synthesized through sonochemical solventless reaction followed by free radical polymerization. The structures of the synthesized IL and PIL were confirmed using FT-IR,1 H-NMR and13 C-NMR spectroscopy. Pseudocapacitor prototypes consisting of electrodeposited ZnO-based electrodes and the electrospun PVdF/PIL nanofibers as the polymer electrolyte were then fabricated at varied PIL concentrations. Contact angle measurements using sessile drop method revealed the decreasing wettability of the fibers attributed to the inherent hydrophobic nature of both the PVdF and PIL. Scanning electron micrographs also showed that increasing fiber diameters were obtained as the PIL concentration increases. In addition, cyclic voltammetry results showed that the calculated areal capacitance also increases with increasing PIL concentration. The development of pseudocapacitor assemblies utilizing ZnO-based electrodes and electrospun polymer electrolyte-separator membranes presents a better promise for the next-generation energy storage devices. © 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Electrospinning; Nanofibers; Polyionic liquid; Polymer electrolyte; Pseudocapacitors","Casting; Contact angle; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Fluorine compounds; Free radical polymerization; Free radicals; Functional materials; II-VI semiconductors; Industrial research; Ionic liquids; Nanofibers; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Polyelectrolytes; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid electrolytes; Zinc oxide; Electrospuns; Ionic liquid concentrations; Poly(ionic liquid)s; Poly(vinylidene fluoride); Polyionic liquid; Polymer electrolyte; Polymerized ionic liquids; Property; Pseudocapacitors; Synthesised; Electrospinning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120529205

In this work, an intelligent controller is proposed for a DC microgrid that comprises a wave energy converter and a hybrid energy storage system. A wave energy converter oscillating in heave, which drives a linear permanent magnet generator as a power take-off (PTO) mechanism, is used in this study. Additionally, HESS, consisting of battery and supercapacitor, is used for power quality improvement and DC bus voltage regulation. The DC bus connects with each system component through dedicated power converters, with the WEC device using an active rectifier, and the HESS (battery and ultra-capacitor) utilising two bidirectional DC-DC converters. In the paper, a model is derived for the individual components of the microgrid. Then, Lyapunov-based intelligent controllers are designed for the power converters in such a way that they achieve the control objectives.

This article proposes an approach to maximize economic benefit among MGs through cooperative scheduling. The cooperative scheduling is achieved via price signals so that MGs are encouraged to share power among themselves for economic benefit. An MG operator generates a time-variable tariff based on energy trading status so that the parking lot operator and distributed battery energy storage system aggregator participate with flexibility in the MG&#x2019;s energy management. The Shapley value method is used for generating fair price signals. The stochastic Dantzig&#x2013;Wolfe decomposition is used to solve the resulting optimization problem in a decentralized manner. The uncertainties related to load demand and renewable energy sources are captured using scenario-based methods, whereas the uncertainty associated with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is modeled using copula theory based estimation. The simulation studies and comparison with the existing methods establish that the proposed approach effectively reduces the total energy cost in a decentralized manner with the minimum amount of information exchange.

However, as variable renewable energy sources see greater deployment in energy markets, baseload is becoming increasingly less competitive relative to flexible, dispatchable generation. Herein, we employ reservoir simulations and optimization modeling to investigate the potential for EGS power plants to adapt to this new market paradigm by providing flexible generation and energy storage services. A novel geothermal system design is considered whereby energy is stored as pressure within an engineered geothermal reservoir, and is used to drive greater production flow than would otherwise be achievable during periods of high electricity demand. Based on multi-physics reservoir simulations, we develop a linear optimization model that captures the transient pressure and flow behaviors within the geothermal reservoir. We use this model to optimize the investment decisions and hourly operations of a first-of-a-kind flexible geothermal plant against a set of historical and modeled future electricity price series. We find that operational flexibility and energy storage can provide significant benefits for a geothermal plant in a market with high electricity price volatility, with revenue improvements of 4%-52% compared to a baseload plant operating on the same price series. Surface generating facilities are oversized by up to 41% in order to take advantage of the greater flow rates provided by reservoir pressurization.

The proposed quadratic convex model uses Taylor’s series expansion to transform the product between voltage variables in the power balance equations into a linear combination of them. Numerical simulations in the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) for both models show small differences in the daily energy losses, which are lower than 3.00 %. The main advantage of the proposed quadratic model is that its optimal solution is achievable with interior point methods guaranteeing its uniqueness (convexity properties of the solution space and objective function), which is not possible to guarantee with the exact nonlinear non-convex model. The 30-bus DC test feeder with four distributed generators (with power generation forecast via artificial neural networks with errors lower than 1 % between real and predicted generation curves) and three batteries is used to validate the proposed convex and exact models. Numerical results obtained by GAMS show the effectiveness of the proposed quadratic convex model for different simulation scenarios tested, which was confirmed by the CVX tool for convex optimization in MATLAB. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial neural networks; Battery energy storage systems; Direct current distribution networks; Economic dispatch; Quadratic convex approximation; Taylor’s series expansion","Battery storage; Convex optimization; Electric batteries; Electric load dispatching; Energy dissipation; MATLAB; Neural networks; Battery energy storage systems; Convex approximation; Convex models; Direct current distribution network; Direct current distributions; Economic Dispatch; Optimal operation; Quadratic convex approximation; Series expansion; Taylor’s series expansion; Scheduling",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119848685

The new juvenile individuals from this nursery area are directly recruited into the adult squat lobster population, which is exploited by industrial fisheries. Despite the importance of new P. monodon juveniles for recruitment estimations in fishery management models, their bioenergetic condition and/or nutritional status at the onset of their benthic phase remain unknown, as are the differences in the biochemical composition and energy reserves of the two sexes, which could help explain the cost of the first breeding event in females. Therefore, in new juvenile squat lobsters with the same degree of immaturity, we quantified and compared between the sexes (female vs. male): the size (cephalothorax length, CL), body biomass (dry weight and organic matter), biochemical composition (proteins, glucose, and lipids), and fatty acid profiles (FAs). The results indicate that the CL of new juveniles was similar between the sexes, while the dry weight and organic matter presented significant differences, with higher values in new juvenile females (NJF) than new juvenile males (NJM). Similarly, the NJF had a higher content of proteins, glucose, and lipids than NJM. The FAs also showed significant differences between the sexes; the NJF had a higher content than NJM in all fatty acid classes (i.e., saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated), with the FAs DHA (C22:6n-3), EPA (C20:5n-3), oleic (C18:1n-9), palmitic (C16:0), and eicosatrienoic (C20:3n-3) significantly contributing to the differentiation of FA profiles between the sexes. All of the aforementioned differences among the multiple variables of the bioenergetic condition can indicate biochemical adaptations in the storage capacity of energy reserves, particularly among NJF that must support the high energy cost of the first reproductive event (characterized by embryo production and incubation), which occurs during the austral winter, a period predominated by cold-water temperatures and scarce food availability in the habitat. Overall, our findings have significant implications in fishery management models. In this case, defining the bioenergetic condition of the new juvenile squat lobsters can aid in predicting the density and stability of the adult population, which is exploited by commercial fisheries. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","benthic phase; bioenergetic condition; breeding area; crustaceans; fishery; nutritional status",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119837886

Particular interest exists for the Magnetically Insulated Diode (MID) configurations used for high power generation of negative or positive ion beams. Our previous work [1-3] regarding numerical simulations using 1-D multi-fluid code [4] in cylindrical geometry enable us to investigate both the spatio-temporal evolution of the plasma species in MID configurations and the high power extracted negative ion beam (H- or D-). The code allows evaluating the extracted high-current beam for different initial, physical parameters of the MID (externally applied electric and magnetic fields), of the plasma (density, species, temperature) and geometrical parameters. The interaction of high current ion beam with suitable targets enables producing relative high neutron flux for material tests or other industrial applications (e. g. radionuclides of different species). In the present work numerical investigations using the elaborated version of the 1-D multi-fluid code enables to improve the diode operation by studying the spatio-temporal evolution of the ion specie for different initial parameters of the diode in order to optimize the extracted high current. This parametric study allows to increase both the pulse duration of the ion beam up to 0.5 μs - 1 μs and the final extracted current (protons or deuterons) up to 14 kA. The accelerating voltage could vary from 400 keV to 1.2 MeV. The ion source is originated from plasmas formed by ionizing a gas or clusters (by electric discharge or laser beam) close to the diode electrode and feeds the pulse duration of the MID operation, in order to extract the long pulse high current ion beam (typically protons or deuterons). For the neutron production we use the extracted high current deuteron (d) beam to interact with a Be target [9Be (d, n) 10B] which presents a relatively high yield up to 3x10-5 n/d, comparing to other targets and with neutron energy spectrum similar to nuclear reactors. The above parameters of the proposed device enable to produce a relatively high neutron flux up 1012–1014 n/cm2 for an operation of several minutes of at a rep. rate of 20 Hz. Alternatively, the use of the proposed high-current deuteron beam with targets implanted with deuterons or 3H (tritium) increase the spectrum of the produced neutrons to energies with interest to test materials for Tokamak blankets. © 2021 47th EPS Conference on Plasma Physics, EPS 2021.

Such large scale curtailed electricity could be used to produce hydrogen via Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) technology. The introduction of P2H would largely affect the configuration of both power grid and the hydrogen supply chain (HSC). This paper proposes a coordinated planning model of power system generation and transmission (GT) as well as HSC with transportable seasonal hydrogen storage. A co-planning model is put forward to investigate the optimal configuration of infrastructures in the GT-HSC and their coupling during operation. The model is formulated as LP model so that the year-round energy balance of seasonal hydrogen storage with daily resolution could be considered. Case studies on 5-bus PJM system and Northwest China HRP-38 system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results of the case study also illustrate the benefits of incorporating GT with HSC to reduce the renewable energy curtailment and bring down the energy supply cost.

However, the power quality on the load side will be severely deteriorated when the microgrid is disturbed. To cope with this issue, an improve linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) technique is proposed in this paper. In this technology, the idea of series correction is introduced into the disturbance observation channel of linear extended state observer (LESO). This strategy can achieve more accurate tracking of disturbance items through the correction link (CL), and handle the unknown modeling error and external disturbances of the system as an overall disturbance through a single structure. Then according to the linear feedback law to achieve good control of the output-side converter. Moreover, the traceability, convergence and stability of ILADRC are analyzed. More importantly, guidance on parameters configuration is given on the basis of performance analysis. Finally, the validity of the proposed improved LADRC technique is verified on a 40-kW experiment platform.

Demand Response (DR) service provision takes place via aggregators and special distribution-level markets (e.g., flexibility markets), where small, distributed DR resources, such as building energy management systems, electric vehicle charging stations, micro-generation and storage, connected to the low-voltage distribution grid, offer DR services. In such systems, energy balancing (and thus, also DR decisions) have to be made close to real-time. Thus, market clearing algorithms for DR service provision must fulfill several requirements related to the efficiency of their operation. More specifically, a DR market clearing algorithm needs to be optimal in terms of cost-efficiency, scalable in terms of number of assets and locations, and able to satisfy real-time constraints. In order to cope with these challenges, this paper presents a distributed DR market clearing algorithm based on Lagrangian decomposition, combined with an optimal cloud resource allocation algorithm for assigning the required computation power. A heuristic algorithm is also presented, able to achieve a near-optimal solution, within negligible computational time. Simulations, performed on a testbed, demonstrate the computational burden introduced by various DR models, as well as the heuristic algorithm&#x0027;s near-optimal performance. The resource allocation algorithm is able to service multiple DR requests (e.g. in multiple distribution networks), and minimize the cost of computational resources while respecting the execution time constraints of each request. This enables third parties to offer cost-efficient and competitive DR operation as a service.

Various kinds of DER aggregators including demand response aggregators (DRAGs), energy storage aggregators (ESAGs), electric vehicle (EV) charging stations (EVCSs), dispatchable distributed generation aggregators (DDGAGs), and renewable energy aggregators (REAGs) are modeled. To handle unbalanced distribution grids with single-phase aggregators, a linearized unbalanced power flow is tailored to model operating constraints of the distribution grid with various aggregators.

On one hand, these grids can present a low capacity, on the other the line lengths are not negligible due to natural obstacles and altitude changes. As a consequence, the voltage drops are remarkable when several power loads are fed by the low voltage section. Basing on this aspect, a novel evolution of ski-resorts power grids towards microgrids is pursued to improve the power system quality of service and to foster the implementation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The paper examines the AC electrical distribution system installed in the ski-resort of San Vito di Cadore, Italy. A preliminary power flow analysis identifies bottlenecks on voltage profiles and weights effective solutions to evolve the power grid. Four system configurations are contrasted in terms of voltage drop in order to establish the most convenient redesign. A proper voltage profile along the entire ski-resort is ensured by the last solution which redistribute the loads powering among the five resorts substations. Finally, a techno-economical-environmental analysis explores the possibility of installing DER and storage to feed the resort loads.

The IMCORSs are the first indirect matrix converters (IMC) with an open-end rectifier stage, creating a new category of IMC. The IMCORS is a full-controlled and partial-bidirectional power flow converter. By replacing four active/controlled switches of the rectifier stage of the IMCORS with four diodes, two new configurations are proposed with reduced active switch count, resulting in reduced costs and increased efficiency. Also, by adding an inverting link to the DC-link of the rectifier stage of the IMCORS (which enables the bidirectional power flow operation), another converter is proposed. The IMCORSs topologies are suitable for wind energy conversion systems (WECS). The zero DC-link current commutation and the space vector modulation (SVM) applied to the proposed converters provide a unity power factor for the input system, reduction of power losses, and decrease the complexity of the commutation when compared to classical matrix converters.

For this purpose, a system composed by photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), diesel generator (DG), and battery bank (BB) as well as for storing the energy in the electrical form to meet the load. In the present paper we are interested in evolutionary algorithms for solving optimization problem of hybrid renewable energy system. A new meta-heuristic algorithm namely whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used to solve optimization problem of cost of energy (COE) and total net present cost (TNPC) including reliability evaluation by using basic probabilistic concept in order to find Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP). The WOA mimics the social behavior of humpback whales. This algorithm is inspired by the bubble-net hunting strategy. Three recent algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and modified grey wolf optimizer (M-GWO) are also implemented in this work. For examining the accuracy, stability, and robustness of proposed optimization technique two case studies have been tested.

Most of the rivers originate from high mountains and are considered as snow fed rivers. Hence the impact of climate change on snow and glacier affects such rivers. In this study, snow and glacier are delineated from LANDSAT TM7 image by ERDAS IMAGINE and melt discharge is estimated by Energy Budget Method (EBM) along with the conceptual TANK model. Runoff generated from the watershed along with precipitation in non-glacerised area are given as inputs to HEC-HMS for simulating discharge of the whole basin. The significance of snow and glacier melt contribution at different downstream stations is assessed. Finally, future precipitation and temperature data obtained using AR5 scenario is used to assess the significance of climate change in river flow. From the analysis it is found that Koshi basin (1.62%) is covered by larger areas of glacier than that of the Mahakali basin (1.16%). The maximum contribution of snow and glacier in Koshi at Chatara and Mahakali at Chameliya are 12.02% and 17.35% respectively. While analysing the effect of climate change on the hydropower potential for storage project, it is observed that most of the sub-basins will have decreased volume of annual flow in 2030 A.D., but that will increase in 2050 A.D. There will be an increase in flow volume in Mahakali in the year 2030 A.D. and 2050 A.D. But for RoR project designed at Q40 flow volume will increase in both 2030 A.D. and 2050 A.D. in Koshi and Mahakali basin. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AR5; EBM; ERDAS IMAGINE; Glacier; HEC-HMS; Hydropower; Snow",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119128160

Depending on the type of original phosphate rock, the microstructure of phosphogypsum may differ, determining its main physical-mechanical properties. However, research with comparative analyses of the properties of phosphogypsum from different origins is almost inexistent. Therefore, in this study, the microstructure of phosphogypsum from two different sources is analysed: the first type is from Kovdor mine (Russia); the second is a mixture between material from Kirov (Russia) and Casablanca (Morocco) mines. The microstructure of both phosphogypsum types was analysed and compared by applying SEM-DES analysis and by measuring the loss on ignition. In order to obtain high mechanical properties, the material was processed by press-forming.

However, the narrow connection between the fin and the bulk region for FinFET inhibits the charge collection compared to the planar transistor structure. In this work, heavy ion tests were conducted for 16 nm bulk FinFET dual-port SRAM at two high linear energy transfers (LETs) of 60 MeV&#x2219;cm2/mg and 85 MeV&#x2219;cm2/mg. The non-saturating behavior of the SEU cross-sections and event cross-sections for a bit cell is observed even over the LET of 60 MeV&#x2219;cm2/mg due to the expanding of the sensitive area surrounding the array and the cutting-off area in the FinFET SRAM cells. The distribution curves of the MCU event probabilities for different MCU cluster sizes show the Single-bit upset (SBU) occupies the largest probability of all the single-event cluster sizes, which exhibits the inhibition capability of the Fin structure against the upsets induced by high energy particles. The parasitic bipolar effect is also serious for 16nm FinFET SRAM as former planar SRAM, but the charge sharing effect is effectively inhibited due to the narrow connection between the fin and the bulk region for FinFET. Results presented in this paper will help designers estimate the Error Correcting Code (ECC) and interleaving design parameters for radiation hardened SRAM designs at the 16 nm FinFET process.

As the most important technical index of a flash device, flash retention parameters often need to consume a substantial amount of time to be tested. With a view toward reducing the test period, the most popular method currently is to speed up the retention loss of flash memory at high temperatures. However, since the retention loss of flash memory is the result of a mixture of multiple failure mechanisms, the Arrhenius model with a single apparent activation energy (Eaa) has significant limitations in calculating the high-temperature acceleration factor for the retention loss of flash memory. In this paper, based on a large number of real experiments, we have studied the retention characteristics of the flash memory in high-temperature environments and closely tracked the change of Eaa at different temperatures, retention time and program/erase (P/E) cycle count. Experimental results show that the equivalent acceleration factor (AF) grows rapidly with retention time at the beginning of flash retention and that flash with a high P/E cycle count has a faster AF growth rate.

One of the most frequently adopted microprocessor design scheme is the von Neumann architecture.

This unceasing motion of data between these two components became a significant performance bottleneck. A lot of power, energy, and computational time are wasted in this communication. With Beyond von Neumann Computing (BvNC paradigms, calculations are performed inside or very close to a memory array. BvNC approaches are proposed in the literature, mainly based on modifications of existing memories, enabling simple computations. Others exploit emerging technologies to both store and compute data, using analog operations.

In this paper, we propose SuperVAULT, a novel secure storage solution for protecting secret data/keys by exploiting the superparamagnetic regime of nanomagnets. Through materials and dimensional engineering of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) free layer, the energy barrier of spintransfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STTMRAM) cells can be designed to lie in the range of the thermal energy (kBT ). Such superparamagnetic MTJ (s-MTJ) cells, with an O(10 ns) retention time, need to be refreshed frequently. In the absence of data refresh (under attack conditions), the data they hold is thermally corrupted to a random state after an arbitrary but short amount of time. We leverage this property to devise a secure memory primitive and showcase its potential against cold boot and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attacks. Further, the overheads for s-MTJ-based STT-MRAMs is shown to be promising for on-chip implementations.

The proposed model determines the optimal MESS sizes and transportation schedules as well as the optimal sizes and locations of wind-based distributed generators (DGs), photovoltaic (PV) DGs, and FCSs. The model takes into account techno-economic and environmental factors in addition to the power variations of RESs, FCSs, and load demands.

To realize the sustainable operation of smart transportation, we leverage solar-harvesting charging stations and rooftops to power electric autonomous vehicles(AVs) solely via design. With a fixed budget, our framework first optimizes the locations of charging stations based on historical spatial-temporal solar energy distribution and usage patterns, achieving (2+epsilon) factor to the optimal. Then a stochastic algorithm is proposed to update the locations online to adapt to any shift in the distribution. Based on the deployment, a strategy is developed to assign energy requests in order to minimize their traveling distance to stations while not depleting their energy storage. Equipped with extra harvesting capability, we also optimize route planning to achieve a reasonable balance between energy consumed and harvested en-route. As a promising application, utility optimization of shared electric AVs is discussed, and (2k+1)-approx algorithm is proposed to manage k vehicles simultaneously. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm can approach the optimal solution within 10-15% approximation error, improve the operating range of vehicles by up to 2-3 times, and improve the utility by more than 50% compared to other competitive strategies.

For instance, NASAs N3X airplane aims to curb jet fuel emissions with the aid of TeDP. However, it is crucial to analyze the survivability of the TeDP system during extreme conditions. The endogenous failure events are of specific interest as they were found to cause a significant number of accidents for commercial aircraft. While the distribution reconfiguration is necessary to meet the critical load demands under extreme failure events, it can also create a transient overload condition in the turboshaft engine. The power system survivability is further deteriorated in the presence of constant power loads. In this work, a mathematical analysis of the survivability of the system is presented to make the aircraft power system highly resilient to endogenous failure events. A power system collapse mitigation strategy is proposed by adding an energy storage system. Also, the analytical expressions are formulated to size the energy storage unit to prevent the system collapse. Various failure conditions are modeled using PSCAD/EMTDC to study the optimum energy storage required to prevent system collapse.

A particular type of interaction known as sub-synchronous control interaction (SSCI), with a purely electrical nature, has the potential to grow very rapidly and can cause severe damage to power grid infrastructure. This paper proposes an additional damping controller that allows mitigating the SSCI expeditiously. The proposed damping loop provides a very large impedance at the synchronous frequency and very low impedance at the sub-synchronous range. More importantly, it can be integrated into the control loop of the battery energy storage systems (BESS) without imposing a negative impact on the routine performance of the BESS. As BESSs are becoming more popular in power grids, thanks to their significant impacts on reliability and power quality, it is anticipated that the proposed approach will have a great implementation opportunity. Hence, the proposed mitigation solution is implemented in a hybrid plant and tested with a radial test system and a section of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power grid under a variety of operating conditions. The results show the efficiency and robustness of the mitigation solution even under different frequencies of oscillation and larges disturbances.

The DAB topology is preferable for EV charging systems due to galvanic isolation and bidirectional power flow capabilities, however this topology increases reactive current peak and loses zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation at light loads if it is not controlled with improved modulation strategies and proper reactive power optimization (RPO) algorithm. This paper proposes a mixed modulation method and a RPO algorithm based on power system concepts that reduce the reactive power and provide ZVS operation over a wide voltage range. The mixed modulation allows one of the bridges of DAB converter to run with 2-level while and other to run with 3-level square wave modulation. Due to the complexities associated with the analytical solution using time domain analysis, this paper develops detailed universal expressions of a DAB converter using harmonic analysis method. Analytical identification of ZVS boundaries and DSP implementation of RPO algorithm become easier with these universal expressions. Multiple modes analysis for different operational states are no longer required. Simulation models of the DAB converters have been developed to show the results with different modulation strategies. The theoretical analysis of modulation strategies, RPO algorithm and ZVS operation are validated by experimental results on a laboratory scale prototype. Results show that the proposed mixed modulation with RPO algorithm improve the DAB converter performance.

Experimental results of 26 benchmark functions show that the exploration and exploitation abilities of DBWO are greatly improved from previous work. Secondly, DBWO is applied in designing DNA storage sets, and compared with previous work, the lower bounds of storage sets are boosted by 9%&#x2013;37%. Finally, to improve the poor stabilities of sequences, the End-constraint is proposed in designing DNA storage sets. By measuring the number of hairpin structures, melting temperature, and minimum free energy, it is evaluated that with our innovative constraint, DBWO can construct not only a larger number of storage sets, but also enhance physical and thermodynamic properties of DNA storage sets.

To balance the various interests of the customers and the utility, this paper proposes a two-level scheduling algorithm to address voltage regulation by coordinating the customer-owned battery energy storage system (BESS) and utility-owned load tap changers (LTCs) in power distribution systems. The objective is to find the optimal operation scheduling for both BESSs and LTCs that simultaneously maximize the economic payback and satisfy system operation rules. For BESSs, a local optimization problem is formulated in a chance-constrained manner in major consideration of the economic performance. For the utility interest, a Markov decision process (MDP) and a computationally efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm are utilized to solve the optimal tap setting problem. To coordinate BESSs and LTCs, a global voltage adjustment is applied. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via simulations on the IEEE 13-node and 34-node distribution test feeders.

However, emerging technologies such as storage and demand response cannot deliver flexibility over long periods due to inherent energy limitations. In this article, we, therefore, inform the day-ahead scheduling of VPPs with forecast scenarios of the balancing stage, which are complemented with information on nonshiftable load, renewable generation, and electricity prices. These multivariate scenarios (incorporating both time and cross-variable dependencies) are obtained using a machine learning framework in which probabilistic forecasts are converted into time trajectories using a copula-based sampling. The model is enriched with a detailed representation of the intraday decision stage wherein all flexible resources are dynamically allocated over the daily horizon. To ensure the reliability of the solution, we take into full consideration the revenues and unit-specific costs related to the activation of reserves. Outcomes show that improving the representation of the intraday dispatch stage while relying on representative balancing uncertainties are two complementary components for increasing the quality of the VPP day-ahead strategy, which ultimately fosters its economic value.

This generally creates a high level of seismic force due to lack of ductility or large displacement demand due to uplift, resulting in damage to tanks. However, a more efficient approach could be using partially restrained connections to control both the deflection and force at the desired levels. In this paper, an innovative generation of anchorage system has been introduced by employing the Resilient Slip Friction Damper (RSFD) as a ductile self-centring hold-down system. This new tension-only damage-free anchorage mechanism mitigates the transmitted earthquake force to storage tanks by dissipating the input energy through friction without experiencing any damage, contrary to other common ductile yielding hold-downs. In this study, based on the numerical modelling of the tanks and the hold-downs performance (validated experimentally), a comparison has been conducted between the RSFD anchorage system with other ductile concepts (eg., necked-rod and buckling-restrained systems), considering three case studies with different tank aspect ratios. The proposed system is capable of considerably decreasing the transmitted force which leads to less seismic demand for designing the tank barrel as well as the foundation.

In this research work we focus on the improving the performance of the gasdiffusion electrode (GDE) for secondary Zn-air batteries. A new generation of GDE has been developed and tested in a half-cell configuration. The gas-diffusion layer was developed by heat treated at up to 300°C carbon black. A mixture of Ag and ('off has been used for the bi-functional catalyst in the active layer (AL). Preliminary studies of the gas-diffusion layer (GDL) with different carbon blacks and different ratios between the PTFE and carbon blacks showed that the most stable GDL is produced by Vulcan XC-72 carbon black teflonized with 60 % PTFE. The steady state polarization curves and the charge/discharge tests revealed a superior electrochemical performance of the heat treated carbon material employed in the GDL. © 2021.

This paper aims to address these challenges using a coordinated control strategy based on an improved reduced order generalized integrator (IROGI) for positive and negative sequence estimation (PNSE). The IROGIPNSE further enhances the control performance, by eliminating the effects of any DC component or unbalance in sensed voltages, on grid synchronization. The coordinated control strategy uses hysteresis scheme for current control. The hysteresis based current control requires fewer rotational transformations, and eliminates the need for PI/PIR regulators and notch filters for inner current control loops. This renders the control, computationally efficient. Moreover, the presented system is equipped to exhibit wind power levelling functionality, through a battery energy storage (BES). An approach, employing the region-specific wind speed frequency distribution graph, is utilized to constitute the power levelling operation modes. The effectiveness of the control scheme is demonstrated through test results on a prototype developed in the laboratory.

The upper and lower dc arms of T-AAMC are formed by half-bridge submodules and series devices for lower construction costs, while the ac arm uses full-bridge submodules to realize dc fault tolerance. Firstly, the arm phase-shift conducting modulation is applied for energy balance of converter stacks under wide-range operation by adjusting the arm phase-shift angle to match ac grid voltage and power factor. Then, the submodule number, power device number and submodule capacitance are evaluated for T-AAMC under optimized modulation design. Analyses illustrate that 43% submodules, 17% power devices and 44% energy storage requirement are reduced with the proposed topology than that with hybrid MMC. Furthermore, the closed-loop control system is designed to dynamically regulate the energy sharing between dc and ac stacks.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is qualitative/interpretive and uses of the concept of functional homomorphism of WR Ashby is used, establishing similarities between the way in which this ancient medicine considers the human being and their condition as healthy to transfer it to an organization that produces goods and/or services. Findings: A healthy organization is conceived as one constituted by an association of people regulated by a set of norms based on certain purposes in a state of harmonious balance of their physical and energetic dimensions. In that the physical refers to storage functions, regulation and allocation of resources; transformation of raw materials and inputs into goods and services; waste disposal, distribution and coordination and with information systems for management control, while energy is associated with the ability to act with its management and policies. Research limitations/implications: The current paper is a first theoretical proposal, which should be enriched with practical applications that feedback its conceptual formulation, thus contributing to its validation. Practical implications: A comprehensive organizational diagnostic method is made available. Social implications: The proposed method allows a comprehensive organizational diagnosis, considering the participation of all the actors that make up this type of social systems.

The proposed program is applied to a Multiple-Sources Multiple-Customers (MSMC) system, consisting of a shared centralized energy source, distributed Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Distributed Storage Elements (DSEs). The proposed program integrates a Deterministic Energy Management (DEM) strategy with a Tabu Search (TS)-based scheduling game to reduce the computational complexity while acknowledging the intermittent nature of RESs as well as the level of customers' comfort. Moreover, an equitable billing mechanism for charging customers based on their energy consumption and adherence to their assigned schedules is implemented. Simulations of the proposed program reveal that the TS-based algorithm offers similar energy generation costs and peak-to-average energy ratio (PAER) to those obtained with a benchmark Branch and Bound (BB) algorithm, with a significantly lower computational complexity, while being superior in computational complexity, energy costs and PAER to an algorithm based on Parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search (P-MCTS).

The results show that the transition to a circular, low carbon economy will significantly change the composition of municipal wastes, making thermochemical approaches more and more competitive. However, it does not mean that pyrolysis and gasification will outperform incineration in the field of traditional waste to energy. Novel thermochemical waste management approaches must not be viewed as competitors, but rather as the successors of the traditional mass-burn incineration. The transition to a circular, low carbon economy will result in an emergence of new needs, new products and thus in possibilities of new pyrolysis and gasification-based business models different from the waste to energy concept. Negative emissions, energy storage, stabilization of renewable grids as well as renewable fuels must be mentioned as examples of such new products. Thus, thermochemical processing technologies should be embedded into the wider concept of circular, low carbon economy as the source of energy for recycling, a technology of tertiary recycling of synthetic polymers and as a way to transform nonrecyclable rejects into fuels, negative emissions, and other marketable products.

However, an effective methodology for the assessment of such complaints is not yet available. Within this project, we investigate LFN from mining activities in the Netherlands, focusing on the extraction, processing, transportation and storage of oil, gas, salt and geothermal heat. Through a literature review and interviews with domain experts, methodologies have been derived with regards to 1) the prediction of LFN generation at the source, 2) observational techniques and 3) potential impacts on health. A broad low-frequency band is considered, spanning from the often-discarded infrasonic frequencies to up to 200 Hz.

While the conventional SRAM-based TCAM is high speed and bulky, there have been denser but slower and less reliable nonvolatile TCAMs using nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices. Meanwhile, some CMOS TCAMs using dynamic memories have been also proposed. Although dynamic TCAM could be denser than the 16T SRAM TCAM and more reliable than the nonvolatile TCAMs, CMOS dynamic TCAMs still suffer from the row-by-row refresh energy and time overheads. In this article, we propose dynamic TCAM using nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays (DyTAN), and utilize one-shot refresh (OSR) to solve the memory refresh problem. By exploiting the unique NEM relay characteristics, DyTAN outperforms the existing works in the balance between density, speed, and power efficiency. Compared with the 16T SRAM-based TCAM, the 5T CMOS dynamic TCAM, the 2T2R TCAM, and the 2FeFET TCAM, evaluations show that the proposed DyTAN reduces the write energy by up to 2.3x, 1.3x, 131x, and 13.5x, and improves the search energy-delay-product (EDP) by up to 12.7x, 1.7x, 1.3x, and 2.8x, respectively.

Gator uses a novel polymer bellows to pump pressurised water through a power take off system, while also providing a non-linear force response that reduces mooring line loads over traditional mooring lines. The Gator system is comprised of 4 distinct subsystems: The Gator pump, hydraulics, turbine, and electrical storage & control. The Gator pump is a polymer component that compresses under load, pumping water through check valves into the hydraulic system. The connected hydraulic system takes the pressurised water, regulates the pressure and flow rates with an accumulator, and provides a steady flow of water to the turbine, generating electricity. This paper will provide an overview of the technical development of the Gator system over several phases, which has focussed its adaptation for use in the aquaculture industry as an inline pump on cage mooring lines.

It is envisioned that the SST will be deployed to transport CO2 to marginal subsea fields with an annual CO2 storage capacity less than 1 million metric tons; volumes that do not justify a full subsea field development. The SST is designed to be a fully autonomous underwater vessel with a cargo capacity of over 17,000 metric tons. It is 155 m long and it has a 17 m diameter hull. The vessel may operate at a water depth of between 50 to 200 m in a weather-independent environment. Furthermore, it travels at a slow speed for minimal energy consumption and maximal range. During the offloading process, the SST will approach the subsea well and land on the seabed just outside the safety radius of the well. After that, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) will mate the offloading flowline to the SST, and the offloading process will start. The landing sequence is technically challenging for various reasons and warrants detailed analysis. First, the SST would have limited manoeuvrability due to the large inertia of the vessel and low effectiveness of the hydroplanes to provide steering at low speeds. Second, during the final phase before the SST lands, seabed boundary effects will intensify and lead to increased non-uniform, time-varying and drag-dominated load-effects. Third, the impact forces during landing should be minimised to allow for the lowest design load. Solving these technical challenges is crucial to meet SST's design goals of having the least possible control appendices for maximum efficiency/range, and minimal structural weight for the largest cargo capacity. This paper will describe the development of a fully coupled 2D planar model that considers the most relevant load-effects. This model is developed with the feasibility to implement any control schemes and has the potential to plug observers or control modules in future study.

The proposed converter has advantages of being a simple structure, a fewer number of components, a common ground, lower voltage stress, and wide voltage gain range. Compared with the conventional buck converters, the novel converter triples the effective duty cycle and lowers voltage stresses across the active switches. A 300 W/500 kHz GaN-based experimental prototype is built and tested to verify the correctness and validity, demonstrating a peak efficiency of 94.54% in step-down mode and a peak efficiency of 94.88% in step-up mode.

This study investigates the prospects of implementing hydrogen P2G technology in coupling the power system and the transportation system. A novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2 emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various CO2 emission cap scenarios. Results show unique decarbonization trajectories of the proposed coordinated planning model, in which IPTS prefers to decarbonizing the power sector firstly. When the power system reaches ultra-low carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100% CO2 emission reductions (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately 143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5% renewables curtailment. The integration of the P2G system can produce hydrogen by use of surplus RES generation to meet hydrogen demand of Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and to meet multi-day electricity supply imbalances.

Electrochemically-rechargeable liquids (ERLs) can be used to store both hydrogen and electrical energy in a convenient liquid form at ambient temperature and pressure. These ERLs can also be electrochemically charged and discharged using a variety of conversion-configuration options, which enables highly flexible energy-storage systems. Additionally, many of these conversion-system options do not require a bi-directional oxygen electrode, which make them especially attractive. A wide variety of ERLs are also possible, which can include conventional liquid-organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), aqueous solutions, or flow-battery electrolytes. The ERLs and conversion systems described here can be used in a wide variety of stationary and transportation applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of some novel ERL conversion-system options and ERL options. ERLs with relatively simple reactions can have potentially attractive energy densities for many applications. A perspective on some potentially attractive end uses for ERLs is also included, along with some recommendations on key ERL metrics for these applications. The goal of this perspective is to highlight the substantial flexibility of the ERL concept, which will hopefully motivate more research on this topic. © 2021 ECS - The Electrochemical Society.",,"Electric energy storage; Liquids; Solid electrolytes; Bi-directional; Configuration options; Conversion systems; Electrical energy; Energy carriers; Hydrogen Energy; Organics; Oxygen electrode; Storage systems; Temperature and pressures; Electrodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116865440

Such a model is proven to be not sustainable because it cannot go forever considering the limited quantity of available resources on Earth but also because of waste and process by-product management. A multitude of diverse initiatives to change this process started at different levels and within several industries in the last years including the O&G sector. Most of these initiatives share the same principle of ""regeneration"": waste and materials represent, in this view, the ""feedback loop"" able to make the production process a circular process, instead of an open-end one. Eni promotes and supports different initiatives to implement the principles of a Circular Economy and the objective of this paper is to describe a process implemented within Eni aimed at reducing the footprint of the Oil and Gas Industry with reference to material usage. Surplus and damaged materials are no more treated as waste, but they are re-engineered or re-conditioned (if necessary) in order to be redeployed to other projects within Eni affiliates all around the world. Nowadays this process is well structured and formalized within Eni and it is extensively applied involving all worldwide affiliates, reducing the overall CO2 footprint. Results achieved within Eni, in the last few years, averages between 6,500 and 17,500 ton of steel of material redeployed among Eni's affiliates for a value ranging between 26 and 71 million USD. The overall average result is 23,000 CO2 equivalent ton not released per year and 242,000 GJ of energy saved (ref. to steel manufacturing estimated impact:1.9 ton di CO2/ton steel cast and 20 GJ/ton steel cast). Extending this process to involve material and equipment manufacturers, it is possible to improve the whole supply process reducing at the ""source"" the material storage needs, the material surplus and the produced wastes, including the CO2 emission produced in the transport phase. Initiatives like ""Just in Time"" delivery and material ""Buy Back"", mainly applied in Countries where Framework Agreements are already in place between Eni and its manufacturers and where manufacturers have their production sites and other facilities, are essential to achieve this target. Eventually, applying the approach to the whole supply chain and operations management will allow to reduce the ""last mile"" warehousing and transportation needs, including the dimension and capability of the operations fleet. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Gas industry; Steel castings; Steelmaking; Supply chains; Waste management; Circular process; Feedback loops; Linear process; Management practises; Materials management; Natural resource utilization; Product management; Production process; Raw material extraction; Waste generation; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116710658

In the highlight of safety, reliability and control, the systems have been sturdy withstanding massive pressure and environmental impact to last the time of estimated life of well. Design have been emphasizing on sturdiness rather than intelligence and autonomy. Time moves on, sophistication levels rise in all parts of our industry. Sustainability and lower environmental impact of solutions grow from the young into business planning and democratic policies. Control lines of hydraulic systems posed risks to the environment as well as being costly in structure and maintenance. Condition monitoring helped ensure better maintenance planning and lowered the risk of breakdown, but still left a lot to be desired reaching for self-contained, self learning systems with low installation and maintenance costs, yet the safest approach. The next steps were taken towards electrification and digitization of pressure control systems, making short and undetermined strides over almost two decades. Still, the standards are not following the pace of technological progress. And when someone dares to pilot or demonstrate modern technology applied, the installations and operational procedures of the systems still need expensive distributed lines of power, of signals and control systems to ensure a swift and safe operation. The fly-by-wire principle applied in oil & gas is the operate-by-costly-technology-and-environmental-impact-lines. With the introduction of new and breaking technology in energy harvesting and storage, the playing field opens up towards fully automated systems with no need for expensive power lines or hydraulic control lines. The safety will be taken care of also off-grid, fully digitized. Should cabling of instrument signals be damaged, the system of tomorrow will still be up to par with the Safety Integrity Levels needed. New supercapacitors with an extra dense storage capacity being developed in partnership between the industry and the University of southeast Norway combined with an extremely low energy consuming actuation system with the fastest failsafe mechanism ever will ensure safety in all modes of operation, even with all lines down or consumed by flames.

The condition with a balanced amount of required oxygen and the presence of ammonia resulting from the feces of striped catfish larvae is essential to maintain the health of the aquaculture media. This study aims to remove ammonia by introducing fine bubbles (FBs) into recirculating aquaculture media and investigating reserved dissolved oxygen inside the bubbles in the media. The water media for the striped catfish larvae hatchery was designed and set up with three containers in a recirculating system. Also, a separate container was utilized as bubble storage connected to FBs generator. The water treatment was conducted in three different scenarios using air and pure oxygen as the FBs generator sources. The generated FBs were investigated in terms of their size and zeta potential concerning the dissolved oxygen (DO). The media’s DO was measured using the titration method and digital DO meter. The difference in DO concentration received from titration and DO meter define as potential reserved oxygen. Furthermore, the removal of synthetic effluent (ammonia, NH4Cl) and effluent in the media with FBs resources were investigated and tested at a different duration of FBs applications. The results showed that bubbles size was 518.5 – 607.6 nm independent of gas resource, either pure oxygen or air. However, the gas resources affected the zeta potential value of suspended bubbles, air (-11.5 to-16.7 mV), and pure oxygen (-21.4 to-25.2 mV). When pure oxygen was used as a gas resource, the media reach the oxygen supersaturation DO condition (25.39 ppm) within 45 minutes with reserve oxygen potential (ROP) of 2.95 ppm. Thus, this condition allowed the synthetic effluent removal of 83.33% and effluent removal of 39.93%. It is emphasized that the ammonia removal due to the presence of reactive oxygen species when the FBs collapsed and the information of ROP due to FBs application is important to preserve the fitness of aquaculture media for catfish larvae hatchery. © 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Ammonia; Aquaculture effluent; Dissolved oxygen; Fine bubbles; Reserve oxygen","Aquaculture; Biochemical oxygen demand; Chlorine compounds; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Energy resources; Petroleum deposits; Titration; Zeta potential; Ammonia removal; Aquaculture effluents; Catfish larvae; Condition; Fine bubble; Gas resource; Oxygen potential; Pure oxygen; Reserve oxygen; Water media; Ammonia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116303550

To cope with this problem, a new emerging concept known as ‘Multi-access Edge Computing’ (MEC) has been introduced. MEC brings computing and storage resources to the edge of the mobile network, enabling highly demanding applications to run in the mobile user equipment, using the network resources as well as possible, while minimizing latency. Offloading computations in the MEC architecture is an NP-hard problem [Jiang W, Gong Y, Cao Y, et al. Energy delay-cost tradeoff for task offloading in imbalanced edge cloud based computing. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.02006; 2018] that has aroused the interest of several researchers, particularly over the last decade. Several algorithms have therefore been proposed to solve it. In this work, we propose a novel specific Local Search (LS) to solve the offloading problem in the case of multi-mobile users with multiple tasks per user. The proposed LS uses three neighborhood strategies and takes into account the problem specificities. Tests performed over generated instances of different sizes, as well as comparisons with works dealing with the same problem, prove the efficiency of the proposed Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) in terms of cost and runtime, for solving the offloading problem in MEC architectures. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","5G; latency; MEC architecture; offloading; variable neighborhood search",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115846873

However, the problem of efficiently minimizing the high energy consumption while ensuring high quality of service (QoS) in VNDCs has not been fully addressed. Although many solutions have been proposed to address this challenge, they are not efficient and only consider one or two of the energy consuming resources of VNDCs. To this end, an adaptive energy-aware algorithm, MCEC, that efficiently reduces the energy consumption of VNDCs while ensuring high QoS is proposed. Different from the existing approaches, the MCEC algorithm considers energy consumed by computing resources, virtual machine (VM) reconfiguration, communication resources and storage media resources while meeting user QoS requirements defined in the service level agreement (SLA). To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we carried out extensive experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm with existing baseline algorithms. The results of the experiments show that our algorithm substantially outperforms the baseline algorithms with respect to reducing energy consumption while respecting the service level agreement.

First, the hybrid dynamics of the ADN are characterized by addressing the voltage regulation and operation economics in each operation mode, and the mode switching control is designed in line with the operation principle of the on-load tap changer, where the voltage security events are used to build the event-triggered functions. Second, multi-objective optimization is formulated with consideration of the system-wide operation cost and distribution circuit loss of the ADN in a relatively slow time scale, while in the fast time scale, all the inverter-based distributed generators, energy storages, and static var compensator devices are coordinated at the source-load side, through which multiple voltage issues including voltage profile issue and voltage increment issue can be addressed in a fully distributed manner. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method based on the modified IEEE 33 bus system.

However, when these mobile end devices are roaming around different MEC servers' areas, it may cause discontinuity of services. To solve this problem, we propose an effective Edge-Intelligent Service Placement Algorithm (EISPA), which transfers the service placement problem into finding a globally optimal solution via nature-inspired-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Moreover, we use a shrinkage factor and combine it with the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to adjust the particles' position in our algorithm to avoid falling into a locally optimal solution. Performance analysis results show that the EISPA can reduce the delay and energy consumption of MEC servers, and its performance is better than the existing algorithm.

IEEE Transactions on Power Systems is the key journal in power system planning; USA, China, and England are the countries that dominate publication production. Research hotspots and trends were analyzed using author-keyword co-occurrence analysis and keyword burst detection. Four clusters were identied and topics from Cluster I (central nodes as power system stability and transient stability) and Cluster IV (central nodes as power system simulation and economics) are important for power system planning research. However, their relative popularities have declined over the past two decades. This indicates that Cluster II (central no des as renewable energy, wind power, and energy storage) and Cluster III (central nodes as distributed generation and smart grids) will be the focus of future research.

Remediation is usually costly and time-consuming, so researchers' attention has been drowning to develop and use new materials. This review aims to summarize the recent development of carbon-based materials used for environmental management. Methods: We conducted a detailed analysis of available literature based on the Web of Science database. In the third part of the manuscript are given some of the recent patents on carbon-based materials. The corresponding papers were carefully evaluated. Results: More than one hundred and ninety papers were included in section literature. Based on the available literature it an increasing trend in carbon-based material usage can be observed. These materials are used in resolving environmental issues: adsorbents in water and wastewater treatment; precursor of catalysts, soil improvement, waste management, climate change mitigation, electrochemical energy storage and soil remediation adsorption processes.

In other words, the unequal irradiation of PV arrays leads to the unbalanced output power of H-bridge cells, which causes over-modulation and increased grid current THD in the CHB inverter. Conventional control methods cannot maintain the stability of a grid-connected CHB inverter under asymmetric operating conditions. So, this article proposes a new CHB-based structure with reserve batteries and a novel modulation technique to stabilize the system in heavy mismatching conditions and avoid over-modulation. Furthermore, the number of switches and series batteries is reduced, and the number of output voltage levels is increased compared to the conventional PV-CHB system with energy storage. The validity of the proposed solution is verified by simulation in MATLAB/Simulink, and then the experimental results are presented to confirm the theoretical and simulation results.

The proposed model is formulated to maximize the profit of the private investor through optimal electric vehicles (EVs) charging coordination and pricing mechanism. The proposed pricing mechanism aims to achieve an expected revenue by the private investor, while guaranteeing a low EVs charging price to ensure the EV owners satisfaction. The D-EVCS integrates a battery storage system (BSS) and rooftop PV for the EVs supply application. However, the rooftop PV existence is constrained to the limited footprint of the EVCS. For this reason, the investment in a remote PV farm and its impact on the expected revenue and the EVs charging price is introduced in this paper. The power generated by the remote PV farm can be transacted to the D-EVCSs using a power purchase agreement through the utility grid infrastructure. In such a case, the electricity service and distribution fees are paid to the utility grid for overseeing the PV farm power transaction. Also, the opportunity of the D-EVCSs to participate in the provision of operating reserve and demand response ancillary services is considered in the proposed model. Different case studies are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

An optimal common-mode voltage injection law is derived, constituting a Maximum Power Per Ampere (MPPA) modulation strategy with respect to the currents of the dc sources. The potential benefits introduced by the proposed algorithm are analyzed in the context of battery-fed CHB converters and validated experimentally with a three-time-constant Randles model of a battery cell. The MPPA strategy is compared with traditional common-mode voltage injection methods, and battery loss reduction is demonstrated. The obtained battery energy saving is dependent on the converter modulation index and power factor. Experimental tests on a 36-cell full-bridge CHB converter validates the simulation and numerical derivation. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in practical applications, a 3 MW Energy Storage System (ESS) and a 110 kW Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) undergoing standard drive cycles are presented as case studies. Compared to traditional modulation strategies, the MPPA strategy reduces the battery losses by up to 10.9% in the ESS and 27.5% in the BEV application.

However, integration of the CAM macros that are conventionally implemented with full custom analog circuits renders design-space exploration and optimization to be difficult at system level. As an alternative, a complete design flow for compiling ternary CAM on chip using foundry-supplied digital standard cells is introduced in this paper. Based on novel CAM architecture and logic design, we leverage guided placement and routing with mainstream EDA tools for exploiting the inherent structure regularity of CAM-cell arrays in layout. An analytical model is also presented which allows us for a systematic investigation on the energy reduction by adapting our design to various pre-search structures. Validated on a post-layout 32W64 ternary CAM in 28nm, our parallel-matching scheme performs at 2.6GHz with 0.42fJ/bit/search, and the (8-bit) pre-search scheme achieves 0.19fJ/bit/search at 1.1GHz, both under the 0.9V supply voltage. In addition to flexibility for tradeoffs between the search throughput and energy, our all-digital CAM design enables voltage scaling aggressively down to 0.45V with a minimum energy consumption of 0.06fJ/bit/search at 50MHz.

Therefore, many memory-oriented network scheduling (MONS) techniques are introduced to exploit on-chip data reuse opportunities and reduce accesses to memory. However, to derive the theoretical lower bound of memory overhead for DNNs is still a significant challenge, which also sheds light on how to reach memory-level optimality by means of network scheduling. Prior work on MONS mainly focused on disparate optimization techniques or missed some of the data reusing opportunities in diverse network models, thus their results are likely to deviate from the true memory-optimality that can be achieved in processors. This paper introduces Olympus, which comprehensively considers the entire memory-level DNN scheduling space, formally analyzes the true memory-optimality and also how to reach the memory-optimal schedules for an arbitrary DNN running on a DNN processor. The key idea behind Olympus is to derive a true memory lower-bound regarding both the intra-layer and inter-layer reuse opportunities, which has not been simultaneously explored by prior works.

The popular GANs usually involve computation-intensive deconvolution operations, leading to limited real-time applications. Prior works have brought several accelerators for deconvolution, but all of them suffer from severe problems, such as computation imbalance and large memory requirements. In this article, we first introduce a novel fast transformation algorithm (FTA) for deconvolution computation, which well solves the computation imbalance problem and removes the extra memory requirement for overlapped partial sums. Besides, it can reduce the computation complexity for various types of deconvolutions significantly. Based on FTA, we develop a fast computing core (FCC) and the corresponding computing array so that the deconvolution can be efficiently computed. We next optimize the dataflow and storage scheme to further reuse on-chip memory and improve the computation efficiency. Finally, we present a computation-efficient hardware architecture for GANs and validate it on several GAN benchmarks, such as deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN), energy-based GAN (EBGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). The experimental results show that our design can reach 2211 GOPS under 185-MHz working frequency on Intel Stratix 10SX field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board with satisfactory visual results. In brief, the proposed design can achieve more than 2x hardware efficiency improvement over previous designs, and it can reduce the storage requirement drastically.

Numerical modeling of these processes requires the use of large geological models with several orders of magnitude of variations in the porous media properties. Moreover, modeling the injection of highly concentrated and cold CO2 in large reservoirs with the correct physics is introducing numerical challenges that conventional reservoir simulators cannot handle. We propose a thermal formulation based on a full equation of state formalism to model pure CO2 and CO2 mixtures with the residual gas of depleted reservoirs. Most of the reservoir simulators model the phase-equilibriums with a pressure-temperature based formulation. With this usual framework, it is not possible to exhibit two phases with pure CO2 contents. Moreover, in this classical framework, the crossing of the phase envelope is associated with a large discontinuity in the enthalpy computation which can prevent the convergence of the energy conservation equation. In this work, accurate and continuous phase properties are obtained basing our formulation on enthalpy as a primary variable. We first implement a new phase-split algorithm with input variables as pressure and enthalpy instead of the usual pressure and temperature and we validate it on several test cases. This algorithm can model situations where the mixture can change rapidly from one phase to the other at constant pressure and temperature. Then treating enthalpy instead of temperature as a primary variable in both the reservoir and the well modeling algorithms, our reservoir simulator can model situations with pure or near pure components as well as crossing of the phase envelope that usual formulations implemented in reservoir simulators cannot handle. We first validate our new formulation against the usual formulation on a problem where both formulations can correctly represent the physics. Then we show situations where the usual formulations fail to represent the correct physics and that are simulated well with our new formulation. Finally, we apply our new model for the simulation of pure and cold CO2 injection in a real depleted gas reservoir from the Netherlands. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Aquifers; Enthalpy; Equations of state of gases; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Mixtures; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum reservoirs; Porous materials; Simulators; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Depleted gas reservoir; Depleted reservoirs; Energy conservation equations; Numerical challenges; Orders of magnitude; Pressure and temperature; Reservoir simulator; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114956357

The objective was to obtain and characterize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and determine their effect on optical, barrier and mechanical properties of alginate-based films. The alginate was extracted from Sargassum fluitans. AgNPs were obtained by green synthesis using Gliricidia sepium. The UV–Vis and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to characterize the AgNPs. The antifungal activity of AgNPs was investigated using several fungal strains. Films were formulated by using 2 and 3% alginate, as well as 0, 1, and 2 mg of AgNPs per mL of formulation, with glycerol as a plasticizer. A randomized experimental design was used to test the effect to alginate and the AgNPs concentrations. The results were analyzed by an ANOVA test (p &lt; 0.05). The films were characterized by water vapor permeability (WVP), mechanical properties, opacity, color, glass transition and melting temperatures, as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-Ray (EDS) spectroscopy. WVP, optical and mechanical properties of the films were influenced statistically with alginate and AgNPs concentrations. The PVA values varied between 0.83 and 1.74 g mm h−1 kPa−1 m−2. The results demonstrated that films made with higher alginate and AgNPs concentrations exhibited higher tensile strength (20.35 MPa) and elongation at break (74.56%). The AgNPs showed percentages of growth inhibition higher than 79% in all fungal strains tested. The films formulated had attractive properties that are used to extend shelf life of foods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Alginate; Films; Gliricidia sepium; Phytonanoparticles; Sargassum fluitans","Alginate; Deterioration; Dynamic light scattering; Fungi; Glass transition; Green Synthesis; Metal nanoparticles; Scanning electron microscopy; Silver nanoparticles; Supply chains; Tensile strength; Anti-fungal activity; Elongation at break; Energy dispersive x-ray; Gliricidia sepium; Growth inhibition; Optical and mechanical properties; Silver nanoparticles (AgNps); Water vapor permeability; Mechanical permeability",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114784903

This framework includes various physical constraints to ensure reliable operation and considers integrated demand response and conservation voltage reduction, and reactive power support from HSs for realistic day-ahead scheduling.

The formulated problem is proved to be NP-hard, then it is investigated by decomposing it into two subproblems, i.e., how to offload tasks for the case of fixed transmit power and how to adjust transmit power for the given offloading decision. For the first subproblem, an approximation algorithm is proposed by offloading the tasks in the vehicle with the maximum load to the vehicle with minimum load. Meanwhile, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, in order to focus on the network dynamics. A coalition based algorithm, a distributed coalition based algorithm, as well as an incentive algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, are proposed to maximize the total payoff for the selfishness of vehicles. For the second subproblem, an adjustment strategy for transmit power is customized to further reduce the computing load. The algorithms are evaluated on an integrated simulation platform with open street map, SUMO, NS-3 and dataset of Google cluster-usage traces. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithms outperform three state-of-the-art works for most cases, in terms of the maximum load. The proposed distributed algorithm can significantly accelerate the proposed centralized algorithm with acceptable increase in maximum load. Besides, the load can be further reduced by the proposed adjustment strategy.

DHACS aims to provide transparency, reliability and robustness to the existing access control mechanism in IIoTs. The framework is based on blockchain feasibilities that contributes with an interconnected hybrid access control through smart contract provision which is new in the domain. We use three access control strategies: role-based, rule-based, and organization-based to develop a hybrid approach for smart contract. The operational transactions along with their accesses controls are accounted and blocks are made by transaction pooler and block creator. We use a private blockchain environment; however, it can be extended to a public blockchain or consortium blockchain for geographical distributed dependency. We compare DHACS with three existing approaches in recent time. We measure the performance in terms of computational costs, storage complexity and energy consumption. DHACS outperforms the others approaches and is considered to be efficient for IIoT applications with more than 30% better efficiency in access control management.

In this paper, it is found that the nonlinear electrochemical characteristics of water electrolysis can be equivalently formulated as the feasible region that consists of two convex subregions, in the space of the consumed renewable power and produced hydrogen gas. Regarding this finding and the typical application scenario where the hydrogen gas is stored in gasholders and used in hydrogen oxygen fuel cells, TEP with water electrolysis is further established as a mixed integer nonlinear programing (MINLP) problem. In our formulation, two linear relaxation technologies are presented to handle both the complementary constraints of the gasholders and the selection of which subregion of water electrolysis.

The three countries (Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan) have been negotiating to establish filling and annual operation rules and guidelines within the umbrella of equitable and reasonable water use without causing significant harm, despite no water-sharing agreement of the riparian countries. They also try to use adaptive, cooperative principles as affirmed by signing the declaration of principles in 2015. Researchers formulated various year-based filling strategies considering different hydrological scenarios—however, the traditional fixed year filling plan, non-flexible by its nature, is unable to tackle the problem. The situation motivated the authors to think and to come up with an innovative concept called stage-based filling. Stage-based filling is flexible, adaptive, and cooperative by its nature. Stages neither refer to the flow conditions nor refer to any water-sharing arrangements. They also do not use a fixed filling year or minimum release and can be accelerated or decelerated based on hydrological variability and cooperation. Based on these concepts, there are five filling stages of GERD; the first stage entirely depends on the construction phase, and the others are more flexible to adapt and cooperate with the changes. Unlike previously proposed filling schedules, GERD’s stage-based filling is accepted and adopted by the three countries to solve their concerns. Furthermore, the countries use multiple modeling approaches to evaluate the filling schedule and its impacts according to their perspectives, like using the year of filling, amount of release during filling, energy production, and water level in the reservoir. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive GERD filling; Blue Nile River; Cooperative GERD filling; Egypt; Ethiopia; Flexible GERD filling; GERD; Nile river basin; Stage-based filling; Sudan",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114621961

Capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes and storing it in geological formations (carbon capture and storage, CCS) can help counteract climate change. Nevertheless, the interaction between well barrier elements such as cement, casing, tubulars, packers, and valves can lead to possible leakages. To accomplish successful carbon dioxide sequestration, injecting the carbon dioxide in its supercritical state is necessary. The supercritical carbon dioxide can corrode steel and elastomers and react with the calcium compounds in the cement, dissolving them and forming calcium carbonate and bicarbonate in the process. This carbonation can lead to channels forming on the cement-to-rock interface or cracking due to the carbonate precipitation, resulting in a loss of well integrity. This study focusses on finding ways that enable the continuous monitoring of cement integrity, under in-situ conditions, in a lab setup. The construction of an autoclave, capable of withstanding supercritical conditions of carbon dioxide, facilitates the in-situ monitoring. This autoclave also makes CT-scans of the pressurized sample possible, as well as acoustic measurements, using state-of-the-art piezo elements. The first tests will establish a baseline using neat Class G Portland cement to verify the design and sensors. The set up consists of a rock core in the middle of the autoclave surrounded by a cement sheath. A prepared channel in the center of the core expedites the distribution of the carbon dioxide. Once the ability of the sensors to monitor the integrity is verified, different cement compositions and their interaction with supercritical carbon dioxide can be studied. The experimental setup and the procedure discussed here closely simulate the downhole condition. Hence, the results obtained using this setup and procedure is representative of what could be observed downhole. The direction is not to remove the sample from the autoclave for analysis, as is the current industry practice, but to measure cement integrity under in-situ conditions over an extended period of time. Digitalization is powering the in-situ analysis in these tests. The first two tests of this study, using the afore mentioned autoclave, investigated the carbonation behaviour of two Class G Portland cement slurrys, one with a low and one with a high slurry-density. The low-density slurry showed extensive degradation and even the high-density slurry showed carbonation, but only close to the sandstone core. The results from this study can lead to the prevention of leakage of carbon dioxide to the environment and other formations, which defeats the purpose of carbon dioxide sequestration. These results should improve the economics of these wells as well as the health, safety, and environmental aspects.

The hybrid objective function coupli ng the oil recovery factor and the CO2 storage ratio is proposed to optimize the injection and production parameters in CO2 flooding. Three storage factors of the oil and water partition coefficient, the permeability change coefficient and the CO2 retention factor are measured in a laboratory, which is utilized to modify the grid properties of oil, brine, rock in compositional numerical simulation. The restart procedure is automatically adopted to consider these storage mechanisms in CO2 EOR. The bi-objective function of the oil recovery factor and the CO2 storage ratio is used to optimize the injection and production parameters for CO2 EOR, which concludes the design principles on CO2 EOR and storage. The oil and water partition coefficient defined as the ratio of the CO2 solubility in the oil phase and the brine phase is a constant for a specific reservoir condition. The permeability change coefficient caused by the mineral dissolution effect of carbonate water decreases slightly in the early stage and increases gradually with the long term injection. The CO2 retention factor that is induced by the relative permeability hysteresis decreases with the pressure and the permeability. These equivalent treated methods that modify fluids and rock in the real-time are inserted into the procedure of compositional numerical simulation to take into account the storage mechanisms in CO2 EOR. The results show that the effect of the storage mechanisms on EOR is evident. Furthermore, the bi - objective optimization indicates that the injection rate should be reduced largely in the medium and the later stages to control gas channeling as the EOR scenario is focused. And the bottom wellhole pressure of producers should be decreased to the lower level to maximize oil recovery. As the storage scenario is concentrated, the injection rate is required to be slightly controlled. As the producers are shut off, the injection rate must be increased significantly to maximize CO2 storage. The storage mechanisms in the CO2 EOR process have not been understood thoroughly. The methodology of numerical simulation coupling CO2 EOR and storage is not mature, which is still not taken into account in commercial software. The results above provide a way to optimize CO2 EOR and storage simultaneously, which is significant for the large scale storage after CO2 EOR in mature oilfield.

However, the major risk is the possibility of leakage and injection limitation due to pore pressure. This research investigates the three major mechanisms of CO2 trapping to determine which method safely captures the most CO2, interrogates the pore pressure effect on storage, and compares traditional core flooding methods for CO2 storage with CO2 drainage which is more practical in the aquifer. A core flooding set up was built to replicate reservoir conditions of the Anadarko Basin in Texas, USA. The research involved three reservoir pay zone rocks obtained from depths of about 7687ft that were pieced together to undergo core flooding at 4400psi-5200psi and a temperature of 168°F. In the first study conducted the core was flooded with supercritical CO2 and brine of salinity 4000ppm to generate relative permeability curves to represent drainage and imbibition. For the duration of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th studies the core saturated with brine is flooded with CO2 at pressures of 4400psi, 4800psi, and 5200psi. Parameters like the volume of CO2 captured, connate water volumes, differential pressure, Ph of produced water, trapping efficiency, relative permeability, and fractional flow curves are noted. After scrutinizing the result it is observed that the highest volume of CO2 is captured by solubility trapping followed by structural trapping and residual trapping in that order. From this research, it can be concluded that CO2 trapping, at least for these reservoir rocks, is not affected by pore pressure. Also contrary to most practices CO2 storage is best replaced in the laboratory using drainage experiments instead of the widely used relative permeability approach.

The volume supplied to the domestic market plays an outsized role in the energy mix and economy of Nigeria with over 90% supplied to thermal power plants and industrial clusters. As huge upstream gas projects continue to take Final Investment Decision, pipeline takeaway capacity grows and demand increases, the dependence on natural gas and preponderance in the energy mix will likely persist. Natural gas is the present and future of Nigeria's energy needs. The domestic gas industry is evolving but has been fraught with challenges. Oil and gas infrastructure are often disrupted and production shut-in, mostly triggered by infrastructure unavailablity, environmental concerns and prioritisation of hydro power generation during River Niger's white and black floods, all of which come at a cost to upstream producers. Gas producers are often compelled to curtail production of gas plants (associated and non-associated) to avoid environmental disasters and prohibitive gas flare penalties. Can underground gas storage (UGS) be an opportunity for gas producers to guarantee continued operations during disruptions and provide buffer for national strategic benefits? This paper seeks to explore the potential technical and economic dynamics of underground natural gas storage in Nigeria in the context of extant technical regulations, seasonal demand variations, gas flare penalties and local operating environment. The paper presents types of underground storages and recommends the most suitable, considers options for optimal location of UGS in Nigeria and undertakes an economic evaluation of a UGS project.

The gas molecules are trapped in cage-like structures of the water molecules by hydrogen bonds. There are several hydrate deposits in permafrost and oceanic sediments with an enormous amount of energy. The energy content of methane in hydrate reservoirs is considered to be up to 50 times that of conventional petroleum resources, with about 2,500 to 20,000 trillion m3 of methane gas. More than 220 hydrate deposits in permafrost and oceanic sediments have been identified to date. The exploration and production of these deposits to recover the trapped methane gas could overcome the world energy challenges and create a sustainable energy future. Furthermore, global warming is a major issue facing the world at large and it is caused by greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide. As a result, researchers and organizations have proposed various methods of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide gas. One of the proposed methods is the geological storage of carbon dioxide in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, oceanic sediments, deep saline aquifers, and depleted hydrate deposits. Studies have shown that there is the possibility of methane gas production and carbon dioxide storage in hydrate reservoirs using the injection of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas mixture. However, the conventional hydrocarbon production methods cannot be used for the hydrate reservoirs due to the nature of these reservoirs. In addition, thermal stimulation and depressurization are not effective methods for methane gas production and carbon sequestration in hydrate-bearing sediments. Therefore, the gas replacement method for methane production and carbon dioxide storage in clathrate hydrate is investigated in this paper. The research studies (experiments, modeling/simulation, and field tests) on CO2/N2 gas mixture injection for the optimization of methane gas recovery in hydrate reservoirs are reviewed. It was discovered that the injection of the gas mixture enhanced the recovery process by replacing methane gas in the small and large cages of the hydrate. Also, the presence of N2 molecules significantly increased fluid injectivity and methane recovery rate. In addition, a significant amount of free water was not released and the hydrate phase was stable during the replacement process.

Kabul city is a city in which the coal-fired central heating systems for providing the mentioned energy is in expansion process. And, coal as feeding source of these systems with generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main cause of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions in winter. Fortunately, Kabul city has maximum solar radiation in summer warm season which can be used for fulfilling of this demand in winter cold season. The method which can perform this task is the central heating by seasonal sensible heat storage of solar thermal energy. But, the economic and environmental feasibility and viability of this method is a discussable issue. In this study, the central heating by seasonal sensible heat storage of solar thermal energy and its economic and environmental feasibility and viability is studied. It is tried that this system is compared in a logical method with current coal-fired systems. The economic feasibility study is accomplished by comparison of initial or capital cost and annual operation and maintenance cost with the usage of existing data and thermodynamic analytic methods. The environmental viability study is accomplished by comparison of annual emissions of CO2 with the usage of online emissions calculator. Unfortunately, it is found that seasonal sensible heat storage of solar thermal energy is not an economically feasible method for central heating due to its high initial cost and cannot be used in an economically beneficial manner for central heating. But fortunately, it is an environmentally viable method and environmentally friendly way due to its no and/or zero CO2 emissions. To sum up, it is suggested that, this method should be used for district heating which can make this system economically feasible. © 2021, International Journal of Innovative Research and Scientific Studies.

In contrast to the cationic redox activity, the oxygen redox activity enforces an enhancement in the surface reactivity of the oxides leading to their poor reversibility and cycling stability. Herein, we propose a new concept to stabilize oxygen redox activity by using oxygen-storage materials as an efficient buffer supplying and receiving oxygen during alkali ion intercalation.

However, edge-cloud computing systems are composed of various hardware facilities, leading to difficulties in hardware control and management. With network slicing, underlying resource sharing among multiple slice users is allowed, leading to potential attacks to the slice formulation processes and malicious usage of network slices that may result in inefficient resource utilization of the system. To address the aforementioned network slice security issue, we firslty propose a new systematic framework named Software-Defined Edge-Cloud Computing (SD-ECC), which applies standard software to control the hardware infrastructure regardless of vendor variations. With SD-ECC, resource slices are formulated by including storage and computational resources provided by edge and cloud servers. Then, we study an optimal slicing-based resource orchestration problem by considering slice-initiated attacks as possible adversaries, which includes both inter-slice and intra-slice resource orchestrations. A secure slicing-based resource orchestration (SS-RO) algorithm is designed by minimizing the delay and resource utilization simultaneously to mitigate the impacts of the slice-initiated attacks, where Benders decomposition is employed to obtain the inter-slice orchestration outcome, and a quadratic transformation method is applied to derive the intra-slice orchestration solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SS-RO algorithm outperforms baseline schemes in terms of the ratio of accepted attacking tasks, energy consumption, and system throughput.

The referred system is currently on the design-phase so this work describes in particular the associated design considerations, governing equations, schematics and the expected system efficiency. The system design requirements include the production of enough energy to power an average residence located in the Ica city, Peru. The system design has been divided in four subsystems, each one having its own design considerations and limitations, (i) power, hydrogen (ii) production, (iii) storage and (iv) consumption. Regarding the power subsystem, the required considerations to generate the maximum amount of solar energy in the minimum amount of space are presented. For hydrogen production, different electrolyzer related technologies have been accounted for; including proton exchange (PEM), alkaline (AEC) and polymer (PEC). Hydrogen and oxygen storages are a critical aspect in the full hydrogen chain production. Currently no single technology satisfies all of the criteria required. As such, present technologies and selection considerations are presented. For using the produced hydrogen, fuel cell stacks including PEM and solid oxide ones are assessed. Finally, the right the combination of current, voltage (including conversion from DC to a constant AC supply) and fuel utilization maximizing efficiency and power output is determined. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

In order to reduce the inductor size and improve the efficiency, the zero-voltage switch (ZVS) control schemes with four segments inductor current for FSBB had been investigated in numerous publications. Among these ZVS control schemes, the optimized control variable stored as the huge look-up table data achieved minimum RMS inductor current, and the complex real-time calculation was avoided. However, for the purpose of matching the wide input and output voltage ranges, an external flash was needed for storing the look-up table data; and the large time consumption for invoking the data hazard the dynamic performance significantly. To reduce the storage device cost and meet the demand of transient, a simplified real-time control algorithm is proposed by dividing the operation into the defined DCM and CCM operation featuring the minimum RMS inductor current and ZVS operation during the whole voltage range without complex calculation and mode transient. Finally, a 300W dc-dc prototype is built to verify the theoretical analysis and proposed control scheme with a low-cost real-time digital controller.

Inspired by biological neural networks, people use superconducting devices, which have nonlinear dynamic characteristics, to construct synapse and neuron circuits. However, it is challenging to build large-scale superconducting spiking neural networks due to fan-ins and fan-outs of superconducting devices. In this paper, we present a criterion to scale up the superconducting neural network. Then, we present a three-layer fully connected superconducting spiking neural network construction scheme.

By analyzing the operating characteristics of hydrogen storage and the integrated demand response (IDR) of terminal electric and thermal loads, the external demand elastic space of HS-AL is extracted. Then, the optimal dispatching model considering the power demand elasticity of HS-AL is established. Finally, the simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

In this paper, an advanced strategy of non-interleaved multi-tasked metaplexer for three-dimensional manipulation of dual-helical electromagnetic wavefronts is reported. We first develop a general method to derive the metasurface phase distribution required to form the desired three-dimensional electric field patterns. Then, the spin-decoupled meta-atoms are designed to achieve this goal and further increase the degrees of freedom in electromagnetic manipulation. As a proof of concept, cascaded multi-plane digital images in the propagation direction are employed as the three-dimensional wavefronts, which are encoded into the spin-decoupled meta-atoms array, making the outputting circularly polarized waves carry different image information at different planes. Both the simulations and experiments verify the desirable three-dimensional wavefront manipulation capacities of our strategy for dual-helical states. Besides, this scheme can be further extended to achieve arbitrary energy allocation in three-dimensional space for dual-helical electromagnetic waves. Our strategy paves an alternative route for applications such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, multi-target radar detection, information storage, as well as three-dimensional microwave imaging.

This problem contributes to the need for more ecological solutions and processes including the use of renewable energies, which reduces organizations&#x2019; environmental impact. To find ways to improve new green solutions and process integration, researchers need to study and measure these innovation effects, especially on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, evaluating renewable energy impacts on SMEs is not as easy as would first appear. This challenge can be addressed by developing an analysis model to mitigate the limitations of recent studies and, concurrently, deal with this complex subjective issue. In this article, the combined use of cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique facilitated the generation of a complete, transparent, and informed model that can help managers make better decisions in this context. Specifically, grounded in intensive group work sessions with renewable energy specialists, the results address some of the limitations of more generic models and include a multicriteria analysis system that provides guidelines for renewable energy management practices, with the potential to improve SME performance. To enable a fuller interpretation of the decision problem in question, the most important indicators were identified and the cause-and-effect relationships between these criteria were analyzed. The findings were validated by the panel members and a member of the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association. The advantages and limitations of the proposed model are also discussed.

The power management is a social welfare optimization problem. A multiagent-based algorithm is suggested to solve this problem, in which agents are defined as volunteering consumers and dispatchable generators. In the proposed method, every consumer can voluntarily put a price on its power demand at each interval of operation to benefit from the equal opportunity of contributing to the power management process provided for all generation and consumption units. In addition, the uncertainty analysis using a deep learning method is also applied in a distributive way with the local calculation of prediction intervals for sources with stochastic nature in the system, such as loads, small wind turbines (WTs), and rooftop photovoltaics (PVs). Using the predicted ranges of load demand and stochastic generation outputs, a range for power consumption/generation is also provided for each agent called ``preparation range'' to demonstrate the predicted boundary, where the accepted power consumption/generation of an agent might occur, considering the uncertain sources. Besides, fog computing is deployed as a critical infrastructure for fast calculation and providing local storage for reasonable pricing. Cloud services are also proposed for virtual applications as efficient databases and computation units. The performance of the proposed framework is examined on two smart grid test systems and compared with other well-known methods. The results prove the capability of the proposed method to obtain the optimal outcomes in a short time for any scale of grid.

This article proposes novel methods of scheduling of battery energy storage system (BESS) and loads of microgrid to enhance the resiliency of PDN. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimize the energy mismatch between available resources and critical loads during outage period. The proposed model is aimed at minimizing the shedding of high critical loads (hcl) and maximizing the serving time of hcl during outages. In order to increase the longevity of the load serving, the fuzzy-based approach is developed to control the C_rate of the BESS. Moreover, to increase the resiliency of hcl, partitioning of BESS capacity is proposed, which provides more flexibility for charging&#x002F;discharging control of the BESS. The concept of variable dispatch interval is introduced to reduce the frequent switching of loads. By considering the reactive power, an apparent power resiliency metric is proposed to quantify the resiliency of PDN. The IEEE 33-bus network is tested under various restoration periods in order to verify the performance of the proposed methodology in the MATLAB environment.

In this paper, the HESS is considered as an essential tool in hydrogen-integrated transportation and power systems to alleviate EV charging demand forecast error in a fast-charging station (FCS) and to solve voltage deviation problem due to the huge uptake of fast chargers on the utility grid. First, the wavelet transform (WT) method and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network are combined to precisely predict the non-stationary traffic flow (TF). Then, a queuing theory-based model is developed to convert the predicted TF to the expected EV charging demand in FCS by considering charging service limitations and driver behaviors. Third, the charging demand prediction error is used to schedule the components in a HESS by considering their inherent properties and operational limits. As a result, the HESS configuration can be determined by analyzing the tradeoff between the investment cost and the monetary penalty due to charging demand forecast error and voltage deviation. The proposed solution is validated through a case study with mathematical justifications and simulation results.

Sustainable chains have to be efficient to use recourses by optimized way and to return nutrients back to field for future agriculture. The important issue also is to process biowaste as biofuels. Biomaterial chains are often long and complex including processing, transportation, storages side flow and energy. Because of this it has not been possible to optimize the value chain and production the same way as in manufacturing industry. To create efficient bio-based value chains, organizations need to create value and share the information to partners in the ecosystem. Standardization as well as harmonization of data is needed to make it possible. All the data should be integrated and processed to optimize operations of the whole chain. Industry 4.0- framework provides standardization, RAMI architecture, as a reference databased business architecture for this development. The aim of this article is to create an innovation ecosystem concept for the development of bio-based value chain more efficient and enable a more efficient circular economy. This article introduces as a case study an implementation of a framework on digitalization of farming ecosystem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bioeconomy; Circular economy; Digitalization; Ecosystem; Industry 4.0",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112273460

Nominal proportional-derivative position controllers with desired acceleration feedforward are augmented with time-varying dissipative terms to account for the drones under-actuation. A storage function is defined that includes terms inspired by the kinetic and potential energies of the system components as well as virtual energy of the controller. A time-domain passivity observer is used in conjunction with an adaptive dissipative term to ensure that the value of the storage function is continuously decreased and hence, guarantees closed-loop stability. Moreover, barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to avoid inter-drone collisions. The proposed controller makes no assumption about and requires no knowledge of the cables tension status. Additionally, it requires no measurement from the payload. The cables can be attached to the quad-rotors and the payload at arbitrary points. Experiments with a system of three quad-rotors and a cable-suspended payload demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this paper, we consider a multi-device computing enabled Internet of things (IoT) system with a common destination, in which the status update sampled by the device can be offloaded directly to the destination for computing or computed by the device and then delivered to the destination, and jointly design offloading and scheduling policies to minimize the average weighted sum of AoI and energy consumption. The challenge lies in computing mode selection and its strong coupling with scheduling decisions. To address this issue, we formulate the optimization problem as a bilevel discrete time Markov decision process (MDP) and approximate the optimal solution by relative value iteration. Furthermore, the threshold structure of MDP policy is shown. However, with the expansion of system scale, MDP policy will suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In light of this, we develop a learning-based algorithm based on emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to reduce the dimensionality of state space and utilize late experience storage method to train two heterogeneous artificial neural networks (ANNs) synchronously during the training process. Simulation results show the structure of the MDP policy and verify the performance of the DRL policy is near-optimal.

RISC32 is one of the recent Internet of Things (IoT) processors proposed for the development of FPGA-based sensor nodes, and it includes the ability to reconfigure the micro-architecture on the fly in order to reduce dynamic energy consumption. However, such a method does not minimize static energy consumption, which is important in FPGA-based systems. In this work, clock gating and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling are applied to further reduce the energy consumption in RISC32. In the research presented here, we implemented a new software called the Energy Reduction Program Analyser to estimate the parameters that configure a sensor node to achieve minimum energy consumption, targeting the typical IoT application scenario. Experimental results show that the low-power techniques applied in this work (RISC32-LP) can reduce energy consumption by 47%, compared to the standard RISC32 processor.

However, in order to realize the optimal scheduling of FTPSS, it is necessary to further study the high cost of HESS and battery available capacity. In this study, a two-layer model with the lowest comprehensive cost as the goal is proposed, which includes the cost of investment, replacement, operation and maintenance (O&#x0026;M), and electricity. In the upper layer, the HESS sizing and replacement strategy are performed to achieve the lowest daily comprehensive cost within the project period. In the lower layer, based on the piecewise linear method, the battery capacity degradation is formulated as a linear mathematical model concerning the depth of discharge (DOD). Then, with the aim to achieve the lowest electricity charge, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated by associating PV, regenerative braking energy (RBE) and HESS. Sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with CPLEX solver embedded is utilized to solve this two-layer nonlinear model. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed model can achieve 13.55% cost reduction.

This fact triggers the need to roll out fast-charging stations to fulfill daily road charging demand. Securing the power requirement for those stations has become a significant challenge that would cause substantial load increase on the existing electricity generation system and distribution infrastructure if supplied from the conventional resources. Hence, grid-independent charging stations with renewable energy sources (RES) and multiple energy storage systems has become an alternative solution to overcome the raised challenge. This paper aims to assess the implementation of a standalone fast charging station technically and economically in the State of Qatar comprising of a wind turbine (WT), concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system and a bio-generator as RES along with various storage systems. The proposed design is built, modelled, and simulated using Hybrid Optimization System for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software to determine the optimal techno-economic configuration to fast charge 50 EVs daily in a reliable manner. Predefined constraints such as space limitation, stochastic nature of EV demand, and site-specific metrological conditions are considered. Multiple sizing portfolios of incorporated subsystems are evaluated through simulation. Sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impact of selected decision variable values such as the WT height where the generated analytical results are compared from the technical and economic perspectives. The results show that a stand-alone micropower system consisting of 450 kW CPV, 250 kW WT with 60 m hub height, 100 kW bio generator, and 324 kWh batteries is the optimal configuration with minimal 2.378 million dollars net present cost (NPC), 0.284 $/kWh cost of energy (COE) and 0.02 % unmet demand. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","clean energy; electrolyzer; fuel cell; HOMER; Hydrogen",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112023058

A pellet configuration in size of 6 mm in diameter and 80% dry mangrove litter and 20% binder material in composition, was made using a pellet machine followed by a torrefaction process carried out at 230 °C and finally burned in a combustion chamber for evaluation of the energy potential. The physicochemical characterization of the raw and torrefied pellets was performed taking as reference the ISO 17225-6: 2014 and ISO/TS 17225-8: 2016 standards. Results are in good agreement in terms of heating value, ash percentage, moisture, durability, and density in both cases. After torrefaction, an enhancement factor of 1.26 for heating value, decrease in diameter, length, and particle density of 6.16%, 7.44% and 12.57%, respectively is observed as well as, lower rate of mass loss during combustion at 300 °C and a considerable increase in hydrophobicity. It turns out that the red mangrove litter shows a high energy potential for small-scale applications. Torrefaction evidenced improvements in energy content in high humidity conditions and a significative increase in hydrophobicity, showing improvements in energetic application and storage. © 2021, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

In this study, it was conducted the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of rapeseed meal, which is a biomass waste from the rapeseed oil extraction process that shows interesting properties in terms of calorific value. The effect of the reaction temperature was evaluated on basic fuel properties, pellet quality, and emissions from a pellet stove. First, the mass yields were decreased as reaction temperature increased showing significant mass loses even at low HTC temperatures. The higher heating values were, conversely, increased with temperature reaching an improvement of more than 30% compared to raw biomass. On the other hand, the ash content was dramatically reduced at 150 °C; however, an increasing trend was observed as temperature rose. About the pellet quality, moisture uptake and compression strength tests were performed resulting in hydrochar pellets showing enhanced hydrophobicity and durability, which facilitates the storage and transportation of these novel pellets. Finally, combustion tests in a household pellet stove were carried out to assess the effect of the HTC process on the air pollution control from residential combustion. Emissions from incomplete combustion such as CO and particulates were significantly diminished when burning hydrochar pellets obtained at low HTC temperatures, whereas NOX concentrations were gradually reduced with hydrochars obtained at higher temperatures. These findings definitely represent a promising contribution from biomass conversion technologies to take advantage of rapeseed meal residues, and also, to overcome the current scarcity of commercial pellets made of woody biomass. © 2021, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

The producers, the receivers, and the electrical networks that connect them, have mechanical and electrical inertias which disturb this balance. Faced with a variation in power, the electrical system, after oscillations, returns to a stable state. In some cases, the oscillatory regime may diverge. Studies are being carried out to remedy this problem and ensure the stability of the electricity network. This manuscript focuses on FACTS regulation which helps electrical systems, subjected to strong disturbances, to maintain their stability.

For example, in Peru, drinking water chlorination systems exhibit a large number of deficiencies from the dosing process to the monitoring of chlorine volumes in storage tanks. In fact, as the water tanks are often far from communities, chlorine solution levels are hardly ever properly monitored. Therefore, the system proposed in this paper will allow users to monitor the real-time chlorinated solution volume levels in drinking water systems, thus, rendering their operations effective. The design of the prototype relies on an intelligent two-way system comprising of a sender and a receiver. Both parts are Arduino-based and communicate with each other via a long-range wireless transmission protocol. In addition, the system features low energy consumption and uses cloud connectivity for storing chlorination process information. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Arduino; Chlorination; Intelligent systems; Ultrasound; Water treatment system","Chlorination; Chlorine; Developing countries; Energy utilization; Green computing; Potable water; Real time systems; Water quality; Water treatment; Waterworks; Chlorination process; Chlorine solution; Drinking water systems; Latin americans; Low energy consumption; Water chlorination; Water treatment systems; Wireless transmission protocol; Water tanks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111394271

The formulations of linear and nonlinear relations for determining the parameters of structural mechanics based on the energy potentials and force coefficients of molecular mechanics are considered. Using the finite element method, numerical models have been developed to study the elasticity modulus of nanotubes of various types and sizes, macros in the APDL ANSYS Mechanical APDL programming language. Comparison of the results obtained with theoretical and experimental data showed satisfactory agreement. The discrepancy with the known theoretical estimates lies in the range of 0.08–5.1%. Using numerical modeling, an assessment was made of the possibility of using functionalized polymers (nanocomposites) as structural materials for the manufacture of cartridges for the storage and distribution of compressed gas. Based on calculations of the stress-strain state of a cartridge for storage and distribution of compressed carbon dioxide, it was found that the use of a functionalized polymer for the manufacture of containers operating under pressure can significantly reduce its weight and even increase its capacity while ensuring the required strength. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Elastic modulus; Finite element method; Functionalized polymer; Nanocomposite; Tensile strength",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111286470

Proceeding from this, the annual refrigeration energy generation in response to its consumption is used as a primary criterion for assessing the efficiency of AC systems yearly operation. The traditional AC system design issues from a design refrigeration capacity value covering the maximum current thermal loads and annual refrigeration energy consumption lead to inevitable refrigeration capacity overestimation and oversizing installed refrigeration machines. The method to determine the appropriate design refrigeration capacity to cover current thermal duties and provide closed to annual refrigeration energy generation simultaneously is developed. The novel approach to further enhancing modern variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system energy efficiency due to functioning the refrigerant receivers already installed as thermal storage to accumulate refrigeration to cover peak thermal loads has been proposed. The developed method's application enables defining minimum design refrigeration capacities providing a maximum rate of annual refrigeration energy generation increment that leads to reduced sizes of variable-speed or traditional refrigerant compressors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air conditioning; Design refrigeration capacity; Thermal load",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111261144

The proposed framework determines the lower and upper dispatch limits of PV generation considering the worst-case realization of a) the minimum and maximum storage capacity in EVs, b) the minimum and maximum power dispatch of EVs, c) the lower and upper bounds for the arrival and departure times and d) the available energy at arrival and departure times. The unbalanced operation of the distribution network as well as the uncertainty in the maximum PV generation and demand forecasts were considered. The problem formulation and solution approach are validated using the modified IEEE 34-bus and IEEE 123-bus distribution systems. The impacts of the budget of uncertainty and the vehicle-to-grid operation mode of EV clusters were addressed in the case studies. It is shown that integrating EVs with charging capability will increase the lower dispatch limit or increase the upper dispatch limit of the PV generation. Moreover, the increase in the budget of uncertainty will reduce the difference between the upper and lower dispatch limits by increasing the lower dispatch or decreasing the upper dispatch limit of the PV generation. Finally, it is shown that the vehicle-to-grid capability will reduce the total lower dispatch limit or increase the total upper dispatch limit of the PV generation in the operation horizon.

Using the personalized recommendation system as a driving example, we developed a scalable, practical DIMM-based NMP solution tailor-designed for accelerating the inference serving. Our solution is demonstrated on a versatile FPGA-enabled NMP platform called AxDIMM that allows rapid prototyping and evaluation of NMP's performance potential on real hardware under a realistic system setting using industry-representative recommendation framework. We experimentally validated the performance of a two-ranked AxDIMM prototype which achieves up to 1.89x speedup in latency and 31.6% memory energy saving for embedding operations. For end-to-end recommendation inference serving, AxDIMM improves the throughput up to 1.5x and latency-bounded throughput up to 1.77x, respectively.

These risks include, in particular, the risk of spontaneous combustion fires and the production of phytopathogens and fungi which endanger human health. In this paper, we analyzed three large-capacity wood chips storages in urban-type heating plants in Slovakia. The risk of fire in these heating plants and the occurrence of phytopathogens and fungi in piles of stored wood chips were analyzed. The piles consisted of energy chips, which represented a mixture of 80% deciduous trees and 20% conifers. From each pile, 5 samples (15 in total) were taken for analysis in the year 2020. In each pile, 3 samples were taken from the surface and 2 samples from a depth of 0.5 m of the pile. The results of long-term monitoring of large-capacity wood chip dumps, which are used for energy purposes in urban heating plants, show that although this biomass is regularly handled, mixed, continuously fed, and removed, the health risks resulting from the presence of phytopathogen spores are permanent. © 14th International Scientific Conference WoodEMA 2021 - The Response of the Forest-Based Sector to Changes in the Global Economy, Proceedings.

However, most of the existing memory read/write intensive algorithms and data structures are not aware of the PCM write heterogeneity in terms of both energy consumption and latency. In particular, self-balancing binary search trees, which are widely used to manage massive data in the big-data era, were designed without the consideration of PCM characteristics. Thus, the multiple rotations of the tree balancing process would degrade the memory performance. This work explores the relations among nodes and analyzes tree operations, and the node indexing and address mapping are redesigned to reduce the tree management overhead on single-level cell (SLC) PCM by decreasing the number of bit flips of tree rotations. When multi-level cell (MLC) PCM is included, our address mapping algorithm is developed to reduce the total energy consumption and latency with considerations of the heterogeneous write operations of different cell states. Experimental results show that our solution significantly outperforms the original implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree when the amount of data is large.

It leverages the symmetry of crossbar structure and supports both row and column memory accesses. The new architecture is well fit for the applications with different access patterns which suffer from low efficiency and high energy consumption in traditional memory architecture. However, existing hard failure defensive techniques for emerging NVM are inappropriate for RC-NVM. Therefore, the limited device endurance makes RC-NVM ephemeral and unreliable. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose a hybrid-grained remapping defensive technique to fight against hard failures. By hybrid-grained remapping, we can effectively avoid multiple reads issue of fine-grained remapping and low utilization issue of coarse-grained remapping and significantly increase RC-NVM lifetime with little performance loss. Moreover, motion vector and remap-aware write optimizations are also proposed to further improve RC-NVM reliability and degrade performance loss and energy consumption of write operation. Evaluation shows that the hybrid-grained remapping can increase the lifetime by 61.1% compared to single coarse-grained remapping with only 5% performance loss and 7% energy increase when 10% pages are mapped out. Optimizations can further improve lifetime, performance and energy by 5%, 11.4% and 30.5% respectively.

The analysis considered two different operating cases with different fuels in the power plant each case: biogas, coal, non- associated gas, and associated gas. The first one considers a constant fuel feed flow in the power plant. The second one, considers a constant energy demand. The results indicate that, for the first case, the fuel with the lowest environmental impact was the non-associated gas with 2.14 kEcopoints and 1083 MJ per kg of CO2 recovered. For a constant energy demand, the fuel with the lowest environmental impact was the biogas with 0.57 kEcopoints and 193 MJ per kg of CO2 recovered.

Circular economy pillars have been proposed as a means to conserve resources, limit emissions and maintain sustainable revenue streams. Most CO2 emissions stem from stationary sources, which are largely due to industrial processes (IPCC, 2005). In an attempt to reduce these emissions, there has been an increased focus on carbon capture utilization and storage solutions, e.g. integrating carbon dioxide in industrial parks to create value-added products. Ahmed et al. (2020) introduced a method that can represent any resource, material or energy, within a cluster to identify integration potential. In this work, we utilize the mixed integer linear program to synthesize waste reuse clusters at zero carbon footprint. The work mainly assesses the potential benefits of utilizing waste resources such as CO2 emissions, free resources such as seawater (H2O and its minerals), air (N2, and O2) and sunlight as an energy source to produce various value-added products to create carbon neutral industrial parks. This attempt demonstrates circular economy values on an industrial park level by conserving fresh resources, maximizing reuse of materials and creating valuable products.

Several technologies and actions constitute such pathways, whether through reducing the production of CO2 streams by implementing renewable energy options for example or through processing them via CO2 capture, utilization, and storage. For such projects to be implemented, they need to satisfy an economic favourability that serves as an incentive for the industrial stakeholders to invest. Process Integration tools have been developed recently to optimize the planning of CO2 reduction through identifying the cheapest pathways. However, the interactions between the different stakeholders are not considered in such approaches. The existence of such interactions may lead to a non-optimal implementation of CO2 reduction pathways under the applied policy framework. It is important for the enforced policies to guarantee the implementation of the lowest cost pathways to avoid recessive consequences associated with emissions mitigation. This work tries to identify the effect of such interactions on the feasibility of the optimal solution. CO2 reduction policy can then be assessed based on the resulting feasible solution in comparison with the optimal solution. A conducted case study showed that a high tax on CO2 emissions may result in deviations from the optimality. Subsidizing CO2capture and renewable energy would help in reducing the economic impact on the stakeholders, leading to a feasible optimal solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","carbon policy; CO2 capture; minimum cost CO2 reduction; process integration; renewable energy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110335458

This research work has explored a procedure for temperature control through the incorporation of phase change materials (PCMs) in laboratory environment (mortar testing). Indeed, PCM’s have the potential to store and release heat energy during phase change from solid to liquid, or vice versa. By choosing a PCM with a melting range between casting temperature and the expected peak temperature, it is possible to attenuate the temperature rise rate in concrete through heat storage (the melting process is endothermic). This paper presents and discusses an experimental work focused on the thermo-physical properties and thermal performance analysis of mortar with direct incorporation of pristine PCM (with a melting temperature of 34 °C and latent heat capacity of 240 J/g) in three volume fractions of 0, 10 and 20% in mixture compositions (volumetric percentage replacement with regard to sand particles), cast into partially insulated cubes with 320 mm3 size. The thermal performance tests revealed the impact of the PCM in the thermal behavior of the cast element, by reducing the maximum peak temperatures in comparison with the reference case (without PCM). Mechanical tests were also performed and revealed that, as expected, their compressive and flexural strength are reduced. Nonetheless, the observed reduction might still be compatible with structural applications in specific contexts, even for the case of high PCM content incorporation (20%). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Heat of hydration; Mortar; Phase change materials; Thermal and mechanical behavior",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109827970

However, the overall packaging life cycle generates significant environmental impacts since its production exploits natural resources and energy and causes environmental emissions. Moreover, packaging wastes generate increasing disposal issues, being the second largest fraction of municipal wastes after the organic fraction. During the last years there is focus on the environmental performance of juice packaging systems. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and Tetra Pak multilayer packaging arethe dominant juice packaging options. Life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques are used to improve the understanding, as well as, to compare the environmental characteristics of different packaging systems. This research assesses the environmental impact of the two commonest juice packaging options, including their production along with their final disposal (landfilling, incineration and recycling). The aim is to compare the footprints of PET and Tetra Pak packaging, identify the hot spots and finally discover the most environmentally benign juice packaging. LCA was performed using GABI software, following the ISO 14040 series recommendations, while the impact assessment was carried out using ReCiPe 2016. The results showed that Tetra Pak was environmentally superior to alternative PET packaging in 12 of the 18 total impact categories. In fact, their differences were significant in climate change and fossil depletion caegories, the environmental importance of which is assessed by the Federal Environment Agency as ""very high"" and ""high"" respectively. Considering the extended shelf life of juices with Tetra Pak, andthe reduced environmental footprint, it can be concluded that there are clear environmental advantages for multilayer Tetra Pak juice packaging over PET bottles.

The test material was polypropylene plates (PP). The modification was performed by a device with a multi-electrode (four pairs) system, which is not common. The quality of pre-processing and usability was evaluated primarily in terms of the industrial requirements, which means a change in wettability and adhesion expressed by the contact angle/surface free energy value in dependence to sample exposure time expressed by the conveyor belt speed. The surface free energy assessment of a treated polymeric surface by contact angle measurement was carried out by analyzing static sessile drops and evaluated by Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble (OWRK) model. The results determined a set of operating parameters at which the modification process meets the industrial requirements. By evaluating the change in surface free energy in relation to the storage time, the degree of hydrophobic recovery of the treated samples, i.e. the time stability of the plasma-treated surface, was also determined.

Hydrogen distribution to the future gas refuelling stations in liquid (cryogenic) phase rather than compressed gas is one of the options to increase the truck payload. For this reason, potential liquid hydrogen (LH2) release with a consequent pool formation and gas dispersion is one of the scenarios to consider by the associated risk assessment. The aim of this study is to comprehend the hydrogen behaviour after a liquid release in a refuelling station, which represents a semi-confined space, by means of a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool: the FLame ACceleration Simulator (FLACS). The LH2 pool formation as well as the dispersion of the hydrogen gas cloud in the surrounding were investigated. Different parameters such as the variation in density of the extremely cold gas and the lower flammability limit (LFL) of the gas cloud were measured. As expected, the wind speed and direction significantly affect the position and dilution of the flammable gas cloud within and outside the facility. Few solutions to prevent further consequences from the LH2 releases such as a vapour cloud explosion were proposed to spark the interest on future studies on safety barriers for this type of accident scenario.

One of the sources that have had significant growth worldwide in the last decade is photovoltaic solar energy. However, one of the drawbacks with the use of photovoltaic technology is conversion efficiency. For this, alternatives are sought, such as the study of new materials with structures that facilitate the quantum photodetection of a given compound; minimize losses due to transient and harmonic in the regulation devices and inverters, and losses in the storage and transport of the energy generated. One proposal to increase the collection efficiency is solar tracking systems, making the panels remain approximately perpendicular to the direct light beam (direct radiation), from dawn to sunset. In this research work, three photovoltaic solar energy capture systems are compared using a simulation. The first case corresponds a fixed system in a horizontal position; the second case is a system fixed with an inclination of 10 degrees south latitude, and the third, a two-axis tracker. The information collected is taken in the municipality of Sibaté, the coordinates 4 ° 30 ' 09.5 "" N, 74 ° 15 ' 20.2 "" W in the Savanna of Bogotá. The purpose of this study is to use clean electrical energy to obtain bio-hydrogen using electrolysis. In the simulation, two periods, cloudy and clear, are determined based on a threshold taken experimentally in the panels and thus comparing the three systems. The results show that in clear periods the solar tracker has an energy conversion gain of 5 %. On the other hand, in cloudy periods, the three systems' panels showed similarity in the energy measurements captured.

Implementing real-time food trace-ability requires the use of novel networking solutions and computer embedded systems. This paper intro-duces a new technique for active food traceability based on energy-efficient wireless sensor networks-Long Range Wide Area Networking (LoRaWAN) tech-nology. Our network infrastructure is for active food traceabil-ity based on existing Internet of Things technologies. LoRa is used as technology for communication due to the fact that its end nodes allow secure communication up to 5 km in urban area. A model for a modern infrastructure for food traceability has been developed. Based on the proposed model for network infrastructure for active food traceability a block diagram of such a traceability system has been synthesized. The main modules of our food traceability system include LoRa end node, Lora gateway, The Things Network, application server, router and mobile device. Special attention has been paid to the selection and the design of our LoRa sensor end node for food traceability by using modern microcontroller ATmega32u4, RN2483 trans-mitter, TCS34725 colour sensor and BME280 environmental sensor. An exemplary use of our end module for food traceability is active monitoring of meat prod-ucts. The schematics and algorithmic diagram of the designed food traceability sensor end node are given. We have developed a web application in Python for real-time monitoring of meat products during storage sensor data like temperature, colour and humidity.

This research was carried out to determine the heat transfer parameters of an existing dryer-mixer and evaluate its performance for the drying and mixing of Irvingia gabonensis powder. A 1 kg of the powdered product (~ 15 µm particle size and 24.5% initial moisture content) was dried using the mixer-dryer for 5 hours. The average temperature of the drying chamber was preset at 50oC for the drying process, with the help of a thermostat. The heat transfer parameters, which includes the air flow rate and thickness of wall lagging, were determined mechanistically. Also, the drying performance was determined based on the drying rate, drying efficiency, mixing index, and mixing rate of the machine. Results show that an air flow rate of 0.00082 kgs-1 and 0.02 m thickness of a fibre-glass lagging material was required in the drying and mixing operation.

It is well known that carbonic materials along with metal hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising materials to be used for hydrogen storage by using adsorption method, specifically based on ""spill-over"" phenomena. These materials have different applications and one of the most important is considered to be fuel cells technology for mobile applications, namely onboard automotive hydrogen storage. By using transitional metals in order to dope carbonic materials, their adsorption capacity increases, thus approaching “the target” of 4,5% weight ratio of H2 adsorbed in a substrate, according to US Office Of Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy [1]. Within this paper carbon based nanomaterials: multi-wall nanotubes (MWNT) and poly-aniline (PANI) have been used as substrates for Ruthenium doping and their hydrogen storage capacity has been determined. PANI has been firstly prepared and after that doped in laboratory, while MWNT have been purchased from the market and afterwards doped in laboratory. The doping procedure consists of a physical-chemical method which involves Ru salts and the use of ultrasounds in order to activate the carbon based substrate for doping. The adsorption and storage capacity of carbonic materials has been determined by using spill-over phenomena in a PCT Pro-User apparatus, provided by SETARAM and also calculated from cyclic voltametry, by using VoltaLab-40 apparatus. In order to investigate the adsorption capacity of the nano-structured carbonic materials, the experiments have been carried out at different pressures (ranging from 10 to 30 bar).

The H2-CCS chain is taken as an example of strategic value chains in the process towards a low carbon and increasingly integrated energy system. The successful realization of H2-CCS integrated chains requires the mobilization of vast quantities of domestic and international private capital. This article looks at how legislation and contracts, separately and in combination, can be used to manage and mitigate risks and incenti-vise private sector investment along the H2-CCS value chain in Europe. First, it discusses the role of national governments and the EU in developing legislative measures such as climate change targets, market design, liability regimes and how those could remove some of the risks preventing private sector investments. Second, it considers how the design and standardization of contracts can mitigate risks faced by the private sector by allocating, transferring and sharing risks between private and public parties. The article concludes that the law has an important role in de-risking investments and that further policy steps are necessary to refine the legislative and contractual regimes needed for the successful deployment of such strategic value chains. © 2021, Kluwer Law International.

Numerous studies show that large-scale geologic disposal of CO2 from industrial emissions will be essential to achieve this objective. There are currently 21 large-scale CCS facilities in operation. Of these large-scale CCS projects, five use geologic storage in saline formations (Sleipner, Snøhvit, Quest, IBDP & Gorgon) and together inject nearly 6 million tonnes CO2 per annum (Mtpa). The remaining large-scale projects mainly use CO2EOR as the storage vehicle. Enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide (CO2EOR) can have a dual purpose: (a) To recover additional oil, thereby supplying energy and additional revenues; and (b) to mitigate climate change by reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Historically, CO2EOR projects have tended to maximize oil production as a function of the CO2 injected. There are various options proposed to enhance the climate mitigation effect of CO2EOR projects by maximizing the ratio of the CO2 injected to the oil produced, or by transiting projects from CO2EOR in the initial stages to pure storage projects in the later stages. However, to achieve net zero-emissions, CO2EOR projects need to include a significant fraction of non-EOR CO2 storage. CO2EOR projects also play an important role in building the infrastructure needed for large-scale carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. We illustrate these potential pathways using examples of large CCUS/CCS projects, both from offshore Norway and onshore Canada. © IOR 2021 - 21st European Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum industry; Stages; Climate mitigations; Enhanced oil recovery; Geologic disposal; Geologic storage; Large-scale projects; Oil production; Saline formation; Zero emission; Enhanced recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108448217

The Energy Management System (EMS) allows the optimal scheduling of energy resources and energy storage systems in MG in order to maintain the balance between supply and demand at low cost. The aim is to minimize peaks and fluctuations in the load and production profile on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to make the most of renewable energy sources and energy exchanges with the utility grid. In this paper, our attention has been focused on a Rule-based energy management system (RB EMS) applied to a residential multi-source grid-connected MG. A Microgrid model has been implemented that combines distributed energy sources (PV, WT, BESS), a number of EVs equipped with the Vehicle to Grid technology (V2G) and variable load. Different operational scenarios were developed to see the behaviour of the implemented management system during the day, including the random demand profile of EV users, the variation in load and production, grid electricity price variation. The simulation results presented in this paper demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested EMS and confirm the strategy's feasibility as well as its ability to properly share power among different sources, loads and vehicles by obeying constraints on each element. © 2021, Editura ELECTRA.

This chapter aims to review the current status of sustainable energy system analysis in archipelagic countries and to identify the key challenges and opportunities for developing sustainable energy systems. It is found that the framework of energy system analysis can be categorized into centralized, decentralized, and hybrid energy systems. Renewable energy penetration has better performance assessed by the sustainability index, especially on the economy, job creation, energy access, and reduce a country's CO2 emission. Furthermore, the main barriers of energy system modeling and design are technical, socioeconomic, and political aspects, while its abundant renewable energy sources, declining cost of renewable energy and storage, and the archipelago’s characteristics are key opportunities for further development. Finally, policy analysis for sustainable energy system deployment is discussed in the latter part of this chapter. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Archipelago; Energy system analysis; Island; Sustainability; Sustainable energy","Economics; Renewable energy resources; Systems analysis; Energy system analysis; Energy system model; Hybrid energy system; Renewable energies; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable energy source; Sustainability index; Sustainable energy systems; Energy conservation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107364432

One such system is a horizontal carousel, a rotating rack that delivers parts to the operator. Apart from space and time reduction related benefits, horizontal carousels are often marketed as well as better ergonomic systems compared to traditional shelving rack systems. However, not many papers deal with a quantitative comparison of horizontal carousels with shelving systems that are much more used for small parts order picking. Especially there is a lack of papers analyzing ergonomics of horizontal carousels. In this paper, horizontal carousels are briefly presented, followed by methods to compare horizontal carousels with shelving systems in terms of space, time and ergonomics. For ergonomic assessment, a method of energy expenditure calculation is used. Presented methods can serve as tools for managers for additional justification of horizontal carousel’s implementation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy expenditure; Ergonomic assessment; Order-picking; Vertical lift module (VLM)","Horizontal wells; Automated storage/retrieval systems; Energy expenditure; Ergonomic assessment; Ergonomic systems; Order picking; Quantitative comparison; Rack systems; Space and time; Ergonomics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107361528

Besides its lower leakage power, higher density, immunity to radiation-induced particles, and non-volatility, an unintentional bit flip during read operation, referred to as read disturbance error, is a severe reliability challenge in STT-MRAM caches. One major source of read disturbance error in STT-MRAM caches is simultaneous accesses to all tags for parallel comparison operation in a cache set, which has not been addressed in previous work. This paper first demonstrates that high read accesses to tag arrays extremely increase the read disturbance rate and then proposes a low-cost scheme, so-called Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison (3RSeT), to reduce the error rate by eliminating a significant portion of tag reads. 3RSeT proactively disables the tags that have no chance for hit, using low significant bits of the tags on each access request. Our evaluations using gem5 full-system cycle-accurate simulator show that 3RSeT reduces the read disturbance rate in the tag array by 71.8%, which results in 3.6x improvement in Mean Time To Failure. In addition, the energy consumption is reduced by 62.1% without compromising performance and with less than 0.4% area overhead.

Further, all these solar PV modules can operate at their respective maximum power point thus increasing the power extraction capability. A high-frequency transformer facilitates the interfacing of low voltage solar PV modules, and the battery bank with a 380 V microgrid. However, the power from the solar PV modules to the battery bank does not flow through this transformer.

However, process variation and thermal fluctuation severely affect the data integrity of STT-MRAM, resulting in both write errors and read errors. Therefore, effective error correction codes (ECCs) are necessary for correcting memory cell errors. Meanwhile, the design of channel quantizer plays a critical role in supporting error correction coding for STT-MRAM. In this work, we propose a union bound analysis which can accurately predict the word error rates (WERs) of ECCs with maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding over the quantized STT-MRAM channel. The derived bound provides a theoretical tool for comparing the performance of ECCs with different quantization schemes at very low error rate levels without resorting to lengthy computer simulations. Moreover, we also propose a new criterion to design the channel quantizer by minimizing the WERs of ECC decoding that are obtained from the union bound analysis. Numerical results show that the proposed union-bound-optimized (UBO) quantizer can achieve better error rate performance than the state-of-art quantizers for STT-MRAM.

In this paper, we propose a theoretically sound deep architecture, named reversible autoencoder (Rev-AE), from the perspective of well-developed frame theory for image reconstruction. Reversible blocks (Rev-Blocks) are developed as fundamental building blocks to realize nonlinear dimension invariant transform, up-sampling (with dimension growth) and down-sampling (with dimension reduction) in Rev-AE. The Rev-Block integrates CNN-based operators with the two-stream structure of lifting scheme to introduce nonlinearity and achieve reversibility. Therefore, Rev-AE only requires training and storage of encoder parameters. Furthermore, Rev-AE bridges existing nonlinear CNNs and well-established traditional signal processing tools to realize end-to-end optimized reversible networks with a guarantee of stability for image reconstruction for the first time. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that reversible blocks guarantee perfect reconstruction with derived frame bounds and are robust to noise perturbation under restricted energy propagation of noise. Moreover, we prove that Rev-AE achieves stable reconstruction with bounded projection angle under the presence of down-sampling and up-sampling. The stability and robustness of Rev-Blocks are also validated with numerical evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that Rev-AE achieves comparable performance with halved parameters in comparison to recent leading methods (e.g., 3-D CNN based autoencoder and ISTA-Net+) in the applications of image compression and compressive sensing.

As other DCCBs, EAR DCCBs still require a fast mechanical switch. The requirements on the actuator of the mechanical switch depend on the DCCB concept and the DC grid and are derived here for an EAR DCCB. Thomson-coil actuators can open and close mechanical switches sufficiently fast to satisfy the requirements. This work studies experimentally a Thomson-coil actuator system with active damping for an off-the-shelf industrial vacuum interrupter used as mechanical switch in an EAR DCCB. The prototype is explained in detail and extensive measurement results are presented showing that active damping must be perfectly timed to be effective. A novel Thomson-coil driver is proposed and studied experimentally, which operates the Thomson-coil actuator more efficiently by recycling energy during the actuation. Moreover, the novel Thomson-coil driver reduces the capacitive storage by 50 % and allows for faster recharging with lower charging current. Finally, the auto-reclosing and proactive commutation operation of the Thomson-coil actuator system and the interruption capability of the prototype EAR DCCB are demonstrated experimentally.

Transmission lines can balance production across geographies. Well-designed incentives can encourage users to modify their consumption via demand-side management programs.

Previous experiments have studied how supply affects bedload transport, but I studied a setup with converging banks, where the supply–transport relation implies feedback. While increasing flows, a short range of transitional flows showed sharp increase of bedload, accompanied by channel response via longitudinal homogenization (connectivity) and maximum sediment storage. To slightly vary initial bed mixing (channel history), I repeated the experiments three times, which validated the robustness of the transition. This transition synchronized hydraulics and transport along the channel, leading to a wetted width consistent with downstream hydraulic geometry that allowed a critical sediment evacuation with minimum energy and bed alteration. For flows higher than the transitional, longitudinal connectivity persisted, as most of the landslide material was redistributed by fluvial action. Finally, the largest flows dissipated energy excess via coarsening and channel migration, akin to non-incising rivers with floodplain. A conceptual model of the geomorphic cycle of gravel river reaches might contain the proposed critical transition, but only if this transition proves to be robust to bank cohesion and to spatial and temporal size of the experimental setup. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alluvial storage; bank landslides; critical self-organization; fluvial connectivity; incising gravel rivers; Lateral sediment supply",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106945089

Latch topologies have been proposed to implement these new technologies. In this article, we present new non-volatile Latch topology. We focus on a D Latch topology that uses memristors as memory elements combined with CMOS components. The memristor device has been implemented using an accurate Verilog-A model exploring the experimental data of a real OxRRAM device. Our simulation results explore low-voltage and reliable non-volatile Latch designs. Indeed, we integrate this Latch design to behave as a counter application using both binary and Gray codes. Moreover, this topology has been compared with other non-volatile topologies in terms of power consumption, cell size, energy, programing time and robustness at different programming voltage values.

This article proposes an optimized distributed cooperative control method for multi-PV energy sources in an islanded DCMG. Unlike conventional control methods for DCMGs, the proposed distributed cooperative control method is capable of obtaining a constant total generated power from PVs, thus minimizing the impact of the intermittent nature of PVs on the total generation. This operation subsequently reduces the charging stress on the backup energy storage system (BESS) and increases the lifetime of the BESS in the DCMG. The proposed control method can also intelligently reduce the total generation cost of the DCMG via monitoring and analyzing the information of energy sources and minimizing the quadratic cost function. The dynamic model of the proposed controller is thoroughly analyzed, and its effectiveness in terms of providing controllable generated power and cost reduction is validated for different generation-demand scenarios.

Temperature raising increases the pressure and temperature of the condenser. One of the reasons behind that is the increasing of air temperature of the condenser, causes increase the pressure-ratio of the compressor that leads to increase superheated degree of the compressor. This causes a decrease in performing cooling unit that causes raising in an energy expenditure. In current study a theoretical and experimental investment were achieves to decreases the refrigerant temperature by reducing superheated degree of the compressor. Engineering Equation solver (EES) software was used to compare the experimental data that given from experimental test rig with the theoretical one. For this purpose, several methods were used to solve the problem of raising the superheated degree of the compressor, one of them by raising the condenser air humidity ratio through adding water mist to decrease the high air-temperature of condenser problem. Air duct was designed and developed for controlling the humidity of the air enters the condenser by adding water mist to the air flow that enters the condenser. As well, a water pump with water storage tank were supplies to provide water drops to the air flow of the condenser. As a result, System Coefficient of Performance once use a water mist was found to decrease the condenser air_temperature by (12%) compared with system without any modification. Also, the decreases in superheating degree of compressor for system using water mist was found to be (8%) less than system without modification. It is recommended to use a water mist through a water nozzle to the air flow enters the condenser for reducing the superheating degree of the compressor despite of high consuming of water to reduce the condenser air temperature. © 2021 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

Shallow intermediate buffers in the hierarchical router can cause head-of-line blocking to create backpressure towards input buffers and reduce overall performance. In this work, we propose to organize decentralized intermediate buffers as a centralized buffer and exploit the high-density nature of Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) to increase intermediate buffer depth while also providing near-zero leakage power. STT-MRAM has disadvantages such as higher write latency and higher write energy. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose DeepHiR, a novel deep hybrid buffer organization (STT-MRAM and SRAM) to provide high performance with minimal cost. Although the deep intermediate buffer can effectively improve router performance, a large amount of input buffer will still cause hardware overhead. Therefore, we further propose ElasHiR, which leverages elastic input buffer design in the centralized row buffer to allow a part of the centralized row buffer to act as input buffer. ElasHiR adopts reduced input buffers and automatically determines the length of input buffer in the centralized row buffer. Evaluation results show that DeepHiR and ElasHiR can achieve significantly performance improvement, and the cost of energy and area is moderate.

A fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV) with the fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain is used as the study case. The battery plays a key role in current transportation electrification, and the optimal sizing of the battery is critical for both system technical performances and economical revenues, especially in the hybrid design. The optimal battery design should coordinate the static sizing study against the dynamic power distribution for a given system, but few works provided the synergistic consideration of the two parts. In this study, the interaction happens in each sizing point with the optimal power sharing between the battery and the FC, aiming at minimizing the summation of hydrogen consumption, FC degradation and battery degradation. Under the proposed framework, the power management is developed with deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, considering multi-objectives that minimizing hydrogen consumption and suppressing system degradation. In the case study, optimal sizing parameters with lowest cost are determined. Leveraged by the optimal size, the hybrid system economy with synergistic approach is improved by 16.0%, comparing with the conventional FC configuration.

This study investigated the influence of two important factors the molecular weights (Mw) of polymer and the concentration of nanofillers on the electrical properties of samples. Hybrid nanocomposites were fabricated from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with three different molecular weights (4 k, 8 k, and 20 k) using developed mixing-sonication-solution methods. This method was successfully exhibited a fine homogeneity and good dispersion of both polymers and nanofillers in the matrix as displayed by using an optical microscope (OM). The effect of the addition of graphene oxide on the alternating electrical properties showed a reduction in the dielectric constant and the isolation loss of the polymer compounds (PVA-PEG-GO) with increasing the frequency of the electric field and the loss of isolation increased. It was also shown that the increase of electrical conductivity is noticeable with samples by increasing the molecular weight of PEGs to the highest at 20 k Mw. Increasing the polymer molecular weight in addition to the contribution of GO revealed an extraordinary improvement of the electrical properties that bring promising and performance materials for electronic, photovoltaic devices, heterojunction, solar cells, and energy storage systems, other substantial applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The solar data used in this analysis were obtained from Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) and the method used is the active direct roof mounted solar water heating. The system design process consist of evaluating the optimum collector tilt angle, the thermal analysis of the flat plate collector and hot water storage tank and finally modelling a low cost automatic controller for the system using a microcontroller in the Proteus software. The optimum annual average solar radiation on the tilted solar collector was obtained following the calculation of the conversion ratios of the direct, diffuse and reflected radiations. At annual time scale, the optimum tilt angle (β) that maximizes the collected radiation was 11o and the corresponding optimum average irradiance of 432 W/m2 was obtained. The analytical results presented for the performance of the heater indicate that the system operates at an annual thermal efficiency of 55.49%.

They can be subjected to malfunctioning since they are the most extensively operated buildings' components that account alone for almost half of the total building energy usage. Therefore, fault diagnosis (FD) of the HVAC system is important to maintain the system's reliability and efficiency and provide preventive maintenance. This article presents a supervised FD strategy for single actuator faults in HVAC systems given that actuators, such as dampers and valves, are mostly prone to faults resulting in thermal discomfort and energy inefficiency in buildings. The proposed approach is based on 2-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using an efficient 1-D-to-2-D data transformation performed on the time-series signals acquired from the HVAC system. The performance of the CNNs is ensured by an optimal tuning of its significant hyperparameters using the Bayesian optimization algorithm toward maximizing the classification accuracy. The proposed 1-D-to-2-D data transformation approach is computationally efficient and eliminates the use of advanced signals preprocessing. It is performed in two schemes: the static and dynamic schemes to analyze the correlation between the system's variables and consider the temporal effects of the time-series signals without compromising the detection time.

A widespread solution in case of vehicular applications is to capture the mechanical energy during braking modes, followed by its storage and consequent release during acceleration and cruising modes. Mechanical recuperation systems based on kinetic energy storages (KES) are considered to be a promising alternative due to the lack of necessity for energy transformation. The simplest design of such systems suitable for retrofits is considered in the present work, which incorporates a friction clutch, used as a variable transmission between KES and drive wheels. An analytical solution in closed form for the necessary clutch kinematic transfer function is obtained based on Lagrange equation in case of inertial energy source and load as well as a numerical example for short–term recuperation system with KES is represented.

The additives were shown to facilitate hydrogenation of magnesium during RBM and substantially improve its hydrogen absorption-desorption kinetics. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the formation of nanocrystalline MgH2 and hydrogenation of nano-Ti and Ti4Fe2Ox. The possible reduction of TiO2 during RBM in hydrogen was not observed, which is in agreement with lower hydrogenation capacity of the corresponding composite, 5.7 wt% for Mg + 5 mol% nano-TiO2 compared to 6.5 wt% for Mg + 5 mol% nano-Ti. Hydrogen desorption from the as-prepared composites was studied by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) in vacuum. A significant lowering of the hydrogen desorption temperature of MgH2 by 30–90 °C in the presence of the additives is associated with lowering activation energy from 146 kJ/mol for nanosized MgH2 down to 74 and 67 kJ/mol for MgH2 modified with nano-TiO2 and Ti4Fe2O0.3 additives, respectively. After hydrogen desorption at 300–350 °C, these materials are able to absorb hydrogen even at room temperature. It is shown that nano-structuring and addition of Ti-based catalysts do not decrease thermodynamic stability of MgH2. The thermodynamic parameters, obtained from hydrogen desorption isotherms for the Mg–Ti4Fe2O0.3 nanocomposite, ΔHdes = 76 kJ/mol H2 and ΔSdes = 138 J/K·mol H2, correspond to the reported literature values for pure polycrystalline MgH2.

The current battery recycling methods cannot utilize the remaining value of these retired batteries effectively. Studies have shown that the Second-Life Batteries (SLBs) have a much lower cost compared to fresh batteries but retain a certain capacity simultaneously, which means they have a high secondary utilization value. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage system planning model including Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). BESS designed in this paper involves not only the use of fresh batteries but also the echelon utilization of SLBs and considers the multiple lifespan cycles based on its State of Health (SOH). Moreover, the proposed planning strategy integrates the electricity and transportation networks in the first stage and evaluates the flexibility of the planning system by comparing the adaptation costs of each system in the second stage. The proposed planning model is verified on the IEEE 33-bus electricity system and the 20-node transportation system. According to the simulation results, the differences in system cost and system operation situations caused by fresh batteries and SLBs are analyzed, verifying the effectiveness and flexibility of echelon utilization of SLBs.

The main driving factors of this process are the rapid technological progress of both wind power plants and new technologies for energy storage sources production, such as high-power battery energy storage systems (BESSs). At the same time, the analysis showed that there is a mismatch between the level of technological development and theoretical research in this area. This concerns, first of all, the models of frequency stabilization processes in IPS with a large share of WPPs in their structure. The models available in the literature that can calculate the processes of frequency regulation in these systems are linear. They cannot take into account nonlinear limitations, which are present in real sources, used as regulating power (restrictions on the maximum regulator power, the maximum speed of its change, the width of the dead band, and the module of frequency deviance). The linear models also do not take into account the nonlinearity of dependence of the WPP output power on wind speed and peculiarities of its frequency spectrum. Ignoring nonlinear limits in the mentioned models leads to grossly inaccurate and even incorrect results. With the use of the author’s model, which takes into account these nonlinear constraints, a series of calculations was performed to identify the possibilities of using each of the known classes of power plants and electrical units for automatic frequency control in the IPS with powerful WPPs (coal, gas-oil power plants, gas piston units, battery energy storage systems). Variants for each of the technologies where the frequency in the IPS met the requirements of the European power system ENTSO-E (|Δf| ≤ 0.02 Hz) and the IPS of Ukraine (|Δf| ≤ 0.2 Hz) were considered. It was found that for IPS, which are comparable to IPS of Ukraine in terms of the combination of operating conditions, only BESS is available for use as a frequency regulator in terms of technological and economic factors. It was also investigated and established that to ensure the European requirements for frequency stability in the IPS, the power of the regulator must be not less than the total power swing of the WPP. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Frequency; Integrated power system; Power; Regulator; Wind power plant",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103188242

The islanded mode of Microgrids on the other hand would not only increase the reliability of existing distribution networks but also increase the security of supply for geographically islanded systems. But as a matter of fact, wind and PV systems are inherently intermittent resources so there is always need of some kind of energy storage to smooth out the power fluctuations caused by weather related intermittency. It is also a fact that most of the well-established renewable energy generators and energy storage technologies are coupled to the distribution networks using power electronic converters. The power electronics converters are, on the one hand very flexible and quick to operate, but on the other hand lacking inertial response and very limited fault current providers. Present day protection schemes rely on single setting group which becomes ineffective with increasing penetration level of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable energy sources and energy storages. During faults in grid-connected mode of Microgrids a high magnitude fault current of 10–50 times the nominal current will be expected from the main grid but in islanded mode only limited fault current magnitude of 1–2 times the nominal current will be available due to converter-based generators. The conventional single setting overcurrent protection causes the immediate disconnection of DERs during faults in grid-connected mode and does not allow any islanded mode operation of DERs due to safety reasons. An adaptive protection will be necessarily required for grid-connected Microgrids to continue operation even in islanded mode after disconnection from the main grid due to faults. An adaptive overcurrent protection will have at least two reliable settings groups, one for grid-connected and other for islanded mode of Microgrid. The adaptive setting group of islanded mode overcurrent protection will have to be more sensitive as compared to grid-connected mode considering the reduced fault current contribution of DERs in islanded Microgrid. The adaptive setting groups could be changed from one setting group to other based on the status of Microgrid connecting switches. The status of switches and thus Microgrid mode (grid-connected or islanded mode) information can be exchanged through for example IEC 61850 GOOSE communication protocol with centralized or decentralized communication architecture or through offline communication-less local measurements for example local voltage magnitude. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Adaptive protection; Grid-connected operation; Islanded operation; Microgrid protection",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102753634

It eliminates the need for frequent data transfer between the memory and processing modules and enables the parallel activation of multiple lines. However, vertical data storage is generally required, increasing the implementation complexity for the SRAM writing mode. This article proposes a 10-transistor (10T) SRAM to omit vertical data storage and improve the stability of in-memory computing. A cross-layout of the word line enables arrays with multirow or multicolumn parallel activation to perform vector logic operations in two directions. In addition, the novel horizontal read channel allows matrix transposition. By reconfiguring the data lines, sense amplifiers, and multiplexing read ports, the proposed SRAM can be regarded as a content-addressable memory (CAM), and its symmetry provides selectable data search by column or by row according to the application that easily fits the SRAM storage mode without additional data adjustments. A proposed self-termination structure aims to decrease search energy consumption by approximately 38.5&#x0025; at 0.9 V at the TT process corner. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed design, a 4 Kb SRAM was implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology. The read margin of the proposed 10T SRAM cell is three times higher than that of the conventional 6-transistor cell. At 0.9 V, logic operations can be performed at approximately 300 MHz, and binary CAM search operations are achieved at approximately 260 MHz with around 1 fJ of energy consumption per search/bit.

Soil samples were collected in a 20 ml vial containing 5 ml of methanol and caped with a crimp. The BTEX species were determined with a Headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (HS-GCMS). The mean concentration of ƩBTEX ranged from 0.04 to 2.42 mg kg−1 and was considerably higher in 56% of the sites. The individual and ƩBTEX concentrations are within the Ministry Order (MO) intervention threshold and below the Department of Petroleum Resources-Environmental guidelines and standards for the petroleum industry in Nigeria (DPR-EGASPIN) intervention values. The source analysis indicates that BTEX compounds originated from a common source attributed to gasoline-diesel combustion exhaust, storage, other stationary sources, and fuel evaporative losses from fuel service stations around the gasoline/diesel combustion electricity generator. The hazard index for infants' in 66% of the sites was higher than 1, suggesting adverse non-carcinogenic health effects. The cancer ingestion and dermal exposure risk for infants were greater than that of adults. This study has shown that the diesel-powered electricity generator has impacted considerable concentrations of ƩBTEX in the land-use sites. The agency for power and energy should ensure regular public electricity supply, while the use of solar panels as an alternative source of electric energy should be encouraged. Further study on the occurrence of other priority contaminants in indoor and outdoor environments should be determined in the land-use sites. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","BTEX; diesel combustion; generator; land use; soil pollution",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102519909

If the operation is performed under optimal conditions, there are benefits for microgrid investment. This paper proposes a detailed formulation to operate microgrids with photovoltaic systems and storage. The model can be used with multiple microgrids interconnected considering electricity prices and tariffs. The model corresponds to an optimal power flow approach for microgrids considering some energy storage systems. The mathematical model considers explicitly electricity tariffs. Illustrative results indicate the optimal operation of microgrids considering a load curve; specifically, the microgrid is designed to operate at different operational circumstances.

In most applications, sensor nodes are expected to operate for extended periods without maintenance. Therefore, minimizing power consumption and self-sustainability based on energy harvesting (EH) still represent important research challenges. In this article, a power management strategy (PMS) based on the weighted order statistics (WOS) classification technique is proposed to dynamically adapt the duty cycle of the sensor node according to historical data measurements. Unnecessary acquisition and transmission of slow-varying signals are reduced, improving the power consumption of the node. As traditional renewable sources (sunlight, wind, and vibration) are scarce in indoor scenarios, an array of Dypsis Lutescens plants is used as a power bioenergy cell, providing a clean and cost-effective alternative to power indoor sensor nodes. The WOS technique is programmed into an nRF52840 microcontroller, and an ultralow-power BQ25570 harvesting circuit harnesses the energy from the array of plants.

Packaging that can be used for yoghurt is a bottle of polyethene terephthalate. The purpose of this study was to identify the kinetics of quality decrease of corn yoghurt packed in polyethene terephthalate bottles and estimate its shelf-life. The stages of establishing shelf-life included determining the quality change rate during storage, selecting reaction order, calculating activation energy, determining critical points, and calculating shelf-life. Corn yoghurt was packed in a polyethene terephthalate bottle, then stored at 25°C, 30°C, and 35°C. The analysis was done every seven days, from day-0 to day-21. Parameters analyzed were lactic acid bacteria content, pH, total acid, total dissolved solids, protein, and viscosity. The results showed that corn yoghurt is still acceptable by more than 50% panelists in 21 days of storage at a temperature of 35°C. Lactic acid bacteria, total dissolved solids, and protein content decreased during storage, while the pH, total acid, and viscosity increased. Corn yoghurt packed in polyethene terephthalate and stored at 5°C, 10°C, 15°C, and 20°C have 41, 40, 39, and 38 days of shelf-life, respectively. The implication is that yoghurt-corn packed with polyethene terephthalate has a better shelf life than existing yoghurt to be applied further. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.","Accelerated shelf-life test (ASLT); arrhenius; corn yoghurt; polyethene terephthalate; shelf-life",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102105622

In the case of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), waste storage is prohibited; therefore, alternative options are encouraged: thermal, chemical, or mechanical recycling and comprehensive recovery. If thermal and chemical recycling are more suitable for carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), due to the higher market value obtained after recycling; for GFRP, the most adequate approach is mechanical recovery, due to several reasons: higher added value, reduced costs and loop closing, according to the circular economy. In this work, we propose an energy-saving thermo-mechanical recycling method for the mixed plastic wastes, to obtain composite material plates. The method is economically efficient, and so far, it is the best for this type of waste, considering the cost–benefit ratio. The sound absorption behavior of the obtained plates was analyzed to define the possibility of using them for the reduction of the environmental noise.

Aim of current study was to evaluate the effect of this bulk sweetener (applied individually or in combination with other sweeteners) on technological characteristics, and on quality aspects of garnishing pastry creams. Complete reductions in sucrose were made, substituting it with the same amount of maltitol (Maltisorb P90, Roquette Frères, France)-56.12% (sample B), with mixture of maltitol-46.72% and fructose (Valerus)-9.4% (sample C), with mixture of maltitol-56.12% and aspartame (Nutra Sweet)-0.028% (sample D) and with 62.3% maltitol concentration (sample E). Samples C, D and E were formulated estimating the lower sweetness of maltitol (0.9) comparing with that of sucrose, and in order to develop suitable product composition without loss of sweetness. Physicochemical parameters of dry matter content, total sugar and reducing substances were analyzed respectively by a method of drying to constant weight at t = 1050C and by iodine method. Density determination was made with mass-based pycnometry measurement. pH values were measured with pH-meter Hanna Instruments pH211. Water activity of samples was evaluated with aw meter-Novasina, Switzerland. Starch gelatinization degree was analyzed by amylose iodide method. For determination of total number of microorganisms and total number of molds and yeasts under aerobic conditions were used standardized “Plate count agar” medium and a solid standardized “Chloramphenicol glucose agar” medium. Rheological flows and viscosities of samples were measured at 250C with rotational viscometer Rheotest 2, Germany. Energy values of pastry creams were calculated according to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. Glycemic indicators were determined according methodology proposed in a Patent 40623 Ukraine. Sensory characteristics of samples were estimated by descriptive sensory analysis. In terms of dry matter content, pH, density, water activity and starch gelatinization degree, there were no significant differences between samples prepared with sucrose and maltitol containing samples. Samples B (56.12% maltitol), D (56.12% maltitol + 0.03% aspartame) and E (62.35% maltitol) had about 90% lower total sugar content than control sample A (56.12% sucrose). Therefore, according to EU Regulation No 1924/2006, pastry creams (B, D and E) can be classified as “Food with no added sugars”. Microbiological analysis indicated that the sucrose substitution with maltitol in pastry cream formulation did not affect microorganisms’ development in specific way regardless the storage temperature conditions. In the matter of nutritional data, samples B, D and E had more than 25% lower energy value than sample A. Samples B, C, D and E had less than 5g sugars/100 g product, which gave grounds to refer them to “Foods with low sugars”, according to EU Regulation No 1924/2006. Rheological parameters and sensory evaluation on texture revealed that substitution of sucrose with maltitoll did not lead to negative changes in quality aspects of garnishing pastry creams. Results from performed study gave grounds to consider maltitol as a suitable sucrose replacer in low sugar garnishing pastry creams with 25% lower energy value. © 2021, Consulting and Training Center - KEY.

However, due to the DC-link voltage ratio between the two ports varies with the ESS state of charge (SoC), the voltage vectors in the AC side are unevenly distributed in the QSSC. This nonlinearity brings some challenges in control and modulation design for the AC-DC part of QSSC. In this paper, a virtual two-level converter model considering the two ports as a single DC source is proposed, and model predictive power control (MPPC) based on the virtual two-level model is proposed to enhance the grid current performance. The duty cycle of each phase is calculated based on the active and reactive power tracking error minimization in the two-level converter frame, and the duty cycle for each switching pair is obtained by minimizing the power processed by the DC-DC converter. In this way, the complicated implementation of MPPC for a three-level converter is avoided, and the controller design of the QSSC can be simplified. The effectiveness of the proposed virtual two-level converter model and MPPC method are verified with experimental results.

However, the intensive computations and data movements in CNNs impede the adoption of DNNs in resource-constraint edge devices. Quantization, a common model compression method, has attracted a lot of attention as it enables efficient inference by lowering the data bit-width of CNN parameters. Due to the features of massive storage and computing-in-memory array, resistive memory (RRAM) has established the energy-efficiency and small-area processing-inmemory (PIM) for the acceleration of DNNs at the edge end. However, when deploying network onto RRAM-based PIM, there will be tremendous unused cells due to the mismatch between the structure of neural network layer and memory array, resulting in the resource under-utilization and low computation efficiency. In this work, we observed prior quantization approaches fail to improve hardware resource utilization as they ignored the hardware structure information in RRAM. Thus, combining the information of neural network model and hardware information is essential for a high-utilization RRAM-based PIM design. Considering the vast model parameters and heterogeneous RRAM crossbar structure, we develop a novel quantization framework by leveraging the AutoML technique, i.e. RaQu, which automatically generates a fine-grained quantization strategy for any model that fully utilizes the resource of RRAM-based PIM. The experimental results show that RaQu achieves at most 29.2%-37.4% and 1.8%-3.3% improvement in resource utilization and model accuracy respectively compared to prior coarse-grained quantization methods.

The transition time required for the proposed STATCOM during treatment of a sudden change in reactive current demand from maximum inductive current to maximum capacitive current is less than 40ms.

With stronger commitments from the government, more effective policies such as renewable portfolio standard frameworks and auctions are expected to deliver more renewable electricity to customers. With increasing penetration of solar and wind power causing congestion on the grid, there are considerable opportunities for building local and smart grids that could facilitate more reliable and secure electricity services.

The Abe administration’s support for the restart of some nuclear power plants, based on the safety authorizations given by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, and Abe’s personal pronuclear position, are often assumed to mean that the Abe administration was hostile toward renewables and wanted to return to the pre-3-11 goal of nuclear expansion. This chapter asks whether this is an accurate assessment of the Abe administration’s energy policy. It finds that the answer is no. Rather, the Abe administration merely slowed down the phase out of nuclear power, while continuing its immediate predecessors’ policies of promoting renewable energy through electricity market liberalization, unbundling of grid ownership from generation, promotion of storage capacity for renewables, including the promotion of the hydrogen economy, which all facilitate the further adoption of renewable energy. © 2021, The Author(s).","Electricity market liberalization; Grids; OCCTO; Renewable energy curtailment; Storage batteries; Unbundling",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101351246

This volume looks at challenges that were still in the future back in 2014. Then, renewable energy policy was primarily about support systems, such as FITs, and about rapidly phasing in renewable energy from a very low base. The present book instead recognizes that as ever more renewable energy was phased into the grid, grid systems and the lack of energy storage became the next obstacles to a renewable energy transition, not government support systems for rapid installation. And yet, while the challenges are changing, the countries we looked at in 2014 are in many ways still distinctly recognizable. Their policy challenges are in many ways similar, as are the ways in which they deal with them. Thus, for policymakers, the renewable energy transition to a major extent still consists of muddling through, pragmatically solving problems as they arise, as much as it consists of gazing far ahead into the future. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101325389

Other significant potential benefit includes supply of clean energy in gaseous (biogas) or liquid (bio-oil) form. However, a challenge still exists in determining the levels of biochar contaminants that the soil can tolerate. This risk implies that adequate planning will be needed to ascertain the suitability of sinks to biochar application in order to lessen the potential for adverse effects on soil. To maximize the potential benefits of biochar, a modeling framework for BCMNs can be developed with the aid of Process Systems Engineering (PSE) techniques so as to ensure that the quality requirements set for the sinks are met. To fill this research gap in the global biochar literature, this work develops an optimization framework for BCMNs by accounting for the relevant and practical aspects of biochar research. Since the decision-maker can consider distinct degree of tolerance for every impurity and can have different preferences regarding the amount of contaminant that can be tolerated in each sink, a unique risk aversion parameter is assigned in each sink-contaminant pair. The parameter represents the extent to which the decision-maker can accept soil contamination level. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, a representative network is explored, which attains a profit of USD 17,453,810 and a cumulative CO2 sequestration of 876,961.4 t. The results show how the framework can be used to support decision-making for the proper deployment of BCMNs. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101037379

This has led to concerns being raised regarding the security of the supply of the Portuguese electric system as well as concerns relating to system inertia. Deploying and efficiently using various flexibility options is proposed as a solution to these concerns. Among these flexibility options proposed is the use of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) as well as relaxing system inertia constraints such as the system nonsynchronous penetration (SNSP). This article proposes a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem formulation, which examines the effects of deploying BESS in a power system. The model is deployed on a real-world test case and results show that the optimal use of BESS can reduce system costs by as much as 10&#x0025; relative to a baseline scenario and the costs are reduced further when the SNSP constraint is relaxed. The amount of RES curtailment is also reduced with the increased flexibility of the power system through the use of BESS. Thus, the efficiency of the Portuguese transmission system is greatly increased by the use of flexibility measures, primarily the use of BESS.

Hence, in general, a multiobjective Grey-Wolf optimization-based optimal sizing algorithm is proposed to get optimal configuration for the area of photovoltaic (PV) panel installation, rating of the wind energy conversion system and capacity of battery energy storage system. Furthermore, there is need for real-time energy management in dc nanogrid due to uncertainty in power generation and load forecasting. A virtual energy storage (VES)-based energy management is proposed in this article to enhance the availability of power supply. The VES concept models the high thermal inertia loads such as air-conditioner and refrigerator analogous to electrochemical battery. A priority-based strategy in VES algorithm turn-on and turn-off thermal loads during the power deficit and surplus renewable generation receptively. The VES-based energy management does not compromise the comfort of customers and does not change the usual number of switching in thermal loads.

To save the quality of medicinal and aromatic plants, it is very important to provide optimum drying and storage conditions. The aim of this study is to determine and model the drying kinetics of sage leaves. Initially the desorption isotherms are determined for different temperatures (30, 45 and 60°C). The drying experiments were carried out in a convection oven at the same temperature range. For the desorption isotherms and the drying kinetics, various models reported in the literature were used and from the statistical view, the Yanniotis and Blahovec and the Fick models fit well the results of desorption isotherms and the oven drying, respectively. The net isosteric heat of desorption of the sage leaves ranged from 6.86 to 63.45 kJ/mol. The total time of oven drying reduced substantially with an increase of the drying temperature.

This article proposes a three-stage hybrid robust/stochastic framework to model the coordinated operation of wind producers and compressed air energy storage in the form of a mixed-integer linear programming problem. The proposed algorithm derives robust offering curves to participate in the day-ahead market. In addition to the day-ahead market, intraday and balancing markets are considered for reducing the negative effects of poor predictability of wind speed. In the proposed hybrid framework, intraday and balancing market prices as well as wind speed are modeled by proper scenarios, while robust optimization is used to model the day-ahead price uncertainty. Besides, the risks of stochastic parameters are modeled by the conditional value at risk (CVaR). Based on the results of robust optimization, the uncertainty of the day-ahead market price reduces the aggregator profit by 21.3&#x0025; in the worst case, whereas CVaR results show a 13.2&#x0025; profit reduction due to the worst-case scenario realization in stochastic parameters.

Therefore, energy consumption is a fundamental issue in which the memory subsystem has a significant role. Scratchpad memories (SPM) can provide a broad potential for energy saving. Still, due to the insufficient SPM capacity in such edge devices, a rigorous SPM data allocation scheme is necessary to reduce the energy consumption of the memory subsystem. Emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) are very useful to reduce the energy consumption of the memory subsystem. Therefore, embedded and edge devices can take advantage of hybrid SPM composed of both NVM and SRAM to achieve further energy saving. This paper proposes MASTER, a task mapping, task scheduling, and dynamic SPM allocation scheme that efficiently utilizes the hybrid SPM space. To this end, we model the hybrid SPM allocation on a multi-core system with integer linear programming formulation to minimize the energy consumption of the memory subsystem. Experimental results show that MASTER improves the energy saving of the memory subsystem by up to 34% compared to EADA, which is a heuristic dynamic data allocation algorithm for multi-core systems with hybrid SPM.

We previously reported the melanocortin α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) ability to increase the number of beige cells in subcutaneous inguinal WAT (ingWAT) in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The current study examined the browning effect of intraperitoneally administered α-MSH on diverse fat depots from mice fed with HFD or standard rodent diet (SD). For this, mRNA expression of browning hallmark genes was quantified concomitantly with histological examination of the adipose tissue samples (epidydimal (eWAT), mesenteric (mWAT), retroperitoneal (rpWAT) or ingWAT). As well, α-MSH impact on body weight, serum profile, WAT mass and lipolytic rates were evaluated. In the visceral depots mWAT, eWAT and rpWAT from HFD-fed mice, α-MSH was not able to induce a browning mechanism. Surprisingly, in SD-fed mice, α-MSH decreased the expression of several beige-specific genes in rpWAT and promoted an increase of the size of lipid droplets. No browning effect was observed in ingWAT from SD-fed mice. We also verified that HFD ingestion per se stimulated the browning mechanisms in rpWAT, but not in mWAT and eWAT.

In view of the report on the accelerated depletion of fossil resources due to the ever increasing energy needs and the challenges of environmental preservation of carbon dioxide emissions, the use of renewable resources for the production of electricity is a promising alternative. However, solar and wind resources are of intermittent types because the wind turbine output power varies with the wind speed at different conditions and the solar energy also varies with the hourly, daily and seasonal variation of solar irradiation, we propose in this work, behavioural study and analysis of an hybrid generation system combining solar and wind energy connected to the grid with a battery (energy storage) to ensure that the system performs under different climatic conditions. The objective of this work is to ensure the best performances of the proposed hybrid configuration under different possible operating scenarios.

Where, micro-grids and aggregators are used as smart agents that can communicate with each other to share information, distribute energy and control their own energy consummation. Aggregators make the link between flexible resources. Smart-agents are an emerging technology for decentralized computation and data storage, secured by a combination of cryptographic signatures and a distributed consensus mechanism. So, two types of agents: energy Generation AGent (GAG) and Bus Agent (BAG) are used to regulate the voltage levels by injecting more power at some buses using the renewable energy sources. The interaction between the two types of agents is based on communication and exchange of information about the parameters and the state of the power grid. For testing this approach, a developed tester by our laboratory has been used that gives a good result. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Decentralized energy management system; Distributed energy resources; Internet of Things; Multi-agent system; Renewable resources; Smart grid",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098246399

This paper presents a modified operational mode of a grid-connected hybrid PV and battery energy storage system (BESS) in Cyprus. The BESS is coupled with residential rooftop PVs and is functioning under an operational mode aiming to decrease the peak power fed into the grid by storing the excess PV generation. The stored energy is then used to cover the mismatch between generation and demand, thus also increasing the on-site PV self-consumption. Given the favourable environmental conditions in Cyprus, with increased PV generation especially during summer, a significant amount of excess PV generation exported to the grid is still observed, as the BESS is usually fully charged before noon. For this reason, a modification of the operational mode of the aforementioned BESS was performed, aiming to reduce the building’s interaction with the electricity grid during peak export hours by delaying the BESS charging process. An analysis of the system’s operation during that period and its contribution towards grid interaction limitation is presented. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Battery energy storage systems; Energy management; Grid interaction; Photovoltaics","Charging time; Electric power transmission networks; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Battery energy storage systems; Charging process; Electricity grids; Environmental conditions; Grid interaction; Grid-connected; Operational modes; Stored energy; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098106722

The following work presents a study to determine the value of the Levelized Cost of Storage considering the reliability of the battery life used in the storage system. For this study, the mathematical developments carried out in previous research were considered, both in the calculation of the Levelized Cost of Storage as for calculating battery life with a certain reliability percentage. This study used Weibull’s probability function to determine the reliability of battery life as well as all the parameters necessary for the calculation of the Levelized Cost of Storage. The calculation processes were carried out in computer programs, especially with regard to iterative processes. The results show that the value of the Levelized Cost of Storage increases as you have a higher percentage of reliability, which means that a storage system might have the same value of the Levelized Cost of Storage with different percentage of reliability, which shows an additional parameter to compare various storage systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Battery life; Levelized cost of storage; Storage systems; Weibull probability function","Electric batteries; Iterative methods; Weibull distribution; Calculation process; Electricity generation; Energy needs; Iterative process; Levelized costs; Primary energy source; Probability functions; Storage systems; Reliability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097656426

This research was directed to moisture sorption isotherm, air drying kinetics, and vit-C degradation throughout blanching, storage, and drying of carambola. Fresh carambola contained 91.44% moisture and 24.2 mg/100 g vit-C. The monolayer moisture content was 7.3 g/100 g solid according to Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) equation. The drying process (cabinet dryer) at different temperatures and sample thickness exposed that more the temperature, higher the drying rate at a constant thickness. Furthermore, drying rate was declined at a constant temperature with the rise of sample thickness. The samples pretreated with citric acid showed the lowest drying time and vit-C degradation in blanching. The influence of drying temperature and duration on the retention of vit-C was also analyzed. The activation energy (Ea) of the vit-C loss was 9.24 kcal/g-mole. Higher the exposure at a constant temperature, more the reduction of vit-C content as per first-order reaction kinetics. During room temperature storage of whole carambola in 3 and 12 days showed 13.7% and 41.2% loss of vit-C, respectively. Vit-C degradation was lower for blanched than non-blanched samples in refrigeration storage, while this change was relatively lower for both in frozen storage. Scanning electronic microscopic (SEM) studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of temperature and pretreatment on the surface morphology of dried carambola. Practical applications: Carambola grows abundantly in Bangladesh. Nevertheless its availability and nutritive significance, it is not so utilized and popular in the fruit market. This yields postharvest difficulties for chemical and microbial spoilage due to its perishability. Therefore, drying of this fruit is an utmost operative and cost-effective process. Thus, it will be accessible in off-season and can be used for the development of new products with these dried fruits.

In many areas, climate change impacts have affected the availability of basic necessities including freshwater, food security, and energy. Developing countries are more adversely impacted by climate change and are less prepared to cope with its impacts. Over the years, local communities in these countries have been using their local based knowledge commonly known as indigenous knowledge (IK) to adapt to any form of uncertainty including climate change. This article assesses the IK used by the mixed farmers in Tanzania to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The study that informed this article was conducted in Missenyi and Muleba Districts, Kagera Region along the Ngono River Basin in Tanzania. It employed different techniques and methods to gather information from both primary and secondary sources including focus group discussions, key informant interviews, observation and desk reviews. The findings revealed that local communities within the basin have developed a sophisticated body of knowledge to withstand impacts of climate change. This knowledge is socially constructed and embedded within the socio-cultural context of the local communities. The findings further established that IK is mostly used in a situation of long drought season, infestation of diseases and pests for both livestock and crops as well as during occurrence of strong winds. In such circumstances, most oft-cited adaptation practices used include farming and grazing in wetlands, growing of drought resistant crops, using locally made pesticides, and grain storage, to mention but a few. The article recommends that despite the fact that some IK seems to be helpful at the local level, it is necessary that local communities are assisted in their adaptive strategies so that they can respond to climate change effectively and enhance their resilience. © 2020 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.","adaptation; climate change; indigenous knowledge; mixed farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094883014

At present, investigations on packaged beverages (e.g. bottled drinking water, beer, milk and refreshments) have received scientific attention and represent an important part of microplastic research as humans are orally exposed to these anthropogenic contaminants every day. Rapid and effective detection methods are important to quantify micro- and nanoplastic particles with a great accuracy as well as to identify their sources and characteristics. A number of methods are currently in use to assess microplastics in packaged beverages; however, the great variations in methods and data acquisition render difficulties when comparing the results and developing the protocols. Based on the challenges, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of emerging technological approaches, points out the current limitations from sample preparation to quantification and present recommendations. From the results of our analysis, we postulate an example framework that can be applied to different types of drinking products for investigating micro- and nanoplastics. Overall, this review will serve as a first step towards harmonization of micro- and nanoplastic monitoring efforts and a point of reference to help direct future researches focusing on drinking products intended for human consumption. This paper focuses on adopting a unified approach towards determination and characterization of micro (nano)plastics on packaged beverages by critically summarizing the available literature information of detection, analysis and methods regarding microplastic contamination including; drinking water, beer, milk and other refreshments, along with describing an example framework to provide a guideline for further research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Drinking water; Food; FTIR; Microplastics; Nanoplastics; Raman","Beer; Dairies; Data acquisition; Elastomers; Microplastic; Anthropogenic contaminants; Bottled drinking waters; Current limitation; Detection methods; Human consumption; Number of methods; Sample preparation; Unified framework; Potable water; alcohol; hydrogen peroxide; microplastic; nanoplastic; polymer; drinking water; plastic; accuracy assessment; detection method; drinking water; food consumption; food storage; FTIR spectroscopy; plastic waste; pollution monitoring; Raman spectroscopy; beer; beverage; coffee; concentration (parameter); energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; energy drink; filtration; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; fruit drink; fruit squash; human; limit of quantitation; mass fragmentography; measurement accuracy; pyrolysis; Raman spectrometry; reproducibility; Review; risk assessment; scanning electron microscopy; soft drink; standardization; tea; ultracentrifugation; vibrational spectroscopy; viscosity; whiskey; wine; environmental monitoring; packaging; water pollutant; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Plastics; Product Packaging; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093695752

The analysis involves the identification of the most influential threats to the security of natural gas supply and prioritization of the strategic measures for overcoming the consequences of threats. The proposed methodology is based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process. The obtained weights for the identified threats and strategic measures are formed according to experts' judgments. The results of the experts’ judgments indicate that the most influential threats are termination of supply at the border with Hungary, termination of supply from Russia, and termination of supply from gas storage. The strategic measure with the highest priority is the so-called “Turkish Stream” project. Two additional strategic measures (gas interconnection Serbia – Bulgaria and the project of expanding the capacities of underground gas storage) could also be beneficial. The final results are validated by two security of supply indicators - Infrastructural Supply Standard (N-1) and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). The N-1 is implemented to examine the preparedness of the gas system for disruption of the largest source in the network, while the HHI is implemented to examine the diversification of the imports. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decision-making; Energy indicators; Fuzzy AHP; Natural gas supply; Security of supply","Gas industry; Gas supply; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Gas sector; Gas storage; Gas systems; Herfindahl-hirschman indices; Prioritization; Security of supply; Turkishs; Underground gas storage; analytical hierarchy process; decision making; energy market; fuzzy mathematics; natural gas; prioritization; strategic approach; Serbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092096515

This is not unusual since these systems can provide a large increase in efficiency and reliability while decreasing the carbon footprint. In most small and medium size UAVs the fully electric propulsion system is implemented. To obtain a propulsion system with an overall high efficiency one must take into consideration the efficiencies of all individual components as well as their matching meaning that the individual characteristics of all components have to be considered when designing the propulsion system. In this paper a propeller design methodology for a fully electric propulsion system is presented. The electric components were represented via simplified mathematical models while the propeller design was performed by the blade momentum theory with vortex wake deflection including corrections for the tip losses. The airfoil aerodynamic characteristics for different Reynolds numbers were determined by XFOIL and corrected for Mach number and post stall effects due to rotation. An off-design point analysis of the designed propeller was then performed and discussed. It was shown that an efficient fully electric propulsion system for initial design purposes can be created with the methodology. Some recommendations regarding the limitations and the possible improvements are also given in the paper. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","BLDC motor; Electric propulsion; Propeller design",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090899595

In New Zealand, the dairy farming sector has the capacity to shift demand outside of peak periods and balance grid demand. We assess the potential for a group of six large-scale New Zealand dairy farms to provide electricity demand flexibility by analysing their electricity demand patterns based on one year of 30 min resolution electricity data. Daily profiles of electricity demand are analysed to demonstrate that irrigation and milking related electricity consumption contribute to peaks. Under a proposed time-of use (TOU) pricing model, 20% of electricity costs in the dairy shed result from the morning peak period. Flattening demand would reduce electricity costs for milking by 3.3% as more of the demand would be overnight and ‘off-peak’. TOU changes to irrigation were found to make responding to peaks more difficult where at least 600 kW had previously been available for load shedding during the irrigation season. If farmers were able to alter their practices or utilise energy storage technologies in response to time-of-use pricing they could reduce energy costs and reduce their impact on peaks in demand on the electricity network. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090325332

Despite the well-known advantages inherent to the resource, there are several challenges that must be overcome before wave energy gains a relevant share of the global energy market. While near-commercial stages of development are still outside the reach of most wave energy converters, it is important to find new perspectives that facilitate the development process and improve the chances of a successful deployment and operation. In this paper, a review of synergetic technologies with the potential for hybridization and/or co-location with wave energy converters is presented. Potential applications of wave energy conversion devices, within the context of nearshore and offshore niche markets that minimize/eliminate, respectively, mainland grid connection and inherent costs are also discussed. It is found that mutual gains can be attained from this complementary approach, namely in terms of infrastructure sharing, critical component protection, introduction of a beneficial shielding effect, energy storage upgrading, coastal erosion mitigation and electricity supply to various marine mobile platforms for different offshore and nearshore activities, amongst others. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hybridization; Marine resources; Offshore industries; Renewable electricity supply; Wave energy; WEC applications","Electric energy storage; Offshore oil well production; Power markets; Alternative energy source; Commercial viability; Critical component; Development process; Global energy market; Infrastructure sharing; Potential synergies; Wave energy converters; Wave energy conversion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089140938

In contrast, congenital generalized lipodystrophy represents the most extreme form of leanness in humans caused by recessive mutations in four genes involved in phospholipid/triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet/caveolae structure. In this disease, the inability to store triglyceride in adipocytes results in hypoleptinemia and ectopic hepatic and muscle fat accumulation leading to fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia and severe insulin resistance. As a result of hypoleptinemia, patients with lipodystrophy show alterations in eating behaviour characterized by constant increased energy intake. As it occurs in obesity caused by genetic leptin deficiency, exogenous leptin rapidly reduces hunger scores in patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy, with additional beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and metabolic profile normalization. The melanocortin-4 receptor agonist setmelanotide has been used in the treatment of monogenic obesities. There is only one report on the effect of setmelanotide in a patient with partial lipodystrophy resulting in mild reductions in hunger scores, with no improvements in metabolic status. The assessment of contrasting phenotypes of obesity/leanness represents an adequate strategy to understand the pathophysiology and altered eating behaviour associated with adipose tissue excessive accumulation/paucity. ©2020 World Obesity Federation","leanness; leptin; lipodystrophy; obesity","hormone; leptin; leptin receptor; melanocortin 4 receptor; melanocortin receptor agonist; proopiomelanocortin; setmelanotide; triacylglycerol; leptin; adipocyte; adipose tissue; agonist; body fat; caloric intake; congenital generalized lipodystrophy; fatty liver; feeding behavior; gene knockout; glucose homeostasis; human; hunger; hyperleptinemia; hypertriglyceridemia; insulin resistance; lean body weight; leptin deficiency; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; metabolic fingerprinting; monogenic disorder; muscle; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; phenotype; Review; sensitization; congenital generalized lipodystrophy; genetics; obesity; Adiposity; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Leptin; Lipodystrophy, Congenital Generalized; Obesity; Phenotype",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088823045

In this study, the effects of season (dry or wet), drying methods (i.e., artisanal: bare ground, rock surface, meshes laid on the ground or raised racks or adopted), as well as storage time on Rastrineobola argentea used for fishmeal in East Africa were examined. Lipid oxidation and proximate composition stability were determined at 30-day intervals over a period of 90 days. Lipid oxidation stability was monitored by determining free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs). Changes in proximate composition were based on moisture, ash, crude protein (CP), crude fat (EE), and gross energy (GE). The relationships among lipid oxidation and proximate composition parameters were also explored. Considerable oxidative rancidity reflected by significantly high levels of FFA, PV, and TBARs in dried R. argentea was recorded in the wet than in the dry season. Drying of R. argentea on bare ground and meshes laid on the ground led to higher lipid oxidation than drying on raised racks. Lipid oxidation was also significantly higher in salted and indirectly dried R. argentea than in the unsalted and directly dried samples. Dry matter tended to decrease with storage time, as ash was high in salted samples and those dried on bare ground. There was a general decrease in EE content with storage time that coincided with peroxidation. However, CP and GE were less affected by season, processing methods and storage time. Drying R. argentea on raised racks was the best among the processing method investigated. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","Lipid oxidation; processing methods; proximate composition; Rastrineobola argentea; seasonality; storage time","aquaculture system; cyprinid; fatty acid; food quality; food supplementation; lipid; oxidation; seasonality; East Africa; Cyprinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080903925

Unprecedented combinations of properties can be achieved when materials of dissimilar nature and contrasting properties like metals and ceramics are merged. For multimaterial systems, the key challenge is to develop suitable manufacturing processes as to be able to, first, successfully produce the material and, second, to achieve the desired behavior without compromising the integrity of the combined materials. A particular interesting class of material is what are defined in this work as structural electroactive cermets: composite materials constituted by conductive ductile metallic particles dispersed within and used as reinforcement for an insulating dielectric matrix. Specifically, chemically unreactive conductive second-phase reinforcing metallic particles such as Ag or Pt are added to piezoelectric ceramics aiming to enhance their brittle mechanical behavior. As analyzed in the present review, the quest for better mechanical properties results in the enhancement of the dielectric properties in general and of the dielectric constant in particular via the percolation effect for which the percolation theory and other alternative models are discussed. Finally, challenges are identified and potential areas of scientific interest for further developments proposed. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","barium titanate; Cermet; dielectric properties; lead zirconate titanate; mechanical properties; piezoelectric ceramics","Barium titanate; Cermets; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties; Lead zirconate titanate; Materials handling; Mechanical properties; Metallic matrix composites; Metals; Piezoelectric ceramics; Piezoelectricity; Reinforcement; Solvents; Dielectric matrixes; Further development; Manufacturing process; Mechanical behavior; Multimaterial systems; Percolation effects; Structural energies; Technological innovation; Structural properties",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075342265

Paired with a realization that thermal power plants are likely to play a significant role during the transitional period towards a 100% sustainable energy system, carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofit is becoming a growingly important consideration for a number of power plant operators. This paper analyzes the possibility of retrofitting a coal-fired power plant based in Croatia. A techno-economic model of the proposed unit is built setting up key elements of the technological solution and determining their capital and operational costs. Both a sensitivity analysis and a market analysis are conducted in order to best evaluate the feasibility of the CCS retrofit project. Particularities of South East Europe power sectors are considered utilizing an optimization software. Special consideration is given to the influence of the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) on CCS projects. Further research focuses on the main factors influencing the potential implementation of CCS. Key recommendations that might aid CCS deployment are outlined signaling stronger government support, stable regulatory framework, and market incentives as crucial factors able to foster CCS development. Considering the project in the study, analyses showed that, although technically feasible, CCS retrofit is currently not a financially viable option. Without a stable regulatory framework able to guarantee an adequate supporting scheme, the project is not market competitive. It is important to note that the economic gap of CCS retrofit has been considerably reduced during the past years. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","CCS; CCS retrofit; ETS; South East Europe; techno-economic assessment","Carbon footprint; Coal; Commerce; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Retrofitting; Sensitivity analysis; Thermoelectric power plants; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CCS retrofit; Coal-fired power plant; Regulatory frameworks; South East Europe; Sustainable energy systems; Techno-economic assessment; Technological solution; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062973415
