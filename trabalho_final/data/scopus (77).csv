It is the Worlds' fourth most water deprived country with a water consumption of only 145 m3 per capita annually, less than a third of the established severe water poverty line. Jordan is also a country rich in wind and solar potential but practically no utilization with 99% of the produced electricity coming from imported fossil fuels resulting in high CO2 emissions and a potential security of supply issue. The utilization of reverse osmosis desalination in a combination with brine operated pump storage units and wind and (PV) photovoltaic plants can tackle both issues. The desalination plants can produce the much needed water and act as a flexible demand to increase the penetration of intermittent renewables supported by the brine operated pump storage units. This paper presents six scenarios for the development of the Jordanian energy system until the year 2050. The results have shown that the demonstrated configuration can increase the share of intermittent renewables in the production of electricity up to 76% resulting in a high reduction of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and costs. These analyses have been performed using the EnergyPLAN advanced energy system analyses tool. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The system was primarily assembled to verify the operability of the control algorithms and practical deployment of available commercial hydrogen technologies that are directly usable for storage of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in a small island system. This energetic system was installed and tested in Laboratory of fuel cells that is located in the university campus of VSB–Technical University of Ostrava. The energetic system consists of several basic components: a photovoltaic field, accumulator’s bank, water commercial electrolyzer and compact fuel cell system. The weather conditions recorded in two different weeks as model weather and solar conditions are used as case studies to test the energetic system and the results for two different cases are compared each other. The results show and illustrate selected behaviour curves of the power system and also average energy storage efficiency for accumulation subsystem based on hydrogen technologies or at the energetic system embedded components.

Inverse opals (IOs) are formed using variants of solution drop-casting, N2-gun assisted infiltration and high-rate (200 mm min-1) iterative dip-coating methods. Through Raman scattering, transmission electron microscopy and optical diffraction, we show how the oxide phase, crystallinity and structure are inter-related and controlled. Opal template removal steps are demonstrated to determine the morphology, crystallinity and phase of the resulting 2D and 3D IO structures. The ability to form high quality 2D IOs is also demonstrated using UV Ozone removal of PMMA spheres. Rapid hydrolysis of the alkoxide precursor allows the formation of 2D arrays of crystalline hollow spheres of V2O5 by utilizing over-filling during iterative dip-coating. The methods and crystallinity control allow 2D and 3D hierarchically structured templates and inverse opal vanadium oxides directly on conductive surfaces.

Nevertheless, the implementation of Al-air batteries as a sustainable energy storage device is hampered by severe hurdles. Al anode high corrosion rate in aqueous alkaline solution is of major concern in terms of Al usage and safety. In non-aqueous electrolytes adverse Al surface activation substantially limits any power output. This study presents a novel non-aqueous Al-air battery. This battery utilizes 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium oligo-fluoro-hydrogenate (EMIm(HF)2.3F) room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL). Al-air batteries can sustain current densities up to 1.5 mA cm-2, producing capacities above 140 mA h cm-2, thus utilizing above 70% of the theoretical Al capacity. This is equivalent to an outstanding energy densities of 2300 W h kg-1 and 6200 W h L-1. We detected Al2O3 at the air electrode as the battery discharge product of the oxygen reduction coupled with Al ions migrated to the air electrode. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.",,"Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ionic liquids; Liquids; Metal drawing; Primary batteries; Aqueous alkaline solutions; Battery discharge; Ionic liquid electrolytes; Non-aqueous electrolytes; Research interests; Room temperature ionic liquids; Surface activation; Sustainable energy; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910140757

Probability density functions are used to model the variability of the hourly wind speed and the solar irradiation in regard to a negative correlation. Case studies based on an Iberian Peninsula wind and concentrated solar power plants are presented, providing the optimal energy and spinning reserve for the short-term self-scheduling in order to unveil the coordination benefits and synergies between wind and solar resources.

This paper assesses CaL (Calcium Looping) as one of the innovative carbon capture options able to deliver low energy and cost penalties. The work evaluates how the integration of post-combustion calcium looping influences the economics of power plants providing up-dated techno-economic indicators. Coal-based combustion plants operated in both sub- and super-critical steam conditions were evaluated, as well as coal gasification plant using an oxygen-blown entrained-flow gasifier. As benchmark options used to quantify the carbon capture energy and cost penalties, the same power generation technologies were evaluated without CCS (Carbon capture and storage). The power plant concepts investigated in the paper generates around 545-560MW net power with at least 90% carbon capture rate. Introduction of CaL technology for CO2 capture results in a 24-42% increase of specific capital investment, the O&amp;M costs are increasing with 24-30% and the electricity cost with 39-48% (all compared to non-CCS cases).

Proteins are directly involved in plant stress response so it is important to study proteome changes under various stress conditions. Generally, both abiotic and biotic stress factors induce profound alterations in protein network covering signaling, energy metabolism (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ATP biosynthesis, photosynthesis), storage proteins, protein metabolism, several other biosynthetic pathways (e.g., S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, lignin metabolism), transport proteins, proteins involved in protein folding and chaperone activities, other protective proteins (LEA, PR proteins), ROS scavenging enzymes as well as proteins affecting regulation of plant growth and development. Proteins which have been reported to reveal significant differences in their relative abundance or posttranslational modifications between wheat, barley or related species genotypes under stress conditions are listed and their potential role in underlying the differential stress response is discussed.

It explores attitudes toward the environment in general and then, more specifically, toward global warming and global warming-mitigation technologies. It also explores student understanding of sources of carbon dioxide and climate change-mitigation technologies, such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Further, it analyses responses to questions about willingness of respondents to pay to solve global warming. The data was collected in October and November of 2011 using a structured questionnaire which was first formulated in English and then translated into Greek. The analysis was performed using the statistical package SPSS v17.0 and focused on descriptive statistics, in order to compare the average ratings for the different statements.The present study concludes that university students in Greece are overwhelmingly positively disposed towards the environment with the majority of respondents believing that protecting the environment should have priority over economic considerations. Students also view the effects of global warming as serious enough to warrant action and state their belief that the current generation should meet its own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. Moreover, the majority of the participants are against the development of nuclear energy, favoring RES (solar wind and bioenergy), and energy conservation technologies. However, the study has also identified a lack of understanding in regards to sources of carbon dioxide. The majority of the respondents do not seem to know that oceans act as sinks of CO2emissions or that the housing stock is a significant contributor to this problem. © 2014 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

The photochemical quantum yields for photocyclization and photocycloreversion of the compound are found to be high and comparable to each other; the latter of which is rarely found in diarylethene compounds.

These novel mobile phone applications rely on advanced sensor information processes, which mainly involve raw data acquisition, feature extraction, data interpretation and transmission. However, the continuous accessing of sensing resources to acquire sensor data in smartphones is still very expensive in terms of energy, particularly due to the periodic use of power-intensive sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The key underlying idea to design energy-efficient schemes is to control the duty cycle of the GPS receiver. However, adapting the sensing rate based on dynamic context changes through a flexible middleware has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel modular middleware architecture and runtime environment to directly interface with application programming interfaces (APIs) and embedded sensors in order to manage the duty cycle process based on energy and context aspects. The proposed solution has been implemented in the Android software stack. It allows continuous location tracking in a timely manner and in a transparent way to the user. It also enables the deployment of sensing policies to appropriately control the sampling rate based on both energy and perceived context. We validate the proposed solution taking into account a reference location-based service (LBS) architecture. A cloud-based storage service along with online mobility analysis tools have been used to store and access sensed data. Experimental measurements demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our middleware, in terms of energy and location resolution. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Context-awareness; Energy-awareness; Location-based services; Middleware; Mobile sensing applications","Application programming interfaces (API); Cellular telephone systems; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Encoding (symbols); Energy efficiency; Error analysis; Feature extraction; Global positioning system; Knowledge based systems; Middleware; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Smartphones; Telecommunication services; Telephone sets; Tracking (position); Context- awareness; Continuous locations; Disruptive innovations; Energy-awareness; Global positioning system receivers; Middleware architecture; Mobile phone applications; Mobile sensing; Location based services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916919999

Based on principles of thermodynamics, we calculate the energy balance in the SOFC/MH system and derive analytical expressions for both the thermal power produced during SOFC operation and the corresponding thermal power required for H 2 desorption, as a function of the operating temperature, efficiency and fuel utilization ratio in the SOFC, and the MH enthalpy of desorption in the tank. Based on these calculations, we propose an integrated SOFC/MH design where heat is transferred primarily by radiation to the tank in order to maintain steady-state desorption conditions. We develop a mathematical model for this particular design that accounts for heat/mass transfer and desorption kinetics in the tank, and solve for the dynamics of the system assuming MgH 2 as a storage material.

The nanoparticle composites were examined as electrochemical supercapacitor materials for energy storage application. We found that the shape of the nanoparticles is dominantly droplet-shape, with shape complementary to graphene support, which ensures good contact between them. The height of the nanoparticles increases linearly with the diameter with a coefficient of 0.44 from the fitting results, and the average height/diameter ratio of those nanoparticles is about 0.6, evidence that the nanoparticles have strong interaction with the graphene template, partially because of graphene-nickel ion interaction which ensures good surface wetting.

Improvement of the rate capability can be further obtained by partially filling the hollow core with nickel metal, as 93.6% of the specific capacitance is retained with this structure by increasing the discharge density from 1 A g-1 to 10 A g-1.

To expand the applications of these structures in areas such as electronics, catalysis, separation, ion exchange, and gas storage, new novel chalcogenides materials are being developed by modifying their structure and chemical components. By doing so, properties such as band gap, luminescence, pore size, surface area, and thermal stability can be improved considerably. Semiconductor nanostructures have excellent optical and electronic properties, which are very different from the bulk semiconductors. Bulk semiconductors represent the overlapping of infinite number of atomic orbitals and continuous energy levels, which result in the formation of conduction and valence bands. On the other hand, the intrinsic semiconductors have completely separated conduction and valence bands. Whereas in the case of semiconductor nanostructure materials, it has been reported that band gap energy increases with the decrease in the size of the material within some critical range. Especially when the size becomes less than the excitation Bohr radius, continuum energy levels will not be formed due to lesser number of atoms. So, instead of continuum energy levels, electrons and holes are confined in three-dimensional nanocrystallites, resulting in the breakdown of continuum energy bands in to discrete atomic-like energy states. The critical radius of these nanostructures can vary from 2 to 60 nm or so depending on their identity group (IV, III-V, II-VI, or IV-VI). It shows that size plays an important role in the optoelectronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures. Along with the size of semiconductor nanostructures, their structure also influences both the physical and chemical properties. Nanocrystal surfaces often have trap sites caused by structural defects, such as vacancies or lattice mismatches, unsaturated bonds, and other surface discontinuities. So, in this chapter, we discuss and review in detail the optical properties and structural defects of chalcogenides nanostructures and their modern applications in different challenging fields. © 2015 by Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Highly effective utilization of solar energy is arguably the most promising way to address the issues of energy shortage, climate change, and environmental pollution. Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen energy is a promising process for solar energy absorption, conversion, and storage. Visible-light-driven photocatalysts have extensively been developed aiming at solar hydrogen production from water. Metal sulfide photocatalysts represented by ZnS and CdS show high activities for sacrificial H2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing electron donors. Metal sulfides are attractive materials as candidates of visible-light-driven photocatalysts. The valence band usually consists of S 3p orbitals, the level of which is more negative than O 2p. Many metal sulfide photocatalysts have been reported for H2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents. Such an achievement will contribute to global energy and environmental issues in the future resulting in bringing about an energy revolution. © 2015 by Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Or should it rather continue to tighten the screws on the Putin regime, in the hope that doing so will concurrently compel the Russian Federation to moderate its behaviour? This paper argues that it is not prudent for the EU to decrease cooperation with Russia in the short term, but rather push for a political solution without additional sanctions and in the long-term secure different fossil resources such as LNG and different suppliers such as Iraq and Iran. Whichever way the EU chooses, Ukraine’s role in EU energy security is depreciating. Nevertheless, the EU possesses a stronger bargaining position than widely believed because Russia lacks a credible alternative to European foreign direct investments (FDI). The EU should (1) establish an energy union that includes gas storage and distribution plans and extends the Energy Community to include Turkey to pave the way for future gas flows; (2) support infrastructure projects that increase reverse flow capacities within the EU as well as South Stream or its heirs and the Southern Corridor via Turkey to enhance import capacity; and (3) massively invest into energy research. © 2014, The Author(s).","Energy union; Russia; South stream; Ukraine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025112684

In addition, the process gives substantial amounts of solid by-products making the integration of mineral carbonation with other industries an opportunity to both reduce CO2 emissions and substitute raw material inputs. Aspen Plus® v7.2 software is used to optimize the ÅA process towards minimal energy use and to study the impact of the flue gases' CO2 concentration (conventional coal firing (CCF) vs. oxyfuel combustion (OXY) flue gases) in the carbonation step instead of pre-separated and compressed CO2 (providing an additional benefit compared to ""conventional"" CO2 capture and storage (CCS) options).

This allowed them to determine the time that a particle spends close to the wall region, its renewal rate, the vertical velocities of solids, and their circulation frequency. The have been able to successfully determine the particle motion inside solar receivers. ""By doing so, they have realized that the best ratio of carrier particles to air is 50:50. Simply putting fewer particles in to achieve this balance improves heat transfer, which in turn reduces energy loss throughout the entire process. CSP systems work by having thousands of mirrors reflect sunlight back onto a tower to absorb the energy from the sunlight. The tower contains a heat transfer fluid that is used to produce steam to drive turbines for electricity generation. Conventional CSP arrays use molten salt as a heat transfer fluid, but this method has a number of disadvantages, in particular a limited working temperature domain. The CSP2 project aims to replace this with tubes of dense gas-particle suspensions.

Numerous factors may indeed influence (i) the composition of the potato tuber itself, i.e. genotype, environmental conditions during growth, post-harvest storage conditions, cooking and processing, and (ii) the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of its components, affecting the final bioactivity. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of potato composition variability followed by an analysis of potential health-promoting effects and bioavailability of specific components including iron and phenolic compounds. It appeared that the various components of the potato matrix might interact with each other at the intestinal level, leading to favourable or detrimental effects on their bioavailability. The consumption of a potato cultivar with a high level of phenolic compounds may improve the health status of an individual regarding its risk of developing chronic diseases on the one hand, but may reduce iron absorption on the other hand, putting an individual at risk of micronutrient deficiency. Tailoring potato varieties or products to match the population nutritional needs appears therefore of major importance. © 2015, European Association for Potato Research.","Bioavailability; Human health; Iron; Micronutrients; Nutritional value; Quality; Secondary metabolites; Vitamins",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940004791

Firstly, SnO2 precursor sols were synthesized after removing chloride ions. Then the sols coated on MWCNT buckypapers, which used as substrates to form nanocomposite electrodes by spin coating method. Sintered nanocomposite structures were then characterized by field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Electrochemical tests were performed for the produced electrodes, assembled as CR2016 cells. The effect of spin rate on the anode capacity was investigated. Coating on the MWCNT buckypapers was thought to use as mechanical support to prevent electrode failure and prevented the formation of cracks of the sol-gel thin film on the MWCNT surfaces. The results showed beneficial effects to prevent mechanical disintegration and subsequent anode pulverization of SnO2 anodes because of huge volume increase during lithium intercalation. The results indicated that the nanocrystalline SnO2/MWCNT composites are suitable for applying as an anode electrode for Li-ion batteries to increase electrochemical energy storage performance. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Free-standing anode; Li-ion batteries; MWCNT buckypaper nanocomposite; Sol-gel; Tin dioxide","Anodes; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Coatings; Electric batteries; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Ions; Lithium; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanocomposites; Nanocrystals; Scanning electron microscopy; Sintering; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Spectrometers; Tin dioxide; X ray diffraction; X ray spectrometers; Yarn; Buckypaper; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical test; Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometers; Lithium Intercalation; Nano-composite structure; Nanocomposite electrodes; Spin-coating method; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931594861

To acquire this energy the body has to move the food through the GI tract, secrete digestive juices to digest the food, and absorb the nutrients during their passage through the GI tract. The anatomical and physiological basics of these processes are going to be reviewed in this chapter. The regulation of these processes is only partly under our voluntary control, which becomes particularly clear in times of emotional stress, where many individuals experience a queasy feeling. The GI tract does not only comprise organs like the stomach or the small intestine, also the oral cavity with the parotid and salivary glands belongs to the human GI tract. About 9 l of fluid in 1 day is secreted and reabsorbed in the human GI tract; its length is on average 9 m, which equates to the smaller side of a volleyball field. The surface of the GI tract estimates a football field; it harbors up to one thousand different bacteria species. It is estimated that up to 1018 bacteria are inside the human GI tract. The number of the bacteria and the surface of the human GI tract make the presence of immune-competent cells throughout the GI tract necessary; these immune-competent cells are distributed all over the GI tract in aggregations like the tonsils, adenoids, or the Peyer's patches. Abstract for Section 9.2: Like humans, also all other animals are dependent on the intake of organic material and therefore called heterotrophs. The organic material is originally produced with the help of photosynthesis by autotrophs (e.g., plants and algae) that are solely dependent on inorganic material like carbon dioxide and water. In all heterotrophic species the digestive system is highly adapted according to the food. Three general groups can be distinguished: carnivores that feed on meat of prey, herbivores that feed on plants only, and omnivores consuming both meat and plants. The main functions of the digestive system are ingestion of food, digestion (physical and chemical disassembly), transportation and temporal storage, absorption of nutrients, and subsequent elimination of undigested wastes. These functions are fulfilled by different parts of the digestive tract that are adapted to the dietary habits of the respective species: mouthparts, esophagus, stomach, and intestine. These organs are supported by salivary glands, pancreas, and liver. As in the human, also for animals there are essential nutritional components that are to be provided with the food. Vitamin C, for example, is essential for guinea pigs, but not for most other mammals. An additional essential amino acid for cats is taurin. Cats can get a retinal degeneration if fed on dog food due to lack of taurin. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930721164

In this paper, the optimal charging/discharging scheduling between one aggregator and its coordinated EVs for the provision of the regulation service is studied. We propose a scheduling method that assures adequate charging of EVs and the quality of the regulation service at the same time. First, the scheduling problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem relying on accurate forecasts of the regulation demand. By exploiting the zero-energy nature of the regulation service, the forecast-based scheduling in turn degenerates to an online scheduling problem to cope with the high uncertainty in the forecasts. Decentralized algorithms based on the gradient projection method are designed to solve the optimization problems, enabling each EV to solve its local problem and to obtain its own schedule. Our simulation study of 1000 EVs shows that the proposed online scheduling can perform nearly as well as the forecast-based scheduling, and it is able to smooth out the real-time power fluctuations of the grid, demonstrating the potential of V2G in providing the regulation service. © 2014 IEEE.","charging/discharging scheduling; decentralized algorithm; electric vehicles; regulation service; vehicle-togrid","Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Convex optimization; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Forecasting; Optimization; Problem solving; Scheduling; Vehicles; Charging/discharging; Convex optimization problems; Decentralized algorithms; Gradient projection methods; Massive energy storages; Optimization problems; Regulation services; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Scheduling algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930016812

In this respect, a novel encapsulating polymer, ethyl cellulose (EC) was used to entrap n-hexadecane (HD) PCM by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Emulsifiers strongly influenced the size and morphology of the forming EC–HD composite microcapsules, and they also had a great impact on their thermal properties. All of the three emulsifiers were suitable to prepare quasi core–shell microparticles, though the high porosity of shells resulted in serious leakage in composites prepared by Tween 80, and permeability of particles manufactured by poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), as can be stated from scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. Interfacial tension measurements and spreading coefficient analysis enabled the prediction of preparation conditions for usable core–shell microcapsules. Volume-weighted mean diameters of the microparticles were 319, 92 and 85 μm formed by Tween 80, PVA and poly(methacrylic acid sodium salt) (PMAA), respectively. A significantly higher HD content and latent heat storage capacity could be achieved using PVA and PMAA than with Tween 80. The thermal cycling test indicated good thermal reliability of microcapsules prepared by PMAA, while the energy-storing capacity of composites prepared by PVA decreased substantially, and a dramatic reduction was found in microparticles using Tween 80. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ethyl cellulose; Latent heat; Microencapsulation; Phase change material; Thermal reversibility","Cellulose; Differential scanning calorimetry; Emulsification; Heat storage; Latent heat; Microencapsulation; Microstructure; Paraffins; Particle size analysis; Polyvinyl alcohols; Scanning electron microscopy; Emulsion-solvent evaporation method; Ethyl cellulose; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Preparation conditions; Spreading coefficients; Thermal cycling test; Thermal reversibility; Volume-weighted means; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925486110

This is the essential basis for the ongoing development of the optimization algorithm. Along with this and the described simulation environment, which allows full control of simulated consumers, further development and research on optimization algorithms for load shifting in time as well as geographical terms can be done.Worldwide efforts facing global climate change issues and the rise of renewable energy sources are leading to significant changes in the energy sector. G[e]oGreen is a SmartGrids ERA-NET project that aims at bringing another approach to energy balance and overall power system stability. The unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources leads to power peaks in the distribution network which are correlated in time and space and therefore within regions load conditions on the grid will vary. One approach to cope with these fluctuations is the massive deployment of energy storage systems but also the temporal and spatial shifting of energy consumption is possible but not widely used at the moment. Introducing a cell concept of mobile consumers, it considers consumption mobility both in terms of time and space. In particular, electric vehicles and Data Centers’ (DC) processing tasks, as typical cases of mobile consumers and their impact on the power grid, improved energy usage efficiency, grid stability and peak shaving are considered.First simulations of the 18 G[e]oGreen cells and the described use-case were performed.

Little is known about the source of acetyl-CoA in the chloroplasts of photosynthetic microalgae, which are capable of producing high amounts of the storage lipid triacylglycerol (TAG) under conditions of nutrient stresses. We generated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-1618 mutants with decreased expression of the PDC2E1α gene, encoding the putative chloroplast pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit E1α, using artificial microRNA. A comparative study on the effects of PDC2E1α silencing on FAs and TAG production in C. reinhardtii, grown photoautotrophically and mixotrophically, with and without a nitrogen source in the nutrient medium, was carried out. Reduced expression of PDC2 E1α led to a severely hampered photoautotrophic growth phenotype with drastic impairment in TAG accumulation under nitrogen deprivation. In the presence of acetate, downregulation of PDC2E1α exerted little to no effect on TAG production and photosynthetic activity. In contrast, under photoautotrophic conditions, especially in the absence of a nitrogen source, a dramatic decline in photosynthetic oxygen evolution and photosystem II quantum yield against a background of the apparent over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron chain was recorded. Our results suggest an essential role of cpPDC in the supply of carbon precursors for de novo FA synthesis in microalgae under conditions of photoautotrophy. A shortage of this supply is detrimental to the nitrogen-starvation-induced synthesis of storage TAG, an important carbon and energy sink in stressed Chlamydomonas cells, thereby impairing the acclimation ability of the microalga. © 2014 © The Author 2014.

RAG operates besides the typical oils and gas production facilities a number of underground storages for natural gas, including the Haidach storage with a capacity of 2.6 billion m3 working gas near Salzburg. The gas flows of Haidach vary greatly over timescales of hours, weeks and months in both directions during injection and production of the gas. During cold winter periods the gas peak demand can exceed 1 million m3/h. Correspondingly very high volumes of gas need to be compressed and delivered to the market. The reliable delivery of the gas demand creates a technical challenge for the operating flexibility of the compressors. The Haidach compression site consists of four reciprocating compressors fitted with reverse flow step-less capacity control. With the existing compressor valves this allows an operating range of 20-100% of nominal flow rate, and gives corresponding energy savings. New high-performance compressor valves have extended the lower flow rate limit down to 10%, thus increasing the flexibility of the capacity control system. This article describes the successful application of an innovative fully electric capacity control system. Compared to the traditional hydraulic system it offers identical operational performance, but with much simpler installation and easier maintenance, and thus better economics for small compressors.

In the work presented in this paper, the calcium looping cycle was applied to a super-critical power plant to capture CO2 (purity &gt;95%). This capture technology is based on calcium looping process which uses CaO for CO2 capture. Calcium looping process has very good techno-economic results compared to other CO2 capture options (e.g. gas-liquid absorption) and has many advantages, one of those being: the raw material used for CO2 capture (limestone) is abundant and cheap, the high carbon capture rate (&gt;90%) and the relatively small efficiency penalty that it imposes on the power/ industrial process. The energy penalty for carbon capture is about 9 net electricity percentage points. Compared to the design without carbon capture, the specific capital investment is increasing with about 48%, the operational &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) costs are increasing with 60% and the levelised cost of electricity is increasing with 54%. © 2014, Universitatea Babes-Bolyai, Catedra de Filosofie Sistematica.

All of the compression concepts required a final delivery pressure of 153 bar at the inlet to the pipeline. Then, simulations were used to determine the maximum safe pipeline distance to subsequent booster stations as a function of inlet pressure, environmental temperature, thickness of the thermal insulation and ground level heat flux conditions. The results show that subcooled liquid transport increases energy efficiency and minimises the cost of CO2 transport over long distances under heat transfer conditions. The study also found that the thermal insulation layer should not be laid on the external surface of the pipe in atmospheric conditions in Poland. The most important problems from the environmental protection point of view are rigorous and robust hazard identification which indirectly affects CO2 transportation.

LUCI is similar to LVP except that it is done under normal irrigation with saline at 4 °C instead of saline at room temperature. The primary outcome measures were the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS-Dysuria, a pain scale (PS), maximum flow rate (Qmax), a quality-of-life (QoL) score and the postvoid residual urine volume (PVR) after 1 month, then the IPSS, Qmax, QoL, and PVR at 3 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative surgical variables, e.g., the decline in core temperature, bleeding, peri- and postoperative morbidity.Results The baseline characteristics of both groups were similar. For the primary outcome measures, there was a statistically significant difference between the groups in all variables except Qmax after 1 month, in favour of LUCI. The mean (SD) IPSS at 1 month in the LVP group was 8.97 (1.68), statistically significantly different from that after LUCI, of 6.89 (1.5) (P &lt; 0.05). The mean IPSS-Dysuria at 1 month was also significantly, at -2.32 (0.91) for LVP and 3.54 (1.07) for LUCI (P &lt; 0.05). The respective mean PS at 1 month was 7.84 (2.92) and 5.7 (2.1) (P &lt; 0.05). The QoL and PVR at 1 month were also significantly different. Within the first month 17% of patients in the LVP group and 4% in the LUCI group complained of transient urgency or stress incontinence, and this difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant bleeding in either group. The mean operative time or applied energy of LVP was not statistically significant from that of LUCI, and there was no significant difference in the decline in core temperature between the groups (P &gt; 0.05).Conclusion LUCI is a good modification for reducing the pain, dysuria and storage symptoms associated with LVP.

Also, unconventional resources are natural resources, which require greater than industry-standard levels of technology or investment to exploit. In the case of unconventional hydrocarbon resources, additional technology, energy, and capital have to be applied to extract the gas or oil. Bioremediation of petroleum spill is considered of great importance due to the contaminating effects on human health and the environment. For this reason, it is important to reduce total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in contaminated soil. In addition, biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms. Seven strains belonging to Lysinibacillus sphaericus and Geobacillus sp were selected to evaluate their ability to biodegrade TPH in the presence of toxic metals, their potential to produce biosurfactants, and their ability to improve the biodegradation rate. The seven bacterial strains examined in this study were able to utilize crude petroleum-oil hydrocarbons as the sole source of carbon and energy. In addition, their ability to degrade crude oil was not affected by the presence of toxic metals such as chromium and arsenic. At the same time, the strains were able to reduce toxic metals concentration through biosorption processes. Biosurfactant production was determined using the drop-collapsed method for all strains, and they were characterized as both anionic and cationic biosurfactants. Biosurfactants showed an increase in biodegradation efficiency both in liquid minimal salt medium and landfarming treatments. The final results in field tests showed an efficiency of 93 percent reduction in crude oil concentration by the selected consortium compared to soil without consortium. The authors propose L. sphaericus and Geobacillus sp consortium as an optimum treatment for contaminated soils. In addition, production of biosurfactants could have an application in the extraction of crude oil from unconventional hydrocarbon resources. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Bacteria (microorganisms); Geobacillus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916884687

In addition, the process gives substantial amounts of solid by-products making the integration of mineral carbonation with other industries an opportunity to both reduce CO2 emissions and substitute raw material inputs. Aspen Plus® v7.2 software is used to optimize the ÅA process towards minimal energy use and to study the impact of the flue gases' CO2 concentration (conventional coal firing (CCF) vs. oxyfuel combustion (OXY) flue gases) in the carbonation step instead of pre-separated and compressed CO2 (providing an additional benefit compared to ""conventional"" CO2 capture and storage (CCS) options). Also the influence of using either ammonium sulphate (AS) or bisulphate (ABS) as the fluxing salts on the process's exergetics is evaluated. It was concluded that ABS lowers the energy requirements in the Mg extraction by 40% but its regeneration (fundamental feature for the route's success) by: (i) thermal decomposition of AS appears to be unviable, (ii) addition of H2SO4 saturates the process with sulphur.

Smart homes define optimal consumption as either balancing/leveling consumption using energy storage devices such that the utility company is presented with a uniform demand or as minimizing consumption costs by storing energy during off-peak time periods when prices are lower and use the stored energy during peak time periods when prices are higher. In cost minimization scheme, household is the sole beneficiary and its consumption profile is highly nonuniform and there is no incentive for the utility company to support this scheme. On the other hand, in consumption leveling/balancing scheme there is an incentive for both the household and utility company to support this scheme due to reduction in consumption costs for the former and uniform demand for the latter. Due to varying nature of energy requirements of households and market energy prices over different time periods in a day, households face a tradeoff between consuming to meet their current energy requirements and/or storing energy for future consumption and/or spending energy stored in the past. These tradeoffs are modeled using inter-temporal trade and consumption preferences of households are modeled as utility functions using consumer theory. We introduce two different utility functions, one for cost minimization and another for consumption balancing/leveling, that are maximized subject to certain budget, consumption, storage and savings constraints to solve for the optimum consumption profile. The optimization problem of a household with energy storage is formulated as a geometric program for consumption balancing/leveling, while cost minimization is formulated as a linear programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves extremely low peak to average ratio close to 1 with about 8% reduction in consumption costs in consumption balancing/leveling scheme and the least possible amount for the electricity bill with about 12% reduction in consumption costs in cost minimization scheme. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","energy storage; geometric programming; inter-temporal trade; optimal consumption; Smart grids","Automation; Budget control; Computer simulation; Cost reduction; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Linear programming; Energy requirements; Energy storage systems; Geometric programming; Linear programming problem; Optimal consumption; Optimization problems; Peak to average ratios; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913601351

The photovoltaic power generation can operate both in stand-alone and grid-connected operations. This paper presents an application of the single-phase five-level common-emitter current-source inverter (CE-CSI) for grid connected photovoltaic system without batteries as energy storage system. In the proposed system, the five-level CE-CSI works generating a sinusoidal output current from photovoltaic system to be injected directly into the power grid. The transformer is used in the system to step-down the grid voltage to meet the voltage level of the photovoltaic system, and also works as a galvanic insulation between the power grid and the inverter system. Two conditions of the power grid voltage, i.e. a pure sinusoidal and a distorted power grid, are tested through computer simulation using PSIM software. Furthermore, experimental test result of the five-level inverter is also presented. The test results show that the five-level CE-CSI works well injecting a sinusoidal current into the power grid with low harmonic contents, and with unity power factor operation. The results also show that the distorted grid voltage affects the harmonic contents of the current injected by the inverter. © 2014 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

It is the work energy including the work energy of the embodied information. Eco-exergy is calculated for living organisms as β×. B×. f kJ, where β is covering the information contained in the genome, B is the biomass (for instance in g) and f is the work energy per unit of biomass, which on average is 18.7. kJ/g. The β-value is a weighting factor that expresses the ratio between the work energy of an organism including the work energy of the embodied information and the work energy of the biomass. The work energy of information transfer is, however, different for the donor and the receptor. This is in part because the receptor uses the work energy to grow, which means it gains the work energy including the information on the level of the receptor while the donor is losing the work energy including the information of the donor. This difference between the donor and recipient has to be considered when we illustrate the ecological networks, their respective transfer processes, and their total system throughflows (TST). It is also critical when we determine the eco-exergy (EE), which is equal to the work energy including the information stored in the network. Two examples are used to illustrate the differences between ecological networks, based on either donor determined work energy including information or on work energy, where the donor and receptor determined work energy of information are different due to differences in the β-values. The results of the latter are presumed to give the correct calculations of the transfer processes in ecological networks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Eco-exergy; Ecological networks; Storage of work energy including information; Total through flow; Work energy","Biology; Biomass; Exergy; A-weighting; Eco exergies; Ecological networks; Information transfers; Living organisms; Total through flow; Transfer process; Work energy; Ecology; biomass; biomass power; exergy; genome; mathematical analysis; throughflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910646689

The system is assumed to be located on Naxos Island, Greece, due to the island's high wind and solar potential and was designed to cover both the load of a typical house and a country house, where the excess electricity could be sold to the grid. An innovative storage device type, consisting of flywheels and electrochemical batteries, was selected as the energy buffer. The energy produced by hydrogen used in the proton electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell (FC) charges the flywheel. This apparatus is compared to diesel generators commonly used in stationary applications. Optimization of the system, in terms of energy efficiency and economic feasibility, is also considered. The two systems were simulated using sensitivity, optimization, and simulation modeling software, and custom calculations of both energy and finance were carried out. It was found that a one-way grid connected project using state-of-the-art and totally green technologies, including hydrogen-fed PEM-FC and flywheels, can totally cover the electrical demands of a typical house and country house, obtaining cost per consumed energy as low as 1.374 and 0.097 /KWh, respectively.

In this paper, integrated torrefaction is defined as torrefaction integrated with entrained flow gasification. External torrefaction is defined as the decentralized production of torrefied wood pellets and centralized conversion of the pellets by entrained flow gasification. First, the syngas production of the two methods was compared. Second, the two methods were compared by considering complete biorefineries with either integrated torrefaction or external torrefaction. The first part of the analysis showed that the biomass to syngas efficiency can be increased from 63% to 86% (LHV-dry) when switching from external torrefaction to integrated torrefaction. The second part of the analysis showed that the total energy efficiency (biomass to methanol+net electricity) could be increased from 53% to 63% when switching from external torrefaction to integrated torrefaction. The costs of this increase in energy efficiency are as follows: 1) more difficult transport, storage and handling of the biomass feedstock (wood chips vs. torrefied wood pellets); 2) reduced plant size; 3) no net electricity production; and 4) a more complex plant design. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel; Biorefinery; Gasification; Syngas; Thermodynamic analysis; Torrefaction","Biofuels; Biomass; Gasification; Pelletizing; Refining; Synthesis gas; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Wood products; Biorefineries; Decentralized production; Electricity production; Entrained flow gasification; Storage and handling; Syn-gas; Thermo dynamic analysis; Torrefaction; Energy efficiency; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy efficiency; flow field; thermochemistry; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910003344

According to the dynamic population size, the proposed algorithm uses novel random and minimum to maximum sort strategy in order to create new populations with decreased or increased sizes. This implementation enables global search with fast convergence. It also uses a multi-core processor, where all the necessary optimization data are sent to the individual core of a central processing unit. The main aim of the optimization process is to satisfy 24h demand by minimizing the water quantity used per electrical energy produced. This optimization process also satisfies the desired reservoir levels at the end of the day.

Recent penetration of renewable energy sources has initiated the use of current-type sources as well as input voltage regulated converters as input sources for power electronic interfaces. While the power electronic converter topology remains unchanged in both the cases, steady state and dynamic properties of the coupled source-converter system are quite different. Moreover, the voltage/current nature of the load contributes to the complex dynamics as well. This paper investigates the factors determining the dynamic properties of a power electronic converter in a specific arrangement. The findings show that the open-loop converter (without any internal or external feedbacks) automatically adapts its dynamic properties to the properties stipulated by source and load if certain terminal constraints are satisfied. If internal or external feedback is activated, the dynamic properties of the converter may be varied as desired; however, the control design process is substantially different for each source/load arrangement. The findings presented in this paper have not been presented in the literature by far. A buck-power-stage converter is used as an illustrative example.

The system was designed from the start with water cooling in mind. The result: a system with greater than 95% of its heat load conducted directly to water and a system that, together with a rear door heat exchanger (HX), removes 100% of its heat load to water with no requirement for room air conditioning. In addition to direct water cooling the processor, the memory, power conversion, and input-output electronics also conduct their heat directly to water. Also included within the framework of the system is a disk storage unit (i.e., disk enclosure) containing an interboard air-to-water HX. The heart of the water cooling system is the water conditioning unit (WCU). The WCU circulates system water at a controlled temperature and flow rate while also transferring the electronics heat load to the data center facility building chilled water (BCW) system. The brain for this system is the motor drive and control assembly (MDA-WCU). In addition to the pump motor drive function, the MDA-WCU contains the control circuitry and associated firmware that maintains system water at a prescribed temperature above the room dew point irrespective of system and or facilities thermal/flow transients. It is also capable of error detection and fault isolation that, together with higher level system firmware, facilitates serviceability, and availability. The paper will present the WCU and MDA-WCU design with an emphasis on the control methodologies and algorithms.",,"Cooling; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric motors; Energy efficiency; Fault detection; Firmware; Supercomputers; Thermal load; Computing performance; Control circuitry; Control methodology; Controlled temperature; Design and control; Direct water cooling; Power conversion; Water conditioning; Electronic cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907819725

Government regulations and rapidly lowering prices help to further this trend. Today's strong drive is to replace light bulbs of common outputs (60‰W, 75‰W, and 100‰W) without resorting to compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs containing mercury while maintaining the standard industry bulb size and shape referred to as A19. For many bulb designs, this A19 size and shape restriction forces a small heat sink which is barely capable of dissipating heat for 60‰W equivalent LED bulbs with natural convection for today's LED efficacies. 75‰W and 100‰W equivalent bulbs require larger sizes, some method of forced cooling, or some unusual liquid cooling system; generally none of these approaches are desirable for light bulbs from a consumer point of view. Thus, there is interest in developing natural convection cooled A19 light bulb designs for LEDs that cool far more effectively than today's current designs. Current A19 size heat sink designs typically have thermal resistances of 5-7‰°C/W. This paper presents designs utilizing the effects of chimney cooling, well developed for other fields that reduce heat sink resistances by significant amounts while meeting all other requirements for bulb system design. Numerical studies and test data show performance of 3-4‰°C/W for various orientations including methods for keeping the chimney partially active in horizontal orientations. Significant parameters are also studied with effects upon performance. The simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data. Such chimney-based designs are shown to enable 75‰W and 100‰W equivalent LED light bulb designs critical for faster penetration of LED systems into general lighting applications.",,"Chimneys; Cooling; Cooling systems; Design; Digital storage; Heat resistance; Heat sinks; Incandescent lamps; Laws and legislation; Lighting; Natural convection; Numerical methods; Forced cooling; General lightings; Government regulation; Heat sink design; Heat sink resistance; Lighting systems; Liquid cooling systems; Natural convection cooling; Light emitting diodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907692403

Over the last 40 years vanadium oxides have continued to be the subject of much research due to their desirable physical properties. Initial results with bulk V2O5 and V 2O5 gels demonstrated the potential for application as a cathode material for lithium batteries. Encouraging specific capacities exceeding 250 mAh g-1 were accompanied by severe capacity fading, which prevented widespread commercial application of V2O 5-containing cathodes. Following the commercial release of the Li-ion battery, the development of layered materials that reversibly intercalated lithium, and the resurgence in nanoscale materials for Li-ion and alternative batteries, have opened new opportunities for the examination of the influence of material structure on cell performance. Recent decades have witnessed advances in the control of shape, structure and function of Li-ion battery materials. This review details the synthesis and structural properties of vanadium oxides, one of the model layered battery materials, and reviews the synthesis and structure of vanadium oxides and related polymorphs, bronzes and phases.

A correct battery thermal management system (BTMS) design is critical to achieve these goals. In this paper, a general framework for obtaining optimal BTMS designs is proposed. Due to the trade-off between the BTMS's design goals and the complex modeling of thermal response inside the battery pack, this paper proposes to solve this problem using a novel Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) approach.

They were responsible for more than 15,900 deaths and 2,600 missing persons as well as physical infrastructure damages exceeding $200 billion. The earthquake and tsunami also initiated a severe nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. Three of the six reactors at the plant sustained severe core damage and released hydrogen and radioactive materials. Explosion of the released hydrogen damaged three reactor buildings and impeded onsite emergency response efforts. The accident prompted widespread evacuations of local populations, large economic losses, and the eventual shutdown of all nuclear power plants in Japan. Lessons Learned from the Fukushima Nuclear Accident for Improving Safety and Security of U.S. Nuclear Plants is a study of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. This report examines the causes of the crisis, the performance of safety systems at the plant, and the responses of its operators following the earthquake and tsunami. The report then considers the lessons that can be learned and their implications for U.S. safety and storage of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste, commercial nuclear reactor safety and security regulations, and design improvements. Lessons Learned makes recommendations to improve plant systems, resources, and operator training to enable effective ad hoc responses to severe accidents. This report's recommendations to incorporate modern risk concepts into safety regulations and improve the nuclear safety culture will help the industry prepare for events that could challenge the design of plant structures and lead to a loss of critical safety functions. In providing a broad-scope, high-level examination of the accident, Lessons Learned is meant to complement earlier evaluations by industry and regulators.

NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. The term NAFLD describes a spectrum of liver pathology ranges from simple steatosis to steatosis with inflammation nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and even cirrhosis. Metabolic syndrome and NAFLD also predict hepatocellular carcinoma. Many genetic and environmental factors have been suggested to contribute to the development of obesity and NAFLD, but the exact mechanisms are not known. Intestinal ecosystem contains trillions of microorganisms including bacteria, Archaea, yeasts and viruses. Several studies support the relationship between the intestinal microbial changes and obesity and also its complications, including insulin resistance and NAFLD. Given that the gut and liver are connected by the portal venous system, it makes the liver more vulnerable to translocation of bacteria, bacterial products, endotoxins or secreted cytokines. Altered intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) may stimulate hepatic fat deposition through several mechanisms: regulation of gut permeability, increasing low-grade inflammation, modulation of dietary choline metabolism, regulation of bile acid metabolism and producing endogenous ethanol. Regulation of intestinal microbial ecosystem by diet modifications or by using probiotics and prebiotics as a treatment for obesity and its complications might be the issue of further investigations. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2, is known as a suitable material for TES at temperature T &gt; 300 °C. In this work, the thermal decomposition of Mg(OH)2 in the absence and presence of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) is investigated to adapt this material for TES at T &lt; 300 °C. The most notable observations described for the doped Mg(OH)2 are (1) a significant reduction of the decomposition temperature Td that allows tuning the dehydration reactivity by varying the NaNO3 content. The decrease by 25 ° C is revealed at a salt content content. The Td decrease by 25 °C is revealed at a salt content Y ≤ 2.0 wt %. The maximum Td depression of some 50 °C is observed at Y = 15-20 wt %; (2) the NaNO3-doped Mg(OH)2 decomposes considerably faster under conditions typical for closed TES cycles (at T &gt; 300 °C in vapor atmosphere) than a pure Mg(OH)2; (3) the morphology of the dehydration product (MgO) dramatically changes. Differential scanning calorimetry, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) are used to study the observed effects and to elucidate possible ways the NaNO3 influences the Mg(OH)2 dehydration and morphology of the dehydration product.

Although patterning of these clusters down to the micro- or nanoscale could lead to applications such as high-density data storage, it has been reported only for inorganic matrices. Here we present submicron-scale mask-free patterning of fluorescent silver nanoclusters in an organic matrix. The nanoclusters were produced by direct laser writing in poly(methacrylic acid) thin films and exhibit a broadband emission at visible wavelengths with photostability that is superior to that of Rhodamine 6G dye. This fabrication method could open new opportunities for applications in nanophotonics like imaging, labeling, and metal ion sensing. We foresee that this method can be further applied to prepare other metal nanoclusters embedded in compositionally different polymer matrices.

Large composite tanks possessing cylindrical shape are produced using the winding process. Therefore, the inal products have uneven thickness and ibre orientation lamina layers, and also an unevenly impregnated honeycomb layer. The aim of this research is to develop an economically attractive embedded ultrasonic measurement technique for on-field diagnostics of complex composite structures used for production of large liquid storage tanks. Development of the relatively cheap and easy to operate embedded diagnostic/monitoring technique is important aiming to assure safety of liquid storage tanks (monitoring structural integrity against overpressure, etc.) and detection of accidental defects that may appear during transportation, installation and exploitation of those structures. Typical defects that are aimed to be detected are relatively large delaminations/disbonds (area having diameter of 150-200 mm) of skin layers caused by low energy impacts that cannot be detected visually and show severe influence on the structural strength and safety of liquid tanks. This work presents results of numerical modeling and experimental research in low frequency (50 kHz) ultrasonic guided waves (UGW) propagation in large honeycomb composite structures. Finite element (FE) simulation of UGW propagation has been made aiming to reduce quantity of ultrasonic transducers and optimize their placement on composite structure. The possibilities to place ultrasonic transducers and receivers on both sides (internal or external) of compositestructures and to use such a proposed technique for detection of delamination/debonding areas caused by low energy impacts or alternating semi static loads (e.g. filling and draining of liquid from storage tank) and monitoring of partial self-healing of relatively rigid composite structures were proved by experimental testing. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Condition monitoring; Delamination and debonding; Embedded transducers; Honeycomb core; Multi-layered composite; Ultrasonic guided waves","Condition monitoring; Defects; Guided electromagnetic wave propagation; Honeycomb structures; Liquids; Rigid structures; Structure (composition); Tanks (containers); Transducers; Ultrasonic transducers; Ultrasonic waves; Complex composite structures; Embedded transducers; Finite element simulations; Honeycomb core; Large liquid storage tanks; Multi-layered composites; Structure of composites; Ultrasonic guided wave; Ultrasonic applications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912150175

This technique is proposed to detect the rotor fault in the doubly fed induction generator under non-stationary conditions based on the spectral analysis of stator currents of the doubly fed induction generator by an adaptive fast Fourier transform algorithm. Furthermore, to prevent system deterioration, a fractional-order controller with a simple design method is used for the control of the whole wind turbine system. The fractional-order controller ensures that the system is stable in both healthy and faulty conditions. Additionally, to improve the production capacity under wind speed fluctuations and grid demand changes, a two-level energy storage system consisting of a supercapacitor bank and lead-acid batteries is proposed.

Specific capacitance measurements revealed cycle dependent behavior, which was examined by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The capacitive charge-storage properties of intertwined MoO3-MWCNTs were found to be superior to those of either MoO3 nanowires or randomly entangled mesoporous MWCNTs. This study showed that double-layer, faradaic and intercalation mechanisms are in operation in the charge storage process. This rather complicated mechanism causes irreversible structural modifications to the oxide lattice, which were verified systematically by various characterization techniques. The intertwined nanocomposites showed increased charge-storage capacity without compromising the charge/discharge kinetics in MWCNTs or MoO3 nanowires.

These include protective materials, sensors, cosmetics, hygiene, filtration and energy storage. The most widely used and researched technology in these fields is electrospinning. This method for producing fibers yields highly promising results thanks to its versatility and simplicity. Electrospinning is employed in multiple forms, among which needle and needleless direct current (DC) variants are the most distinctive. The former is based on the generation of just one single jet from a nozzle; hence this fabrication process is not very productive. The latter uses the destabilization of free liquid surfaces by means of an electric field, which enhances the throughput since it produces numerous jets, emitted from the surfaces of rollers, spheres, strings and spirals. However, although some progress in total producibility has been achieved, the efficiency of the DC method still remains relatively low. A further drawback of DC electrospinning is that both variants need a collector, which makes it difficult to combine DC electrospinning easily with other technologies due to the presence of the high field strength within the entire spinning zone. This paper describes our experiments with AC electrospinning. We show that alternating current (AC) electrospinning based on a needleless spinning-electrode provides a highly productive smoke-like aerogel composed of nanofibers. This aerogel rises rapidly from the electrode like a thin plume of smoke, without any need for a collector. Our work shows that AC needleless electrospinning gains its efficiency and collector-less feature thanks to the creation of a perpetually charge-changing virtual counter-electrode composed of the nanofibers emitted. High-speed camera recordings demonstrate the formation mechanism of the nanofibrous plume, which is wafted by an electric wind. This wind’s velocity field is experimentally investigated. One potential use of AC needleless electrospinning is demonstrated here by spinning it into a yarn. © the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911874523

The technical-economic model and the program for calculating CEPPs with energy storage devices (ESDs) is developed, which allows one to determine CEPPs of minimum cost for given modes of generation and consumption (load) of energy. Optimal CEPPs will almost always be single or paired combinations; moreover, in some cases, the proportion of SPVPs reaches 100%. It was shown that CEPPs can provide the minimum cost of power in a wider range of modes of alternative energy sources (AESs) than individual SPVPs, WEPPs, or MHHPs.

The efficiency of such systems depends on the thermal properties of the subsurface. Therefore, feasibility and impact studies performed prior to their installation should include a field characterization of thermal properties and a heat transfer model using parameter values measured in situ. However, there is a lack of in situ experiments and methodology for performing such a field characterization, especially for open systems. This study presents an in situ experiment designed for estimating heat transfer parameters in shallow alluvial aquifers with focus on the specific heat capacity. This experiment consists in simultaneously injecting hot water and a chemical tracer into the aquifer and monitoring the evolution of groundwater temperature and concentration in the recovery well (and possibly in other piezometers located down gradient). Temperature and concentrations are then used for estimating the specific heat capacity. The first method for estimating this parameter is based on a modeling in series of the chemical tracer and temperature breakthrough curves at the recovery well. The second method is based on an energy balance. The values of specific heat capacity estimated for both methods (2.30 and 2.54 MJ/m3/K) for the experimental site in the alluvial aquifer of the Meuse River (Belgium) are almost identical and consistent with values found in the literature. Temperature breakthrough curves in other piezometers are not required for estimating the specific heat capacity. However, they highlight that heat transfer in the alluvial aquifer of the Meuse River is complex and contrasted with different dominant process depending on the depth leading to significant vertical heat exchange between upper and lower part of the aquifer. Furthermore, these temperature breakthrough curves could be included in the calibration of a complex heat transfer model for estimating the entire set of heat transfer parameters and their spatial distribution by inverse modeling. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Heat tracer test; Heat transfer; Shallow geothermal energy; Solute transport; Very low temperature geothermy","Aquifers; Cooling systems; Experiments; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Inverse problems; Parameter estimation; Solute transport; Specific heat; Temperature; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Field characterization; Geothermal energy systems; Geothermy; Groundwater temperatures; Shallow geothermal energies; Tracer tests; Transfer parameters; Geothermal energy; ground water; hot water; sodium naphtionate; tracer; unclassified drug; aquifer; concentration (composition); coupling; energy balance; geothermal energy; heat transfer; solute transport; spatial distribution; tracer; underground storage; aquifer; Article; Belgium; concentration (parameters); controlled study; energy balance; experimental design; heat; heat exchange; heat transfer; hydraulic conductivity; river; specific heat capacity; temperature measurement; thermal conductivity; water temperature; chemistry; environmental monitoring; geothermal energy; theoretical model; Belgium; Meuse River; Belgium; Environmental Monitoring; Geothermal Energy; Groundwater; Hot Temperature; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908456538

The gut microbiome encodes metabolic capability in excess of that encoded by the human genome, and bacterially produced enzymes are important for releasing nutrients from complex dietary ingredients. Previous culture-based studies had indicated that the gut microbiota of older people was different from that of younger adults, but the detailed findings were contradictory. Small-scale studies had also shown that the microbiota composition could be altered by dietary intervention or supplementation. We showed that the core microbiota and aggregate composition in 161 seniors was distinct from that of younger persons. To further investigate the reasons for this variation, we analysed the microbiota composition of 178 elderly subjects for whom the dietary intake data were available. The data revealed distinct microbiota composition groups, which overlapped with distinct dietary patterns that were governed by where people lived: at home, in rehabilitation or in long-term residential care. These diet-microbiota separations correlated with cluster analysis of NMR-derived faecal metabolites and shotgun metagenomic data. Major separations in the microbiota correlated with selected clinical measurements. It should thus be possible to programme the microbiota to enrich bacterial species and activities that promote healthier ageing. A number of other studies have investigated the effect of certain dietary components and their ability to modulate the microbiota composition to promote health.

To evaluate whether different dietary protein sources modulate energy balance when ingested at average levels obesity-prone male C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed high-fat diets (67 energy percent fat, 18 energy percent sucrose and 15 energy percent protein) with either casein, chicken filet or a mixture of cod and scallop (1:1 on amino acid content) as protein sources. At equal energy intake, casein and cod/scallop fed mice had lower feed efficiency than chicken fed mice, which translated into reduced adipose tissue masses after seven weeks of feeding. Chicken fed mice had elevated hepatic triglyceride relative to casein and cod/scallop fed mice and elevated 4 h fasted plasma cholesterol concentrations compared to low-fat and casein fed mice. In casein fed mice the reduced adiposity was likely related to the observed three percent lower apparent fat digestibility compared to low-fat, chicken and cod/scallop fed mice. After six weeks of feeding an oral glucose tolerance test revealed that despite their lean phenotype, casein fed mice had reduced glucose tolerance compared to low-fat, chicken and cod/scallop fed mice. In a separate set of mice, effects on metabolism were evaluated by indirect calorimetry before onset of diet-induced obesity. Spontaneous locomotor activity decreased in casein and chicken fed mice when shifting from low-fat to high-fat diets, but cod/scallop feeding tended (P = 0.06) to attenuate this decrease. Moreover, at this shift, energy expenditure decreased in all groups, but was decreased to a greater extent in casein fed than in cod/scallop fed mice, indicating that protein sources regulated energy expenditure differently. In conclusion, protein from different sources modulates energy balance in C57BL/6J mice when given at normal levels. Ingestion of a cod/scallop-mixture prevented diet-induced obesity compared to intake of chicken filet and preserved glucose tolerance compared to casein intake. © 2014 Tastesen et al.",,"casein; fat; protein; sucrose; triacylglycerol; cholesterol; protein intake; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; Article; body mass; caloric intake; calorimetry; chicken; cholesterol blood level; cod; diet therapy; energy balance; energy expenditure; fish; gene expression; gluconeogenesis; glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipogenesis; locomotion; lung gas exchange; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; phenotype; protein diet; scallop; therapy effect; adverse effects; animal; C57BL mouse; energy metabolism; Gadiformes; glucose tolerance test; meat; metabolism; obesity; physiology; procedures; protein intake; Mus; Adiposity; Animals; Caseins; Chickens; Cholesterol; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Gadiformes; Glucose Tolerance Test; Male; Meat; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Pectinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912034406

However, in this paper, we report that proton insertion, an unusual capacitive mechanism, may effectively enhance the capacitance of metal oxides with low surface area but specific structures. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) as the electrode material for supercapacitors has always suffered from low capacitance. Nevertheless, enhanced by the proton insertion mechanism, we demonstrate that electrodes fabricated by an assembly structure of hexagonal-phase WO3 (h-WO3) nanopillars achieve a high capacitance of up to 421.8 F g-1 under the current density of 0.5 A g-1, which is the highest capacitance achieved with pure WO3 as the electrodes so far, to the best of our knowledge. Detailed analyses indicate that proton insertion dominates the electrochemical behavior of h-WO3 and plays the key role in reaching high capacitance by excluding other mechanisms. In addition, a thorough investigation on the temperature-dependent electrochemical performance reveals excellent performance stability at different temperatures. This study provides a new approach to achieving high capacitance by effective proton insertion into ordered tunnels in crystallized metal oxides, which is primarily important for the fabrication of compact high-performance energy storage devices. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","insertion mechanism; supercapacitors; temperature-dependent performance; tungsten oxide","Capacitance; Electrodes; Oxides; Supercapacitor; Assembly structures; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical performance; Enhanced pseudocapacitance; Insertion mechanism; Performance stability; Temperature dependent; Tungsten oxide; Tungsten compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910153642

While benefiting from local biomass resources Finnish energy system is deemed to achieve this goal, increasing the share of other intermittent renewables is under development, namely wind power and solar energy. Yet the maximum flexibility of the existing energy system in integration of renewable energy is not investigated, which is an important step before undertaking new renewable energy obligations. This study aims at filling this gap by hourly analysis and comprehensive modeling of the energy system including electricity, heat, and transportation, by employing EnergyPLAN tool. Focusing on technical and economic implications, we assess the maximum potential of different RESs separately (including bioenergy, hydropower, wind power, solar heating and PV, and heat pumps), as well as an optimal mix of different technologies. Furthermore, we propose a new index for assessing the maximum flexibility of energy systems in absorbing variable renewable energy. The results demonstrate that wind energy can be harvested at maximum levels of 18-19% of annual power demand (approx. 16 TWh/a), without major enhancements in the flexibility of energy infrastructure. With today's energy demand, the maximum feasible renewable energy for Finland is around 44-50% by an optimal mix of different technologies, which promises 35% reduction in carbon emissions from 2012's level. Moreover, Finnish energy system is flexible to augment the share of renewables in gross electricity consumption up to 69-72%, at maximum. Higher shares of RES calls for lower energy consumption (energy efficiency) and more flexibility in balancing energy supply and consumption (e.g. by energy storage). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy planning; Energy system modeling; Heat pump; Renewable energy integration; Techno-economic optimization; Wind integration","Biomass; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Solar energy; Wind power; Energy planning; Energy system model; Heat pumps; Renewable energy integrations; Techno-economics; Wind integration; Integration; carbon emission; demand analysis; economic activity; electricity; energy planning; energy resource; energy use; optimization; pump; renewable resource; wind power; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921972314

Under homogeneous conditions and in the absence of a regional hydraulic gradient, groundwater flow and heat transport from or to a well exhibit radial symmetry, and governing equations are reduced by one dimension (1D) which increases computational efficiency importantly. Solute transport codes can simulate heat transport and input parameters may be modified such that the Cartesian geometry can handle radial flow. In this article, SEAWAT is evaluated as simulator for heat transport under radial flow conditions. The 1971, 1D analytical solution of Gelhar and Collins is used to compare axisymmetric transport with retardation (i.e., as a result of thermal equilibrium between fluid and solid) and a large diffusion (conduction). It is shown that an axisymmetric simulation compares well with a fully three dimensional (3D) simulation of an aquifer thermal energy storage systems. The influence of grid discretization, solver parameters, and advection solution is illustrated. Because of the high diffusion to simulate conduction, convergence criterion for heat transport must be set much smaller (10-10) than for solute transport (10-6). Grid discretization should be considered carefully, in particular the subdivision of the screen interval. On the other hand, different methods to calculate the pumping or injection rate distribution over different nodes of a multilayer well lead to small differences only. © 2014, National Ground Water Association.",,"Aquifers; Chemical analysis; Computational efficiency; Geothermal energy; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hydrogeology; Radial flow; Solute transport; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Axisymmetric simulation; Convergence criterion; Geothermal exploitation; Homogeneous conditions; Regional hydraulic gradient; Temperature dependent; Three-dimensional (3-D) simulation; Transport properties; advection; aquifer; chemical reaction; convergence; exploitation; geothermal energy; groundwater flow; heat transfer; homogeneity; one-dimensional modeling; pumping; radial flow; solute transport; temperature; three-dimensional modeling; ground water; computer simulation; heat; theoretical model; Computer Simulation; Groundwater; Hot Temperature; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931299823

In European countries, water scarcity has already affected a significant portion of the territory (&gt;10 %) and population (&gt;14 %). The most recent projections are that ~40 % of the world's population would live in regions affected by water scarcity in the next 10 years. Agriculture, especially production of irrigated crops food/feed, is a predominant water consumer given that ~70 % (~3 trillion m3) of totally abstracted fresh hydro-resources are exploited by agri-sector and that irrigated agriculture produces ~40 % (~1.6 billion tonnes) of global food supply. In agriculture, water scarcity is often equalised with drought, i.e., water stress. However, while drought (agronomic, hydrological or meteorological) implies a temporary decrease in water availability (due to precipitation deficiency and/or reduced groundwater/soil moisture), water scarcity from an agricultural perspective assumes that consumption of finite fresh hydro-resources exceed their sustainable exploitation for food production, and thus appropriate long-term water/land management strategies (e.g., implementation of modern irrigation systems) are needed. Unfortunately, recent report indicated that the amount of food wasted annually due to inadequate (post)harvesting processes and relatively high-quality consumer/market standards (~2 billion tonnes) exceeds the annual food production in irrigated agriculture. Therefore, certain solutions to water and food crisis need not to be based on relatively expensive agricultural intensification (increasing land or water productivity), but can rather be based on (1) improved food storage/transport capacities (notably in low-income countries) and (2) changed market-consumer relations (principally in high-income countries). © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This provides a decrease in the transformer ratio for obtaining the specified output voltage and in the value and rise rate of the primary-circuit current to levels, allowing one to use cheap standard thyristors as a switch.

Chemical, crystallographic and electronic structure of the TiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 binary oxide surfaces were characterized (via BET surface area measurements, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and DR-UV-Vis Spectroscopy) as a function of the TiO 2 loading in the mixture as well as the calcination temperature used in the synthesis protocol. 0.5 Ti/Al-900 photocatalyst showed remarkable photocatalytic NO x oxidation and storage performance, which was found to be much superior to that of a Degussa P25 industrial benchmark photocatalyst (i.e. 160% higher NO x storage and 55% lower NO 2 (g) release to the atmosphere). Our results indicate that the onset of the photocatalytic NO x abatement activity is concomitant to the switch between amorphous to a crystalline phase with an electronic band gap within 3.05-3.10 eV; where the most active photocatalyst revealed predominantly rutile phase together and anatase as the minority phase. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As more people learn about this versatile and often cost-effective power option, this trend will accelerate. This document presents a recommended design for a battery based stand-alone photovoltaic system (BSPV). BSPV system has the ability to be applied in different areas, including warning signals, lighting, refrigeration, communication, residential water pumping, remote sensing, and cathodic protection. The presented calculation method gives a proper idea for a system sizing technique. Based on application load, different scenarios are possible for designing a BSPV system. In this study, a battery based stand-alone system was designed. The electricity generation part is three a-Si panels, which are connected in parallel, and for the storage part LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery was used. The high power LFP battery packs are 40 cells each 8S5P (configured 8 series 5 parallel). Each individual pack weighs 0.5 kg and is 25.6 V. In order to evaluate the efficiency of a-Si panels with respect to the temperature and the solar irradiation, cities of Istanbul, Ankara and Adana in Turkey were selected. Temperature and solar irradiation were gathered from reliable sources and by using translation equations, current and voltage output of panels were calculated. As a result of these calculations, current and energy outputs were computed by considering an average efficient solar irradiation time value per day in Turkey. The calculated power values were inserted to a battery cycler system, and the behavior of high power LFP batteries in a time sequence of 7.2 h was evaluated. The charging and discharging cycles were obtained and their behavior was discussed. According to the results, Istanbul has the lowest number of peak month's energy, it followed by Ankara, and ultimately Adana has the highest number of peak months and energy storage. It was observed during the tests that values up to 4 A was discharged by battery packages in a full discharge cycle depending on application and required load. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the intermittent nature of power production of a considered high-altitude wind energy system utilizing an airborne module tethered to a ground station, sufficiently large energy storage is required in order to provide steady power supply to the electrical power grid. This paper focuses on the sizing of typical low-to-medium scale energy storage systems (up to 10MW), such as those based on flywheels, compressed air, batteries and ultracapacitors, considering the intermittent power production cycle, airborne module altitude range and ground-station generator power ratings.

One possible solution for this issue is the implementation of desalination but its utilization can greatly increase the demand for electricity. An important concept for a wide scale implementation of desalination is the integration of water and energy resources.Jordan is currently one of the most water deprived countries in the world. It is also a country very rich in renewable energy sources but almost no utilization of that potential. A combination of desalination, pump storage that utilize the produced brine and renewable energy sources could solve both issues. The desalination plants could produce enough water to ensure the supply for Jordan's ever growing population while the use of wind and solar power could provide much needed electricity and reduce the need for imported fossil fuels as well as CO2 emissions.The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of desalination in a combination with pump storage that utilizes the produced brine on the penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources in an energy system.

Results showed that the nectars were of better quality when stored at lower temperatures. HMF generally increased significantly for all nectars during storage. Conversely, the total polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity of the nectars stored in aluminium cans and the larger-sized carton packaging decreased during storage. Lower anthocyanin loss and colour change were found in the nectars stored in aluminium cans. However, the better packaging material was found to be the large-sized carton package when HMF was analysed. © 2014 Institute of Food Science and Technology.","Aluminium beverage can; Aseptic; Carton package; Quality; Sour cherry nectar; Storage","Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Anthocyanins; Antioxidants; Ascorbic acid; Energy storage; Food storage; Image quality; Packaging; Anti-oxidant activities; Aseptic; Carton packaging; Different sizes; Lower temperatures; Polyphenol content; Sour cherry; Storage temperatures; Packaging materials; Prunus cerasus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908494641

However, since these FCS plugs have power ratings of up to 100 kW, they may expose the utility mains to intolerable stresses in the near future scenario where there will be a large number of public FCS spread across the network. This paper proposes an internal power balancing strategy for FCS based on flywheel energy storage system (ESS) which is able to mitigate those impacts by ramping the initial power peak. The balancing strategy was implemented in a distributed manner to grid and flywheel interfacing converters by means of distributed bus signaling (DBS) method. Since the parameters in the proposed upper hierarchical control layer affect the stability features of the system, a reduced order small-signal model has been assembled and parameters have been selected accordingly.

In spite of being effective in normalization of blood glucose levels, the currently used PPARγ agonists from the thiazolidinedione type have serious side effects, making the discovery of novel ligands highly relevant. Natural products have proven historically to be a promising pool of structures for drug discovery, and a significant research effort has recently been undertaken to explore the PPARγ-activating potential of a wide range of natural products originating from traditionally used medicinal plants or dietary sources. The majority of identified compounds are selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARMs), transactivating the expression of PPARγ-dependent reporter genes as partial agonists. Those natural PPARγ ligands have different binding modes to the receptor in comparison to the full thiazolidinedione agonists, and on some occasions activate in addition PPARα (e.g. genistein, biochanin A, sargaquinoic acid, sargahydroquinoic acid, resveratrol, amorphastilbol) or the PPARγ-dimer partner retinoid X receptor (RXR; e.g. the neolignans magnolol and honokiol). A number of in vivo studies suggest that some of the natural product activators of PPARγ (e.g. honokiol, amorfrutin 1, amorfrutin B, amorphastilbol) improve metabolic parameters in diabetic animal models, partly with reduced side effects in comparison to full thiazolidinedione agonists. The bioactivity pattern as well as the dietary use of several of the identified active compounds and plant extracts warrants future research regarding their therapeutic potential and the possibility to modulate PPARγ activation by dietary interventions or food supplements. © 2014 The Authors.","Diabetes; Natural product; Nuclear receptor; Nutrition; PPAR gamma","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; biochanin A; carnosic acid; carnosol; catechin; falcarindiol; fatty acid; flavonoid; genistein; ginsenoside Rb 1; honokiol; kaempferol; linoleic acid; luteolin; magnolol; natural product; neolignan; partial agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; plant extract; polyacetylene derivative; quercetin; quinone derivative; resveratrol; retinoid X receptor; sesquiterpene lactone; stilbene derivative; unindexed drug; biological product; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein binding; adipocyte; Article; diet supplementation; drug binding; drug receptor binding; energy balance; energy metabolism; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; human; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; medicinal plant; metabolic parameters; metabolic regulation; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; reporter gene; tissue distribution; transcription initiation; agonists; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effects; metabolism; Biological Products; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; PPAR gamma; Protein Binding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908265684

To deal with the curse of dimensionality, we introduce a virtual continuous time system and derive closed-form approximate priority functions for the discrete time MDP at various operating regimes. Based on the approximation, we obtain an online power control solution which is adaptive to the channel state information as well as the data and energy queue state information. The derived power control solution has a multi-level water-filling structure, where the water level is determined jointly by the data and energy queue lengths.

The study is based on the real, Ruukki Metals Ltd.'s existing steel mill, located in the city of Raahe, Finland. Implications of application of OBF to energy and mass balances at the site are studied. Based on the technical evaluation, costs and feasibility for carbon capture are estimated. The energy and mass balance basis is presented in this first part of the series of two papers. Costs, feasibility and sensitivity analysis are assessed in the second part of the series (Tsupari et al. 2014. Int. J.

Greenhouse Gas Control 16 (August) pp. 271-277 concentrating only on the parts of the steelmaking processes affected by the deployment of OBF and CO2 capture. The technical processes, CO2 capture and the steelmaking processes affected were modelled using Aspen Plus process modelling software and the results were used to estimate the CO2 emission reduction potential with OBF technology at an integrated steel mill.The results show that the CO2 emission from an iron and steel mill can be significantly reduced by application of an oxygen blast furnace and CCS. By applying only the blast furnace process, the emissions can already be reduced by 1.2Mt/a without storing the separated CO2. If captured CO2 is also purified and stored permanently, the emission can be further reduced by an additional 1.4Mt/a. This is a significant reduction considering that the production of the mill stays the same as in the reference case. In addition to carbon footprint of the production, application of oxygen blast furnace also has significant impact on coke consumption and energy balance on the site. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aspen Plus; CCS; Concept evaluation; Iron and steel industry; OBF; Oxygen blast furnace; Vacuum pressure swing adsorption","ASPEN PLUS; CCS; Concept evaluation; OBF; Vacuum pressure swing adsorptions; Iron and steel industry; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; conceptual framework; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; energy balance; milling; oxygen; steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908046333

The influence on the content of biogenic amines, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ammonia in the faeces was also determined. Maize was either dried (dried maize), ensiled after milling (maize silage) or tight-closed-stored (TCS-maize) as a whole grain. Nine growing pigs (35.1 ± 0.8. kg) were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. They were fed diets based on the different maize conserves, barley and soybean meal to ensure the same content of N, energy and digestible phosphorus (P) in the diet. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of the DM, ash and starch was improved (P<0.05), and the ATTD of the ether extract tended to be improved (P<0.10) when the maize was fermented. Moreover, based on the results related to the ATTD of P in the different maize conserves of a previous study, less P was added to diets that were based on fermented maize. Nevertheless, the P excretion was reduced without compromising P utilisation. The metabolic products of the gut microorganisms, biogenic amines and most VFAs in the faeces were reduced when the animals were fed fermented maize (P<0.05). The observed effects were more pronounced in the maize silage treatment. In conclusion, the current data suggest that the air-proofed storage of wet maize can be a strategy to improve the feeding value of maize-based diets fed to pigs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Digestibility; Fermentation; Maize; Microbial metabolites; Phytate; Pig",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907991644

Due to their poor thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity, thermally conductive fillers are often added to form composites to enhance the thermal performance. To achieve the optimized performance without sacrificing the thermal capacity, a novel numerical methodology has been developed to model the thermal behavior of phase change material composites, which has been validated by the experimental results for pure n-octadecane and n-octadecane/expanded graphite composites. Effects of different filler concentration distributions have been analyzed and compared. It is found that the phase change time is significantly affected by the filler distribution. An optimal polynomial filler distribution can reduce the phase change time by more than 50% with the same filling content, compared with the uniform distribution.

For an industrial application of this process however, the optimization of the volumetric productivity and the product quality is an important issue. Since the reactants in this fermentation process are, unlike in most microbial fermentations, solely gasses, the gas liquid mass transfer is supposed to play an important role on the way to a higher volumetric productivity.This work aimed at investigating the effects of the gassing rate, the reactor pressure, as well as reactor design issues on the performance of Methanothermobacter marburgensis by using continuous cultures. Our results show that biological methanogenesis with M. marburgensis is gas limited. Maximum physiological capacity is not reached yet. The gassing rate influenced mainly the volumetric methane production rate (MER), the reactor pressure influenced mainly the offgas quality. Based on this information, we demonstrated how a combination of increased gas flow rate and increased reactor pressure can be used to reach high volumetric productivity at high offgas quality. Maximum MER was 950mmolL-1h-1 at a CH4 concentration of 60Vol.-%, maximum CH4 concentration reached was 85Vol.-% at a MER of 255mmolL-1h-1.The reactor design currently limits further increase in gas flow rate and reactor pressure.

In the absence of HISS action, the hypoglycemic response to insulin is the same as in the fasted state, and only half of what it should be. Postprandial hyperglycemia ensues, with compensatory hyperinsulinemia, resultant hyperlipidemia and elevated free radical stress. Storage of nutrient energy shifts from glycogen in muscle to fat. Chronic AMIS results in adiposity, occurs with age, is accelerated with sucrose supplement, and prevented by a synergistic antioxidant. Exercise reverses AMIS, as do pharmaceuticals that mimic the “feeding signals”. The AMIS syndrome develops as a sequence of pathologies based on the consequences of absence of HISS action, including adiposity as the earliest symptom. Cardiac dysfunction, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and fatty liver are related to lack of HISS action. The AMIS syndrome hypothesis is mechanistic-based and accounts for the major pathologies associated with prediabetes, obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. AMIS can be diagnosed, prevented and treated. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","AMIS syndrome (Absence of Meal-induced Insulin Sensitization); Diabetes; Hepatic Insulin Sensitizing Substance (HISS); Hepatic parasympathetic neuropathy; Hyperinsulinemia; Insulin resistance; Meal-induced Insulin Sensitization (MIS); Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Prediabetes; Rapid insulin sensitivity test (RIST)","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; atropine; cholecystokinin; glutathione; hepatic insulin sensitizing substance; insulin sensitizing agent; nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; s adenosylmethionine; somatostatin; sucrose; unclassified drug; absence of meal induced insulin sensitization syndrome; Article; chemical phenomena; chronology; diabetes mellitus; diet restriction; diet supplementation; exercise; fatty heart; fatty liver; feeding behavior; free radical quenching; glucose blood level; glucose transport; heart disease; human; hyperinsulinemia; hyperlipidemia; impedance; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; obesity; signal transduction; vasodilatation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921650638

In this work, we report on vibration energy harvesting scheme based on the charging phenomenon occurring naturally between two bodies with different work functions. Such work function energy harvester (WFEH) is similar to electrostatic energy harvester with the fundamental distinction that neither external power supplies nor electrets are needed. A theoretical model and description of different operation modes of WFEHs are presented. The WFEH concept is tested with macroscopic experiments, which agree well with the model. The feasibility of miniaturizing WFEHs is shown by simulating a realistic MEMS device. The WFEH can be operated as a charge pump that pushes charge and energy into an energy storage element. We show that such an operation mode is highly desirable for applications and that it can be realised with either a charge shuttle or with switches. The WFEH is shown to give equal or better output power in comparison to traditional electrostatic harvesters. Our findings indicate that WFEH has great potential in energy harvesting applications.",,"feasibility study; model; power supply; storage; theoretical model; vibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915772279

While their performances are satisfactorily under normal conditions, they may be degraded under wind gusts as well as in extremely low grid voltage conditions. An adaptive control of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system for efficient wind energy transfer as well as dynamic performance improvement is proposed in this article. A radial basis function neural network has been employed to determine the controller parameter values. The nominal weights of the neural network are obtained from training of a large input-output data set generated through an improved swarm optimization procedure. These weights are then updated through a novel method of tracking of system outputs in time domain. Tests carried out with the adaptive controller show that the improved particle swarm-based radial basis network SMES controller delivers wind energy to grid efficiently and at the same time exhibit very good damping profile. © 2014, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.","Adaptive neural network; Particle search optimization; PMSG; Radial basis function; SMES; Wind generator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909998989

This paper describes the impact of weather change on rice drying system design and management in Bangladesh. A general simulation model (WEGDM) translated in to FORTRAN 77 language that can simulate different weather patterns was used to study the effect of weather change on rice drying system design and management. There are three major components of the model-simulator for weather variables, simulator for drying process and simulator for economic analysis. Net present value (NPV) of cash flow was used as an overall criterion to study the effect of weather on the capacity of the drying and storing system. Eight different weather patterns have been simulated to study the effect of weather using previous weather data of 24 years. All pertinent cost parameters including fixed cost and variable costs were considered. Energy cost of drying was calculated using available grain drying theories and equations. Results indicated that there was a significant effect of weather change on rice drying and storing system capacities. The model revealed that the optimum drying capacity, storage size and the benefit cost ratio for a locality in Bangladesh were 4.37 m3/h, 547.0 m3 and 1.58 respectively. The model could also be used to determine the optimum capacities of drying and storing facilities of other cereals under adverse weather change. © 2014, International Society for Horticultural Science.

Among the biological sources, peptides and proteins are of special interest due to their role as major structural elements in all living systems, ranging from bacteria to humans in a continuum of magnitudes, from the nano-scale to the macro-scale. Peptides, as short as dipeptides, contain all the molecular information needed to form well-ordered structures at the nano-scale. Here, in light of the significant advancements in the field of peptide nanostructures in the last few years, we provide an updated overview of this subject. The use of these nanostructures was indeed recently demonstrated in various fields including the design of molecular motors based on nanostructure complexation with a metal-organic framework, the delivery of therapeutic agents, the development of energy storage devices and the fabrication of piezoelectric-based sensors.

The results indicated that the mixture consisting of 60 mass% camphene and 40 mass% stearic acid is the most favorable as a PCM, in terms of the phase-change temperature and latent heat. Thereafter, the CS was absorbed in fly ash, pyroclastic, barite, and marble powder, which acts as a supporting material, to prepare four kinds of composite-based PCMs. DSC, FT-IR, and scanning electron microscopy measurements were made to investigate the structures and properties of the PCMs. DSC results showed that the latent heats of melting and freezing of the composite PCMs were sharply decreased. Morphology and structural characterization revealed that, in form-stable PCMs, the dispersion of the supporting materials in the camphene/stearic acid matrix is homogeneous and there is no chemical interaction between the CS and composites.

Other strategic decisions deal with the optimal selection of desalination technologies for existing and new desalination plants. In addition, the model provides decisions to define the pipeline network configuration for water transportation among several sites. The operation decisions are modelled to optimize the water production from desalination plants, energy consumption, brine disposal, as well as CO2 emissions. In addition, water transportation through the pipeline network and water storage at every site are optimized to satisfy water demand at every time period, and to minimize the net present value of the supply chain network. Finally, the proposed approach is solved for a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed mathematical programming model.

Lyngby, Denmark","The increase of renewable sources in the power sector is an important step towards more sustainable electricity production. However, introducing high shares of variable renewables, such as wind and solar, cause dispatchable power plants to vary their output to fulfill the remaining electrical demand. The environmental impacts related to potential future energy systems in Ireland for 2025 with high shares of wind power were evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA), focusing on cycling emissions (due to part-load operation and start-ups) from dispatchable generators. Part-load operations significantly affect the average power plant efficiency, with all units seeing an average yearly efficiency noticeably less than optimal. In particular, load following units, on average, saw an 11% reduction. Given that production technologies are typically modeled assuming steady-state operation at full load, as part of LCA of electricity generation, the efficiency reduction would result in large underestimation of emissions, e.g. up to 65% for an oil power plant. Overall, cycling emissions accounted for less than 7% of lifecycle CO2, NOx and SO2 emissions in the five scenarios considered: while not overbalancing the benefits from increasing wind energy, cycling emissions are not negligible and should be systematically included (i.e. by using emission factors per unit of fuel input rather than per unit of power generated). As the ability to cycle is an additional service provided by a power plant, it is also recommended that only units with similar roles (load following, mid merit, or base load) should be compared. The results showed that cycling emissions increased with the installed wind capacity, but decreased with the addition of storage. The latter benefits can, however, only be obtained if base-load electricity production shifts to a cleaner source than coal. Finally, the present study indicates that, in terms of emission reductions, the priority for Ireland is to phase out coal-based power plants. While investing in new storage capacity reduces system operating costs at high wind penetrations and limits cycling, the emissions reductions are somewhat negated when coupled with base load coal. © 2014.","Emission factors; Energy modeling; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Power plant cycling; Renewable energy system; Wind power","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Emission control; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Sulfur dioxide; Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Coal based power plants; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Emission factors; Energy model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energy systems; Steady-state operation; Life cycle; cleaner production; electricity generation; emission control; life cycle analysis; sustainable development; thermal power; wind power; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903511173

The methane yield of the different substrate mixtures was determined in batch experiments to study possible correlation between methanogenic activity in the anaerobic digesters and reduction of indigenous microorganisms in the blackwater. By the end of the experiments a recovery study was conducted to determine possible injury of the microorganisms. In both anaerobic and aerobic samples, survival of Escherichia coli was better in the presence of Greenlandic Halibut offal when compared to samples containing blackwater only and blackwater and shrimp offal, possibly due to more available carbon in the samples containing Greenlandic Halibut offal. Reduction of faecal streptococci was large under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, and the results indicated a complete removal of faecal streptococci in the anaerobic samples containing blackwater and a mixture of blackwater and shrimp offal after 17 and 31 days, respectively.

The opposite pattern was observed in the aerobic samples, with a growth in the beginning followed by a reduction. During the anaerobic digestion tetracycline resistant bacteria showed the least reduction in the mixture of blackwater and shrimp offal, which had the lowest methane yield while the highest reduction was observed in the mixture of blackwater and Greenlandic Halibut, where the highest methane yield was measured Reduction of coliphages was larger under anaerobic conditions. Addition of fish offal had no effect on survival of coliphages. The results of the recovery study indicated that a fraction of the E. coli in the aerobic blackwater sample and of the faecal streptococci in both the anaerobic and aerobic samples containing blackwater and Greenlandic Halibut were injured only, and thus able to resuscitate during recovery.The use of anaerobic digestion in the Arctic is limited to substrate types like those tested in this study because of absence of agriculture. The results indicate that anaerobic digestion of wastewater could benefit from the addition of fish offal, with respect to both microbial reduction and energy production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anaerobic digestion; Arctic; Fish offal; Indigenous microorganisms; Resistance; Wastewater","Agricultural robots; Electric resistance; Escherichia coli; Fish; Methane; Mixtures; Shellfish; Wastewater; Anaerobic conditions; Arctic; Different substrates; Faecal Streptococci; Fish offals; Mesophilic anaerobic digestion; Methanogenic activity; Microbial reduction; Anaerobic digestion; amoxicillin; carbon; methane; tetracycline; industrial waste; sewage; anaerobiosis; coliform bacterium; crustacean; developmental biology; flatfish; methane; microorganism; substrate; wastewater; aerobic metabolism; aerobic storage; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic growth; antibiotic resistance; Arctic; article; bacterial survival; bacterium; blackwater; coliphage; controlled study; energy yield; Escherichia coli; feces microflora; fish; fish offal; halibut; mesophilic bacterium; methanogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; reduction; shrimp; storage; Streptococcus; waste water; anaerobic growth; analysis; animal; bacterial phenomena and functions; bioreactor; biosynthesis; Decapoda (Crustacea); feces; fishery; flounder; Greenland; industrial waste; microbiology; physiology; procedures; sewage; waste disposal; Arctic; Greenland; Aerobiosis; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Arctic Regions; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Bioreactors; Decapoda (Crustacea); Escherichia coli; Feces; Fisheries; Flounder; Greenland; Industrial Waste; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Sewage; Streptococcus; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902994845

The scope of analysis was cradle-to-end of utilisation with functional unit 1 kWh of uninterrupted electricity produced. For the life-cycle inventory analysis, quantitative data was collected with on-site measurements on an experimental system, project documentation, GaBi software generic databases and literature data. The CML 2001 method was applied to evaluate the system’s environmental impacts. Energy consumption of the manufacturing phase was estimated from gross value added (GVA) and the energy intensity of the industry sector in the manufacturer’s country.Results and discussion: In terms of global warming (GW), acidification (A), abiotic depletion (AD) and eutrophication (E), manufacturing phase of HT-UPS accounts for more than 97 % of environmental impacts. Electrolyser in all its life-cycle phases contributes above 50 % of environmental impacts to the system’s GW, A and AD. Energy return on investment (EROI) for the HT-UPS has been calculated to be 0.143 with distinction between renewable (roughly 60 %) and non-renewable energy resources inputs. HT-UPS’s life-cycle GW emissions have been calculated to be 375 g of CO2 eq per 1 kWh of uninterruptible electric energy supplied. All these values have also been calculated for the ICE-UPS and show that in terms of GW, A and AD, the ICE-UPS has bigger environmental impacts and emits 1,190 g of CO2 eq per 1 kWh of uninterruptible electric energy supplied. Both systems have similar operation phase energy efficiency. The ICE-UPS has a higher EROI but uses almost none RES inputs.Conclusions: The comparison of two different technologies for providing UPS has shown that in all environmental impact categories, except eutrophication, the HT-UPS is the sounder system. Most of HT-UPS’s environmental impacts result from the manufacturing phase. On the contrary, ICE-UPS system’s environmental impacts mainly result from operational phase. Efficiency of energy conversion from electricity to hydrogen to electricity again is rather low, as is EROI, but these will likely improve as the technology matures.Purpose: The paper provides an empirical assessment of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system based on hydrogen technologies (HT-UPS) using renewable energy sources (RES) with regard to its environmental impacts and a comparison to a UPS system based on the internal combustion engine (ICE-UPS). © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Advanced energy systems; Electrolyser; EROI; Fuel cells; Hydrogen technologies; Life-cycle assessment; Renewable energy sources; Uninterruptible power supply","carbon dioxide; abiotic depletion; acidification; Article; carbon footprint; electrolyser; energy consumption; energy conversion; energy resource; energy return on investment; energy yield; environmental impact; environmental parameters; eutrophication; general device; greenhouse effect; hydrogen technology uninterruptible power supply system; intermethod comparison; internal combustion engine uninterruptible power supply system; life cycle assessment; power supply; renewable energy; system analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027939208

Particular lines of the Moscow Metro were considered (Filevskaya, Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya, Butovskaya, Kol’tsevaya), where trains are equipped with asynchronous motors of 81–740/741 Rusich series. The lines are able to save up to 10–12% of the traction energy in the regenerated energy. It is suggested to use a system of stationary energy storage to improve the efficiency of regenerative braking. A stationary uncontrolled storage system based on storage modules produced by the Russian company Elton was selected from among the multiple existing types of storage systems. A scheme of stationary energy-storage system for use in the traction power-supply system of the Moscow Metro is described. Electrotechnical characteristics of the storage system and its performance features and functionality are presented. The power indices of the stationary energy-storage system were measured experimentally for normal operation at a traction substation of the Filevskaya line of the Moscow Metro over several months. Maximum levels of the regenerated energy and the cycle and efficiency ratio were determined. Long-term monitoring of the normal operation confirmed high reliability of stationary energy storage. Every system, including the switching elements; diagnostic and control systems of storage modules; and control and signaling systems, including those at the dispatching office; operated in a failsafe fashion. The stationary energy-storage system exhibited more positive effects, such as stabilization of voltage at the traction substation bus and possible lower rated power capacity of a traction substation as an effect of a smooth power consumption. It is also possible to bring a train containing passengers from a tunnel to the nearest station in case of external power-supply failure. The correlation between the theoretical calculations and the experimental measurements is displayed. © 2014, Allerton Press, Inc.","capacitive energy storage; energy recuperation braking; traction power supply system of underground","Electric current collection; Energy storage; Induction motors; Regenerative braking; Traction motors; Capacitive energy storage; Electric power efficiency; Energy recuperation; External power supplies; Full-scale applications; Stationary energy storages; Theoretical calculations; Traction power supply system; Rectifier substations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910133324

It was suggested to carry out comparative analysis of the efficiency of energy-storage systems on the basis of the following parameters: index of electric-power recovery in a full start-brake cycle of the wagon operation, relative determination of electric-power recovery in the braking regime and electric-power loss in the active regime of car operation, index of electric-power recovery in electrodynamic braking of traction electric cars, and relative evaluation of the mass of energy-storage systems. It is proposed to analyze the efficiency of energy-storage systems taking into account their design features. Energy-storage systems can be manufactured in a monoblock or stepped design. The proposed procedure of comparative analysis of the energy and mass-dimensional characteristics of underground cars with energy-storage systems allow their operation to be evaluated with a minimum number of source data. Installation of energy-storage systems increases the mass and energy expenditure during wagon operation, but this loss is significantly less than the energy volume recovered with an energy-storage system in a regime of recuperative braking of traction electric cars. Energy-storage systems allow one to create effective systems of autonomic recuperative braking on underground cars. A stepped design of energy-storage systems decreases their mass-dimensional characteristics and increases energy efficiency. The only real disadvantage of energy-storage systems preventing their use is their large size. © 2014, Allerton Press, Inc.","condenser energy-storage system; dimensions; energy conservation; mass; reserve; underground car","Automobile manufacture; Digital storage; Electric automobiles; Electric energy storage; Electric losses; Electric traction; Energy conservation; Recovery; dimensions; Energy storage systems; mass; reserve; Underground cars; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910122440

In this book, Elin Lerum Boasson develops an innovative and well-grounded analytical framework for assessing national climate-policy development. Why do national climate policies emerge and change? This question is underpinned by the role played by different actors and the kind social mechanism at work. Boasson asks, to what extent and how is the emergence and change of climate policy influenced by: politicians and the national political fields; business and organizational fields; EU policy and the European environment; social and entrepreneurial mechanisms?. Combining policy studies with sociological new institutionalism, and drawing on three climate policy sub-areas in Norway: renewable energy, low-energy buildings and carbon capture and storage, Boasson presents a multi-field framework that allows the reader to capture the entire policy cycle, explaining policy initiation, policy adoption and the long-term, social feedback effects resulting from implementation (or lack of implementation). © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

The challenge for cloud robotics is the inherent problem of cloud disconnection. A major assumption made in the development of the current cloud robotics frameworks is that the connection between the cloud and the robot is always available. However, for multi-robots working in heterogeneous environments, the connection between the cloud and the robots cannot always be guaranteed. This work serves to assist with the challenge of disconnection in cloud robotics by proposing a survivable cloud multi-robotics (SCMR) framework for heterogeneous environments. The SCMR framework leverages the combination of a virtual ad hoc network formed by robot-to-robot communication and a physical cloud infrastructure formed by robot-to-cloud communications. The quality of service (QoS) on the SCMR framework was tested and validated by determining the optimal energy utilization and time of response (ToR) on drivability analysis with and without cloud connection. The design trade-off, including the result, is between the computation energy for the robot execution and the offloading energy for the cloud execution. © 2014 The Author(s).","Cloud; Disconnection; Drivability; Multi-robotics; R2C; R2R; SRM; Survivability","Ad hoc networks; Clouds; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Industrial robots; Machine design; Multipurpose robots; Quality of service; Robotics; Disconnection; Drivability; R2C; R2R; SRM; Survivability; Robots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913554354

This Paper reports on an easy and reproducible way to synthesize a new stable form of magnesium borohydride by pressure-induced collapse of the porous γ-Mg(BH4)2. This amorphous complex hydride was investigated by temperature-programmed synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and Raman spectroscopy, and the dynamics of the BH4- reorientation was studied by spin-lattice relaxation NMR spectroscopy. No long-range order is observed in the lattice region by Raman spectroscopy, while the internal vibration modes of the BH4- groups are the same as in the crystalline state. A hump at 4.9 Å in the SXRD pattern suggests the presence of nearly linear Mg-BH4-Mg fragments constituting all the known crystalline polymorphs of Mg(BH4)2, which are essentially frameworks built of tetrahedral Mg nodes and linear BH4 linkers. TEM shows that the pressure-collapsed phase is amorphous down to the nanoscale, but surprisingly, SXRD reveals a transition at ∼90 °C from the dense amorphous state (density of 0.98 g/cm3) back to the porous γ phase having only 0.55 g/cm3 crystal density. The crystallization is slightly exothermic, with the enthalpy of -4.3 kJ/mol. The volumetric hydrogen density of the amorphous form is 145 g/L, one of the highest among hydrides. Remarkably, this form of Mg(BH4)2 has different reactivity compared to the crystalline forms. The parameters of the reorientational motion of BH4 groups in the amorphous Mg(BH4)2 found from NMR measurements differ significantly from those in the known crystalline forms. The behavior of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates can be described in terms of a Gaussian distribution of the activation energies centered on 234 ± 9 meV with the dispersion of 100 ± 10 meV. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Complex hydrides; Reversible transitions; Ultradense",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908191418

These studies were aimed at performing a field test for the heating capacity of a heat pump. The studies were conducted for 3 cases of variable demand for heat: when space heating was used on the ground floor (75 m2); when space heating was used on the ground and first floors (140 m2) and with the additional heating of domestic hot water mode on (hot water tank 250 L). During the measurement cycle the evaporation temperature of the R407C refrigerant was maintained at a constant level using an electronic expansion valve. Series of measurements were conducted for the evaporation temperature ranging from -5 °C to 2.5 °C. The COP increases along with the evaporation temperature of the R407C refrigerant, yet in the case of the heat pump the maximum COP value was obtained for the evaporation temperature about -2.5 °C. The obtained results were considerably influenced by the temperature of glycol in the secondary circuit of the low temperature source. The heating performance of the heat pump within the investigated period ranged from 8.4 kW to 9.2 kW. While heating domestic hot water, the system could heat the water in the storage tank to a temperature of 45 °C. The control system of the heat pump should enable keeping the condensation temperature as low as possible thus maintain a high COP value. The heating capacity can be adjusted to match the heat demand for space heating by controlling the duration of compressor operation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These, ideally, must be inexpensive, less polluting than current fuels and available for a substantial time. One promising alternative is hydrogen, which has the great advantage that it can be produced by coupling renewable energy devices with water electrolysis. Several projects devoted to connecting photovoltaic and wind systems with electrolysis devices have been successful; however, little research has been done into the coupling of ocean wave energy converters with water electrolysis. The work here proposes a basic system that stores the energy from waves in the form of hydrogen. The WEC considered is a novel design known as a Blow-Jet, which captures waves and converts them into a water jet. The performance of the Blow-Jet is found to depend more on wavelength than on wave height. The electrolyser results show, at 0.200 A and 1.88 V, that the electrolysis of water produces 0.082 Nl h-1 of hydrogen and a current efficiency (ηI) of 90.58%. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Blow-Jet; Electrolyser; Energy storage systems; Hydrogen production; Wave power Wave energy converters","Electrolysis; Fossil fuels; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Water waves; Wave power; Alternative energy source; Current efficiency; Electrolysers; Electrolysis of waters; Energy storage systems; Power waves; Renewable energy devices; Water electrolysis; Wave energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908075710

These platforms are an alternative to increase the effectiveness of future communication. Nevertheless, the power system is a key part that determines the implementation and feasibility of these platforms. One effective and renewable option to power an HALE aircraft is a photovoltaic system (PVS) with hydrogen storage. In this paper, the simulation of the solar/hydrogen closed loop system is carried out for a parametric combination of the subsystems power. Power consumption of the propeller was determined as a function of the aircraft weight in steady flight and in still air. In order to obtain the optimal nominal powers the efficacies are calculated at hourly intervals over the course of the year by means of an analytical energy balance. The proposed method was implemented in an algorithm, which allows fast estimation of the actual time of flight and the system efficiency.

This increasing electricity demand is resulting higher primary energy consumption and emission of green house gases (GHG) due to electricity generation from fossil fuels. An exciting alternative to reduce the peak electricity consumption is the possible utilization of solar heat to run thermally driven cooling machines instead of vapor compression machines utilizing high amount of electricity. In order to widen the use of solar collectors, they should also be used to contribute for sanitary hot water production and space heating. Pakistan lying on solar belt has a huge potential to utilize solar thermal heat for heating and cooling requirement because cooling is dominant throughout the year and the enormous amount of radiation availability provides an opportunity to use it for solar thermal driven cooling systems. The sensitivity analysis of solar assisted heating and cooling system has been carried out under climatic conditions of Faisalabad (Pakistan) and its economic feasibility has been calculated using maximization of NPV. Both storage size and collector area has been optimized using different economic boundary conditions. Results show that optimum area of collector lies between 0.26m2 to 0.36m2 of collector area per m2 of conditioned area for ieff values of 4.5% to 0.5%. The optimum area of collector increases by decreasing effective interest rate resulting higher solar fraction. The NPV was found to be negative for all ieff values which shows that some incentives/subsidies are needed to be provided to make the system cost beneficial. Results also show that solar fraction space heating varies between 87 and 100% during heating season and solar fraction cooling between 55 and 100% during cooling season which indicates a huge amount of conventional energy saving potential. © IJRED.","Absorption chiller; NPV; PBT; Solar collector; Solar cooling and heating",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040910880

The adaptive control scheme is based on the set-membership affine projection algorithm (SMAPA), which provides a faster convergence and less computational complexity than the normalized least-mean-square algorithm. In this study, two grid-connected fixed-speed wind farms are considered. The control strategy of the SMES units is based on a pulse width modulation (PWM) voltage source converter (VSC) and a dc-dc converter. The VSC and dc-dc converter is used to control the reactive and active power exchange with the power system, respectively. The SMAPA-based adaptive proportional-integral (PI) controllers are utilized to control both converters. For realistic responses, real wind speed data extracted from Hokkaido Island, Japan, and two-mass drive train model of the wind turbine generator system are used in the analyses. Also, a real 10 MVA SMES unit that was installed at a power plant in Kameyama, Japan, is connected to the point of common coupling of the wind farms. The validity of the proposed control scheme is verified by the simulation results, which are performed using PSCAD/EMTDC environment.

Petroleum coke (petcoke) is a black-colored solid composed primarily of carbon, and may contain limited amounts of elemental forms of sulfur, metals and non-volatile inorganic compounds. Petcoke is essentially chemically inert. Petcoke exposure is considered to pose few human health or environmental risks, but may present significant nuisance concerns. The material in Detroit was the byproduct of the nearby Marathon Refinery's processing of heavy crude oils derived, in part, from Canadian oil sands deposits. The situation gained national attention with the publication of an article in the New York Times (?A Black Mound of Canadian Oil Waste Is Rising over Detroit,? New York Times, May 17, 2013). The piles of petcoke sparked local concerns over the potential impacts of the material on human health and the environment, and whether these concerns were adequately addressed by local, state, and federal regulations. As petroleum refining is a nationwide commercial industry, these concerns may arise in other regions Petcoke is a co-product of several distillation processes used in refining heavy crude oil. Nearly half of U.S. petroleum refineries (56 or more) use a coking process to convert heavy crude oils into refined petroleum products, and more refineries may follow suit to take advantage of the supply of heavy crude oils from Canada's oil sands projects. Although it is a refining co-product, petcoke has economic value as both a heating fuel and raw material in manufacturing. In 2012, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. refineries produced in excess of 56 million metric tons of petcoke, of which 80% was exported. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has surveyed the potential human health and environmental impacts of petcoke through its High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge Program and found the material to be highly stable and non-reactive at ambient environmental conditions. Most toxicity analyses of petcoke find it has a low potential to cause adverse effects on aquatic or terrestrial environments as well as a low health hazard potential in humans, with no observed carcinogenic, reproductive, or developmental effects. Cases of repeated-dose and chronic inhalation of fugitive dust (as generated during petcoke handling and storage) in animal studies do appear associated with respiratory inflammation. Emissions from the combustion of petcoke, however, can have impacts on human health and the environment, including the release of common pollutants, hazardous substances, and high levels of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. While some federal statutes address certain environmental impacts of petcoke's life-cycle, most regulatory action and oversight has been undertaken at the state and local levels, generally through facility-specific permitting requirements. Federally, petcoke is exempted from classification as either a solid or hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and is not considered a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Petcoke facilities may be regulated under certain provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, as authorized by the Clean Water Act (CWA), if it is determined that runoff from sites where it is stored has the potential to transport the substance to nearby surface waters. The handling of petcoke may also create instances of reduced air quality due to releases of fugitive dust into the atmosphere.

Many street foods appear to be unhealthy since they are high in saturated fats, trans fats, salt and sugar. Furthermore, they are energydense and may contribute to the high prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities in SA. Aim: To conduct a situational analysis on the type, nutritional content, and hygienic conditions under which foods are sold by vendors on the streets of Cape Town (CT) and surrounding areas. Methods: All locations where vendors (n=820) sold street food (SF) in the CT and surrounding areas were surveyed. These venues included community centers, market areas, major streets, train and bus stations, and taxi ranks. The interviews were conducted by trained fieldworkers using pre-tested questionnaires. Street foods were categorized in different ways: i) by meal; ii) by single food item or beverage; iii) by the level of processing; iv) by method of cooking (fried, boiled, baked, grilled, roasted and steamed) and v) by packaging. Results: The majority of vendors had more than one food item for sale, with some specializing in specific types of food. It was observed that food items most commonly sold were snacks, such as crisps, candy bars, and biscuits (45%), cooked foods (28%), fruits and vegetables (26%), sweetened beverages or flavored water (6%), raw foods (4%), and tea and coffee (1%). Despite the variation in food items, the majority were classified as being unhealthy (i.e. energy-dense), and prepared and sold under poor hygienic conditions as shown by lack of adequate sanitation facilities, poor storage facilities, and inadequate serving procedures. Conclusion: With the exception of fruit and vegetables, the majority of foods and beverages sold by vendors were not healthy options and were prepared and sold under poor hygienic conditions. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Here, we show that GPR81 is also present in the mammalian brain, including regions of the cerebral neocortex and hippocampus, where it can be activated by physiological concentrations of lactate and by the specific GPR81 agonist 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate to reduce cAMP. Cerebral GPR81 is concentrated on the synaptic membranes of excitatory synapses, with a postsynaptic predominance. GPR81 is also enriched at the blood-brain-barrier: the GPR81 densities at endothelial cell membranes are about twice the GPR81 density at membranes of perivascular astrocytic processes, but about one-seventh of that on synaptic membranes. There is only a slight signal in perisynaptic processes of astrocytes. In synaptic spines, as well as in adipocytes, GPR81 immunoreactivity is located on subplasmalemmal vesicular organelles, suggesting trafficking of the protein to and from the plasma membrane. The results indicate roles of lactate in brain signaling, including a neuronal glucose and glycogen saving response to the supply of lactate. We propose that lactate, through activation of GPR81 receptors, can act as a volume transmitter that links neuronal activity, cerebral energy metabolism and energy substrate availability. © The Author 2013.

To tackle both problems, the new circuit configuration and optimization technique of the superconducting magnetic energy storage with fault current limiting function (SMES-FCL) in a DC microgrid are presented. The SMES-FCL circuit mainly consists of two DC choppers with common superconducting coil (SC). During normal operation, the SMES-FCL acts as the SMES unit to suppress the power fluctuation of DFIG. When severe faults occur in the system, the SC is automatically connected to the system and used as the fault current limiter. Consequently, the fault current and the terminal voltage drop of DFIG can be alleviated. The energy function method is used to formulate the optimization problem of SC inductance, initial stored energy, and proportional-integral control parameters of choppers. Simulation study confirms the superior control effect of the SMES-FCL over the conventional SMES. © 2015 IEEE.","Doubly fed induction generator wind turbine; energy function method; fault current limiter; optimization; superconducting magnetic energy storage","Choppers (circuits); Electric energy storage; Electric fault currents; Energy storage; Fault current limiters; Limiters; Magnetic storage; Optimization; Reconfigurable hardware; Superconducting devices; Superconducting fault current limiters; Superconducting magnets; Two term control systems; Wind turbines; Automatically connected; Circuit configurations; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Doubly fed induction generators; Energy function methods; Low-voltage ride-through; Proportional-integral control; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Asynchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927769355

The waste composition, and physical and chemical characteristics of each waste fraction were determined to evaluate the suitability of the waste for recycling and reuse as RDF-5. Results showed that after MBT processing, the solid waste >40 mm in size was observed to have 33.8 MJ/kg of calorific value. The average concentrations of heavy metals were also found to be within the acceptable limit for plastic waste combustion, thus proving that MBT-processed solid waste >40 mm in size has high potential for use as RDF-5. The optimal weight ratio of MBT-processed solid waste and crude oil sludge for transformation into RDF-5 was found to be 80:20. With this optimum ratio, the average calorific values of the RDF-5 were determined to be 47 MJ/kg, with sulfur and chlorine contents of 0.16 and 0.74 %, respectively. The characteristics of the produced RDF-5 could meet the specified ASTM standards in terms of calorific value (>15 MJ/kg), and sulfur and chlorine contents. In addition, the compressive strength of the produced RDF-5 was also found to be suitable for compact storage and transportation without any damage.

In contradistinction photonic crystals could present “perfect reflection” and they can be fabricated using porous silicon which has a higher melting point than aluminum (porous silicon has a melting point higher than 900 K). Porous silicon is a nanostructured semiconductor material which can be fabricated with different porosities and refractive indices. Multilayers of alternating periodic refractive index conform the structure of these photonic crystals. The light that propagates in these structures interacts with its periodic refractive index that generates wavelength gaps of forbidden transmission and so these multilayers conform a mirror.

Surface morphology of the films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images revealed that the films were uniformly distributed and the starting material (Cu2O) had cubical structure. Grains agglomeration and crystallinity were enhanced by annealing. Optical studies indicated that all the samples have direct allowed transition.

The developed numerical model shows that the process of the magnetic field diffusion into the steel at the leading edge of the pulse can be conventionally described by three stages: initial stage extending up to saturation of the steel surface layers, stage of saturation when the discharge current diffuses into the bulk of the steel, and stage of conduction when the discharge current is distributed practically uniformly in the steel. Approximate analytical relations describing the voltage drop across the resistive element are derived for each of the three stages. These relations are used for estimation of the effect of the ferromagnetic properties of the steel on transients in electrical circuits with the resistive element. Experiments prove the validity of the obtained analytical results. © 2014 IEEE.","Magnetic fields; pulse power systems; saturation magnetization; superconducting magnetic energy storages.","Saturation magnetization; Pulse power systems; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Magnetic fields",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908415702

A secondary emission magnetron injection gun is proposed as a source of the electron beam. Using the drift approximation, a step value after the first turn of the beam around the solenoid is calculated. For multiturn injection, the beam must not return to the electron gun. Thus, the step value must be large enough by comparison with the gun dimension. Using this condition and the Hull cutoff magnetic field equation, the maximum electrode diameters of the magnetron injection gun are calculated. The maximum gun perveance is calculated using scale theory and experimental data from other authors. Because of the small dimensions of the gun, a concept for a multibeam gun is proposed. As an example, the total current and total power are calculated for two values of the electron beam energy and three operational facilities. In comparison with existing sources for auxiliary plasma heating, a novel approach can provide higher power. The calculated levels of the electric field strength in the gun are several times lower than those achieved in experiments. Prospects for the novel concept for plasma heating and current drive and the problem of gun cooling are discussed. Other possible applications are discussed too.","Cold-cathode electron gun; Noninductive current drive; Plasma heating","Digital storage; Electric fields; Electrodes; Electron beam lithography; Electron beams; Electron guns; Magnetrons; Plasma heating; Secondary emission; Solenoids; Cold cathodes; Electric field strength; Electrode diameters; Electron beam energy; Magnetron injection gun; Noninductive current drives; Nonrelativistic electrons; Plasma heating and current drive; Electrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908397526

Characterization of polymer produced by this strain was also performed. Methods and Results: Twenty strains were isolated from water samples of salt ponds and selected based on both morphological features and their PHA storage capacity, which were determined by SEM and staining methods with Nile red and Nile blue, respectively; strains were also analysed by the fluorescence imaging technique. Among them, JCCOL25.8 strain showed the highest production of PHA's reason why phenotypic and genotypic characterization was performed; this strain was identified as Halomonas nitroreducens. Polymer produced by this strain was characterized by FTIR, DSC, GPC and EDX spectroscopy. Results indicated that the biosynthesized polymer was polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) which had a melting peak at 170°C and a crystallinity percentage of about 36%. Conclusions: Based on phenotypic and genotypic aspects, JCCOL25.8 strain was identified as H. nitroreducens and it was capable to accumulate PHB.

This is due to the boundary conditions and Gibbs Phase rule. At a minimum this leaves a hydrate with two adsorbed phases in addition to hydrate and fluids. One adsorbed phase is governed by the mineral surfaces and the other by the hydrate surface. With pressure and temperature defined by local conditions, hydrate formation will never be able to reach any state of equilibrium. The kinetics of hydrate formation and dissociation are a complex function of competing phase transitions. This requires kinetic theories that include minimization of free energy under constraints of mass and energy transport. Since phase transitions also change density, further constraints are given by fluid dynamics. In this work, we describe a new approach for non-equilibrium theory of hydrates together with a Phase Field Theory for simulation of phase transition kinetics. We choose a three component system of water, methane and carbon dioxide for illustration. Conversion of methane hydrate into carbon dioxide hydrate is a win-win situation of energy production combined with safe long term storage of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is able to induce and proceed with a solid-state exchange, but is slow due to mass transport limitations. A faster process is the formation of new hydrate from injected carbon dioxide and residual pore water. This formation releases substantial heat. This assists in dissociating in situ methane hydrate, making the conversion progress substantially faster, because heat transport is very rapid in these systems. But conversion of liquid water into carbon dioxide hydrate, in the vicinity of the hydrate core will increase temperatures to some portions of the surface. The dissociating regions of the methane hydrate core will show a local decrease in temperature, due to extraction of heat for methane hydrate dissociation from surroundings. Another reason for heat transport implementation is that regions of the system that contains non-polar gas phase will have low heat conductivity and low heat convection. At this stage we apply a simplified heat transport model in which ""lumped"" efficient heat conductivity is used. We illustrate the theory on the conversion of methane hydrate to mix methane-carbon dioxide hydrate using three initial hydrate sizes: 150. Å. ×. 150. Å, 500. Å. ×. 500. Å and 5000. Å. ×. 5000. Å. The hydrate cores used are spherical because it makes it easier to illustrate the impact of curvature. Symmetrical aspects simplifies the dependency to a two dimensional problem - although there are no such limitations in theory. The mineral surfaces are considered to be water wetting in these examples. It was observed that the smaller sizes convert to a more unstable mix hydrate for some periods of the simulation time, during which there were significant losses of the initial methane hydrate core. These instabilities are caused by local under saturated fluid phases around the hydrate core. Eventually a steady state progress was observed. The largest size system appeared to reach a steady state situation comparable faster than the two smaller systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Hydrate; Kinetics; Non-equilibrium; Supersaturation; Thermodynamics","Enzyme kinetics; Hydrates; Supersaturation; Thermodynamics; Heat transport; Hydrate phase; Non equilibrium; Phase field theory; Carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fluid dynamics; hydrodynamics; kinetics; mass transport; methane; supersaturation; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908067438

HRLs (heat recovery loops) are an indirect method for transferring heat from one process to another using an intermediate fluid. With HRL's thermal storage is also necessary to effectively meet the stop/start time dependent nature of the multiple source and sink streams. Combining solar heating with HRL's is a cost effective way to share common storage and piping infrastructure. The conventional HRL design method based on a CTS (constant temperature storage) and a new HRL design method using VTS (variable temperature storage) are applied to demonstrate the potential benefits of inter-plant heat integration and installing solar heating. The dairy case study had available 12 source streams including four spray dryer exhausts and six sink streams. The addition of the dryer exhausts as heat sources was a critical factor in gaining a heat recovery of 10.8MW for the variable temperature storage design, of which 5.1MW was contributed from exhaust heat recovery. For the same minimum approach temperature the VTS approach achieved 37% more heat recovery compared to the CTS approach. Solar heating also proved to be a valuable source to be integrated into an HRL with a pinch around the cold storage tank with the maximum addition of 0.9MW of heating on average for the CTS approach and 1.0MW of heating on average for the VTS approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Heat recovery loop; Low temperature heat recovery; Process integration; Solar heating","Cold storage; Cost effectiveness; Design; Dryers (equipment); Heat storage; Heating; Recovery; Solar heating; Temperature; Waste heat utilization; Constant temperature; Exhaust heat recovery; Industrial sites; Low temperature heat recovery; Potential benefits; Process integration; Renewable energies; Variable temperature; Waste heat; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; heat source; industrial performance; installation; optimization; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908067408

Increase in the price of oil as well as environmental concerns have spurred the use of alternative renewable energy sources. In the Faroe Islands, the readily available wind energy is an obvious source for space heating. Seasonal correlation exists between wind energy and required space heating and mismatches can be reduced by using simple water tanks as heat storages. A traditional Danish induction generator wind turbine has been erected on the island of Nólsoy to produce energy for space heating. The system is designed as a stand-alone microgrid, which needs its own control of frequency and voltage. A microcontroller is used to control frequency by matching load (heaters) to generated power and to produce the correct reactive power and voltage by switched capacitors. One challenge is the start-up procedure at high wind speeds when nominal speed tends to be reached before voltage builds up by the self-excitation process.

Consequently, emission reduction technologies will be needed to reduce CO2 atmospheric concentration. Microalgae may have an important role in this context. They are photosynthetic microorganisms that are able to fix atmospheric CO2 using solar energy with efficiency ten times higher than terrestrial plants. The objectives of this study were: (i) to analyse the effect of light supply on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; (ii) to assess the atmospheric CO2 capture by these microalgae; and (iii) to determine the parameters of the Monod model that describe the influence of irradiance on the growth of the selected microalgae. Both microalgae presented higher growth rates with high irradiance values and discontinuous light supply. The continuous supply of light at the highest irradiance value was not beneficial for C. vulgaris due to photooxidation. Additionally, C. vulgaris achieved the highest CO2 fixation rate with the value of 0.305 g-CO2 L−1 d−1. The parameters of the Monod model demonstrated that C. vulgaris can achieve higher specific growth rates (and higher CO2 fixation rates) if cultivated under higher irradiances than the studied values.

Genes with the highest (P<. 0.05) expression in the mammary gland, liver and adipose tissue were Elovl5 (1333%), Fads2 (490%) and Fasn (6608%), respectively, in a low-lipid diet than in adequate-lipid diet. The percentage of AA in the mammary gland was similar between the low-lipid diet and adequate-lipid diet groups during the second stage of pregnancy and during lactation. The percentage of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids was significantly (P<. 0.05) increased throughout pregnancy and lactation in all tissues in rats fed a low-lipid diet than in rats fed an adequate-lipid diet. Results suggest that maternal metabolic adaptations used to compensate for lipid-deficient diet during pregnancy and lactation include increased expression of genes involved in LC-PUFAs synthesis in a stage- and tissue-specific manner and elevated lipogenic activity (saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis) of maternal tissues including adipose tissue. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Desaturases; Elongases; Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; Pregnancy; Sterol-regulatory element binding factor","complementary DNA; fatty acid synthase; monounsaturated fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; birth; controlled study; energy balance; enzyme activity; fatty acid synthesis; female; food intake; gene expression; gene targeting; lactation; lipid composition; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver; low fat diet; mammary gland; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; upregulation; weight gain; Rattus; Desaturases; Elongases; Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; Pregnancy; Sterol-regulatory element binding factor; Acetyltransferases; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet, Fat-Restricted; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Lactation; Liver; Mammary Glands, Animal; Pregnancy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905749833

The experimental data indicated that these halos originate from single electron events occurring before the electron multiplication in the microchannel plate. By means of electron trajectory simulations, this halo effect is explained to originate from single electron, emitted from the carbon foil, hitting the non-active area of the microchannel plate. This electron creates a secondary electron from the surface and which ends up to the microchannel plate pore, is multiplied and create now a detectable signal.

The transition will require combined backup from conventional sources and storage. A phase transition emerges during the ramp-up of the required amount of storage, with renewable penetration being the control parameter and average relative storage filling level being the order parameter. A singularity appears for the required storage energy capacity at a renewable penetration determined by the parameters of the storage. For an ideal storage with no roundtrip losses the transition occurs at 100% renewable penetration. Moreover, the required storage energy capacity is strongly enhanced by temporal correlations on the synoptic weather time scale.

Biomass is one of the alternative energy resources and agricultural, animal and industrial organic wastes can be treated as biomass feedstock in biomass to energy conversion systems. This study aims to develop an effective supply chain network design model for the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion of biomass. In this regard, a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to determine the most appropriate locations for the biogas plants and biomass storages. Besides the strategic decisions such as determining the numbers, capacities and locations of biogas plants and biomass storages, the biomass supply and product distribution decisions can also be made by this model. Mainly, waste biomass is considered as feedstock to be digested in anaerobic digestion facilities. To explore the viability of the proposed model, computational experiments are performed on a real-world problem.

Artemia cysts may be exposed to repeated hydration/dehydration (H/D) cycles pre-harvesting or during processing and storage. To observe the effect of these cycles on cyst quality, Artemia franciscana cysts were exposed to a comprehensive set of various H/D treatments, differing in the number of cycles (1, 2, or 3) and the duration of the freshwater hydration period (2 or 4 h). Cyst quality was assessed using the criteria of immediate relevance for aquaculture use, such as hatching percentage directly after H/D treatment and after −18 °C storage up to 1 month, longevity of axenically hatched starved nauplii, cyst and naupliar energy content, and (for the most extreme H/D treatment) cyst and naupliar fatty acid and vitamin C content. Repeated H/D cycles resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) decreased cyst hatching, reduced starved naupliar longevity and individual energy content, loss in vitamin C and fatty acid content, and moreover a close correlation between these parameters as a function of progressive H/D treatments.

An efficient implementation of frozen-core analytic gradients for the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) with the density-fitting (DF) approximation (applying to both reference and correlation energies), which is denoted as DF-MP2, is reported. The DF-MP2 method is applied to a set of alkanes, conjugated dienes, and noncovalent interaction complexes to compare the computational cost of single point analytic gradients with MP2 with the resolution of the identity approach (RI-MP2) [F. Weigend and M. Häser, Theor. Chem. Acc. 97, 331 (1997); R. A. Distasio, R. P. Steele, Y. M. Rhee, Y. Shao, and M. Head-Gordon, J. Comput. Chem. 28, 839 (2007)]. In the RI-MP2 method, the DF approach is used only for the correlation energy. Our results demonstrate that the DF-MP2 method substantially accelerate the RI-MP2 method for analytic gradient computations due to the reduced input/output (I/O) time. Because in the DF-MP2 method the DF approach is used for both reference and correlation energies, the storage of 4-index electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) are avoided, 3-index ERI tensors are employed instead. Further, as in case of integrals, our gradient equation is completely avoid construction or storage of the 4-index two-particle density matrix (TPDM), instead we use 2- and 3-index TPDMs. Hence, the I/O bottleneck of a gradient computation is significantly overcome. Therefore, the cost of the generalized-Fock matrix (GFM), TPDM, solution of Z-vector equations, the back transformation of TPDM, and integral derivatives are substantially reduced when the DF approach is used for the entire energy expression. Further application results show that the DF approach introduce negligible errors for closed-shell reaction energies and equilibrium bond lengths. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Computation theory; Ions; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Quantum chemistry; Efficient implementation; Electron repulsion integrals; Equilibrium bond length; Frozen-core approximations; Gradient computation; Non-covalent interaction; Plesset perturbation theory; Post-Hartree-Fock methods; Perturbation techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907974280

Although non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) provide sweet taste without contributing to energy intake, animal studies showed that long-term consumption of NSS, particularly aspartame, starting during the perigestational period may predispose the offspring to develop obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life. In this paper, we review the impact of NNS exposure during the perigestational period on the long-term disease risk of the offspring, with a particular focus on metabolic diseases. Some mechanisms underlying NNS adverse metabolic effects have been proposed, such as an increase in intestinal glucose absorption, alterations in intestinal microbiota, induction of oxidative stress and a dysregulation of appetite and reward responses. The data reviewed herein suggest that NNS consumption by pregnant and lactating women should be looked with particular caution and requires further research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Fetal programming; Metabolic syndrome; Non-nutritive sweeteners; Pregnancy","acesulfame; advantame; aspartame; glucose; neotame; neurotransmitter; nonnutritive sweetener; saccharin; sucralose; unclassified drug; aspartame; nonnutritive sweetener; caloric intake; cognitive defect; exposure; food intake; gestation period; glucose absorption; glucose blood level; high risk population; human; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; lactation; learning disorder; lipid storage; long term exposure; metabolic disorder; multiple sclerosis; neoplasm; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; perinatal period; postnatal exposure; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; progeny; Review; reward; safety; Stevia; taste bud; chemically induced; drug effects; female; lactation; male; metabolic disorder; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Aspartame; Female; Humans; Lactation; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Non-Nutritive Sweeteners; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907525383

It is widely recognized that cAMP signaling via protein kinase A (PKA) is important both in adipogenesis and for hormonal control and lipolysis in WAT. A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) target PKA to distinct subcellular compartments in close proximity to its specific substrates thereby providing spatial and temporal specificity in the mediation of biological effects controlled by the cAMP-PKA pathway.

Box 1000FI-02044 VTT, Finland","The fuel properties of fast pyrolysis bio-oils differ significantly from those of fossil fuels. As transportation fuel, bio-oil is not suitable without upgrading because of its relatively low energy content, high water content, acidity, and poor storage stability. Upgrading of bio-oil has usually been done by treating the whole oil in a reactor. The problem with this treatment is that pyrolysis oil is a mixture of different compound groups, which all need different conditions and catalysts to react in a desirable way. Therefore, an efficient fractionation of bio-oil before upgrading may be a more efficient way of producing liquid fuels than treating the whole oil. In this work, the target was to compare two industrially relevant fractionation concepts. In the first concept, most of the water was removed during liquid recovery by adjusting the scrubber temperature. When the scrubber temperature was increased from 36 to 66 °C, the water content in the bio-oil decreased from 24 to 7 wt %. In the second concept, fast pyrolysis was carried out with wet feedstock. This would reduce the drying cost in the plant. By this means, a spontaneous phase separation was generated after liquid condensation. In the experiments, the moisture content of the raw material was increased up to 25 wt %, but even with this moisture content, the oily bottom phase still contained 22 wt % watersoluble compounds. However, if the target is to produce transportation fuels from bio-oil, fractionation by phase separation is a better concept for dividing the bio-oil into different compound groups. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Biofuels; Fractionation; Fuel oils; Fuel storage; Liquids; Moisture; Moisture determination; Oil shale; Phase separation; Scrubbers; Energy content; Fuel properties; High water content; Liquid condensation; Liquid recoveries; Storage stability; Transportation fuels; Water soluble compounds; Petroleum transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949115811

However, when compared with static random access memories (SRAMs), TCAMs suffer from certain limitations such as low-storage density, relatively slow access time, low scalability, complex circuitry, and higher cost. One fundamental question is that can we utilize SRAM to combine it with additional logic to achieve the TCAM functionality? This paper proposes an efficient memory architecture, called E-TCAM, which emulates the TCAM functionality with SRAM. E-TCAM logically divides the classical TCAM table along columns and rows into hybrid TCAM subtables and then maps them to their corresponding memory blocks. During search operation, the memory blocks are accessed by their corresponding subwords of the input word and a match address is produced. An example design of 512×36 of E-TCAM has been successfully implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5, Virtex-6, and Virtex-7 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). FPGA implementation results show that E-TCAM obtains 33.33 % reduction in block-RAMs, 71.07 % in slice registers, 77.16 % in lookup tables, 53.54 % in energy/bit/search, and offers 63.03 % improvement in speed, compared with the best available SRAM-based TCAM designs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA); Memory architecture; Static random access memory(SRAM)-based TCAM; Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Associative storage; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Logic gates; Memory architecture; Signal receivers; Table lookup; Ternary content adressable memory; Access time; Additional logic; FPGA implementations; Low-storage; Memory blocks; Search operations; Static random access memory; Ternary content addressable memory; Static random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919394790

These include bioactive lipids (including SCFA and conjugated linoleic acid) antimicrobials and exopolysaccharides in addition to nutrients, including vitamins B and K. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and reductions in microbial diversity are highlighted in many disease states, possibly rendering the host susceptible to infection and consequently negatively affecting innate immune function. Evidence is also emerging of microbially produced molecules with neuroactive functions that can have influences across the brain-gut axis. For example, γ-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, catecholamines and acetylcholine may modulate neural signalling within the enteric nervous system, when released in the intestinal lumen and consequently signal brain function and behaviour. Dietary supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics are the most widely used dietary adjuncts to modulate the gut microbiota. Furthermore, evidence is emerging of the interactions between administered microbes and dietary substrates, leading to the production of pharmabiotics, which may directly or indirectly positively influence human health.

This article aims at assessing the Life-Cycle (LC) environmental impacts associated with the use of a battery in an EV and secondly, at assessing the LC environmental impacts/benefits of using a battery, no longer suitable for electric mobility, for energy storage in a household. Three electricity mixes with different shares of renewable, nuclear and fossil energy sources are considered. For the primary battery use, three in-vehicle use scenarios are assessed, addressing three different driving profiles. For the secondary use, two scenarios of energy storage strategies are analyzed: peak shaving and load shifting. Results show that a light use of the battery in the EV has 42-50% less impacts per km than an intensive use. After its use in the vehicle, the battery life can be extended by 1.8-3.3 years; however, this is not always beneficial from an environmental point of view, since the impacts are strongly dependent on the electricity generation mix and on the additional efficiency losses in the battery. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An optimization study using the first and second laws of thermodynamics is also carried out to obtain the energy and exergy efficiencies. The experimental study was conducted, designed, and realized in the Research and Technology Center of Energy (CRTEn) in Tunisia. The experimentally obtained results are used to analyze the performance of the system, based on temperature distribution in different parts of the collectors, absorbed, instantaneous stored and used thermal energy.

The aim of this study is to investigate numerically the airflow behavior through a Solar Chimney. The transport equations that describe the flow, for different geometric tower parameters were modeled and solved numerically using the finite volume method. This methodology allows us a detailed visualization of the effects of some geometrical parameters such as the tower height and tower radius. It has been shown in this work that the dimensions of the tower play an important role in designing of such systems by increasing or decreasing the mass flow rate. Consequently, the hydrodynamic field is directly controlled by varying the tower dimensions.

On top of this, pervasive computing has been improved and technologies have been matured enough to build plug-and-play body area networks (BANs). In a BAN, the main functionality of a node is to effectively and efficiently collect data from vital body parts, share it with the neighbors and make decisions accordingly. Because of the fact that the captured phenomenon is highly sensitive to privacy breaches in addition to being transmitted using the wireless communication medium, BANs require a security infrastructure. However, due to the extreme energy scarcity, bandwidth and storage constraints of the nodes, conventional solutions are inapplicable. In this survey, we present an overview of BANs and provide a detailed investigation into the developed security infrastructures. We examined the literature and combined the corresponding proposals under two major classes: (i) pure-cryptographic security mechanisms and (ii) bio-cryptographic security mechanisms. Pure-cryptographic methods include constructions based on the well-known symmetric or asymmetric cryptography primitives and they are suitable for securing the communication between any two network entities. On the other hand, bio-cryptographic methods benefit from the network's context-awareness and to the best of our knowledge, they have been utilized only for the communication among the biosensors. © 2013 The British Computer Society.

X-ray diffraction characterization shows an increase of ceria lattice parameter for Pr loadings lower than 15 at%, which is consistent with a solid solution formation. X-ray photoelectron spectra indicate a surface enrichment in Pr cations and a diminution of Ce3+ surface concentration as Pr content increases. DFT calculations confirm the preferential reduction of Pr cations due to a single oxygen vacancy formation in Ce-Pr mixed oxides, and also a significant decrease in the energy needed for this O removal compare to that in pure CeO2.

For this purpose heat network analysis is carried out using guided redesign of the technology based on process integration. This results in an improvement in the internal heat exchange consequently minimising the exit exergy and in this way reducing the energy supply. For further efficiency improvement the application of enhanced low-grade heat recovery is proposed using direct phase contact heat exchange and pre-humidification of the boiler combustion air at the expense of waste heat. The application of the method and the resulting potential efficiency improvement is presented. A medium-sized company which produces sliced cooked meats is used as an example. This is a very typical case study for the food industry, represented mainly by Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), which have relatively low energy efficiency due to non-optimisation of the heat network and substantial waste heat and effluent emissions. A substantial energy efficiency improvement is achieved resulting in about 30% heat saving at 12.1% reduced fuel consumption. Further hot water production at 70 °C corresponding to 61% of the original steam production is available without additional fuel consumption, if required. Finally a reduction of 1.9 times effluent and up to 2.7 times NOx gas emissions is estimated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea is to build a ceiling in the form of thick board with parallel internal channels for air flow. It is also important that a ceiling is made of a composite containing about 27% of phase change material (PCM). Such a ceiling would be a part of a building ventilation system - air taken from the environment flows through the channels and exchange heat with the construction material. When a melting point of PCM is properly chosen it is possible that the temperature of air flowing into the building reach a level corresponding to thermal comfort conditions, regardless the temperature at the intake. Warm air (during a day) release the heat basically to PCM causing its melting. During night time cool ambient air is heated up while it takes back heat accumulated in PCM. An experimental set-up based on the above concept was developed. A series of tests in different conditions (inlet air temperature, air flow rate) were performed. Information on thermal performance of the ceiling panel as well as detailed data on heat transfer process were obtained and discussed in the paper. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy, and therefore resources, can be saved at every level of application, from the construction of machinery to the use of transportation fuel, and above all at a systems level considering how different parts and pieces come together to form structures of society. This article addresses the last issue by presenting a model for optimizing the structure and operation of a distributed energy system, or more specifically, a district heating system with its numerous alternatives for production and distribution of heat for a set of widely different consumers.

The time required for complete hydrogen absorption and desorption measured at 250 °C was 500 s and 2500 s, respectively. In order to improve the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics of as synthesized MgH2 powders, three different types of nanocatalysts (metallic Ni, Nb2O5 and (Ni)x/(Nb2O5)y) were utilized with different weight percentages and independently ball milled with the MgH2 powders for 50 h under 50 bar of a hydrogen gas atmosphere. The results showed that the prepared nanocomposite MgH2/5Ni/5Nb2O5 powders possessed superior hydrogenation/dehydrogenation characteristics, indexed by low values of activation energy for β-phase (68 kJ/mol) and γ-phase (74 kJ/mol). This nanocomposite system showed excellent hydrogenation/dehydrogenization behavior, indexed by the short time required to uptake (41 s) and release (121 s) of 5 wt% H2 at 250 °C. At this temperature the synthesized nanocomposite powders possessed excellent absorption/desorption cyclability of 180 complete cycles.

Compressed gas cylinders are the storage systems closest to the commercialization of hydrogen in vehicles. The safety factors in current standards are seen as restrictive for further growth and competitiveness of hydrogen infrastructure. A probabilistic approach can be employed in order to give a rational background to the safety factors. However, an acceptable probability of failure needs to be estimated before calculating the safety factors. The discussion of determining the acceptable probability must include the mass of hydrogen since this determines the consequences of an accident. It is concluded that an annual probability of failure of 10-7 would be appropriate for small pressure vessels containing a few kilograms of hydrogen. Larger pressure vessels of a few hundred kilograms or more should be designed for an annual probability 10-8. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The MWCNTs surface functionalization was carried out by silanization of methacryloxy or vinyl-based silanes. The nanocomposites were prepared using solvent mixing which enhanced distribution and dispersion of the MWCNTs in the high-viscosity silicone matrix. The quality of dispersion was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicating good dispersion state. It was found that the optimal concentration of both treated and untreated MWCNTs in the nanocomposites was 1 wt.%. Above this threshold value, the nanocomposites properties were reduced. Furthermore, the silane treatment of the MWCNTs was proven to be an effective process that resulted in a significant increase in the nanocomposites properties compared to the neat polymer, leading to higher storage modulus simultaneously with up to 27% improvement in the tensile strength and elongation, 20-30% reduction in the thermal expansion coefficient, 220-300% enhancement in crystallinity (enthalpy of fusion), and up to 56% improvement in the lap shear strength. SEM analysis indicated that significant changes in the fracture morphologies occurred due to higher energy absorption in the case of silane-treated MWCNTs. It was concluded that incorporation of silane-treated MWCNTs is an effective route to reinforce and increase the toughness of silicone-based adhesives. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","adhesive; carbon nanotubes; shear strength; silane; Silicone; surface treatment","Adhesives; Carbon nanotubes; Dispersions; Nanocomposites; Quality control; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear strength; Silicones; Surface treatment; Tensile strength; Adhesion properties; Enthalpy of fusion; Fracture morphology; Optimal concentration; Silicone adhesives; Strength and elongations; Surface Functionalization; Thermal expansion coefficients; Silanes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902544318

TAM-induced liver injury remains a major concern, as TAM causes hepatic steatosis in a significant number of patients, which can progress toward steatohepatitis. Liver toxicity is generally believed to involve mitochondrial dysfunction and TAM exerts multiple deleterious effects on mitochondria, which may account for the hepatotoxicity observed in patients treated with TAM. Endoxifen (EDX), a key active metabolite of TAM that is being investigated as an alternative to TAM in breast cancer therapy, slightly affects mitochondria in comparison with TAM and this demonstration well correlates with the absence of alterations in the clinical parameters of individuals taking EDX. The steady-state plasma concentrations of TAM and its active metabolites EDX and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHTAM) in patients taking TAM are highly variable, reflecting genetic variants of CYP2D6 involved in TAM metabolism. Besides de genetic polymorphisms, the intake of drugs that influence the enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 compromises the therapeutic efficiency of TAM. The knowledge of the impact of the variability of TAM metabolism in the breast cancer treatment explains the discrepant outcomes observed in patients taking TAM, as well as the individual variability of idiosyncratic liver injury and other sides effects observed. Therefore, and contrarily to the clinical use of EDX, the need of therapeutic drug monitoring and a regular assessment of liver function biomarkers should be considered in patients under therapies with TAM. In this review we focus on the mitochondrial effects of TAM and its metabolites and on the role played by mitochondria in the initiating events leading to TAM-induced hepatotoxicity, as well as the clinical implications. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Endoxifen; Hepatotoxicity; Mitochondria; Tamoxifen","adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; cytochrome c; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 2D6; endoxifen; estrogen receptor alpha; heme; long chain fatty acid; mitochondrial DNA; phosphate transporter; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); steroid; succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); tamoxifen; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; bioenergy; breast cancer; cell death; conformational transition; cytoplasm; drug blood level; drug metabolism; drug monitoring; electron transport; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; erythrocyte membrane; fatty acid oxidation; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; gluconeogenesis; glucuronidation; glycolysis; hemolytic anemia; human; in vitro study; lipid metabolism; lipid peroxidation; lipid storage; liver cell; liver injury; liver mitochondrion; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrial permeability; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion swelling; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; prostate cancer; respiratory chain; review; steady state; toxic hepatitis; Endoxifen; Hepatotoxicity; Mitochondria; Tamoxifen; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Drug-Induced Liver Injury; Humans; Mitochondria, Liver; Tamoxifen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902357447

Well-defined starch granules in the raw bean pastes were observed, whereas a gelatinized starch paste was observed for the canned bean pastes. The DSC analysis showed that the raw bean pastes had lower onset peak temperatures (79 °C, 79.1 °C) and gelatinization enthalpy (1.940 J/g), compared to that precooked bean pastes (70.4 °C, 75.7 °C and 1.314 J/g, respectively) thermal characteristics. Moreover, the dynamic rheological results showed a gel-like behavior for the canned bean pastes, where the storage modulus (G′) was frequency independent and was higher than the loss modulus (G″). The non-linear rheological results exhibited a shear-thinning flow behavior, where the steady shear-viscosity was temperature and fat content dependent. For canned bean pastes, the shear-viscosity data followed a power law equation, where the power law index (n) decreased when the temperature and the fat content increased. The temperature effect on the shear-viscosity was described by an Arrhenius equation, where the activation energy (Ea) was in the range from 19.04 to 36.81 KJ/mol. This rheological behavior was caused by gelatinization of the starch during the cooking and sterilization processes, where starch-lipids and starch-proteins complex were formed. © 2012, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).","Canned bean pastes (Phaseolus vulgaris L.); Fat content; Morphology; Rheology; Temperature","Activation energy; Differential scanning calorimetry; Digital storage; Gelation; Morphology; Physicochemical properties; Rheology; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear thinning; Starch; Temperature; Activation energies (Ea); Fat contents; Frequency independent; Phaseolus vulgaris; Rheological behaviors; Steady shear viscosity; Sterilization process; Thermal characteristics; Shear flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920706312

An online monitoring and load demand information can provide the user with reliable and constant electric power. Practically, consumer load demand always varies frequently and unpredictably. Therefore smart energy dispatch unit is required to distribute the energy to consumers and meet their demand depending on the energy available and charging condition.

The effects of apple storage during 6 months on basic parameters such as dry weight, total soluble solids and titratable acidity, composition of phenolics, antioxidant activity and sensory evaluation were studied to evaluate the potential applicability of long-time stored apples for consumption and processing. Long-time storage of apples resulted in a higher dry matter but decreases total soluble solids and titratable acidity in all examined cultivars (cv.) of apples. The total phenolics determined by HPLC in fresh apples ranged from 1,243 mg in ‘Idared’ cv. to 1,435 mg/kg in ‘Shampion’ cv. During storage, the decrease of polyphenolic content has been observed, in ‘Shampion’ cv., it was higher than in ‘Idared’ cv. Similar effects were observed for antioxidant activity. Comparing quality of fruits just after harvest, it was found that cultivar affects most of the investigated sensory attributes with the exception of ripe apple smell, crispness, crunchiness and the overall texture score. In general, ‘Shampion’ cv. apples got higher ranks for sweetness, taste and the overall quality, whereas ‘Idared’ cv. were perceived as sourer, which is in arrangement with instrumental measurements. The results of presented study demonstrate that apples after storage, especially ‘Shampion’ cv., can be a valuable sensory attributes for food product and consumption.

Consequently, it is important to ensure redundancy and enough energy capacity in order to support possible increments in load consumption. This is achieved by means of expansion of the energy storage system by adding extra distributed energy storage units. However, using distributed energy storage units adds more challenges in microgrids control, since stored energy should be balanced in order to avoid deep discharge or over-charge in one of the energy storage units. Typically, voltage droop loops are used for interconnecting several different units in parallel to a microgrid. This paper proposes a new decentralized strategy based on fuzzy logic that ensures stored energy balance for a low voltage dc microgrid with distributed battery energy storage systems by modifying the virtual resistances of the droop controllers in accordance with the state of charge of each energy storage unit. Additionally, the virtual resistance is adjusted in order to reduce the voltage deviation at the common dc bus. The units are self-controlled by using local variables only, hence, the microgrid can operate without relying on communication systems. Hardware in the loop results show the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Cooperative control; dc microgrids; droop control; fuzzy logic","Co-operative control; Distributed generation and storage; Droop control; Micro grid; Fuzzy logic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907508839

In addition to the precise knowledge of the edge energy of the luminosity spectrum, it is even more important to have a way to calibrate the absolute energy scale of the detector. At first sight, Compton scattering itself provides a unique way to determine the beam energies and produce particles of known energies that could be used for detector calibration. The energy scale is given by the electron mass me and laser photon energy ω0.

Initially, the holistic model of the entire system is achieved, including the PMSG, the uncontrolled rectifier, the buck converter and the storage system. The power absorbed by the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed WT and energy storage systems, subject to TS-fuzzy control. The main purpose is to supply 230-V/50-Hz through a three-phase inverter. The performance of the proposed system is compared with the system without storage system. Moreover, the proposed system performance with the TS-fuzzy control is compared with the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

Load voltage is boosted to 1.9 V, stored across a 240-pF on-chip capacitor, and let drop by 0.6 V to release 230-pJ energy for transmitting a 16-bit codeword in each beacon interval. The measured value of beacon interval is 2.7 s at the lower limit 20 μW/cm2of indoor irradiance, and 25.6 ms at the higher limit 2 mW/cm2. The electrical power consumed in the entire system varies from less than 2 nW to 250 nW between these limits. Duty cycle of transmission is relatively insensitive to irradiance, and remains below 0.2% over the entire range. Storage-capacitor and converter footprints are 0.07 mm2and 0.35 mm2, respectively. Upgrading to 64-b codeword and 920-nJ transmission energy quadruples the footprint of the capacitor and triples that of the converters. © 2014 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; photovoltaic converter; radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag; sensor node","Sensor nodes; On chips; Photovoltaic converter; Photovoltaic energy harvesting; Energy harvesting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907226051

CopyrightObjective: The main objective of this study was to compare the degree of agreement between VAT measurements by a new dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) application and one of the standard methods, CT, in a population of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) before and after GH treatment. Furthermore, we tested whether VAT estimations by these two methods are equivalent in assessing the metabolic risk in this population.Design and Patients: Data from the Norwegian population of a multicenter study in adults with genetically proven PWS were used. Subjects with complete anthropometry, biochemical, and imagistic measurements at all study visits (baseline and after 12 and 24 months of GH treatment) (n= 14, six men) were included. VAT was quantified both using CT scans (GE Lightspeed 16 Pro) of the abdomen at L2-L3 level and a total body DXA scan (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy).Results: VATDXAwas strongly associated with VAT CT at baseline (r=0.97) and after 12 (r=0.90) and 24 months (r=0.89) ofGHtreatment (all P<.001).Wefound moderate to strong positive correlations between VAT by both methods, and blood pressure, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glucose metabolism, and other fat depots (arms, legs, android, trunk, total body) but no association with age, gender, blood lipids, and IGF-I. Adiponectin was negatively associated with the amount of VAT. At baseline, the highest correlation with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was found for VAT DXA (r = 0.76, P = .001) and VAT CT (r = 0.75, P = .002), respectively.Conclusion: VAT can be accurately estimated by DXA, in patients with PWS, and might contribute to the assessment of the metabolic risk. © 2014 by the Endocrine Society.",,"adipocytokine; growth hormone; leptin; lipid; somatomedin C; adipocytokine; glucose blood level; human growth hormone; adult; Article; blood pressure; body fat distribution; body mass; body weight; cardiometabolic risk; clinical article; clinical trial (topic); computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; correlational study; densitometer; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; glucose metabolism; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; hormonal therapy; human; imaging software; insulin release; insulin resistance; intermethod comparison; intraabdominal fat; lipid storage; male; measurement accuracy; metabolic parameters; multicenter study (topic); Norwegian (people); Prader Willi syndrome; risk assessment; subcutaneous fat; waist circumference; blood; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; double blind procedure; glucose blood level; intraabdominal fat; metabolism; multicenter study; photon absorptiometry; Prader-Willi Syndrome; procedures; radiography; reproducibility; standard; standards; validation study; young adult; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adipokines; Adult; Blood Glucose; Double-Blind Method; Female; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Prader-Willi Syndrome; Reference Standards; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Adjustment; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907203417

Feasible miniaturized microwatts energy sources include photovoltaic cell, piezoelectric harvester and thermoelectric generator. A digital logic based shunt regulator with 1 V clamping output is first designed using multi-threshold transistors to minimize static leakage current. Three shunt regulator blocks on separate dies are subsequently paired up with the series-stacked storage capacitors to increase the system output voltage to 3 V. The stacked shunt regulators not only provide voltage regulation and over-voltage protection, but also balance each individual storage capacitor to improve system reliability. By using the mirroring property of pulse transformer-based boost converter and one additional storage capacitor, the system is capable of generating bipolar ± 3 V output voltage at minimum input voltage of 86 mV (boost conversion ratio up to 70) and input power of 26 μW only. The increased supply voltage headroom is desirable for sensitive and high power blocks i.e., sensors, analog and radio-frequency circuits in terms of achieving better analog-to-digital-converter resolution, amplifier gain and linearity. The remaining branches of the stacked capacitors simultaneously provide 2 V and 1 V outputs which can be used by ultra-low power digital blocks of less supply voltage sensitive.

This modification of behaviour of the house must rely on a conjugation of technologies (on-site generation, demand-side management, demand response, etc.) but, in general, the literature mentions storage as the ultimate response to conjugate generation, demand and grid interaction. In this context, the impact of in-house energy storage capacity deserves to be properly analysed. This work focuses on the analysis of electricity storage inside the house and its influence on the grid interaction, ensuring the demand satisfaction. First the typical demand and generation profiles are analysed to characterise the need for storage. Different roles for the storage utilisation are analysed with the objective of optimising self-consumption and mitigating the peak power flows from and to the grid. For the given storage roles, the benefits are evaluated from a local and grid global perspective. The analysis is done using data from real profiles of demand and generation, as well as by simulating the existence of storage. The simulated storage capacity in this analysis has resulted in significant improvements in the residential energy management.

Resorcinol was used as carbon precursor and hexamethylenetetramine as a source of formaldehyde and ammonia to respectively cross-link the framework and regulate the pH. The temperature of the heat treatment leading to the formation of the solid polymer was shown to have a strong influence on the structural and textural parameters. In particular, moderate temperatures led to the coexistence of differently-sized entangled hexagonal mesostructures, whereas the higher temperatures led to a sharp decrease in the mesopore volume. The performance of these materials as anode materials for Li-ion batteries has been investigated in detail. Although these OMC show reversible capacities similar to those reported for hard carbons, their long-term cycling remains very stable for over 100 cycles of charge/discharge.

To perform this examination, real-time operating data from the buses were collected on the Campus-Return route of the Sakarya Municipality. The main characteristics examined were the traction, braking, engine, engine generator unit (EGU), motor/generator (M/G), and ultracapacitor (Ucap) energies and efficiencies of the buses.The route elevation profile and the frequency of stop-and-go operations of the buses were found to have dramatic impacts on the braking and traction energies of the buses. The declining profile of the Campus-Return route provided an excellent opportunity for energy recovery by the regenerative braking system of the HEB. However, owing to the limits on the capacities and efficiencies of the hybrid drive train components and the Ucap, the bus braking energies were not recovered completely. Braking energies as high as 2.2. kW. h per micro-trip were observed, but less than 1. kW. h of braking energy per micro-trip was converted to electricity by the M/G; the rest of the braking energy was wasted in frictional braking. The maximum energy recovered and stored in the Ucap per micro-trip was 0.5. kW. h, but the amount of energy recovered and stored per micro-trip was typically less than 0.2. kW. h for the entire route. The cumulative braking energy recovered and stored in the Ucap for the Campus-Return route was 52% of the available brake energy, which was 13.02. kW. h. Consequently, the round-trip efficiency of the regenerative braking system, between the wheels and Ucap, was determined to be 27%. Finally, although the brake engine energy (BEE) of the CB was 1.18 times higher than its positive traction energy (PTE), the BEE of the HEB was only 1.07 times higher than its PTE. In fact, it is normal to expect the BEE to be higher than the PTE owing to power train losses, but the energy recovered by the regenerative braking system was found to cover most of the power train losses and even improve the energy efficiency of the HEB. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Braking energy; Energy efficiency; Hybrid bus; Real-world driving; Regenerative braking; Traction energy","AC generator motors; Brakes; Buses; Digital storage; Electric generators; Engines; Hybrid vehicles; Recovery; Regenerative braking; Braking energy; Hybrid bus; Hybrid drive train; Hybrid electric bus; Hybrid electric city bus; Operating characteristics; Real-world drivings; Regenerative braking systems; Energy efficiency; bus transport; electric vehicle; energy dissipation; energy efficiency; friction; urban transport; Sakarya; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907220810

The necessary functionalities for the energy processes (e.g. energy conversion or energy storage) are achieved through organizing these materials into complex nanostructures combined with supporting substances to complete these processes. Key functionalities accomplished in this way often include charge transfer processes. The stability of the nano-energy devices is a key factor affecting both their technical and economic viability. In this paper we discuss procedures for identifying degradation phenomena in nano-energy devices and present results from stability studies of metal oxide-based nanomaterials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and ceramic fuel cells (CFC) relevant to microelectronics. DSSC stability study is based on TiO2 nanostructure and CFC is based on samarium doped ceria (SDC)/carbonate nanocomposite. Analyses included morphological and electrochemical characterization. Degradation had a major impact on the charge transfer processes and on the overall energy conversion efficiency through the material interfaces. As DSSC and SDC-nanocomposite fuel cell are electrochemical devices, ion mobility linked to side reactions that weakens the original redox-reactions were found, in particular through the electrolyte, but also on material interfaces (e.g. electrode-electrolyte, core-shell particle interface) where catalytic activity is an important performance enhancing factor.

Herein we describe the synthesis of complex branched nanocages of copper hydroxide with an alternating stacked morphology. The size of the nanocages' core and the length of the branches can be controlled by the temperature and ratio of surfactant used, varying the length from 85 to 232 nm long, and varying the core size from 240 to 19 nm. The nanostructures' unique morphology forms by controlling the growth of an initial spherical seed, and the crystallization of the anisotropic arms. The Cu(OH)2 nanostructures can be converted to polycrystalline CuO branched nanocages and Cu2O nanoframes. We show that the branched nanocage morphology of CuO has markedly superior catalytic properties to previous reports with CuO nanomaterials, resulting in a rapid and efficient catalyst for C-S coupling. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Copper; Morphology; Nanostructures; Catalytic properties; Copper hydroxide; CuO nanomaterials; Efficient catalysts; Oxide nanostructures; Polycrystalline; Stacked morphology; Unique morphologies; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906535843

The Ti atom prefers to bind at the hollow site of the hexagonal ring. The average adsorption energies corrected for dispersion forces are -0.54 and -0.39 eV per hydrogen molecule. With no metal clustering, the system gravimetric capacities are expected to be as large as 9.31 and 11.01 wt%. The hydrogen storage reactions are characterized in terms of simulated infrared spectra, projected densities of states, kinetics, and statistical thermodynamics. The free energies and enthalpies of the Ti functionalized carbon nanocone meet the ultimate targets of the Department of Energy for all temperatures and pressures. The closest reactions to zero free energy occur at 378.15 K/2.961 atm for carbon nanocones and 233.15 K/2.961 atm for carbon nanocone sheets. The translational component is found to exert a dominant effect on the total entropy change with temperature. More promising thermodynamics are assigned to the hydrogenation of Ti functionalized carbon nanocone sheets at 233.15 K. As the temperature is increased, the lifetimes of the hydrogen molecules adsorbed at the surface drop and the rate constants increase. At fixed pressure, the rate constants of hydrogenation of Ti functionalized carbon nanocones are smaller than those of Ti functionalized carbon nanocone sheets, while the lifetimes are greater. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906536120

So far known materials, e.g. Mg(NH3)6Cl2 and Sr(NH3)8Cl2, are not suitable for automotive, fuel cell applications, because the release of ammonia is a multi-step reaction, requiring too much heat to be supplied, making the total efficiency lower. Here, we apply density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict new mixed metal halide ammines with improved storage capacities and the ability to release the stored ammonia in one step, at temperatures suitable for system integration with polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). We use genetic algorithms (GAs) to search for materials containing up to three different metals (alkaline-earth, 3d and 4d) and two different halides (Cl, Br and I) - almost 27 000 combinations, and have identified novel mixtures, with significantly improved storage capacities. The size of the search space and the chosen fitness function make it possible to verify that the found candidates are the best possible candidates in the search space, proving that the GA implementation is ideal for this kind of computational materials design, requiring calculations on less than two percent of the candidates to identify the global optimum. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,"ammonia; halogen; magnesium; algorithm; chemistry; power supply; quantum theory; temperature; Algorithms; Ammonia; Electric Power Supplies; Halogens; Magnesium; Quantum Theory; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906536083

The system with the optimum tack according to the Dahlquist criterion (HPC/PG = 85/15 wt.%) was chosen based on its rheological properties (viscosity, storage and loss moduli at 20 and 50°C). Tack measurements were carried out for this system. Rheological measurements revealed the presence of the critical stress detected by the abrupt drop of viscosity. The adhesive behavior of the system deviates significantly from one of the conventional pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs): almost no tack is observed when using contact force and contact time typical for a PSA. To achieve good adhesion with this system one needs substantially higher pressure and contact time. At 20°C, adhesive failure is observed in most cases and high contact forces (over 500-600 g) are required to overcome critical stress and obtain noticeable tack characteristics. At 50°C, fibrillation and cohesive failure are usually observed with some residue of the system on the probe after debonding. Usage of high contact forces (600-1000 g) and contact times (up to 1000 s) allows us to reach significant values of the maximum debonding stress (up to 1.25 MPa) and energy (up to 420 J/m2). These values are on the same level or even higher than the corresponding values for standard PSAs. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.","adhesion; contact time; liquid crystalline polymers; pressure-sensitive adhesives; probe tack","Adhesion; Cellulose; Crystalline materials; Debonding; Liquid crystal polymers; Polyols; Probes; Rheology; Viscosity; Adhesive properties; Contact time; Liquid crystalline; Pressure-sensitive adhesives; Probe tacks; Rheological measurements; Rheological property; Storage and loss modulus; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900019610

However, the energy demand for cooling can be efficiently reduced by low-exergy free-cooling systems, which use natural processes, like evaporative cooling or the environmental cold of ambient air during night-time ventilation for the cooling of buildings. Unlike mechanical cooling systems, the energy for the operation of free-cooling system is needed only for the transport of the cold from the environment into the building. Because the natural cold potential is time dependent, the efficiency of free-cooling systems could be improved by introducing a weather forecast into the algorithm for the controlling. In the article, a numerical algorithm for the optimization of the operation of free-cooling systems with night-time ventilation is presented and validated on a test cell with different thermal storage capacities and during different ambient conditions. As a case study, the advantage of weather-predicted controlling is presented for a summer week for typical office room. The results show the necessity of the weather-predicted controlling of free-cooling ventilation systems for achieving the highest overall energy efficiency of such systems in comparison to mechanical cooling, better indoor comfort conditions and a decrease in the primary energy needed for cooling of the buildings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Experimental validation of numerical model; Free cooling; Numerical modelling; Thermal response of the buildings; Weather forecast","Buildings; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Heat storage; Numerical models; Thermoelectric equipment; Ventilation; Weather forecasting; Cooling of buildings; Experimental validations; Free cooling; Free-cooling systems; Night-time ventilation; Numerical algorithms; Overall energy efficiency; Thermal response; Evaporative cooling systems; algorithm; climate change; cooling; energy efficiency; indoor air; parameterization; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906101695

The single crystal elastic constants for the intermetallic FeTi and its hydrides FeTiH and FeTiH2 are successfully obtained from the stress-strain relationship calculations and the strain energy-strain curves calculations, respectively. The shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and shear anisotropic factors are also calculated. The bulk moduli derived from the elastic constants calculations of the cubic FeTi, orthorhombic P2221 FeTiH and Cmmm FeTiH2 are calculated. For cubic FeTi compound, the bulk modulus is in a good agreement with both theoretical results and experimental data available in the literature. More importantly, it is found that, the insertion of hydrogen into the FeTi crystal structure causes an increase in the bulk modulus.

The results have shown that a single stable phase of β-MgH2 is obtained upon RBM for 25 h. Increasing the RBM time leads to a significant decreasing on the grain size and an increase in the iron contamination that were introduced to the powders upon using hard steel milling tools. Remarkable changes in the transformed mass fractions of β-MgH2 phase to a metastable γ-MgH2 phase with increasing the RBM time could be detected. Cyclic β-γ-β phase transformations were observed several times upon changing the RBM time. After 200 h of RBM time, the decomposition temperature and activation energy were recorded to be 399 °C and 131 kJ/mol, respectively. Moreover, the times required for complete absorption and desorption of 7 wt.% of hydrogen at 250 °C were recorded to be 3140 s and 35,207 s under 10 and 0 bar, respectively. At 300 °C, the powders that were obtained upon RBM time for 200 h possess excellent hydrogenation properties for any pure MgH2 system, indexed by high hydrogen storage capacity (7.54 wt.%) with complete 600 absorption/desorption cycles. Improvements of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics are attributed to the presence of γ-phase, the existence of Fe contamination and the nanocrystallinity of the ball milled powders. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Self-aggregation dramatically changes the values of the rate and equilibrium constants of a network. The equilibrium constant (Ka) increases and the hydration (Kh) and global (Ka') constants decrease with increasing anthocyanin concentration. The hydration rate constant (kh) decreases as the dehydration rate constant (k-h) increases. Evidence for the formation of flavylium cation dimers aggregating according to a left-handed helix has been obtained from circular dichroism, while indirect evidence for a stronger aggregation in quinoidal base than in flavylium cation has been found. The chapter discusses the photochromism of synthetic flavylium compounds lacking or possessing a high cis-trans isomerization barrier; in the latter case, the system illustrates the concept of an optical memory capable of write-lock-read-unlock-erase. Extended conjugation in flavylium-derived compounds such as styryl-1-benzopyrylium and naphtoflavylium permits access to photochromic systems that present new switching colors.

Such an application requires disseminating a large amount of data within the WSN. This data includes, but is not limited to, the object's location and the environment conditions at that location. WSNs require efficient data processing and dissemination processes due to the limited storage, processing power, and energy available in the WSN nodes. The aim of this paper is to propose a data processing technique that can work under constrained storage, processing, and energy resource conditions. The proposed technique utilizes the lifting procedure in processing the disseminated data. Lifting is usually used in discrete wavelet transform (DWT) operations. The proposed technique is referred to as LiftingWiSe, which stands for Lifting-based efficient data processing technique for Wireless Sensor Networks.

Alexandrou Street, Patras, 263 34, Greece","Estimation of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits' behavior, in terms of analysis and computation of their dynamic characteristics (such as propagation delay, transition time, and energy dissipation) is today a standard part of digital circuit design. Since these characteristics are critical design parameters in CMOS digital circuits, much effort has to be devoted for the extraction of accurate, analytical expressions for primitive circuits. Using transistor-level simulators with continuous-time modeling of the devices such as SPICE can be very expensive in terms of storage and computation time. Hence, much of the research has addressed the development of analytical timing and energy dissipation models, without the necessity of expensive numerical iterations. This chapter mainly regards the methodology for the derivation of closed-form, accurate expressions for the aforementioned parameters. The operational conditions of primitive CMOS structures are determined and the differential equations describing their operation are solved analytically by using appropriate approximations in order to simplify the modeling procedure, without significant influence in the accuracy. As a case study, the CMOS inverter is used. Following a detailed analysis of the inverter operation, accurate expressions for its output response are derived for the different operation regions, and based on this analysis, analytical expressions for the calculation of the timing and energy parameters can be produced. The derived models account for the influences of input voltage transition time, device sizes, parasitic capacitances, output load, as well as small-geometry device effects. The inverter model can be extended to multi-input CMOS gates by using reduction techniques of series-connected and parallel-connected transistors. Since the accuracy of the used MOSFET device I-V model determines the accuracy of primitive circuits' timing and energy models to a large extent, accurate and compact device models that take into account the influences of predominant effects in modern nanometer device technologies should be adopted. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Archaeological bronze artefacts often are stored or displayed in uncontrolled conditions and may suffer from dangerous active corrosion processes that can lead to their destruction. The most dangerous form of archaeological bronze degradation is due to a cyclic reaction that involves copper from the pure alloy and chlorine as a pathogenic agent. A protection treatment can be used to protect them from the corrosion environment and stabilise them to avoid further degradation during exhibition or storage. Starting from its initial assessment as a corrosion inhibitor for pure copper, nowadays benzotriazole (BTA) is in widespread use for the conservation of copper-based artefacts, but unfortunately, BTA is toxic and a suspected carcinogen. The development of new and safe protection systems would offer a choice of alternative products to conservation-restoration professionals for the effective and safe stabilization and protection of metal artefacts. In this investigation, a new organic compound, namely, MTSNH, was synthesized, characterized and tested as a corrosion inhibitor for Bronze B66 (similar to archaeological bronze) in 3 per cent NaCl solution using potentiodynamic polarization studies and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at room temperature. It has been observed from the corrosion rate that the inhibition efficiency increased with increasing concentration of MTSNH. Potentiodynamic polarisation results revealed that the compound acted as a mixed-type inhibitor. Impedance studies indicated that protection occurs through adsorption of the inhibitor on the metal surface, with important modification to the mechanism of corrosion. Surface analysis was carried out using scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX) techniques to verify the electrochemical results.Design/methodology/approach: The inhibition efficiency of MTSNH is investigated by potentiodynamic polarization, EIS and surface analysis.Findings: The synthesized MTSNH act a good inhibitor in 3 per cent NaCl and inhibition efficiency increases with inhibitor concentration. Polarisation curves showed that the inhibitor is mixed. The EIS measurements showed that the inhibitor acted throughout the formation of film at the bronze surface. The surface analysis confirms this result.Originality/value: The adsorption of the MTSNH on the metal surface can markedly change the corrosion resisting property of metal. Therefore, the study of the relation between adsorption and corrosion inhibiting is of a great importance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corrosion; Electrochemistry; Inhibitors","Adsorption; Bronze; Copper corrosion; Corrosion; Corrosion inhibitors; Corrosion protection; Corrosion rate; Efficiency; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochemistry; Metal analysis; Metals; Polarization; Potentiodynamic polarization; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium chloride; Surface analysis; Corrosion environments; Corrosion inhibition; Design/methodology/approach; Inhibition efficiency; Inhibitor concentration; Mechanism of corrosion; Potentiodynamic polarization studies; Protection of metals; Electrochemical corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907188547

At Jožef Stefan Institute, we constructed a linear TOF spectrometer and mount it to our multipurpose nuclear microprobe. A beam of 8 MeV 35Cl7+ could be focused to a diameter of better than 3 μm × 3 μm and pulsed by electrostatic deflection at the high-energy side of accelerator. TOF mass spectrometer incorporates an 1 m long drift tube and a double stack microchannel plate (MCP) as a stop detector positioned at the end of the drift path. Secondary ions are focused at MCP using electrostatic cylindrical einzel lens. Time of flight spectra are currently acquired with a single-hit time-to-digital converter. Pulsed ion beam produces a shower of secondary ions that are ejected from positively biased target and accelerated towards MCP. We start our time measurement simultaneously with the start of the beam pulse. Signal of the first ion hitting MCP is used to stop the time measurement. Standard pulses proportional to the time of flight are produced with time to analog converter (TAC) and fed into analog-to-digital converter to obtain a time histogram. To enable efficient detection of desorbed fragments with higher molecular masses, which are of particular interest, we recently implemented a state-of art Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based multi-hit TOF acquisition. To test the system we used focused 8 MeV 35Cl 7+ ion beam with pulse length of 180 ns. Mass resolution of measured SIMS spectra, dominantly determined by the duration of the beam pulse, is in good agreement with resolution estimated from pulse length. With improved high-voltage switching ability that will enable beam pulses with duration of 50 ns, a mass resolution of better than 500 is anticipated. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The dynamic states in the power grid-deep voltage sags and swells-might cause faults and defects in sensitive loads. This paper deals with a three-phase hybrid transformer (HT) without dc energy storage to compensate voltage sags and swells and to protect sensitive loads against the rapid and extensive changes in supply voltage amplitude. The analyzed HT contains two main units: the first one is the conventional electromagnetic transformer, realizing an electromagnetic coupling, and the second one is the buck-boost matrix-reactance chopper, realizing an electrical coupling in the HT unit. In the presented solution, output voltage is transformed in two ways-electromagnetically and electrically. This paper presents an operational description, the theoretical analysis, and the experimental test results from a 2-kVA laboratory model. On the basis of the authors' research, it can be stated that the HT makes it possible to compensate deep voltage sags (deeper than 50% of nominal source voltage) and overvoltages (up to 140% of nominal source voltage) while maintaining good dynamic properties. The main advantages of the proposed solution, in comparison to other conventional solutions, are the ability to control the output voltage in the range of 0.66-3.5 US, good dynamics (transient state during source voltage uS amplitude change is shorter than 10 ms), and galvanic separation between source and load (such as in the case of the conventional electromagnetic transformer). © 2013 IEEE.","AC chopper; ac voltage stabilizer; ac-ac power conversion; power quality; voltage control","DC transformers; Electric autotransformers; Electromagnetism; Power converters; Power quality; Voltage control; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Ac voltage stabilizer; AC-AC power conversion; AC-chopper; Electro-magnetic transformers; Galvanic separations; Matrix-reactance chopper; Operational description; Voltage sags and swells; Source separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894530506

A new model based in the Ginstling-Brounshtein diffusion equation was proposed for the hydrogen absorption kinetics. It adds the contribution of the pressure of the gaseous phase and the enthalpy of reaction to the previously mentioned diffusive model. An activation energy for the process was estimated and the value obtained (112 kJ/mol) was concordant with previous values reported in the literature.

These hydroxide nanosheets formed stable aqueous dispersions. The thickness of a nanosheet was estimated to be approximately 1 nm by atomic force microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering experiments, and corresponds to a single hydroxide layer. Some of the Co2+ cations were oxidised by oxygen, resulting in a mixed Co2+0.76Co3+0.24 layer composition. Upon water evaporation, the nanosheets restacked to form transparent self-standing films with a layered structure like that of the original material. The coverage of the surface with side-by-side stacks of nanosheets indicated two-dimensional agglomeration and suggested that these dispersions could be applied to prepare large monolayers of nanosheets. The layers prepared by spin-coating were stable and featured reversible and reproducible redox properties in an alkaline electrolyte. In an evaluation of their electrochemical performance, the cobalt hydroxide nanosheets exhibited durability and fast charge transfer kinetics during repetitive potential cycling up to 200 mV s-1.

We have calculated the binding energies of Ben, BenHxn and [BeH2]n nanoparticles for a large range of n values. In the limit n → ∞, we have obtained the experimental binding energy of a Be crystal (3.32 eV) with unexpectedly very good agreement (3.26 ± 0.06 eV), and a predicted value of 7.85 eV ± 0.02 eV for the binding energy of the [BeH2] ∞ infinite system. We also predict that the majority of the lowest energy stoichiometric BenH2n nanoparticles are chains or chain-like structures. The tendency towards chain stabilization of BenHxn nanoparticles increases, as x approaches the stoichiometric value x = 2, leading for large values of n, as n → ∞, to polymeric forms of bulk BeH2, which in the past have been considered as the leading forms of solid BeH2. For such 1-dimensional forms of [BeH2]n we have obtained and verified that the binding energy varies exactly proportionally to n-1. The extrapolated desorption energy for such polymeric forms of solid BeH2 is found to be 19 ± 3 kJ mol-1 in juxtaposition to the experimental value of 19 kJ mol-1 for solid BeH2, suggesting that the difference ΔE in cohesive energy between the orthorhombic and polymeric form is very small (ΔE ≈ 3 kJ mol-1). This is in full accord with the early discrepancies in the literature in determining and distinguishing the real crystal structure of solid BeH2.

The conformally coated CoNi0.5LDH/FC electrode showed 1.5 times greater specific capacitance compared to the electrodes prepared by conventional non-conformal (drop casting) method of depositing CoNi0.5LDH powder on the carbon microfibers (1938 Fg-1 vs 1292 Fg-1).

A novel strategy is used to synthesize a non-noble-metal-based electrocatalyst of the OER by finely combining layered FeNi double hydroxide that is catalytically active and electric conducting graphene sheets, taking advantage of the electrostatic attraction between the two positively charged nanosheets. The synergy between the catalytic activity of the double hydroxide and the enhanced electron transport arising from the graphene resulted in superior electrocatalytic properties of the FeNi-GO hybrids for the OER with overpotentials as low as 0.21 V, which was further reduced to 0.195 V after the reduction treatment. Moreover, the turnover frequency at the overpotential of 0.3 V has reached 1 s-1, which is much higher than those previously reported for non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

By using new technologies, like combined heat and power (CHP), growers are trying to control these costs; however, the use of CHP is not always possible for growers with a small production area and/or a diverse range of crop types, as is often the case in organic horticulture. A semi-closed greenhouse with a gas absorption heat pump (GAHP) and short- and long-term energy storage might be a better solution for small scale companies. For the purpose of this experiment, we used an insulated six-compartment greenhouse (1,250m2) with three gas absorption heat pumps for a total heat capacity of 120 kW and a coefficient of performance (COP) of 130-170%. In this system, the CO2 released by gas combustion was available for use in the greenhouses for fertilisation. Cold water produced by the heat pumps was used for dehumidification, thus allowing the greenhouse to remain closed for longer periods and reducing heat and CO2 losses. Cold and warm water were stored for the short term in two 45 m3 water tanks. Excess heat from heat pump operation for CO2 production on sunny days was collected during summer and stored long-term in a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES). In winter, stored heat was used by the heat pump to warm the greenhouse. Two 400m2 compartments were used to identify energy flows during the culture of organic tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) in 2012 and 2013. The crop was planted in January and grown until the end of November. A COP of 140% was measured for the heat pumps. The energy use for the 2012 season was 418.3 kWh m-2. With the COP of the heat pumps included, this resulted in a gas consumption (11.52 kWh m-3 gas) of 25.8 m3 m-2 with an average yield of 41.8 kg m-2. In 2013, energy use was 301.4 kWh m-2. With the COP of the heat pumps included, this resulted in a gas consumption of 18.54 m3 m-2 with an average yield of 36.1 kg m-2.","BTES; Energy efficiency; Organic greenhouse; Semi-closed growing system","Chandipura virus; Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907964267

This paper is devoted to in-depth economic evaluations of pre- and post-combustion Calcium Looping (CaL) configurations for Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants. The poly-generation capability, e.g. hydrogen and power co-generation, is also discussed. The post-combustion CaL option is a gasification power plant in which the flue gases from the gas turbine are treated for CO2 capture in a carbonation-calcination cycle. In pre-combustion CaL option, the Sorbent Enhanced Water Gas Shift (SEWGS) feature is used to produce hydrogen which is used for power generation. As benchmark case, a conventional gasification power plant without carbon capture was considered. Net power output of evaluated cases is in the range of 550-600 MW with more than 95% carbon capture rate. The pre-combustion capture configuration was evaluated also in hydrogen and power co-generation scenario. The evaluations are concentrated for estimation of capital costs, specific investment cost, operational &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, CO2 removal and avoidance costs, electricity costs, sensitivity analysis of technical and economic assumptions on key economic indicators etc. ©2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It was found that the value of parameter n only slightly changes with temperature, indicating the same mechanism of crystallization. Moreover, we found that the activation energies for the crystallization process obtained from the all applied methods are comparable. From the optical measurements, it was possible to estimate the time of the nuclei formation, the nucleation density, sizes of the forming embryos and crystals at each temperature as well as the crystal morphology and habit. Additionally, monitoring the crystallization process by optical microscopy, we observed unexpected corrugations of the sample surface before the nucleation begins.

The United States is producing more oil and natural gas, is generating more electricity from renewables such as wind and solar, and is consuming less petroleum while holding electricity consumption constant. These developments have had substantial economic and energy security benefits, and they are helping to reduce carbon emissions in the energy sector and thereby tackle the challenge posed by climate change. To build on this progress, to foster economic growth, and to protect the planet for future generations, the President has set out an aggressive All-ofthe- Above strategy on energy. Some of the recent trends in the energy sector predate the Administration and stem from technological advances and risktaking by American entrepreneurs and businesses, as well as from government-supported research and other public policies. The All-of-the- Above energy strategy supports these trends through environmentally responsible production of oil and natural gas. In addition, the Administration has advanced the growth of energy sources with low or zero carbon emissions through programs that support wind, solar, other renewables, and nuclear, and has also helped to reduce energy demand by promoting energy efficiency. The Administration is also supporting an ambitious program of carbon capture, utilization and storage for coal and natural gas power plants and for industrial facilities. The All-of-the-Above energy strategy has three key elements: to support economic growth and job creation, to enhance energy security, and to deploy low-carbon energy technologies and lay the foundation for a clean energy future.

Among several long-term preservation processes, freezing is widely recognized as a proven and efficient method for vegetables. Most vegetables require a short heat treatment (blanching) prior to freezing to reduce microbiota and inactivate enzymes responsible for deteriorative reactions. However, detrimental effects occur during this process, such as alterations of plant tissues and consequent texture changes, solubilisation of nutrients in the blanching medium, thermal degradation of nutrients, weight loss and color changes, resulting in quality losses. Therefore, a rigorous balance between enzyme inactivation (correlated to degradation) and minimization of quality losses must be achieved in order to produce the highest final quality of frozen product. The increasing consumers demand for high-quality food standards, have stimulated research on alternative and/or mild processing technologies that extend shelf-life without the detrimental effects caused by severe heating. From an industrial perspective, thermal processes are extremely energy consuming and have high environmental impact. Non-thermal processes, or their combination with less severe heat treatments applied before low-temperature storage, are emergent challenges with potential applications in the food industry. The application of ultraviolet irradiation is an example of such processes. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) occupies a wide band in the non-ionizing region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with a wavelength between 100 and 400 nm. Application of UV-C radiation in the germicidal range (240-260 nm) as a non-thermal food processing technology, by pulses or continuously to food right after thermal processing of frozen vegetables, may improve the process' quality by reducing heat. It is generally claimed that the main parameters influencing sensory and quality changes on food are the dose of UV radiation applied (measured in intensity of flux in J/m2), treatment time, and the distance between the UV source and product. UV-C pre-treatments present a high potential to retain the vegetable quality after freezing process and storage. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The selection of materials that contribute to improve indoor air quality improves significantly the building quality and sustainability. Mortars, because they are one of the most commonly used materials, represent a strong environmental impact in construction. Preparing mortars with new and innovative functionalities, that promote energy savings and increase air quality, help to develop buildings with better environmental performance. However, adding a new functionality comprises the introduction of new additives into the mortar matrix, causing microstructural modifications that influence fresh and hardened state properties. Adding new additives always imply a compromise between functionality and durability. In this chapter, was investigated the introduction of a photocatalytic additive and a phase change material, in single and binary formulations. Latent heat storage, selfcleaning and depolluting properties were studied and the impact of the additives in the mortar final properties was assessed.

ECs show shorter charge/discharge time and higher power density compared to batteries. However, to use ECs as alternatives to batteries, a significant increase in energy density is required. Although critical to the U.S.'s energy future, development of ECs has been hindered by the lack of cost-effective electrode materials that can store more energy. As a cheaper alternative transition metal, manganese (Mn) is abundant and environmentally-friendly. Manganese oxide shows theoretical capacitance of ~ 800 F g-1, which is comparable to that of RuO2. However, owing to low electronic and ionic conductance, manganese oxide powder exhibits much lower specific capacitances. This book discusses studies of charge-storage mechanism of manganese oxide nanomaterials for ECs. It also discusses sustainable electrode materials made from electrospun alkali lignin-based carbon nanofibers for high performacen supercapacitors; new strategies for the improvement of SC energy density by covalent and non-covalent addition of qunones of carbon surfaces; maganese dioxide based SCs; supercapacitors test methods; and hydrogenated barium titanate films and their potential for integrated SCs. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Natural gas is in many places composed of 10-20% CO2, which must be removed before it can be used. This is done at remote gas processing stations, using large towers containing aqueous amine. The aqueous amine is corrosive and must be heated to 140°C to release the CO2. Not only is this process energy-intensive, but the remote locations of the processing stations often mean that there is no convenient way of dealing with the captured CO2, so it is often just vented into the atmosphere, adding to the carbon footprint of gas production. The material can be used at the pressures found at the wellhead, without any further energy input to release the CO2. The captured CO2 can simply be pumped straight back underground into the well for storage or EOR. This will be especially effective offshore, where the footprints of traditional methods that involve scrubbing towers or membranes are too cumbersome. The black powder material is a nanoporous solid of carbon with either nitrogen or sulfur. It is made by heating an inexpensive polymer with a base, such as potassium hydroxide, to 600°C.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954558548

For realizing such energy devices like, electrochemical capacitors, rechargeable batteries, solar cells and fuel cells, and so on, has triggered a scientific race for achieving high energy density and high power density. In this sense, developing advanced electrode materials is at the very heart of modern scientific research. Porous metallic materials e.g., oxides, nitrides, sulfides and carbides of molybdenum (Mo) have been a topic of great interest as electrode material for efficient energy demands. Both oxide and non-oxide of molybdenum have been extensively used in energy storage and conversion devices owing to their crystallinity and porosity resulting in enhanced intercalation and charge storage both in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Additionally, molybdenum-based compounds, with their low cost and diverse structure, possess excellent redox properties owing to the various oxidation states. Molybdenum-based compounds; together with carbon result in composite materials which are used either as positive or negative electrodes. These composites have exhibited promising pseudocapacitive character with good cyclability and long term performance. Recent work in this field suggests that molybdenum based compounds are of significant importance for energy storage and conversion. In this chapter, we present electrode materials essentially containing molybdenum compounds supported on high surface area carbon material applied for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Also emphasis has been given to the physical properties and morphology of such electrode materials. Overall, we demonstrate that by using various molybdenum compounds and composites, efficient electrode materials with optimized performance can be realized for developing the energy storage and conversion devices for the future. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The United States currently has no disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository. NWPA established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) in the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop such a repository, which would be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted DOE's repository site studies to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository to NRC on June 3, 2008. The state of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain project, citing excessive water infiltration, earthquakes, volcanoes, human intrusion, and other technical flaws. The Obama Administration ""has determined that developing the Yucca Mountain repository is not a workable option and the Nation needs a different solution for nuclear waste disposal,"" according to the DOE FY2011 budget justification. As a result, no funding for Yucca Mountain, OCRWM, or NRC licensing was requested or provided for FY2011 or subsequent years. DOE filed a motion with NRC to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010. An NRC licensing board denied DOE's withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, a decision sustained by the NRC commissioners on a tie vote September 9, 2011. Despite that decision, NRC halted further consideration of the license application because of ""budgetary limitations,"" but a federal appeals court on August 13, 2013, ordered NRC to continue the licensing process with previously appropriated funds. After halting the Yucca Mountain project, the Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop an alternative nuclear waste policy. The commission issued its final report on January 26, 2012, recommending that a new, ""single-purpose organization"" be given the authority and resources to promptly begin developing one or more nuclear waste repositories and consolidated storage facilities. The commission recommended a ""consent based"" process for siting nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities and that long-term research, development, and demonstration be conducted on technologies that could provide waste disposal benefits. After OCRWM was dismantled, responsibility for implementing the Administration's nuclear waste policy was given to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy (NE). In January 2013, NE issued a nuclear waste strategy based on the Blue Ribbon Commission recommendations. The strategy calls for a pilot interim storage facility for spent fuel from closed nuclear reactors to open by 2021 and a larger storage facility, possibly at the same site, to open by 2025. A site for a permanent underground waste repository would be selected by 2026, and the repository would open by 2048. DOE requested $60 million for FY2014 to carry out the new waste strategy, an amount approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. However, the House denied funding for the new strategy and provided $25 million for Yucca Mountain instead. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Since an open circuit voltage (OCV) path is not identical for the charge and discharge of the battery cell at different states of charge (SoC) level, the battery cell show the hysteresis effect. Usually, the OCV i.e. voltage with zero current after previous charge is higher than the OCV after discharge at the same SoC level. It embodies the hysteresis of the battery cell. The OCV is principally subjected to previous operating condition and cannot be taken as self-regulating from the operating history. Therefore, an accurate knowledge of the hysteresis of OCV is vital for various applications and battery models. This is because currently Battery Management Systems (BMS) use the well-defined OCV-SoC representative curve for SoC estimation and power prediction. Particularly lithium-ion batteries with iron-phosphate cathode material show a complex OCV behavior including a hysteresis that is dependent on the previous operation i.e. the previous state - charging or discharging. The extent of drawbacks related to hysteresis varies on specific cell chemistry. Batteries exhibiting the hysteresis are susceptible to catastrophes due to failures to estimate the correct SoC or energy content of the battery consequently limiting operation life of the battery pack. Therefore, novel and more cutting-edge hysteresis management strategies are required to be able to prevent securely the energy storage system from ever facing critical circumstances, such as thermal run away, internal short circuit etc. In case of the exchanging between the charging and discharging curves (due to exposure of charge and discharge pulse) makes the SoC estimation problematic since switching from the OCV leads to sudden changes in the output of SoC that physically is not consistent for a battery cell. In this chapter, the characteristics of the OCV in function of relaxation times for different Li-ion chemistries are presented. Moreover, a novel hysteresis compensation structure is introduced based on Kalman filtering and statistical error functions. These combinations are able to meet the high requirements of estimating accurate SoC using open circuit voltage. In addition, the issues of safety and reliability are going to be increased for the integration of the newly established compensation scheme for the hysteresis phenomenon. A hysteresis compensation framework is elaborated in the subsequent sections of this chapter. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Its achieving by means of diplomacy lowers risks of power actions and leads the society to solving science-technical problems. Atomic and hydro-power plants, production and supply of coal, oil and gas for thermoelectric power stations and chemical industry have a big grade of risk to damage the ecological systems and are limited by the nature and political resources of the State. The solar energy and air are not ownership of the State. They don't need production, transportation, work-out and storage. However, direct using solar energy and the energy stored in air is limited by high expenses and low device capacity. Required efficiency of solar energy convertors and direct chemical nitrogen and oxygen binding is not achievable because of low commercial effectiveness of scientific and technical solutions proposed at this moment. Nevertheless, the Sun, air and water are the principal components of energy provision required by the life on the earth. So, this triad of raw materials is the energy priority of the State without dependence on providing with natural energetical resources. The aim and actuality of this book is energy requirement of the State provided with renewable or practically inexhaustible and accessible natural resources. Solar radiation (light), air and water are appearing as working bodies of wind and solar engines, collectors and turbines; they form geothermal and biofuel energy sources. The design solutions raise their efficiency but not indicate its limit. If the solar radiation functions as a warm source and working body, then we can ask: Which cycle is to be made by the solar radiation to exceed maximum efficiency of the heat engine using oil, gas, coil, firewood and water? The authors are solving the problem by inclusion of antenna processes in the working cycle and call attention of the respectful reader to the theory of this solar-heat engine. The photosynthesis of the plant cell also uses the special dye molecules for antenna processes. Comparing theoretical results has allowed proposing the thermodynamic scale of chemical action for the solar radiation which builds a base for comparison of biofuel energy sources. The technology needed for production of bio- and synthetic fuel uses chemical and bioactive stuff at the stage of bio-row processing as well as at the stage of chemical fertilizers' growth. Under nitrogen fertilizers' productions the authors propose replacing the ammonia synthesis (800 K, 350 Bar, catalyst, 30% efficiency) with nitrogen oxygenation and obtaining nitric acid immediately from air and water at sufficiently lower expenses than under ammonia production.

Energy monitoring devices are able to transform the invisible to the visible by providing consumers with a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of their usage patterns. This meaningful boost in knowledge enables consumers to make more informed short- and long-term decisions about their energy use, from highlighting the importance of shutting off lights to showing the value of replacing an old furnace with a new higher efficiency model. Residential energy feedback has growing interest among consumers, utilities, and researchers as a way to save energy, save money, and increase consumer understanding of their home energy use. Providing more detailed information about how-and possibly when-a consumer uses energy in their home can help identify opportunities for energy efficiency upgrades. Though still a relatively young market, residential feedback has focused historically on electricity. The ubiquity of electricity, combined with the potential for utilities to achieve demand response savings and the high number of electric devices in a home, has made it the fuel of focus. Low natural gas prices and a relatively limited set of gas devices in the home have made gas feedback a less compelling option. Yet, given that nearly 43% of energy used in the residential sector in 2010 was natural gas, the lack of development of the gas feedback market is surprising. This project aimed to provide a better understanding of gas feedback by: Reviewing the body of research on electricity feedback to identify parallel lessons that could be drawn for gas Discussing benefits and challenges of different types of feedback as related to gas Examining commercially available feedback options Identifying three gas feedback options that show strong potential and should be the focus of future research and demonstration projects. The large body of literature on residential energy feedback spans the past four decades. From this literature, key variables to designing feedback that can effectively drive energy-saving behaviors have been identified, including frequency, level of granularity, display medium, display design, and consumer targeting, among others. Feedback can be categorized as direct (real time) or indirect (post facto), and existing research has demonstrated that these two types achieve different levels of savings. Direct feedback can achieve whole home energy savings averaging about 5% to 15% while indirect feedback generally yields savings averaging about 4% to 8%.[1, 2] It should be noted that the majority of research pilots have been for a year or less, which means there is a lack of data on how savings may change year-to-year. These savings ranges are also based on largely electric-driven research, though recent data tends to indicate gas savings are somewhat lower. For example, work by large indirect feedback provider Opower indicates enhanced billing can achieve annual gas savings of about 1% to 2% while electricity savings can be 1.5% to 3.5%.[3, 4] Direct feedback is also more costly than indirect feedback as it often requires additional hardware, which plays a strong role in cost effectiveness of each option. A primary direct feedback option is an in-home display (IHD) that can show a variety of information, such as real-time energy use, energy cost for a day or month to date, and historical energy use, among many others. Commercially available IHDs monitor electricity and even water use in some cases, but no options for monitoring gas were identified. The challenge of connecting a gas meter to an IHD is driven by the mechanical nature of most conventional gas meters, the limited roll-out of advanced smart gas meters, modest to no market pull for such a device, and concerns surrounding attaching an electrical monitor to a gas meter. There has been ongoing debate about how critical or not an IHD is to providing effective feedback, and given the challenges faced by an IHD for gas monitoring, it is clear that non-IHD options should be considered. Indirect gas feedback through enhanced billing does not offer consumers information in real time, but does provide significantly more information than a typical utility bill, including neighbor comparisons, tips and recommendations, and normative ratings. Enhanced billing has grown rapidly over the past three years, with estimates that about 5% of U.S. households received these types of comparative reports in 2011.[5] Recent research suggests a paper bill or report is the favored medium for many consumers to monitor their energy use, so providing enhanced billing would leverage this already favored communication channel.[6] While not considered a feedback device in itself, the development of advanced, Internet- connected thermostats presents an early market entry point for residential gas feedback. As the primary control system for space conditioning, which represents the majority of residential gas use, the thermostat is a leverage point for incorporating feedback into the home. Recent efforts have centered on next-generation thermostat designs, as evidenced by the Nest learning thermostat. Given the historical difficulties with understanding how programmable thermostats may or may not save energy, the market and key stakeholders (like ENERGY STAR®) are placing increased emphasis on good, user-friendly thermostat design. This provides a ripe development environment for advanced thermostats, which could provide users with increased control, feedback, remote access capabilities, and overall energy savings. The nascent, but growing smart gas grid infrastructure represents another feedback opportunity. Though less market ready than enhanced billing and smart thermostats, gas Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), commonly called smart meters, offer two-way communication potential and the ability to access real-time meter data. This could be used to develop an alert/notification system for consumers regarding their gas use, including warning of unusually large usage, providing recommendations, or even participation in an energy savings goal-setting program. Natural gas use patterns are highly seasonal yet are not affected by the same capacity constraints as electricity, which means there is not the same level of interest in demand response programs. Taking into account these unique characteristics, it's important to balance the potential for gas savings offered by a feedback option with the overall cost. Given how gas is used, feedback options must make sense from both an energy efficiency and economic standpoint.

Transportation of this gas through pipelines (one of the solutions with most advantages in transport) can be done at ambient temperature only at high pressures, so the carbon dioxide to remain in the supercritical state. In case of underground pipelines, there is a risk of cracking at the wall of the pipe, with the release into the atmosphere of a large quantity of gas. The authors demonstrate the existence of a threshold at which the properties of the material change from ductile to brittle properties due to depressurization of the pipe, which has the effect of a rapid drop of the temperature in the crack. This paper presents the factors influencing the ductile-brittle transformation and the factors influencing this transition. Changing to brittle proprieties into the material of the pipe, leads to a rapid increase of the hole through which the CO2 leaks. As these pipes are part of a vast network, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere can be considerable, affecting the neighboring ecosystem, contributing to the local change of temperature regime and to global warming, by the high concentration of CO2 in a large area. © 2014, (publisher).

However, the most used method to generate that cold (based on the compression refrigeration cycle) requires a considerable amount of electric energy, especially if no appropriate energy efficiency measures are implemented in cold storage chambers. This fact contributes to the increased costs in electricity bills, reduction of competitiveness among companies and also to a negative impact in terms of global warming. To help companies define and implement the right efficiency measures for cold production, this work aims to develop a methodology for simulation and optimization of energy consumption in cold chambers by improving both constructive and operating parameters (external temperature, enclosure insulation, door opening time, etc.), which contribute to the infiltration of heat energy. It is also intended that this methodology determines which of those parameters have greater influence in energy consumptions, as well as to estimate possible savings resulting from the optimization process. Results obtained in a garlic cold chamber showed that it is possible to achieve energy savings of up to 40 % for an initial investment around 1,500 € in efficiency measures and a payback time among 2 and 5 years. On the other hand, parameters that had the greatest influence in energy consumptions were those directly related with thermal insulation of enclosures and entry of warm air within. Total contribution of these two parameters in the global consumption was about 95 %. © 2014 The Author(s).","Cold storage chamber; Energy efficiency; Horticultural industry; Simulation","Cold storage; Enclosures; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Food preservation; Global warming; Refrigeration; Thermal insulation; Thermal processing (foods); Efficiency measure; External temperature; Global consumption; Horticultural industry; Operating parameters; Refrigeration cycles; Simulation; Simulation and optimization; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923067821

If a reduction in the rates of these biological processes involves a reduction in fitness, then organisms may evolve compensatory responses for the constraints imposed by high-latitude habitats. To test the existence of a latitudinal compensation in ectotherms, we used a common-garden experiment to investigate the extent to which the level of energy turnover (measured as standard metabolic rate, SMR) and the energy budget (energy allocation to growth) are affected by climatic constraints in three populations of the land snail Cornu aspersum, distributed across a latitudinal gradient of 1300 km in Chile. Our results did not support the existence of a latitudinal compensation in metabolic rates (metabolic cold adaptation). However, there was a countergradient variation (CnGV) for growth rate in which the highest latitudinal population exhibited greater growth rates than their counterparts from lower latitudes. Surprisingly, this CnGV pattern was accompanied by a lower apparent dry-matter digestibility, which could highlight a differential assimilation of ingested nutrients into somatic tissue, revealing enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal habitat. Our evidence highlights that adjustments in energy allocation to the digestive machinery and to protein storage could act as a latitudinal compensation for enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal population. © 2014.

The investigation has been performed with the purpose to determine potential dependence of clay filtration coefficient values on the number of freeze-thaw cycles and duration of filtration. The filtration coefficient for the repository till clay has been found to be greatly varying at the start of the filtration and during the experiment that lasted several days. This confirms that, during the filtration, structural changeover of clay-forming aggregates takes place with pore space volumes changing and affecting the filtration coefficient values. The filtration parameters are even more affected by freeze-thaw cycles and their number. When the clay thaw is finished the colmatation of fissure system is very slow and incomplete.

This saturation is often caused by overvoltage and results in curtailing or shutting down of the PV inverters, leading to a loss of renewable electricity generation. The presented work assesses the potential of rule-based demand-side management (DSM) applied to domestic hot water (DHW) production with heat pumps in dwellings for reducing the non-renewable energy use of the neighbourhood. The studied case consists of 33 single-family dwellings connected to a single phase distribution grid in a moderate European climate. Each dwelling is designed as a net-zero energy building by adequate design of a heat pump and PV system. A detailed dynamic simulation model is implemented by use of a cross-domain Modelica library for integrated district energy assessment. The user behaviour is obtained from a stochastic model based on Markov chains and survival analysis. Different rule-based DSM control strategies are applied to the individual dwelling's DHW systems. The results show that for balancing the PV production, active thermal energy storage in the DHW storage tanks is very promising. Even with very basic control algorithms and small storage tanks of 0.3 m3, curtailing losses can be reduced by 74%.

One of the major lines of action relates to the stabilization or reduction of greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere. CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas, due to the increase of the world's production, deforestation and intensive use of fossil energy [PAC 07]. Furthermore, the proposal for a strategy for the reduction of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a subject of research in full expansion. Several approaches are proposed, such as the reduction of emissions of this gas, its storage (geological, in the oceans or by mineralization), its adsorption or its absorption by chemical, geological or biological means [PIR 11]. This book focuses more particularly on CO2 fixation by biological means through the use of microalgae, in order to minimize the environmental impact of this sequestration. Carbon dioxide (CO2) biofixation by microalgae is a very promising CO2 mitigation strategy since these microorganisms are the most efficient to sequester CO2, in comparison with terrestrial plants. In the presence of light, microalgae are capable of assimilating CO2 to grow while producing oxygen and secondary metabolites, via photosynthesis. The use of microalgae for environmental purposes is thus a very promising solution due to their potential, the various advantages related to their growth rate and their high tolerance regarding high concentrations of CO2. In addition, they have a large number of uses on laboratory and industrial scales in different areas: they can be used to produce high value-added molecules in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, animal feed and human food, and they represent a feedstock for the production of renewable energy such as hydrogen, methane and biodiesel. Thus, the major aspect of CO2 biofixation by microalgae combines this sequestration with the production of value-added molecules. © ISTE Ltd 2014.",,"Algae; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Geology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Metabolites; Microorganisms; Molecules; Sustainable development; CO2 concentration; CO2 mitigation; Industrial scale; Lines of action; Reduction of emissions; Renewable energies; Secondary metabolites; Terrestrial plants; Growth rate",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926397398

We compared the quantitative expression of biomarkers in culture relative to their expression in vivo because the mere presence or absence of expression is minimally informative. Although all biomarkers analyzed have biochemical functions in adipocytes, the expression of some of the biomarkers varied enormously in culture relative to their expression in the adult fat tissues in vivo, i.e. inguinal fat for white adipocytes and brite cells, interscapular brown adipose tissue for brown adipocytes, and ear mesenchymal stem cells for white adipocytes from adult mice. We propose that the pattern of expression in vitro does not reflect gene expression in the adult mouse; rather it is predominantly the expression pattern of adipose tissue of the developing mouse between birth and weaning. The variation in gene expression among fat depots in both human and rodent has been an extensively studied phenomenon, and as recently reviewed, it is related to subphenotypes associated with immune function, the inflammatory response, fat depot blood flow, and insulin sensitivity. We suggest that adipose tissue biology in the period from birth to weaning is not just a staging platform for the emergence of adult white fat but that it has properties to serve the unique needs of energy metabolism in the newborn. A case in point is the differentiation of brite cells that occurs during this period followed by their involution immediately following weaning. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Cell culture; Gene expression; Mammals; Sensitivity analysis; Tissue; Biochemical functions; Energy metabolism; Expression patterns; Immune function; Inflammatory response; Insulin sensitivity; Mesenchymal stem cell; Primary cell cultures; Tissue engineering; biological marker; cell marker; cell protein; transcription factor; Ucp1 protein; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adult; animal cell; article; brown adipose tissue; cell differentiation; cell function; cell structure; controlled study; developmental stage; energy metabolism; gene expression; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid storage; mesenchymal stem cell; microarray analysis; molecular dynamics; molecular model; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; primary cell culture; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; quantitative analysis; weaning; Adipose Tissue Metabolism; Energy Metabolism; Lipid Metabolism; Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs); Mesoderm-specific Transcript; Microarray; Obesity; Primary Adipocyte Cultures; Sfrp5; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biological Markers; Cells, Cultured; Female; Gene Expression; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Models, Biological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903521572

Hepatic steatosis shows a greater negative influence on graft function following prolonged cold ischaemia. As the impact of steatosis on hepatocyte metabolism during extended cold ischaemia is not well-described, we compared markers of metabolic capacity and mitochondrial function in steatotic and lean livers following clinically relevant durations of cold preservation. Methods: Livers from 10-week old leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob, n = 9) and lean C57 mice (n = 9) were preserved in ice-cold University of Wisconsin solution. Liver mitochondrial function was then assessed using high resolution respirometry after 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours of storage. Metabolic marker enzymes for anaerobiosis and mitochondrial mass were also measured in conjunction with non-bicarbonate tissue pH buffering capacity. Results: Ob/ob and lean mice livers showed severe (>60%) macrovesicular and mild (<30%) microvesicular steatosis on Oil Red O staining, respectively. Ob/ob livers had lower baseline enzymatic complex I activity but similar adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels compared to lean livers. During cold storage, the respiratory control ratio and complex I-fueled phosphorylation deteriorated approximately twice as fast in ob/ob livers compared to lean livers. Ob/ob livers also demonstrated decreased ATP production capacities at all time-points analyzed compared to lean livers. Ob/ob liver baseline lactate dehydrogenase activities and intrinsic non-bicarbonate buffering capacities were depressed by 60% and 40%, respectively compared to lean livers. Conclusions: Steatotic livers have impaired baseline aerobic and anaerobic capacities compared to lean livers, and mitochondrial function indices decrease particularly from after 5 hours of cold preservation. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical recommendation of shorter cold storage durations in steatotic donor livers. © 2014 Chu et al.",,"adenosine triphosphate; lactate dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); adenosine; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; allopurinol; buffer; glucose blood level; glutathione; insulin; preservation solution; raffinose; University of Wisconsin-lactobionate solution; aerobic capacity; anaerobic capacity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cold ischemia; controlled study; cryopreservation; disease severity; energy yield; enzyme activity; fatty liver; glucose intolerance; insulin resistance; lean body weight; liver mitochondrion; male; mitochondrial energy transfer; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative phosphorylation; respiration control; anaerobic growth; animal; blood; body weight; C57BL mouse; cell respiration; diet restriction; electron transport; fatty liver; glucose blood level; liver; metabolism; mouse mutant; pathology; pH; Adenosine; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allopurinol; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Buffers; Cell Respiration; Cold Ischemia; Electron Transport; Fasting; Fatty Liver; Glucose Intolerance; Glutathione; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Liver; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Mitochondria, Liver; Organ Preservation Solutions; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Raffinose; Thinness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903530386

As electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors, the NiCo2O4 anchored MWCNTs exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2032 Fg-1, which is nearly 1.62 times greater than pristine NiCo2O4 nanoflakes at 1 Ag-1. The synthesized NiCo2O4 anchored MWCNTs composite shows excellent rate performance (83.96% capacity retention at 30 Ag-1) and stability with coulombic efficiency over 96% after 5,000 cycles when being fully charged/discharged at 1 Ag-1. Furthermore, NiCo 2O4 anchored MWCNTs achieve a maximum energy density of 48.32 Whkg-1 at a power density of 480 Wkg-1 which is 60% higher than pristine NiCo2O4 electrode and significantly outperformed electrode materials based on NiCo2O4 which are currently used in the state-of-the-art supercapacitors throughout the literature. This superior rate performance and high-capacity value offered by NiCo2O4 anchored MWCNTs is mainly due to enhanced electronic and ionic conductivity, which provides a short diffusion path for ions and an easy access of electrolyte flow to nickel cobaltite redox centers besides the high conductivity of MWCNTs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","flexible energy storage devices; Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes; nano-architectured; Spinel nickel cobaltite; supercapacitors","Carbon nanotubes; Lithium compounds; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nickel; Capacity retention; Coulombic efficiency; Electronic and ionic conductivity; Fabrication method; High specific capacitances; nano-architectured; Spinel nickel cobaltite; Super capacitor; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899521365

Within extensive density functional theory calculations we consider continuous transformation of the lithium borohydride equilibrium structures from 3-dimensional to 1-dimensional. Such structures consist of single linear chains, linear ribbons and 3-dimensional chains, and together with the low temperature bulk phase they reproduce 11B NMR spectra observed in LiBH4 confined in porous carbon. The present model suggest that nanoconfined LiBH4 consists of a dense bulk-like region and loosely distributed chains and ribbons of Li-BH4. Even with the low effective density of loosely distributed LiBH4 they occupy region with thickness as small as a quarter of a pore diameter. Copyright © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The detailed reaction mechanism during hydrogen release and uptake during continuous cycling was investigated by in-situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) experiments. The thermal behaviour of the samples and hydrogen desorption properties were examined by simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and mass spectrometry (MS) measurements. A ternary Ti-Mg-H compound with a fcc lattice form during mechano-chemical sample preparation in hydrogen atmosphere using metal powders, but not using metal hydrides as reactants. The amount of β-MgH2 increases during the first hydrogen absorption cycle at 300 °C at the expense of the high-pressure polymorph, γ-MgH2 and the amount of β-MgH2 remain constant during the following hydrogenations. This study reveals that the ternary compound tends to absorb increasing amounts of magnesium in the dehydrogenated state during cycling. A strong coupling between the amounts of magnesium in the ternary Ti-Mg-H phase and the formation of magnesium and magnesium hydride during hydrogen release and uptake at 300 °C is observed. The composition and the amount of the Ti-Mg-H phase appear to be similar in the hydrogenated state. Fast absorption-desorption kinetics at 300 °C and lower onset temperatures for hydrogen release is observed for all investigated samples (lowest onset temperature of desorption Ton = 217 °C).

A number of recent studies provided the BPR as a principal milling parameter while neglecting other parameters, such the vial volume, the diameter and quantity of milling balls and the powder mass. In this experiment, different batches of magnesium hydride powder were milled using varying ball size, powder mass, and other parameters and a constant BPR. The hydrogen desorption properties (i.e., differential scanning calorimeter) and phase evolution (i.e., XRD phase analysis) of the milled powders were subsequently investigated. The obtained results demonstrated that the BPR cannot be provided as a single processing parameter. The DSC curves obtained during decomposition with a scanning rate of 5 °C/min revealed significant differences in desorption peak temperature among the samples milled using the same BPR. Additionally, XRD patterns revealed that the crystallite size after milling varied, suggesting that differences existed in the effectiveness of the milling process.

Both prealloyed powders and elemental powders were used as precursors in an inductively coupled thermal plasma incorporating two injection probes located axially in the reactor one from the top and the other from the bottom. The study has shown that the use of prealloyed Mg 2Ni as precursor leads to its disintegration in the plasma condensing into separate phases and therefore was not suitable for the synthesis of Mg2Ni. The study further showed that Mg2Ni can be synthesized quite successfully with the use of elemental powders provided that elements are maintained into the plasma at carefully controlled positions. While the fraction of Mg2Ni was quite substantial, it co-existed with other phases and therefore additional treatments would be necessary for separation. It was shown that a substantial size reduction was possible with thermal plasma where Mg2Ni could be produced in sizes around 100 nm. Copyright © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Furthermore, it has been proposed that surface oxygen groups may improve the process. In this study, a carbon molecular sieve was subjected to controlled oxidation and consequent doping with Pd nanoparticles. The H2 sorption performance of the pristine and oxidized, undoped and doped materials was examined at 298 K up to 20 bar. It was found that the non-oxidized carbon-Pd composite did not show any spillover based sorption increase. On the other hand the oxidized samples reveal a slight enhancement that could be attributed to a weak chemisorption process initiated by the so-called ""spillover"" effect. Overall, the contribution of spillover to the total hydrogen storage capacity of this system (under the conditions studied) was not found to be of great significance.

It is intended to be a standalone book in a series that covers the Internet of Things activities of the IERC - Internet of Things European Research Cluster from technology to international cooperation and the global ""state of play"". The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European research Cluster on the Internet of Things Strategic Research Agenda and presents global views and state of the art results on the challenges facing the research, development and deployment of IoT at the global level. Internet of Things is creating a revolutionary new paradigm, with opportunities in every industry from Health Care, Pharmaceuticals, Food and Beverage, Agriculture, Computer, Electronics Telecommunications, Automotive, Aeronautics, Transportation Energy and Retail to apply the massive potential of the IoT to achieving real-world solutions. The beneficiaries will include as well semiconductor companies, device and product companies, infrastructure software companies, application software companies, consulting companies, telecommunication and cloud service providers. IoT will create new revenues annually for these stakeholders, and potentially create substantial market share shakeups due to increased technology competition. The IoT will fuel technology innovation by creating the means for machines to communicate many different types of information with one another while contributing in the increased value of information created by the number of interconnections among things and the transformation of the processed information into knowledge shared into the Internet of Everything. The success of IoT depends strongly on enabling technology development, market acceptance and standardization, which provides interoperability, compatibility, reliability, and effective operations on a global scale. The connected devices are part of ecosystems connecting people, processes, data, and things which are communicating in the cloud using the increased storage and computing power and pushing for standardization of communication and metadata. In this context security, privacy, safety, trust have to be address by the product manufacturers through the life cycle of their products from design to the support processes. The IoT developments address the whole IoT spectrum - from devices at the edge to cloud and datacentres on the backend and everything in between, through ecosystems are created by industry, research and application stakeholders that enable real-world use cases to accelerate the Internet of Things and establish open interoperability standards and common architectures for IoT solutions. Enabling technologies such as nanoelectronics, sensors/actuators, cyber-physical systems, intelligent device management, smart gateways, telematics, smart network infrastructure, cloud computing and software technologies will create new products, new services, new interfaces by creating smart environments and smart spaces with applications ranging from Smart Cities, smart transport, buildings, energy, grid, to smart health and life. © 2014 River Publishers.

This two-step process is a totally green synthetic method with cheap and ubiquitous biomass as the only raw material. These black-colored, highly electrically conductive and 3D structured CAs are ideal materials for energy conversion and storage. Paraffin wax was impregnated into the CA scaffold by vacuum infusion. The obtained CA-wax composites show excellent form-stable phase change behavior, with a high melting enthalpy of 115.2 J g-1. The CA-wax composites exhibit very high solar radiation absorption over the whole UV-vis-NIR range, and 96% of light can be absorbed by the phase-change composite and stored as thermal energy. With an electrical conductivity of 3.4 S m -1, the CA-wax composite can be triggered by low electric potential to perform energy storage and release, with an estimated electric-heat conversion efficiency of 71.4%. Furthermore, the CA-wax composites have excellent thermal stability with stable melting-freezing enthalpy and excellent reversibility. With a combination of low-cost biomass as the raw materials, a green preparation process, low density, and excellent electrical conductivity, the 3D CAs are believed to have promising potential applications in many energy-related devices.

Up until now there has been no way of reliably tracking both these factors in everyday inhaler use. Objectives: This paper introduces a device developed to create time stamped acoustic recordings of an individual's inhaler use, in which empirical evidence of temporal and technique adherence in inhaler use can be monitored over time. The correlation between clinical outcomes and adherence, as determined by this device, was compared for temporal adherence alone and combined temporal and technique adherence. Findings: The technology was validated by showing that the doses taken matched the number of audio recordings (r2 = 0.94, p&lt;0.01). To demonstrate that audio analysis of inhaler use gives objective information, in vitro studies were performed. These showed that acoustic profiles of inhalations correlated with the peak inspiratory flow rate (r2 = 0.97, p&lt;0.01), and that the acoustic energy of exhalations into the inhaler was related to the amount of drug removed. Despite training, 16% of participants exhaled into the mouthpiece after priming, in &gt;20% of their inhaler events. Repeated training reduced this to 7% of participants (p = 0.03). When time of use was considered, there was no evidence of a relationship between adherence and changes in AQLQ (r 2 = 0.2) or PEFR (r2 = 0.2). Combining time and technique the rate of adherence was related to changes in AQLQ (r2 = 0.53, p = 0.01) and PEFR (r2 = 0.29, p = 0.01). Conclusions: This study presents a novel method to objectively assess how errors in both time and technique of inhaler use impact on clinical outcomes.

High-resolution X-ray diffraction study and transmission electron microscopy show that heating and isothermal annealing treatment results in the nucleation of nanocrystals of several phases. The average size of these nanocrystals (∼15-20 nm) only slightly varies with prolonged annealing, only their volume fraction increases. High-pressure calorimetry experiments indicate that the as-cast fully amorphous alloy exhibits the largest enthalpy of hydrogen desorption, compared to partially and fully crystallized states. Since the fully crystallized alloy does not desorb hydrogen, it is assumed that hydrogen storage capacity correlates only with the crystalline volume fraction of the partially crystallized Mg 54Cu28Ag7Y11 BMG and additional parameters (crystalline phase selection, crystallite size, average matrix concentration) do not play a significant role. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The reaction is significantly accelerated by the rise of temperature or by the addition of acidic substances. Boric acid (H 3BO3) can be used as an alternative to water for the hydrogen production in the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The effect of H3BO3 and NaBH4-H 3BO3 molar ratios was studied at 30, 40, 50, 60, and 80°C on the hydrogen production of NaBH4. All of these results show that H3BO3 is a relatively green acid compound for hydrogen generation from NaBH4 and the H3BO 3-water-NaBH4 system being quite simple for single-use applications. It was found that the reaction between H3BO3 and NaBH4 complied with a second order kinetics rate with 0.5 reaction orders versus NaBH4 concentration and 1.5 ordersversus H3BO3 concentration, and the activation energy for conversion was calculated as 18.01 kJ mol-1.

Effective recovery of the electrical energy inherently stored during operation will greatly improve the efficiency of a DE device. One method of energy recovery involves the use of DC-DC step-down circuits to convert the high voltage energy into a low voltage form. The energy would then go to a storage component and eventually be reconverted back to high voltage for recharging the DE. However, the voltage conversion process incurs significant energy loss. Simply transferring the energy to a capacitor or another DE without large changes in the voltage can achieve better efficiencies. In our experiments, we achieved 51% energy transfer from one DE to another DE of similar size. Improved energy transfer is expected with lower electrode resistance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Dielectric elastomer; Efficiency; Electrode resistance; Electronics","Efficiency; Elastomers; Electronic equipment; Energy dissipation; Dielectric elastomer actuators; Dielectric elastomers; Electrical energy; Electrode resistance; Energy recovery; Low voltages; Storage component; Voltage conversion; Electroactive polymer actuators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940234983

Wind and solar power generation are two of the most promising renewable power generation technologies. This paper deals with the simulation of a Solar- Photovoltaic and Wind hybrid power generation system equipped with Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The Solar-Photovoltaic Module and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based wind turbine is simulated separately. Then they are connected to a dc bus. Since the intermittent nature of Solar and Wind makes the system unreliable, so an energy storage system SMES is introduced to reduce output fluctuations. Varying wind speed and solar irradiance value are taken as the input parameters. The simulation results show that a system with SMES is more reliable than a system without SMES.

Such networks are known by their limited resources of energy, storage, computation, and bandwidth. In addition if the networks entities are deployed with high density, it makes the synchronization mandatory for these networks. Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) technology is a promising solution for this kind of networks due to its various advantages such as its robustness to severe multipath fading even in indoor environments, its low cost, low complexity, and low power consumption. To exploit the specific features of this technology, we need a convenient MAC protocol. WideMac was presented as a new low power consumption MAC protocol designed for WSN using IR-UWB transceivers. Because of the luck of synchronization in this protocol, this paper presents a solution for the synchronization problem especially in the case of no communication between the Network's nodes. To implement and evaluate the proposed synchronization mechanism, we used MiXiM platform under OMNet++ Simulator. © 2014 CCIS.","Ir-uwb; Mixim; Packets delivery ratio; Power consumption; Synchronization; Widemac; Wsn",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924282809

For their design, it is necessary to understand and predict the ac loss. This article analyzes the ac loss in magnet-like coils under dc bias contribution superimposed to the ac current. The analysis is based on a numerical model that takes the interaction between magnetization currents in all turns into account. The studied example is a stack of 32 pancake coils with 200 turns each made of thin tape, such as ReBCO-coated conductor. We present the current density, the instantaneous power loss, and loss per cycle. We have found that the loss increases with the dc bias current. The instantaneous power loss is the largest in the initial rise of the ac current. In the following cycles, the power loss is higher in the current increase than in the decrease. The loss per cycle is the largest at the end pancakes. In conclusion, the highest cooling power should be supplied to the top and bottom pancakes and during current rise, specially the initial one. The presented model has a high potential to predict the ac loss in magnet-size coils, useful for their design. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","AC loss; coated conductor; numerical modeling; pancake coil; stack of pancake coils; YBCO","Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Magnetic storage; Magnets; Numerical models; Yttrium barium copper oxides; AC loss; Coated conductors; Instantaneous power; Magnetization currents; Pancake coils; Rebco coated conductors; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage systems; YBCO; Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921498996

Aries-St is the spherical tokamak (St) a innovative fusion reactor engineering. This toroidal reactor is a type of system that facilitates the occurrence of the nuclear fusion and fission events together (Tillack et al. in Fusion Energ Des 65:215-261, 2003; El-Guebaly in Fusion Energ Des 65:263-284, 2003). The Aries-St power core consist of the components directly surrounding the burning plasma and serves important functions. In fusion applications, liquid metals are traditionally considered to be the best working fluids. Sufficient tritium breed amount must be TBR >1.1 for Aries-St fusion tokamak power plant (Tillack et al. in Fusion Energ Des 65:215-261, 2003; El-Guebaly in Fusion Energ Des 65:263-284, 2003). The Aries-St power core has designed for correlation with an optimized St plasma that develop through the investigation of extensive range of plasma magnetohydrodynamic (Mhd) equations. In this study, the engineering design plasma parameters are described with respect to Mhd equilibrium and nuclear analysis, stability, radiation heat transfer conditions, current drive, and safety. In addition, turbulence model extended to an incompressible Mhd flows and monte carlo simulation are used for modeling of low-conductivity fluid. In this study the modeling of aries-st tokamak reactor produced by using aries design technology, has performed by using the monte carlo code and Endf/b-V-VI nuclear data. Monte carlo method is the general name for the solution of experimental and statistical problems with a random approach. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Aries-st; Fusion; Mhd; Spherical torus; Tokamak","Digital storage; Fusion reactions; Heat transfer; Magnetohydrodynamics; Monte Carlo methods; Plasma stability; Structural design; Tokamak devices; Turbulence models; Aries-st; Design technologies; Fusion applications; Plasma magnetohydrodynamics; Spherical torus; Statistical problems; Tokamak; Tokamak power plants; Magnetoplasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899103907

The possible use of PCM in buildings is becoming more and more attractive due to the large energy storage density and nearly isothermal nature of the PCM storage when compared to sensible heat storage. Although there is large amount of information available on this topic, literatures show very little information about the long term thermal performance of phase change materials. In this research, changes in thermal characteristics of two commercial organic PCMs when exposed to a constant temperature above their melting point were examined. The thermal characteristic (i.e. melting range and latent heat of fusion) of Rubitherm 21 (RT21, a paraffin mixture) and propyl stearic and palmitate mixture with a melting point in the range of 18-25. °C were tested after an exposure to storage temperatures of 30 and 55. °C. The results obtained indicated that the paraffin based mixture such as RT21 experienced a significant irreversible physical change with time. The data collected and analysis indicated a shift in the peak melting point from 21 to 28. °C and increase in latent heat of fusion from 134 to 170. J/g over a period of 120. days when kept at a temperature of 55. °C. On the other hand, the mixed esters experienced almost no change in mass due to their lower vapour pressure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Fire retardants; Latent heat; Paraffin mixtures; Phase change materials (PCMs); Propyl esters; Weight loss","Digital storage; Esterification; Esters; Flame retardants; Heat storage; Latent heat; Melting point; Mixtures; Paraffins; Constant temperature; Energy storage density; Latent heat of fusion; Propyl esters; Sensible heat storages; Storage temperatures; Thermal characteristics; Weight loss; Phase change materials; data acquisition; energy use; ester; isotherm; phase transition; wax; weight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897634699

In this paper, detailed efficiency analysis of a shipboard dc hybrid power system is carried out. An optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize fuel consumption under various loading conditions. The studied system includes diesel engines, synchronous generator-rectifier units, a full-bridge bidirectional converter, and a Li-Ion battery bank as energy storage. In order to evaluate potential fuel saving provided by such a system, an online optimization strategy for fuel consumption is implemented. An Offshore Support Vessel (OSV) is simulated over different operating modes using the online control strategy. The resulted consumed fuel in the simulation is compared to that of a conventional ac power system, and also a dc power system without energy storage. The results show that while the dc system without energy storage provides noticeable fuel saving compared to the conventional ac system, optimal utilization of the energy storage in the dc system results in twice as much fuel saving. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The supercapacitor is prepared in ambient conditions using activated carbon and an aqueous, non-acidic electrolyte. The obtained capacitances are 0.45 F and 0.21 F for device sizes of 4 cm2 and 2 cm2, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the utilisation of the supercapacitor in an autonomous energy harvesting and storage system. The RF energy harvester comprises a printed loop antenna and a half-wave organic diode rectifier operating at 13.56 MHz frequency. The harvested energy is stored in two supercapacitors connected in series to increase the maximum operating voltage. In order to power a device such as a sensor or a small indicator display, voltage regulation is needed. A voltage regulator, implemented as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), was designed for this purpose, and fabricated commercially. We demonstrate the ability of the harvester storage unit to power the regulator for hours with a constant regulator output voltage and power. The effect of supercapacitor charging time on the actual supercapacitor charging state is also discussed, as a slower charging rate is found to have a significant effect on the output of the supercapacitor. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the same characteristic chemistry that makes it so biologically versatile may lead to iron-associated toxicity as a consequence of increased oxidative stress. The fact that free iron accumulates with age and generates ROS led to the hypothesis that it could be involved in the etiogenesis of several chronic diseases. Iron has been consistently linked to carcinogenesis, either through persistent failure in the redox balance or due to its critical role in cellular proliferation. Several reports have given evidence that alterations in the import, export and storage of cellular iron may contribute to breast cancer development, behavior and recurrence. In this review, we summarize the basic mechanisms of systemic and cellular iron regulation and highlight the findings that link their deregulation with breast cancer.

Ideal gas and real gas simulations are compared and the entropy balance of the filling process is formulated. Calculated results are validated for a type I tank (steel vessel) with measurements. The simulation is used to accurately predict the maximum gas temperature during the refueling of pressurized gaseous hydrogen storages, which must not exceed 85 °C according to international standards. The influences of ambient temperature, initial pressure and pressure ramp rate on the resulting hydrogen gas temperature in the tank are investigated. In experiments, the effect of pressure pulses applied in practice on the resulting gas temperature is investigated as is the influence of the Joule-Thomson effect of hydrogen and methane.

Several models have been developed which now offer a good understanding of the VRB operating principles; this knowledge is important to evaluate its performance when applied in power systems. However, these models depend on parameters that are difficult to obtain experimentally or in data sheets. In this regard, this article presents a new VRB model based on the stack efficiency curves, usually determined by the manufacturer. This model is especially useful for computing intensive applications, such as power system dynamic studies, in order to maintain a low run-time.

The calibration uncertainty in the measuring system was below 1%. In all the measured samples the real part of the relative permittivity decreases with temperature, with a very good fit to a linear function; and it clearly depends on the oil source. The conductivity increases rapidly with temperature, fitting satisfactorily to an Arrhenius function. The values of the activation energy are between 0.34 eV (chia) and 0.46 eV (olive and soybean), and are consistent with previously reported values.

The necessary heating for the bioethanol reforming reaction can be provided by the renewable sources to enhance the efficiency of the hydrogen production. It is worth noting that, from the power balance as well as backup point of views, the hybrid system is equipped with energy storage devices. An optimal sizing methodology integrated with the energy management strategy is proposed here for designing the overall hybrid system. The suggested approach is based on genetic algorithms, using historical climate data and load demands over a period of one year.

In all cases we computed the energy, bonding and electronic structure for the different nanotube-supported hydrogen-palladium systems. Our results show that Pd(H2) and Pd2(H2) complexes with relaxed but not dissociated H-H bonds are the most stable adsorbed systems. The role of s, p and d orbitals on the bonding mechanism for all adsorbates and substrates was also addressed. We found intermolecular donor-acceptor C-Pd and Pd-H delocalizations after adsorption.

If there is any surplus PV power over demand, and capacity left in the tank for accommodating additional hydrogen, this surplus power is supplied to the electrolyser to produce hydrogen for storage. When the output of the PV array is not sufficient to supply the demand, the fuel cell draws on hydrogen from storage and produces electricity to meet the supply deficit.

H debilitates the original metal-metal bonds by forming strong interactions with the metallic matrix. The Fe-H interaction is stronger than the Ni-H interaction. The H-metal exchange contributes to this process. After first H atom adsorption, the strength of the nearest Fe-Fe, Fe-Ni and Ni-Ni bonds decreases to about 89%, 15% and 1%, respectively. Then, the Fe-Fe bond is the most affected. The adsorption of an additional H atom modified the metal-metal strength in a lesser percent. Then, no additional decohesion is observed in the metallic bonds when two H atoms are present but in this case more metallic bonds are affected.

The scheduling framework used in this study is based on the recent and efficient formulation. This formulation has been shown to result in a significant reduction of computational time, an improvement of the objective function and leads to fewer time points. The objective is to improve the profitability of the plant by minimizing wastewater generation and utility usage. From a case study it was found that through applying only water integration the cost is reduced by 11.6%, by applying only energy integration the cost is reduced by 29.1% and by applying both energy and water integration the cost is reduced by 34.6%. This indicates that optimizing water and energy integration in the same scheduling framework will reduce the operating cost and environmental impact significantly. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy integration; Heat storage; Multipurpose batch plant; Wastewater minimization","Batch data processing; Costs; Environmental impact; Heat storage; Integration; Optimization; Efficient formulation; Energy integration; Mathematical formulation; Multipurpose batch plants; Objective functions; Scheduling frameworks; Wastewater generation; Wastewater minimization; Scheduling algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897009770

It is increasingly recognized that surface albedo is the most important biogeophysical mechanism by which the boreal forest directly influences the global energy balance. Forest management decisions that influence age class and species distributions affect not only the carbon sink capacity, but also the albedo (and hence climate services) of the forested landscape. Disregarding albedo and how it is influenced by management decisions can have profound implications for the effectiveness of any climate change mitigation policy involving active forest management. Here, we explore, analyze, and compare the albedo predicted by simple empirical models with in situ and remotely sensed albedo observations in regions outside the region in which the models were originally developed (southeastern Norway), including boreal Canada and Europe. We find that the models are robust in their ability to predict the longer term interannual trends in the mean winter-summer albedo amplitude, the rapid albedo evolution in young stands, and the timing of seasonal transitions and weak with respect to capturing interannual albedo changes linked to seasonal climate variability and phenology.","Albedo; Boreal; Climate change mitigation; Forest management; Global warming; Model; Remote sensing","Carbon; Climate models; Decision making; Global warming; Models; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Albedo; Analysis of performance; Boreal; Climate change mitigation; Forested landscapes; Management decisions; Regulation services; Species distributions; Forestry; albedo; boreal forest; carbon flux; carbon sink; climate change; empirical analysis; energy balance; forest management; global warming; heat flux; mitigation; moisture; performance assessment; phenology; remote sensing; Climates; Forest Management; Forests; Models; Remote Sensing; Canada; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921959285

The focus is on identifying both a suitable substitution pattern for ammonia-borane optimized for chemical hydrogen storage and allowing for low-energy dehydrogenation. The interaction of ammonia-borane, and related substituted ammonia-boranes, with a bifunctional η6-arene ruthenium catalyst and associated variants is investigated for dehydrogenation. Interestingly, in a number of cases, hydride-proton transfer from the substituted ammonia-borane to the catalyst undergoes a barrier-less process in the gas phase, with rapid formation of hydrogenated catalyst in the gas phase. Amongst the catalysts considered, N,N-difluoro ammonia-borane and N-phenyl ammonia-borane systems resulted in negative activation energy barriers. However, these types of ammonia-boranes are inherently thermodynamically unstable and undergo barrierless decay in the gas phase. Apart from N,N-difluoro ammonia-borane, the interaction between different types of catalyst and ammonia borane was modeled in the solvent phase, revealing free-energy barriers slightly higher than those in the gas phase. Amongst the various potential candidate Ru-complexes screened, few are found to differ in terms of efficiency for the dehydrogenation (rate-limiting) step. To model dehydrogenation more accurately, a selection of explicit protic solvent molecules was considered, with the goal of lowering energy barriers for H-H recombination. It was found that primary (1°), 2°, and 3° alcohols are the most suitable to enhance reaction rate. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ammonia-borane; bifunctional; catalysis; dehydrogenation; density functional theory; ruthenium","Activation energy; Boron compounds; Catalysis; Catalysts; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Energy barriers; Gases; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Quantum chemistry; Ruthenium; ammonia-borane; Bi-functional; Chemical hydrogen storage; Negative activation energy; Protic solvents; Rate limiting; Ruthenium catalysts; Substitution patterns; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962407212

This production is the source of many breeding programs all around the world. The sugarcane straw usually considered as trash is normally burned or is left in the soil depending on the harvesting system. There is an immense amount of straw being wasted yearly. Besides utilizing the straw for energy production or its requirement, there are a lot of other agronomic benefits that enhance the possibility of the straw blanket placed/left on the ground including protection of soil avoiding erosion, increasing organic ratio of content of carbon in the soil, inhibition of growth of weed, recycling of nutrients in textile fiber, and soil water reduction. Although consumption of sugarcane is very popular worldwide, certain factors are to be kept in mind regarding postharvest storage of stalk that involves enzymatic browning. This chapter focuses on ways sugarcane straw can be utilized as a primary source for the production of products having great agronomic value. Balancing the pros of keeping sugarcane fields with a percentage of straw, which significantly outnumber the cons, economists are keen to find out beneficial properties and economic aspects of keeping straw on the ground rather than using it all as possible energy source. The most challenging factor is to maintain the straw quality rendering it useful. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

For the most part, electricity needed by customers and the system must be produced at the moment it's required. According to EIA and DOE data, at the end of 2013, the US had about 1,200 Gw of installed generating capacity and a mere 21.1 Gw of grid-connected, utility-scale storage. However, the energy storage sector is poised to begin making its mark, driven by greater policy support and technological advances that have begun making new solutions economic. States such as California and New York have passed legislation requiring energy storage for renewable energy projects. Germany is also looking into power-to-gas (P2G). In August 2013, E.ON inaugurated a 2-Mw/30-Mwhr facility in Falkenhagen that generates methane via electrolysis and methanization with CO2, and uses it to generate electricity via fuel cells. In October, a second P2G facility was added to a wind farm in Grapzow; that plant has a capacity of 1 Mw/27 Mwhr. On the technology front, there is a great deal of activity in the battery industry, from the evolution of existing designs and improvements in manufacturing to new technologies.

The technology behind Li-ion battery systems has rapidly developed in recent years, and the chemistry's high energy density (up to 385 w-hr/L and 180 w-hr/kg) means that significant levels of storage capacity can be packed into a relatively compact and lightweight footprint. Wind turbine and wind farm operators are keen to optimize their generation capacity so that they can sell electricity to the grid at times of peak demand and avoid curtailment. Grid operators, on the other hand, are eager to ensure that wind farms supply high-quality power that meets the demands of their grid codes and avoids high ramp rates caused by rapid changes in wind conditions. Saft has delivered Li-ion ESS solutions for a number of installations, including integrating solar photovoltaic (PV) and other on-grid applications. Three projects highlight the benefits of the technology and its application to different circumstances. These are a $5.5 million project in Canada comprising an 800-kw wind turbine installed with a 1-Mw-hr Li-ion ESS that overcomes the issue of intermittency of wind power on the prairies; the installation of an ESS in France to serve a 12-Mw wind power plant and demonstrate multiple services, including smoothing of output as well as grid voltage and frequency management; and a project in Pellworm Island, off the North Sea cost of Germany, which has annual energy production of around 21 Gw-hr from wind turbines and PV power plants while biogas plants is around three times the annual consumer load of 7 Gw-hr.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903289178

It also needs to stay on track with a binding commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, followed by a 40% cut by 2030 under European Commission plans announced in January 2014. Under new emissions performance standards introduced in the Energy Bill, any new coal plant would have to use carbon capture and storage (CCS). Since that is unlikely any time soon, demand growth in the next few years will require a shift back to gas, if it cannot be met by an expansion of wind. Converting coal-fired plants to burn biomass gives power companies a guaranteed price of £105/Mwhr as well as avoiding the carbon tax. This is a good deal, given that dedicated biomass power plants get £120/Mwhr. However, not all conversion projects gain government approval. Drax Power's White Rose project is one of only two carbon capture and storage projects being funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). White Rose partners Alstom, Drax, and BOC are now carrying out a front-end engineering study for coal CCS, while Shell and SSE are doing the same for gas at Peterhead in Scotland. The two projects will then compete for up to £1 billion in construction funding, while two other previously rejected projects seek funding through other means.

In sectors such as electricity and gas, this opening to competition is possible only in certain activities (i.e. generation, storage of natural gas and supply), maintaining as a natural monopoly the activities of distribution and transmission, and therefore still subject to regulation. The performance of these regulated segments can have important effects on the operation of the competitive segments, because the regulated segments (i.e. the transmission and distribution networks) provide the infrastructure platform upon which the competitive activities rely. The motivation of this paper is to evaluate the effects of privatization, liberalization and regulation on investments, as components of the reform of the natural gas sector.

The pumped storage hydro (PSH) units are one possible solution to mitigate this problem, once they can store the excess of energy in the periods of higher generation and lower demand. However, the behavior of a PSH unit may differ considerably from the expected in terms of wind power integration when it operates in a liberalized electricity market under a price-maker context. In this regard, this paper models and computes the optimal PSH weekly scheduling in a price-taker and price-maker scenarios, either when the PSH unit operates in standalone and integrated in a portfolio of other generation assets. Results show that the price-maker standalone PSH will integrate less wind power in comparison with the price-taker situation. Moreover, when the PSH unit is integrated in a portfolio with a base load power plant, the role of the price elasticity of demand may completely change the operational profile of the PSH unit. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity markets; Electricity systems modeling; Non-linear programming; Price-maker; Pumped storage hydro scheduling; Wind power integration","Nonlinear programming; Power generation; Scheduling; Wind power; Commerce; Costs; Integration; Nonlinear programming; Scheduling; Wind power; Electricity market; Electricity system; Price-maker; Pumped-storage hydro; Wind power integrations; Costs; Power markets; demand analysis; energy market; nonlinearity; power generation; power plant; pump; wind power; electrical power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901486227

The overall long-term objective has been the enhancement of safety culture and includes a special focus on regulatory supervision of nuclear legacy sites. The initial project outputs included appropriate regulatory threat assessments, to determine the hazardous situations and activities which are most in need of enhanced regulatory supervision. In turn, this has led to the development of new and updated norms and standards, and related regulatory procedures, necessary to address the often abnormal conditions at legacy sites.This paper presents the experience gained within the above program with regard to radio-ecological characterization of Sites of Temporary Storage for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste at Andreeva Bay and Gremikha in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Such characterization is necessary to support assessments of the current radiological situation and to support prospective assessments of its evolution. Both types of assessments contribute to regulatory supervision of the sites. Accordingly, they include assessments to support development of regulatory standards and guidance concerning: control of radiation exposures to workers during remediation operations; emergency preparedness and response; planned radionuclide releases to the environment; development of site restoration plans, and waste treatment and disposal. Examples of characterization work are presented which relate to terrestrial and marine environments at Andreeva Bay. The use of this data in assessments is illustrated by means of the visualization and assessment tool (DATAMAP) developed as part of the regulatory cooperation program, specifically to help control radiation exposure in operations and to support regulatory analysis of management options. For assessments of the current radiological situation, the types of data needed include information about the distribution of radionuclides in environmental media. For prognostic assessments, additional data are needed about the landscape features, on-shore and off-shore hydrology, geochemical properties of soils and sediments, and possible continuing source terms from continuing operations and on-site disposal. It is anticipated that shared international experience in legacy site characterization can be useful in the next steps. Although the output has been designed to support regulatory evaluation of these particular sites in northwest Russia, the methods and techniques are considered useful examples for application elsewhere, as well as providing relevant input to the International Atomic Energy Agency's international Working Forum for the Regulatory Supervision of Legacy Sites. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental assessment; Nuclear legacy; Regulatory supervision; Site characterization","Emergency preparedness and response; Environmental assessment; International atomic energy agency; International experiences; Nuclear legacy; Radiological assessment; Regulatory supervision; Site characterization; Data visualization; Digital storage; Ecology; Radiation protection; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Radioisotopes; Radiology; Sediments; Waste treatment; Characterization; cesium 137; radioisotope; strontium 90; cooperative sector; environmental assessment; pollution exposure; radioactive waste; radionuclide; regulatory approach; site characterization; waste management; article; ecology; emergency care; environmental radioactivity; gamma radiation; geochemistry; hydrology; marine environment; planning; protection; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation measurement; radioactive contamination; radioecological characterization; Russian Federation; sediment; soil; vegetation; waste disposal; waste management; Russian Federation; Environmental assessment; Nuclear legacy; Regulatory supervision; Site characterization; Cesium Radioisotopes; Government Regulation; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Monitoring; Radioactive Pollutants; Radioactive Waste; Russia; Strontium Radioisotopes; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896733412

Specifically, a vertical double pipe concentric storage unit with circumferentially finned inner tube is explored experimentally. It is demonstrated that CCM enhances significantly the heat transfer rate, shortening the melting time by almost 2.5 times in that specific laboratory-scale device. These results show that it is favorable to supply heat to the outer shell of a latent-heat storage unit in order to initiate close-contact melting and achieve higher heat transfer rates. In order to analyze the process more closely, a single-cell vertical enclosure containing a phase-change material (PCM) is explored. A numerical model, which combines an enthalpy method with CCM modeling, is developed and validated experimentally. The solid bulk of the PCM is allowed to sink, thus enabling close-contact melting on the non-isothermal fin surface. The fins are thus much more important than just extended surfaces for heat transfer enhancement. The agreement between the numerical predictions and experimental findings is very good both in terms of the total melting time and instant melting patterns. The validated numerical model is further used for a detailed study, in which time dependent melt fractions and heat transfer rates are obtained for various temperature conditions. In all cases, the findings are compared with a simplified analytical model which accounts for the close-contact melting only, revealing effects not predicted by common CCM modeling approaches in the literature. The analytical model yields theoretical expressions for the time-dependent melt fraction, heat transfer rate and molten layer thickness in a dimensionless form. For the conditions of the present study, the dimensional analysis indicates that the melt fraction depends on the Fourier and Stefan numbers combined as FoSte3/4 only, whereas the Nusselt number and the normalized layer thickness both depend also on the same additional group, Ste1/4. Based on these findings, the numerically calculated melt fractions, Nusselt numbers and layer thicknesses are generalized completely, showing a remarkable agreement. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Bruising can occur during harvest and at all stages of postharvest handling, especially during packhouse operations, transport and storage, and is one of the major physical defects contributing to downgrading and postharvest loss of fresh horticultural produce. Understanding susceptibility or resistance of produce to bruising is important in developing strategies for reducing the problem. Bruise quantification can be carried out using destructive manual measurements and subsequent analysis, or using a range of non-destructive techniques. Novel and emerging non-invasive technologies for bruise measurement of fresh horticultural produce include near infrared spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, thermal imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

The reason for selecting this topology is that the voltage level at the output of renewable sources, such as solar cells and storage batteries, is about 12 V DC, and the voltage level required for electrolysis is about 2 V DC. Traditional buck converters have low efficiencies at low output voltages since the voltage drops on the components are comparable to the output voltage. The converter has been designed and tested at 25 A output current. Two different electrodes were used for electrolysis and the effect of electrode opening on the operation was observed.

The mineralogy of well-sorted silica sand is modified by the pH-controlled precipitation of eight metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd). Continuous flow tests are performed in two fixed-bed columns packed with the modified sand by coinjecting gas CO2/distilled water (2-phase column) and distilled water (1-phase column/control test) at constant influx rates for a period of two months. The concentration of dissolved metals is measured in the effluents of columns with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Mineralogical analysis of the surface of sand grains is done before and after the flow tests with scanning electron microscopy-X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), whereas the precise quantitative measurement of the metal content in the sand is done with AAS. A dynamic numerical model that couples the flow and mass-transfer processes in porous media with the equilibrium and kinetically driven metal desorption processes is developed. Inverse modeling of the continuous flow test enables us to quantify and rank the selectivity of metal mobility in terms of equilibrium and kinetic desorption parameters. The continuous CO2 dissolution and water acidification causes significant mobilization and dissolution of several metals (Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Co), moderate mobilization of Cr, acceleration of Cd dissolution, whereas Fe remains strongly bonded on the sand grains as goethite. The parameters estimated from lab-scale column tests might be helpful for interpreting field-scale CO2 leakage scenarios and installing relevant early warning monitoring systems. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Aquifers; Atomic absorption spectrometry; Cadmium; Carbon dioxide; Desorption; Dissolution; Effluents; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Inverse problems; Manganese; Manganese removal (water treatment); Metals; Minerals; Nickel; Photoelectrons; Porous materials; Sand; Scanning electron microscopy; Testing; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc; Atomic absorption spectroscopy; Dynamic numerical modeling; Mass-transfer process; Mineralogical analysis; Parameters estimated; Potable groundwater; Quantitative measurement; Water acidification; Copper; cadmium; carbon dioxide; chromium; cobalt; copper; ferric hydroxide; ground water; iron; manganese; metal; nickel; silicon dioxide; water; zinc; aquifer; carbon dioxide; desorption; distillation; effluent; goethite; leakage; measurement method; metal; mineralogy; mobilization; monitoring; numerical model; pH; precipitation (chemistry); silica; acidification; aquifer; article; atomic absorption spectrometry; controlled study; desorption; dissolution; electric conductivity; flow; mineralogy; pH; sand; scanning electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Adsorption; Carbon Dioxide; Cations; Groundwater; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metals; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Minerals; Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Soil; Spectrophotometry, Atomic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898884175

This suggested that more complicated reaction models taking into account the structure of the redox material are needed to describe the whole extent of the experimental data. Based on the above, a minimum set of experiments for water splitting thermochemical cycles over a Nickel-ferrite was deigned and performed involving an increased duration of the reaction steps. A new extended model was derived for the water splitting and thermal reduction reactions, which considers two oxygen storage regions of the redox material communicating to each other by a solid state diffusion mechanism. The inclusion of two state variables instead of one has a significant effect on the reaction dynamics and renders the model capable to explain the dynamics of the convergence of the thermochemical cycles to a periodic steady state, observed experimentally in the previous work.

EmIC are widely used as industrial chemicals (new and recently recognized), global organic contaminants (flame retardant chemicals), pharmaceuticals (for both human and animal use), endocrine-modulating compounds, biological metabolites, personal care products, household chemicals, nanomaterials (energy storage products, lubricants), anticorrosive and agricultural chemicals and others that are applied to a variety of everyday items such as clothing, upholstery, electronics and automobile interiors. NORMAN (Network of reference laboratories for monitoring of emerging environmental pollutants) has established an open, dynamic list of emerging substances and pollutants. EmIC have been recently detected in the environment due to their long-term presence, pseudo-persistence and increased use. Improvements in sophisticated analytical methods and time integrative passive sampling have enabled the identification and quantification of EmIC, in very low concentrations (ppb, ppt and lower), which likely have been present in all environmental mediums for decades. Passive technology is an innovative technique for the time-integrated measurement of emerging contaminants in water, sediment, soil and air. Passive samplers are simple handling, costeffective tool that could be used in environmental monitoring programs. These devices are now being considered as a part of an emerging strategy for monitoring various industrial chemicals and priority pollutants in the aquatic environment. EmIC are substances that are not included in the routine monitoring programes and whose fate, behavior and (eco)toxicological effects are still not well understood. Emerging pollutants have no regulatory standards based on peer-reviewed science. EmIC might jeopardize aquatic environment. The first screening analyses of emerging industrial and priority organic contaminants in the Danube surface water, in the vicinity of Novi Sad, have been done and approximately more than 140 compounds have been registered. The new sampling campaign, screening and target analyses are in progress.","Danube; Industrial emerging contaminants; Industrial wastewater; Novi Sad",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898764795

The microstructure of raw and cooked beans consists of hexagonal- or angular-shaped cotyledon cells (50-100. μm size) containing starch granules. The flour obtained through milling of the whole navy beans contains disrupted cotyledon cells, starch granules, and cell wall fragments. The extent of starch hydrolysis (%) after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion differs among whole navy beans (≈60 %) and milled bean flour (85-90%) due to differences in their microstructure. Intact cotyledon cells in the cooked whole navy beans provide resistance whereas disrupted cotyledon cells in bean flour allow proper gelatinization and enzymatic digestion of starch. The cotyledon cell structure of the cooked whole navy beans is maintained quite well throughout the in vitro gastric and small intestinal digestion period.

The obtained OMC product was characterized by N2 sorptometry, X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The mean pore radius of 2 nm and specific surface area of 712 m2 g-1 were found. The OMC sample was subjected to a complex electrochemical testing in order to check for its applicability in various energy conversion processes. For pure OMC, the charge storage properties and kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution were measured. The OMC sample delivered specific capacitance of 232 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 with 83.6% capacitance retained at 100 mV s-1. Effective ORR electrocatalysis by OMC in alkaline media was evidenced, with onset potential amounting to -0.10 V vs. saturated calomel electrode. A part of the OMC sample was used as a support of Pt nanoparticles, and examined as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HOR) and ORR in acidic media. Reversible HOR kinetics was observed, while ORR performances were found to be competitive to the ones on other carbon-supported Pt electrocatalysts reported so far. A superb electrochemical behavior was correlated to physico-chemical properties of OMC. Described OMC stands out as a highly versatile material, which can be used to replace carbon materials developed for specific purposes, allowing rationalization of carbon-based technologies aimed for energy conversion purposes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Electrochemical capacitor; Fuel cell catalysis; Hydrogen oxidation reaction; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Oxygen reduction reaction","Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical investigations; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Hydrogen oxidation reaction; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Oxygen reduction reaction; Saturated calomel electrode; Structure directing agents; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Energy conversion; Hydrogen; Mesoporous materials; Platinum; Reaction kinetics; X ray diffraction analysis; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896835570

For this purpose the absorption reaction was modeled as a process involving several partial reactions occurring sequentially. The analysis was performed by comparing the experimental data with the descriptions derived from four different kinetic expressions, each considering that there is only one mechanism governing the hydrogen absorption reaction while the other steps occur near equilibrium conditions. Kinetic curves corresponding to the binary alloy LaNi5 and to the substituted alloys LaNi4.73Sn0.27 and LaNi 4.55Sn0.45 were measured using the Sieverts volumetric technique. Experiments were carried out over a temperature range from 300 K to 348 K and under different hydrogen pressures. In all cases, the best fit to the experimental data was achieved by applying an expression that assumes the limiting step of the overall reaction is the diffusion of hydrogen atoms through the hydride layer. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The carbon capture options were compared with the similar designs without carbon capture. The designs were simulated to produce mass and energy balances for quantification of key performance indicators. A particular accent is put on assessment of reforming technologies (steam and oxygen-blown autothermal reforming) and chemical looping units, process integration issues of carbon capture step within the plant, modelling and simulation of whole plant, thermal and power integration of various plant sub-systems by pinch analysis.

This system is designed to provide enough power for domestic use that satisfies a single household’s demand and allows a certain level of autonomy. The whole work is based on simulation. Models are elaborated to simulate the power source (wind turbine), a storage battery, the electrical load and the relevant meteorological conditions, in addition to other items that are needed to represent the SWES satisfactorily. MATLAB/SIMULINK software is used for the whole system simulation. Focus is put onto the power source and battery. The load situated in various climatic zones of Algeria is represented as a power demand that needs be satisfied. Finally, the economic analysis has resulted in the calculation of the installed total cost, kWh cost, and the actualized total cost for the wind energy source. The simulation results indicate that the coverage provided by the wind/battery system depends on the wind turbine nominal power. It depends also from the local wind speed distribution As far as the economic results are concerned, it appears that the cost of the energy produced by the wind/battery system is very high (1.3-4$/kWh) compared to those corresponding to conventional installations (0.4$/kWh). This, however, is not to be considered as a negative determinant factor since the local authorities plan to manufacture renewable energy equipment locally and, by doing so, cancel the effects of subsidizing the local fossil fuels on the imported machines costs, which will in turn be favorably reflected on renewable energy costs. © 2014, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

For this purpose absorption-type chillers are used. In these chillers only 10% of the energy is supplied as electrical energy and the rest is supplied as heat energy. At present, many chillers of this type are manufactured with solar heating devices. As a rule, flat panel solar heaters are used for this purpose. Unfortunately, the highest temperature of the heaters is slightly lower that is necessary for efficient work of absorption-type chillers. For this reason sometimes evacuated tube solar heaters are used to obtain sufficiently high temperature. Trough solar collectors have also been proposed for this purpose. This increases the cost of solar heaters. At present, this cost equals approximately 100 USD per square meter. We have developed a low-cost flat facet solar concentrator that can have a cost of 20-30 USD in mass production and provides a temperature of about 200ºC that is sufficient practically for all types of absorption type chillers.

With thermal energy storage it is possible to organize the continuous process of air dehumidification even in the night time. Recently we have developed low cost solar concentrators that can be used for air dehumidification. The concentrators of this type contain a large number of flat triangle mirrors. The support frame for these mirrors has a shape of a parabolic dish. The experiments with two prototypes of flat mirror solar concentrators show that a stagnation temperature of more than 300ºC can be obtained. This temperature is sufficient to regenerate almost all desiccants that are used for air dehumidification. We estimate the cost of flat mirror concentrators in mass production as 20-30 USD per square meter.

However, it is an industry in which the use of raw materials is maximised leaving a large volume of waste. The cork industry has tried to take advantage of these residues, mainly through direct energy recovery, despite the technical and safety difficulties presented by the use of such low density material, which complicates and hinders its transportation for industrial uses outside the area in which it is produced. The densification process opens new doors for such use and also for its storage, because it produces better results when compared with other more common products, such as wood sawdust or even forest and agricultural waste. Thus, cork pellets emerge as a safer and more easily transportable alternative for energy recovery from cork dust and other granulated types of cork waste, which offer the prospects for wider use. The results demonstrate that cork pellets have higher calorific value when compared with other biomass pellets; typically, approximately 19 MJ/kg with 2% volume of ashes, which is equivalent to that obtained from the combustion of pellets produced from combined forest and agricultural waste with a bulk density of 640 kg/m3, which offers real advantages in terms of logistics. © 2014, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

This application has become important in the development of thermal technologies for solar energy concentration. The operating principle of these technologies is based on the concentration of sun rays by mirrors to achieve high temperatures and aims to operate turbines coupled with electric generators to produce electricity. Therefore, alkali nitrates and sodium nitrite are good candidates due to the low melting point and excellent heat capacity. These properties produce a broad molten salt operating range and enable effective thermal storage in solar power plants. But one of the critical parameters is the degradation because the cyclic process of heating / cooling. It is important to study the thermal properties in order to determine the operating conditions and lifetime during processing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the melting point and thermal stability of conventional salt systems, such as the Solar Salt (60% NaNO3-40%-KNO3, Tm = 220 °C) and HITEC (7% NaNO3-53% KNO3-40%NaNO2, Tm = 142 °C), and a novel eutectic mixture. The physical and chemical properties of the studied salts were evaluated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and morphology was observed in SEM images. In order to compare experimental results with theoretical calculations, the eutectic temperature and heat capacity were calculated with Factsage® thermodynamic software. Melting point was found to be lower than that of conventional salts due to the Lithium Nitrate addition in the systems. © 2014, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

The mass to power ratio is of importance to achieve high working efficiency. In addition proper control concept is proposed for various sea wave conditions to manage the system optimally. The potential wave resource in South Africa is enormous as there are over 2000 km of coastline with an annual wave height average of 2-3 m. One of the most efficient wave energy extractor is the hinged wave energy converter (HIWEC) whereby the wave force is applied to a responsive mechanism able to resist the working force of the waves. The hinged mechanism used in this project is of the power take-off (PTO) type. The PTO captures the wave energy and then between the wave’s time intervals transfers it to be converted and stored. Control of the response of the HIWEC can be achieved through active tuning of the PTO. As wave energy is intermittent, the supplied electrical power will show strong variations unless an energy storage system is available. The energy storage system consists of several series connected gas accumulators, placed in the hydraulic circuit to produce a smoothing effect. © 2014, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Topographic slope of the hydrologic system of a plain is very small, or zero, which is sometimes insufficient to generate an integrated drainage network, a surface runoff or to cause fluvial erosive processes. A sector of the Pampas Plain, locally known as ""Pampa Arenosa"" (Sandy Pampa), in the northwest of the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, is presented as a case study. With an area of about 50,000 km2, this region presents a monotonous plain surface of low relief. It is a landscape shaped by eolic processes where it is possible to distinguish different paleoforms related to dune ridges. Current wet climate conditions contrast with the origin of an eolic landscape associated with a preceding arid climate. Thedominant features are the absence of a drainage network and the accumulation of water in blowouts or in inter dune openings. The general characteristics of the region, as well as the hydrologic factors (rainfall, water surplus, soil wetness, water table level) are analyzed, which reveals the most marked impacts from alternate flood and dry periods. The way in which the regional hydrologic variations affect the agricultural production system in one of the most important agricultural regions of Argentina is also studied. The main feature of a large flatland is its low morphogenetic energy, which makes the energy of water resources dissipate through vertical water movements (evaporation, transpiration, infiltration, interchanges between the unsaturated zone and the water table). These vertical movements predominate over surface or groundwater horizontal movements, thus enhancing the importance of surface and groundwater storage variations. It follows that flatlands are highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations (water surplus and deficit), as well as to human activities. These characteristics make it difficult to effectively apply the traditional concept of a basin used for regions having an abrupt relief. Moreover, the difficulty to define a study area as a drainage basin leads to a need for replacing the term drainage basin by hydrologic region. In addition, the development of methodologies for quantification, measurement and hydrologic forecasting adapted to this kind of regions is also a challenging task. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In such scenarios, this issue has also raised considerable interest in the potential role and value of electricity storage as a method of mitigating variability in generation associated with the inherently variable nature of these forms of generation. At the same time, a number of studies have pointed to the potential benefits of renewable generation as a hedge against the volatility and potential escalation of fossil fuel prices. Prior research and this work suggest that the lack of correlation of renewable energy costs with fossil fuel prices means that adding large amounts of wind or solar generation may also reduce the volatility of system-wide electricity costs.1 Such variance reduction in overall system costs may be of significant value to consumers due to risk aversion. In contrast to this observation, other studies have focused on returns in restructured markets and noted that, in deregulated markets, baseload natural gas power generation may be relatively more attractive to investors because-unlike wind generation-peak power prices are often strongly correlated to natural gas prices. The analysis in this report recognizes that the potential value of risk mitigation associated with wind generation and natural gas generation may depend on whether one considers the consumer's perspective or the investor's perspective and whether the market is regulated or deregulated. We analyze the risk and return trade-offs for wind and natural gas generation for deregulated markets based on hourly prices and load over a 10-year period using historical data in the PJM Interconnection (PJM)2 from 1999 to 2008. Similar analysis is then simulated and evaluated for regulated markets under certain assumptions. Estimating the absolute value, as opposed to the relative value, of variance reduction will also depend on assumptions about risk aversion and other consumer preferences, such as loss aversion, and this is discussed. Some key observations include: In a deregulated market such as PJM, • Returns for natural gas generation are partially hedged because power prices are often set by natural gas generation, though with significant seasonal variations. • Returns for wind generation are better hedged than natural gas generation because wind often operates in off-peak hours, where power prices are much less volatile and less correlated with natural gas prices, whereas natural gas generation operation is focused more heavily during peak hours.3 • The impact of incremental net revenue from tax credits, such as production tax credits (PTCs) or other sources of revenue, can have a significant impact on the risk return relationship. In PJM over this period with credits, wind was found to be dominant in terms of risk and reward; that is, it had both greatest returns and the lowest risk, as measured by standard deviation of returns. • More generally, without PTCs investors may benefit from investing in both wind and natural gas generation, with the optimal mixture depending on the investor's risk aversion (and perhaps also loss aversion) preferences due to well-known lack of correlation effects. • While the opportunity for investors to diversify in broader markets may reduce some of the variance reduction benefits of investing in different electric technologies, it is unlikely to completely eliminate these benefits in the electric sector where power prices are often very volatile and positively skewed, which has implications for financial distress. • Consumers, especially smaller commercial and residential consumers, may benefit from reductions in the variance of electricity prices due to risk aversion and loss aversion effects.4 • The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of different technologies is not directly comparable if they operate in different hours because the value of electricity differs significantly throughout each day. This variation reflects the daily load profile, with hourly load and hourly power prices also showing strong seasonal effects. This effect can be seen in our analysis of PJM data when comparing the difference in the average annualized hourly price of variable wind generation and dispatchable natural gas generation. In a regulated market: • The inherent nature of regulated markets means that producers earn, with some caveats, a utility-designated rate of return. A consequence of this is that the risk associated with fuel costs is passed on to the consumer. The ""cost-plus"" nature of regulation means that consumers also bear some increased risk associated with poor investment decisions. Consumers are partly compensated for this because the producer may be willing to accept a lower expected rate of return compared to deregulated markets. • For consumers, who are generally risk averse, the reduced variation in electricity prices (and hence consumer costs) because of wind's lack of correlation with other system costs should have value (as has been suggested by others). Loss aversion also may place a value on variance reduction of electricity prices and consumer costs. • Simplified mean variance cost optimization techniques using annualized LCOEs for the power sector often fail because the assets within the portfolio are too dissimilar (e.g., baseload versus peaking or either of these versus a variable or non-dispatchable resources such as wind or solar). • A variance reduction-based technique could, however, be used more broadly under more sophisticated representation of system costs where the hourly operation of the technologies is modeled more explicitly. Specifically for a regulated electric system, the concept of lowest-cost planning could be refined to have an array of ""least-cost planning"" solutions corresponding to different variances, where the values of the expected annualized system cost and the standard deviation of the annualized system cost are physical properties of the electric system that are completely independent of any risk or loss aversion preferences. The value of variance reduction could then reflect both risk aversion and loss aversion. We discuss explicitly how to estimate the difference in the economic utility between alternative system-based, expected cost- cost variance choices, including the impact of the distribution being positively skewed toward higher costs. In conclusion, we should point out that while some of the observations and findings may be generally applicable, others are empirical observations for a specific location and a specific time period under specific technology cost and performance assumptions.5 © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To capture their nonlinear behavior, wind turbines are often modeled using parameter-varying models. In this chapter, a framework for modelling and controller design of wind turbines is presented. We specifically consider variable-speed, variable-pitch wind turbines with faults on actuators and sensors. Linear parameter-varying (LPV) controllers can be designed by a proposed method that allows the inclusion of faults in the LPV controller design. Moreover, the controller structure can be arbitrarily chosen: static output feedback, dynamic (reduced order) output feedback, decentralized, among others. The controllers are scheduled on an estimated wind speed to manage the parametervarying nature of the model and on information from a fault diagnosis system. The optimization problems involved in the controller synthesis are solved by an iterative LMI-based algorithm. The resulting controllers can also be easily implemented in practice due to low data storage and simple math operations. The performance of the LPV controllers is assessed by nonlinear simulations results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Several research studies forwarded the possibility of incorporating microencapsu-lated PCM in plastering mortars for building façades, in pursuit of increased energy efficiency associated with the heat storage capacity of PCM. However, most of these studies are centred in the use of a single type of PCM, which is bound to be more adequate for a given season of the year (e.g. winter or summer) than for all the seasons. The study proposed in this work regards the evaluation of the possibility of using more than one kind of PCM, with distinct melting ranges, here termed as hybrid PCMs, in plastering mortars, to achieve adequately advantageous performance in all seasons of the year. To characterize the PCM, the specific enthalpy and phase change temperature should be adequately measured. The main purpose of this study was to show the conceptual feasibility of combining PCMs in mortars and to evaluate the behaviour of the resulting mortars with differential scanning calorimeter. The results showed that the behaviour of the mortar that contains more than one type of PCM can be predicted through the superposition of effects of the independent PCMs and no interaction occurs between them. The knowledge obtained from the experimental testing established bases for a framework of numerical simulation of real-scale applications, which can be used to ascertain the feasibility of the hybrid PCM concept for decreases in energy consumption of heating/cooling demands in the buildings. © The Author(s) 2014.","Calorimetry testing; Hybrid PCM; Microencapsulation; Mortar; Phase change materials (PCM)","Calorimeters; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Enthalpy; Heat storage; Hybrid materials; Microencapsulation; Mortar; Differential scanning calorimeters; Experimental testing; Heat storage capacity; Hybrid PCM; Phase change temperature; Plastering mortar; Specific enthalpy; Temperature function; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907531054

TBA formation in WSF-added patties was reduced approximately by as much as 20% when compared to that of the control at the 180th day of the storage, while favourable results were detectable in the storage period at +4 °C. Again, up to 4% WSF1 or WSF2 incorporation gave acceptable sensorial scores to the beef patties.

They must provide power quality, shaving of load change, coordination of distributed power systems, bulk energy storage, and end-user reliability, e.g., uninterrupted power supply. In present paper the configuration and design of experimental ESS based on both Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors have been proposed. Such a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) includes three main components: Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and grid interconnection consisting of two invertors and control and monitoring system. Energy storage capacity of developed HESS prototype is 100 kWh, nominal power - 100 kW, peak power - 200 kW. HESS was created and tested within the experimental facility also including 1.5 MW gas turbine power plant, 200 kW controllable active and reactive loads, and control and measurement system. Experimental results showed that HESS successfully provides the following advantages: (i) suppression of voltage, current, and frequency disturbances in the grid; (ii) compensation of reactive power in the circuit; and (iii) uninterrupted power supply. Cost analysis of proposed hybrid system has also been carried out. In comparison with battery ESS without supercapacitors, HESS showed longer life time, lower cost, and higher peak power. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Energy storage; Hybrid; Li-ion battery; Micro grid; Smart grid; Supercapacitor","Battery storage; Cost benefit analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Gas turbine power plants; Hybrid systems; Ions; Smart power grids; Supercapacitor; Uninterruptible power systems; Control and monitoring systems; Distributed power systems; Hybrid; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Micro grid; Smart grid; Uninterrupted power supply; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899417913

Background data: Water is the main media and fluid found in ocular tissues. Water is also an important photoacceptor and energy storage medium. Eyes are abundantly exposed to environmental radiant energy. Therefore, multiple light-energy-absorption mechanisms may exist, including those associated with the recently discovered fourth phase of water, known as EZ. Methods: Retrospective analysis of published data indicative of EZ phenomena related, in this first communication, to the retina and optic nerve (ON), using surgical microscopy and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Images showing removal of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) aided by preservative-free triamcinolone acetonide (TA) during macular hole surgery show continuous whitish lines indicative of water-layer ordering at the interface between collagen matrices and TA crystals. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) results further exhibit an axis parallel to the ON, which may be an ocular expression of the EZ linked to the steady potential of the eye. Conclusions: Although existing results are still being decoded and analyzed in light of the state of the art studies of light-water interactions, they suggest a new understanding of the eye's bioenergetic environment, which may have deep implications in ocular physiology as well as in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of blinding diseases using light-based therapies such as photobiomodulation. Research is needed to confirm the interpretation of these findings and validate potential ophthalmic applications. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Apparent diffusion coefficient; Collagen matrices; Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging; Macular hole surgery; Photobiomodulation; Retrospective analysis; State of the art; Triamcinolone acetonide; Acetone; Communication; Diagnosis; Diffusion; Disease control; Eye protection; Ophthalmology; Surgery; Water absorption; water; human; light; photobiology; visual system function; Humans; Light; Ocular Physiological Phenomena; Photobiology; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898071193

Direct activation of AMPK has been highlighted as a potential novel, and possibly safer, alternative to treat type II diabetes and obesity. In this study, we aimed to design and characterize novel peptides that mimic the αG region of the α2 AMPK catalytic domain to modulate its activity by inhibiting interactions between AMPK domains or other interacting proteins. The derived peptides were tested in vivo and in tissue culture. The computationally predicted structure of the free peptide with the addition of the myristoyl (Myr) or acetyl (Ac) moiety closely resembled the protein structure that it was designed to mimic. Myr-peptide and Ac-peptide activated AMPK in muscle cells and led to reduced adipose tissue weight, body weight, blood glucose levels, insulin levels, and insulin resistance index, as expected from AMPK activation. In addition, triglyceride, cholesterol, leptin, and adiponectin levels were also lower, suggesting increased adipose tissue breakdown, a result of AMPK activation. On the other hand, liver weight and liver lipid content increased due to fat retention.We could not find an elevated pAMPK:AMPK ratio in the liver in vivo or in hepatocytes ex vivo, suggesting that the peptide does not lead to AMPK activation in hepatocytes. The finding that an AMPK-derived peptide leads to the activation of AMPK in muscle cells and in adipose tissue and leads to reduced glucose levels in obese mice, but to fat accumulation in the liver, demonstrates the differential effect of AMPK modulation in various tissues. © 2014 Society for Endocrinology.","AMPK; Metabolism; Obesity; Peptides","5 amino 4 imidazolecarboxamide riboside; acetic acid derivative; acetyl peptide; adiponectin; agents affecting metabolism; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; leptin; lipid emulsion; metformin; myristoyl peptide; peptide; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body weight; cell differentiation; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; drug design; enzyme activation; enzyme active site; ex vivo study; fatty acid synthesis; food intake; glucose blood level; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lipid liver level; lipid storage; liver cell; liver weight; male; molecular dynamics; mouse; myoblast; myotube; nonhuman; priority journal; protein conformation; protein domain; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; protein structure; tissue culture; triacylglycerol blood level; weight reduction; AMPK; metabolism; obesity; peptides; Adipose Tissue; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Blood Glucose; Down-Regulation; Fats; Humans; Insulin; Liver; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Obese; Obesity; Peptides; Protein Structure, Tertiary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897871640

If the concentration of oxygen is too low or that of carbon dioxide too high, a fermentation metabolism is induced that causes the production of off-flavours, results in insufficient energy supply, leading to cell collapse and consequent tissue browning and cavity formation. The microstructural arrangement of cells and intercellular spaces in the apple create specific pathways for transport of the respiratory gasses oxygen and carbon dioxide. We used X-ray CT to characterise the changes in the microstructure of 'Braeburn' apple during the development of internal storage disorders. Multiscale modeling was applied to understand the changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and respiration and fermentation rates in the apple during the disorder development in controlled atmosphere storage of 'Braeburn' apple fruit. The 3D microstructure geometries of healthy, brown tissue and tissue with cavities were created to solve the micro-scale gas-exchange model for O2 and CO2 using the finite volume method. The apparent gas diffusivities of the tissue were calculated and implemented in the macroscale geometry of healthy and disordered apples to study in detail the changes in the respiratory metabolism of the fruit. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One hundred twenty free-range hens, divided into two groups, were used in the experiment. The experimental treatment group of 60 hens had access to permanent grassland, whereas the control group only had access to a range without grass. The feed dosages were determined according to the metabolisable energy (ME) requirements, calculated based on body weight, the performance of the hens and the air temperature. Compared with the control group, the grazing hens received a 9% lower dose of ME, which included wheat and balancer diet, to ensure pasture intake. Lyophilised permanent pasture contained 128. mg/kg dry matter (DM) of lutein, 115. mg/kg DM of zeaxanthin, 75. mg/kg DM of α-tocopherol and 79. mg/kg DM of β-carotene. Grazing by hens, together with sequential feeding of whole wheat and a balancer mixed diet, significantly increased (P<0.001) the egg concentrations of lutein (by 260. μg), zeaxanthin (by 174. μg), α-tocopherol (by 270. μg) and β-carotene (by 2. μg) relative to the control group. The colour of the egg yolks of the grazing hens was assigned a Roche Yolk Colour Fan score of 10.3. Grazing, together with sequential feeding, resulted in the production of eggs with increased oxidative stability measured after storage at 18. °C for 28 days.

In order to increase the thermal storage capacity of the working fluid, phase change materials of 7% concentration was incorporated in the analysis. Lauric acid was used as phase change materials, and water was considered as the carrier fluid in the channel. The performance and pump power loss parameters were introduced to assess the thermal performance of the volumetric solar absorption system. It is found that the performance parameter attained the highest value for the absorber plate location at the top of the channel, which was about 10% higher than those corresponding to the other locations.

The energy resource management has the objective to obtain the optimal scheduling of the available resources considering distributed generators, storage units, demand response and EVs. The large number of resources causes more complexity in the energy resource management, taking several hours to reach the optimal solution which requires a quick solution for the next day. Therefore, it is necessary to use adequate optimization techniques to determine the best solution in a reasonable amount of time.This paper presents a hybrid artificial intelligence technique to solve a complex energy resource management problem with a large number of resources, including EVs, connected to the electric network. The hybrid approach combines simulated annealing (SA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) techniques. The case study concerns different EVs penetration levels. Comparisons with a previous SA approach and a deterministic technique are also presented. For 2000 EVs scenario, the proposed hybrid approach found a solution better than the previous SA version, resulting in a cost reduction of 1.94%. For this scenario, the proposed approach is approximately 94 times faster than the deterministic approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ant colony optimization; Electric vehicle; Energy resource management; Hybridization; Simulated annealing; Virtual power player","Artificial intelligence; Circuit theory; Complex networks; Cost reduction; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Simulated annealing; Vehicles; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Deterministic technique; Energy resource managements; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Hybrid simulated annealing; Hybridization; Optimization techniques; Virtual power players; Ant colony optimization; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy resource; optimization; resource availability; resource management; simulated annealing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895921647

Decanoic acid (capric acid) is an environmentally friendly fatty acid since it is obtained from vegetable and animal oils. MicroPCMs were prepared with different capsule wall materials via a one-step in situ polymerization technique. The properties of microencapsulated PCMs have been analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra analysis and particle size analyzer. The microPCMs prepared using Poly(urea-formaldehyde) (PUF) exhibit higher heat capacities and the microPCMs prepared using Poly(melamine-formaldehyde) (PMF) exhibit higher thermal stabilities. In order to obtain microPCMs with better properties such as suitable latent heat and better heat resistance at high temperatures, we microencapsulated decanoic acid with Poly (melamine-urea-formaldehyde) (PMUF). Furthermore, the effects of surfactants on microPCMs with PMUF were investigated by SEM, a particle size analyzer, DSC, and TGA. The results show that the binary surfactant system was a suitable emulsifier for this process. We determined that the melting temperature was close to 33 C, the latent heat storage capacity was about 88 J/g, and the mean particle diameter was 0.28 μm for microPCMs with PMUF. We recommend decanoic acid microencapsulated with PMUF for thermally stable and leakage-free applications above 95 C. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The study concerns structural aspects and the chemical composition of the two bentonites (Bents). The effect of Na, Ca and K enrichment on cationic exchange capacity (CEC), specific surface area (SSA), dehydration and cation bonding selectivity has been examined. Results show that the BentMag contains more montmorillonite (Mt) and fewer impurities than BentMos. Ca and K treatments confer higher CEC and SSA to BentMag compared to BentMos. However, with Na treatment the two materials have similar CEC and SSA values. Nevertheless these values are higher compared to Ca and K treatments.Thermodynamic investigation shows that the dehydration energy is more important with Ca-treated bentonites than Na and K-treated one. Unlike BentMos, BentMag possesses the ability to retain water beyond 200. °C. The results of hydration kinetics studies show that water absorption is faster with Ca treatment, whereas the Na treatment allows a higher retention capacity of water. Also, higher vertical compaction of Na treated BentMag reduces its ability to retain water compared to Na treated BentMos which has less Mt. © 2014.","Algerian bentonite; Cations exchange capacity; Differential scanning calorimetry; Nuclear waste; Specific surface area",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894465032

Biogas is becoming an increasingly important source of clean energy for rural and urban areas in developing countries, as can be seen by the increased construction of biodigesters. Biogas digester technology has been domesticated in Nigeria and a number of pilot biogas plants have been built with majority (over 75%) of operational Nigerian manure digesters on piggery, cattle farms or abattoirs. A trend is now seen among academic institutions in Nigeria in the design and construction of biogas digesters, for instance, the Usman Danfodio University Biogas Plant, the Obafemi Awolowo University plant, the University of Ibadan prototype (with a patent), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Private sector involvement, which shows increasing interest and availability of biogas technology. Biogas is a renewable fuel that is 60-70% methane and can be used to power household appliances and generate electricity using appropriate technologies. These technologies include Biogas digesters which are being used to collect farm animal waste and convert it to biogas through anaerobic bacterial processes. The biogas generated is enriched through a process of scrubbing to obtain at least 95% purity. The current research focus of the authors towards improving biogas yield, enrichment, compression and storage for use in Nigeria is discussed.

We have examined the interplay between glycogenolysis and the bioenergetics of astrocytic Ca2+ homeostasis, by analyzing interdependency of glycogen and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), a mechanism in cellular signaling that maintains high endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ concentration and thus provides the basis for store-dependent Ca2+ signaling. We stimulated SOCE in primary cultures of murine cerebellar and cortical astrocytes, and determined glycogen content to investigate the effects of SOCE on glycogen metabolism. By blocking glycogenolysis, we tested energetic dependency of SOCE-related Ca2+ dynamics on glycogenolytic ATP. Our results show that SOCE triggers astrocytic glycogenolysis. Upon inhibition of adenylate cyclase with 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, glycogen content was no longer significantly different from that in unstimulated control cells, indicating that SOCE triggers astrocytic glycogenolysis in a cAMP-dependent manner. When glycogenolysis was inhibited in cortical astrocytes by 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol, the amount of Ca2+ loaded into ER via sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2-ATPase (SERCA) was reduced, which suggests that SERCA pumps preferentially metabolize glycogenolytic ATP. Our study demonstrates SOCE as a novel pathway in stimulating astrocytic glycogenolysis.

Most of the MAVs developed to date are based on electrical motors. In the present study, several potential alternative energy storage/power systems are examined, evaluated for their specific energy and specific power, and compared to electrical batteries and hydrocarbon fuel storage. Analysis of the power and energy requirements of different MAV configurations, suggests that a specific power of 35-60 W/kg for fixed wing MAV and 65-85 W/kg for rotary wing MAV are needed. The required specific energy for a short mission of 20 min is 15-25 W h/kg for fixed wing MAV and 30-40 W h/kg for rotary wing MAV. Based on these requirements, a novel PCM open-cycle storage/power system is proposed. It comprises of an open cycle that uses the ambient temperature as its hot reservoir. Promising initial results, in terms of specific power (45-70 W/kg), specific energy (24-45 W h/kg) and open-cycle thermodynamic efficiency (22-54%), are presented. Owing to the high potential of the proposed PCM open-cycle, we believe that the development of new PCM materials specifically designed for this purpose is highly deserving. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, it was hypothesized that the zirconate coupling agent modified surface would promote higher and more stable shear bond strength than a surface treated with tribochemical coating only. Secondly, the modified surface would retain its bond strength after artificial aging. The shear bond strength between a resin composite bonded to surface treated zirconia was measured. Hydrolytic stability of this bond was verified after water storage while the interface chemistry was evaluated using energy dispersive x-ray analysis. Surface treatment showed significantly greater shear bond strength compared with no treatment before artificial aging while specific surface treatments showed higher shear bond strength compared with no treatment after artificial aging. The predominant mode of failure after shear bond testing was adhesive. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis at the surface revealed elemental C1s, O1s, Si1s and Zr2p. As a result, tribochemical silica-coating followed by application of a zirconate coupling agent was suggested to create a successful a resin-to-zirconia bonding.

Combined wind and pumped-storage ""virtual power plants"", called hybrid power stations (HPS), constitute a realistic and feasible option to achieve high penetrations, provided that their components are properly sized. In this paper, the optimum sizing is investigated for a pumped storage HPS operating in an island system. The analysis addresses the sizing of the main HPS components (hydro turbines, pumps, wind farm, reservoirs), adopting either the investor's perspective, where the objective is to maximize the return on the HPS investment, or a system perspective, where the optimization target is the maximization of RES penetration, along with maintaining the lowest possible generation cost in the system. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied for the optimization and a real isolated island power system is used as a study case. The adopted operating policy and pricing principles, which critically affect the optimal sizing of an HPS project, are based on the existing regulatory framework for storage stations in Greek islands. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Hybrid power station; Island system; Multi-objective optimization; Optimum sizing; Pumped storage; Wind power","Genetic algorithm (GAs); Hybrid power stations; Island system; Optimum sizing; Pumped Storage; Regulatory frameworks; Renewable energy source; Virtual power plants; Economics; Electric utilities; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Wind power; Power plants; genetic algorithm; island biogeography; optimization; power plant; pump; wind power; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888397975

The important aspect of water resources developments used for hydro electrical power. Water use for hydro electrical power gave more advantage because it would decrease the use of gasoline. Restriction of surface water resources and higher cost of hydraulic structures intensify the need for an optimum capacity and operation for reservoir system. Thus, it was needed to allocate the water use as efficient as possible. To reach this target, it was needed to make a system model for optimization. Optimization analysis would give more information for allocating water of each objective function. Optimization of hydro electrical energy was carried out for yearly reservoir. Selorejo reservoir is yearly reservoir was the reservoir which could reserve water during the rainy season than it was used in the dry season. For this kind of reservoir, inflow was not the same as outflow. The methodology consisted of optimization energy which was due to turbine discharge and head of hydro electrical power.

Using this information, a model for the absorption kinetics and thermal behavior of the hydrogen storage system was proposed. This model could be used in the design of Ni-catalyzed magnesium storage tanks and other applications. It considers the independent contribution of three variables: temperature, pressure and reacted fraction to estimate the hydrogen absorption rate.

All relevant transport phenomena were treated in detail and the kinetic model developed previously by the authors was introduced into the algorithm. In this paper the reactive solution was modelled as a two phase flow; with this approach the impact of the hydrogen production on the solution stirring could be observed and quantified. Results showed that not all ruthenium deposited on the nickel foam was used efficiently as catalyst. In fact, most of the reaction occurred in the surface of the catalyst foam and around 70% of the deposited catalyst was not used. The influence of the catalyst foam position in the solution and the design of the perforated plastic support were analysed in order to find the optimum experimental conditions. It was also demonstrated the importance of the two phase flow approach for a correct simulation of the solution stirring and heat transfer. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The protonic conductivity of the composite membranes at 20% relative humidity (RH) and 40 C is up to 1.5 orders of magnitude higher than for Nafion®. The magnitude of the effect decreases with increasing humidity, with the best composite attaining 0.03 S cm -1 at 120 C/40% RH, 3 times more than Nafion®.

Each species has a certain depth range within which different individuals (of the same life stage and sex) are found. Lipids are accumulated in many calanoid copepods for energy storage and reproduction. Lipid content in some species increases with depth, however studies so far focused mostly on temperate and high-latitude seasonal vertically migrating copepods and compared lipid contents among individuals either from coarse layers or between diapausing, deep-dwelling copepods and individuals found in the photic, near-surface layer. Here we examined whether lipid contents of individual calanoid copepods of the same species, life stage/sex differ between finer depth layers within the upper water column of subtropical and Arctic seas. A total of 6 calanoid species were collected from samples taken at precise depths within the photic layer in both cold eutrophic and warm oligotrophic environments using SCUBA diving, MOCNESS and Multinet. Measurements of lipid content were obtained from digitized photographs of the collected individuals. The results revealed significant differences in lipid content across depth differences as small as 12-15 meters for Mecynocera clausi C5 and Ctenocalanus vanus C5 (Red Sea), Clausocalanus furcatus males and two clausocalanid C5s (Mediterranean Sea), and Calanus glacialis C5 (Arctic). We suggest two possible explanations for the differences in lipid content with depth on such a fine scale: predator avoidance and buoyancy. © 2014 Zarubin et al.",,"chlorophyll a; lipid; sea water; article; Calanus glacialis; Clausocalanus furcatus; copepod; Ctenocalanus vanus; female; intraspecific variation; male; Mecynocera clausi; nonhuman; population density; salinity; sex difference; water temperature; animal; Arctic; copepod; growth, development and aging; life cycle stage; lipid metabolism; metabolism; oceanography; temperature; tropic climate; Animals; Arctic Regions; Copepoda; Female; Life Cycle Stages; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Oceanography; Population Density; Seawater; Sex Factors; Temperature; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899743533

However, production efficiency needs to be improved. Increasing cellular lipid levels by nitrogen depletion is one of the most studied strategies. Despite this, the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms of this response have not been well defined. Algae species adapted to hypersaline conditions can be cultivated in salty waters which are not useful for agriculture or consumption. Due to their inherent extreme cultivation conditions, use of hypersaline algae species is better suited for avoiding culture contamination issues. In this study, we identified a new halophilic Dunaliella salina strain by using 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We found that growth and biomass productivities of this strain were directly related to nitrogen levels, as the highest biomass concentration under 0.05 mM or 5 mM nitrogen regimes were 495 mg/l and 1409 mg/l, respectively. We also confirmed that nitrogen limitation increased cellular lipid content up to 35% under 0.05 mM nitrogen concentration. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms of this phenomenon, we applied fluorometric, flow cytometric and spectrophotometric methods to measure oxidative stress and enzymatic defence mechanisms. Under nitrogen depleted cultivation conditions, we observed increased lipid peroxidation by measuring an important oxidative stress marker, malondialdehyde and enhanced activation of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase antioxidant enzymes. These observations indicated that oxidative stress is accompanied by increased lipid content in the green alga. In addition, we also showed that at optimum cultivation conditions, inducing oxidative stress by application of exogenous H2O2 leads to increased cellular lipid content up to 44% when compared with non-treated control groups. Our results support that oxidative stress and lipid overproduction are linked. Importantly, these results also suggest that oxidative stress mediates lipid accumulation. Understanding such relationships may provide guidance for efficient production of algal biodiesels. © 2014 Yilancioglu et al.",,"ascorbate peroxidase; biodiesel; carotenoid; catalase; chlorophyll; hydrogen peroxide; malonaldehyde; reactive oxygen metabolite; RNA 18S; superoxide dismutase; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; algal protein; antioxidant; nitrogen; pigment; algal cell culture; algal growth; article; biomass conversion; biomass distribution; biomass production; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; concentration response; controlled study; depletion; Dunaliella salina; Dunaliella tertiolecta; enzymatic assay; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; fluorometry; halophile; lipid analysis; lipid peroxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; microbial biomass; new species; nitrogen concentration; nitrogen depletion; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; protein determination; RNA sequence; species comparison; spectrophotometry; strain identification; biomass; drug effects; enzymology; fluorescence microscopy; green alga; growth, development and aging; lipid metabolism; metabolism; molecular genetics; phylogeny; toxicity; Algal Proteins; Antioxidants; Biomass; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorophyta; Flow Cytometry; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lipid Metabolism; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Molecular Sequence Data; Nitrogen; Oxidative Stress; Phylogeny; Pigments, Biological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907491076

In such cases, the internal combustion engine consumes the fuel but the mechanical energy is not used by the drive system. The amount of fuel that is consumed in this time by the engine can potentially be saved if the car is equipped with a Stop-Start system. Start-Stop system automatically shuts down and restarts the internal combustion engine due to strategy used by controller reducing this way toxic compounds emissions in exhaust gasses and the fuel consumption, which is directly connected to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The paper presents an analysis of the potential reduction in CO2 emissions for selected vehicles with Start-Stop system during operation in selected urban agglomeration using different strategies to control this system.

The interlayer distance of GOH is found to increase with oxygen content, given by the number of hydroxyl groups. Four types of GOHs were considered, with O/C ratio within a 0.09-0.38 range. In the case of the highest O/C ratio considered, 0.38, a spontaneous redox-reaction between hydroxyl groups delivering a water molecule and an epoxy group was found. Thus, GOHs with high O/C ratio are not recommended for hydrogen storage. In these materials the absorption energy values of hydrogen is in the range of -0.2 and -0.5 eV/molecule, that is within the values expected to allow an efficient storage. The best GOH for hydrogen storage was found to be that with a 0.09 O/C ratio since it has the largest void space and adequate absorption energy, -0.52 eV/molecule. On the other hand, oxygen absorption energy is lower in absolute value than that of hydrogen, which favors absorption of the latter, thus creating adequate conditions for its storage without oxygen interference. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

LTDH can be distributed from the return water in the existing network which results in enhanced utilization and increased capacity of the existing infrastructure. A project funded by the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme (EUDP) on LTDH has developed a concept for an energy efficient DHW solution with a hot water storage tank on the primary side which is charged by DH water that is partially heated by means of a heat pump integrated into a traditional LTDH unit. In respect to electricity consumption the COP for DHW is between three and four times higher, as the main heat for the DHW preparation comes from the supply temperature of 40°C.",,"Combined heat and power plants; Electrical efficiency; Electricity-consumption; Energy technologies; Heating substations; Hot water storage tanks; Supply temperatures; Ultra low temperatures; Energy efficiency; Heat pump systems; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896866330

The antenna features an integrated flexible solar harvesting system, consisting of a flexible solar cell, a power management system, and energy storage. All these components are judiciously positioned on the antenna platform in order not to affect its radiation performance. The measured reflection coefficients and radiation characteristics after bending and deploying the antenna on a human body prove that the antenna is well suited for on-body use. A measured on-body antenna gain and radiation efficiency of 5.0 dBi and 89% are realized. Measurements in a real-life situation have demonstrated the ability to scavenge a maximum of 53 mW by means of a single integrated flexible solar cell. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; energy management; energy storage; substrate integrated waveguide (SIW); textile antenna; wearable antenna","Flexible solar cells; Industrial , scientific and medical bands; Power management systems; Radiation characteristics; Radiation efficiency; Radiation performance; Substrate integrated waveguide technologies; Textile antennas; Energy harvesting; Energy management; Energy storage; Microwave circuits; Solar cells; Substrate integrated waveguides; Textile industry; Textiles; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wearable antennas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896849383

Because of the rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of NSC after harvest, plants are usually placed into liquid nitrogen until subsequent analyses in the laboratory. Nevertheless, when the research is performed in poorly accessible regions such as high mountains, tropical forests or deserts, the use of heavy containers containing vaporizing liquid nitrogen is problematic for logistical reasons. These places are particularly interesting as they harbor plant species with interesting physiological adaptations. In our study we aimed to develop a suitable storage method for plants intended for NSC analyses, which would require minimal equipment. These demands resulted in the idea of using the first step in NSC analyses – extraction in ethanol. Samples were extracted in 50 % and 96 % boiling or non-boiling ethanol and then stored for one month; they were compared with samples immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. We discovered that for samples containing starch, fructans, soluble sugars and sugar alcohols, the best pretreatment for subsequent storage is extraction in 50 % or 96 % boiling ethanol. For total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) assessment, only extracting with 50 % ethanol without boiling gave very good results. Finally, we developed a method that could be used in any remote place without bulky laboratory equipment. © 2013, Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.","Ethanol extraction; Liquid nitrogen; Nonstructural carbohydrates; Plant tissue storage","carbohydrate; ethanol; nitrogen; physiology; plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957430004

This alloy is used for solid-state memory applications. In 0.3Ge15Sb85 alloy exhibits an amorphous-crystalline transition temperature (Tc) that is slightly higher than that of Ge15Sb85 alloy, which may lead to an improvement in its data retention time and thermal stability. AC conductivity measurements demonstrate that the conductivity of In0.3Ge 15Sb85 thin films is thermally activated with an activation energy of 0.32 eV. The optical transmission spectrum shows that the optical bandgap is Eg = 0.44 eV. The reported data reveals the presence of a Fermi level in the vicinity of the valance-band localized states. The capacitance-voltage measurements were performed for a sweep voltage from -20 to +20 V at different temperatures. At low temperatures, the capacitance is electric-field independent and the crystallization is growth limited while the capacitance is electric field dependent at temperatures close to Tc. The reported data show that modifying Ge15Sb85 alloy with indium causes a significant increase in the electrical conductivity of the film that makes the capacitance always negative.

In hybrid caches, migration-based techniques have been proposed. A migration technique dynamically moves write-intensive and read-intensive data between STT-RAM and SRAM to explore the advantages of hybrid cache. Meanwhile, migrations also introduce extra reads and writes during data movements. For stencil loops with read and write data dependencies, we observe that migration overhead is significant, and migrations closely correlate to the interleaved read and write memory access pattern in a memory block. This paper proposes a loop retiming framework during compilation to reduce the migration overhead by changing the interleaved memory access pattern. With the proposed loop retiming technique, the interleaved memory accesses can be significantly reduced so that migration overhead is mitigated, and energy efficiency of hybrid cache is significantly improved. The experimental results have shown that, with the proposed methods, on average, the migration number is reduced up to 27.1% and the cache dynamic energy is reduced up to 14.0%. © 2013 IEEE.","Embedded systems; energy; hybrid cache; loop retiming; migration; STT-RAM","energy; Hybrid caches; migration; Retiming; Stt rams; Cost reduction; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Static random access storage; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897667035

The proposed strategy is capable of preventing overvoltage situations during high PV generation periods, by the use of locally controlled battery energy storage systems (ESS) at the PV system grid interface. The traditional way of operating a domestic ESS is based on charging the battery as soon as the PV generation exceeds the consumption, without taking into account overvoltage events during high PV generation hours; the proposed storage concept improves the traditional approach, thanks to the provision of voltage support. A novel method, based on voltage sensitivity analysis, identifies a common power threshold that triggers the ESSs activation in the feeder. A Belgian residential LV feeder is used as a case study.

This created new challenges associated with the variability and uncertainty of these sources. Handling these two characteristics is a key issue that includes technological, regulatory, and computational aspects. Advanced tools for handling RES maximize the resultant benefits and keep the reliability indices at the required level. Recent advances in forecasting and management algorithms provided means to manage RES. Forecasts of renewable generation for the next hours/days play a crucial role in the management tools and protocols of the system operator. These forecasts are used as input for setting reserve requirements and performing the unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch (ED) processes. Probabilistic forecasts are being included in the management tools, enabling a move from deterministic to stochastic methods, which conduct to robust solutions. On the technological side, advances to increase mid-merit and base-load generation flexibility should be a priority. The use of storage devices to mitigate uncertainty and variability is particularly valuable for isolated power system, whereas in interconnected systems, economic criteria might be a barrier to invest in new storage facilities. The possibility of sending active and reactive control set points to RES power plants offers more flexibility. Furthermore, the emergence of the smart grid concept and the increasing share of controllable loads contribute with flexibility to increase the RES penetration levels. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Computational aspects; Generation flexibilities; Greenhouse-gas emissions; Isolated power system; Power systems operation; Probabilistic forecasts; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty and variability; Electric power systems; Global warming; Proven reserves; Scheduling; Solar energy; Tools; Virtual storage; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893810819

Luís Reis Santos, 3030-788 Coimbra, Portugal","This article aims to assess: i) the carbon footprint (CF) of particleboard produced in Portugal, and ii) the influence of different methodological issues in the particleboard CF calculation by comparing four CF methodologies (ISO/TS 14067; GHG Protocol Product Standard; PAS 2050; Climate Declaration). A life-cycle model was developed for particleboard (functional unit: 1 m 3). Both cradle-to-gate and cradle-to-grave (end-of-life scenarios: incineration and landfill) assessments were performed. Six methods to assess delayed emissions were analyzed. The main methodological differences between the CF methodologies are the treatment of biogenic CO2, multifunctionality, and unit process exclusions (e.g. capital goods). A wide range of CFs was calculated: -939 to 188 kg CO2 eq/m3 (cradle-to-gate); 107 to 201 kg CO2 eq/m3 (cradle-to-grave; incineration) and -692 to 433 kg CO2 eq/m 3 (cradle-to-grave; landfill). The inclusion (negative CF) or exclusion (positive CF) of biogenic carbon storage in the reported CF dominated the differences in results and the ranking of end-of-life scenarios strongly depended on that assumption. ISO/TS 14067, the GHG Protocol and PAS 2050 explicitly include both emissions and removals of biogenic CO2 in the CF calculation. On the other hand, the Climate Declaration does not account for biogenic CO2 or carbon storage, which may bias the comparison with competing products that do not store biogenic carbon (e.g. fossil-based materials). The CF of particleboard was also very sensitive to the different approaches to deal with multifunctionality in the incineration process by the various CF methodologies. Moreover, although not mandatory, delayed emission accounting significantly affected the results for the incineration scenario. Capital goods accounted for 12-20% of the CF. Future guidelines for wood-based panels, such as Product Category Rules, should, therefore, require that carbon storage is assessed and reported, accounting of waste-to-energy burdens is harmonized and capital goods are included. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is in this context that the present research work lies to focus on the numerical study of the transient hydrodynamic, heat and mass transfer in a salinity gradient solar pond. The problem is tackled using the dimensionless governing equations of Navier-Stokes, thermal energy and mass transfer, which are solved numerically by finite-volume method to provide the temperature, concentration and velocity fields in transient regime. The pond is filled with salty water of various salinities to form three zones of salty water: Upper Convective Zone (UCZ), Non-Convective Zone (NCZ) and Lower Convective Zone (LCZ). To prevent convective movements induced by the internal heating of salty water due to solar radiation absorption, a salinity gradient is used in the solar pond. Representative results illustrating the influence of internal Rayleigh number on the thermal performance of the pond and the effect of the aspect ratio on the distribution of temperature and velocity fields in the salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) are discussed. In addition, results for the transient average temperature of UCZ and LCZ are presented and discussed for various parametric conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A control system of the ground heat storing is integrated in a chapel greenhouse located in the premises of the Technology and Research Energy Center, Tunis, Tunisia. Polypropylene capillary heat exchangers, suspended in the air and buried into the ground of the greenhouse, are used to store or destore solar energy excess. During the day, the air-suspended exchangers recuperate the solar energy in excess. This recuperated energy is then stored into the ground through the buried exchangers. At night the stored thermal energy is brought back by the suspended exchangers to heat the greenhouse air. The purpose of this study is to contribute in the greenhouse microclimate control. In order to maintain the greenhouse air temperature at 20 C, suitable for a defined agriculture, the solar energy and the cold water are respectively used for heating and cooling the greenhouse inside air. The design and construction of a chapel greenhouse equipped with the control system is carried out. The studied system is used, at the same time for; heating, cooling the greenhouse air and storing the solar energy in excess.

The problems of energy storage for off-grid renewable energy were analyzed. The sizing methods and economic models were developed, and finally applied in the real project (case study). The results provide the most suitable energy storage scheme for local decision-makers. The two storage schemes were further divided into 4 options. Accordingly, the life-cycle costs (LCC), levelized costs for the renewable energy storage system (LCRES) and the LCC ratios between all options were calculated and compared. It was found that the employment of conventional battery (Option 2) had a higher LCC value than the advanced deep cycle battery (Option 1), indicating that using deep cycle batteries is more suitable for a standalone renewable power supply system. The pumped storage combined with battery bank option (Option 3) had only 55% LCC of that of Option 1, making this combined option more cost-competitive than the sole battery option. The economic benefit of pumped storage is even more significant in the case of purely pumped storage with a hydraulic controller (Option 4), with the lowest LCC among all options at 29-48% of Option 1. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that PHS is even more cost competitive by controlling some adjustments such as increasing energy storage capacity and days of autonomy. Therefore, the renewable energy system coupled with pumped storage presents technically feasible opportunities and practical potential for continuous power supply in remote areas. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Faulty design, as well as suitable design schemes cause situations in which solar energy supply has to ""compete against"" the auxiliary energy supply. This research demonstrates a feasible method to remedy such situations with the utilization of weather forecast data. The developed approach is modular and expandable to be used with additional heat sources. A suitable disturbance-prediction, which approximates the expected solar energy flux into the storage, in connection with a linear model predictive control (MPC), can prevent the auxiliary system to switch on at an early stage and thus reduce the auxiliary energy demand and keep storage capacity for solar thermal energy supply. Results obtained through simulations for selected months show a reduction of auxiliary energy demand up to 40%, when facilitating this approach for a solar thermal combisystem for a single family house.

We evaluated the effect of an antioxidant, R/S-α-lipoic acid on fructose-induced oxidative stress and carbohydrate metabolism changes. Methods Wistar rats were fed a standard commercial diet, the same diet plus 10% fructose in drinking water, or injected with R/S-α-lipoic acid (35 mg/kg, i.p.) (control + L and fructose + L). Three weeks thereafter, blood samples were drawn to measure glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda indices. In the liver, we measured gene expression, protein content and activity of several enzymes, and metabolite concentration. Results Comparable body weight changes and calorie intake were recorded in all groups after the treatments. Fructose fed rats had hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, higher HOMA-IR and lower Matsuda indices compared to control animals. Fructose fed rats showed increased fructokinase gene expression, protein content and activity, glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression and activity, glycogen storage, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and enzyme activity, NAD(P)H oxidase subunits (gp91 phox and p22phox) gene expression and protein concentration and phosphofructokinase-2 protein content than control rats. All these changes were prevented by R/S-α-lipoic acid co-administration. Conclusions Fructose induces hepatic metabolic changes that presumably begin with increased fructose phosphorylation by fructokinase, followed by adaptive changes that attempt to switch the substrate flow from mitochondrial metabolism to energy storage. These changes can be effectively prevented by R/S-α-lipoic acid co-administration.

Yet there is still a need to design new porous structures with controllable porosity and well defined chemical status of sulfur doped into the carbon matrix. In this review, we summarize recent reports on the preparation of S-doped carbons, with special emphasis on porous carbons with intrinsically doped sulfur. The effect of S-doping on the properties determining applications is delineated. Special attention is paid to differentiate between elemental sulfur impregnation, intercalation, surface functionalization and S bulk doping of porous carbons. To this end, synthesis and applications of S-impregnated, S-functionalized and S-intercalated carbons are shortly discussed before the intrinsically S-doped carbons are presented in detail. The importance of the sulfide-C-S-C-system for the properties of S-doped carbon is stressed. At the very end, Se-doped carbons are shortly presented as a promising next generation of chalcogen-doped carbon. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of Phase Change Material (PCM) and rock bed for heat storage has been studied in the past decades. However, limited knowledge exists on the use of the combination of PCM and rock particles for high temperature heat storage with air as the medium of heat transfer. The aim of this paper is to show experimentally by means of comparison, the thermal behaviours of thermal energy storage with only rocks and that with rocks and PCM. A heat storage consisting of only rocks and that with rocks and PCM has been designed and built. The PCM material used is a mixture of NaNO3 and KNO3 in the ratio of 60:40 percent (mol%). The charging and thermal de-stratification profiles were investigated for both cases. The results showed that the introduction of PCM cylinders in a bed of rocks for heat storage does not only increase the energy content of the storage but it also increases the vertical thermal conductivity. The increase in vertical thermal conductivity is attributed to the high thermal conductivity of the PCM container material. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recent energy policies have been planning for a bigger share of renewable energy sources in energy supply. However, inherent characteristics of renewable energy sources - based electricity generation systems are intermittency and non-controllability. That is why electric energy storage has the key role in a more productive use of these energy sources. Numerous energy storage technologies are known today, but none of the present-day technologies could in terms of ratings be compared to water storage. It has been demonstrated here that water storage is able to reduce volatility and increase reliability and stability of green electric energy. Furthermore, the paper analyses the use of water storage as energy storage in the future green energy power system and presents the basic concepts and characteristics of renewable energy conversion into hydroelectric energy.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A) is blessed with considerable amount of solar radiation. Commercial/residential buildings in K.S.A. consume about 10-45% of the total electric energy. In the present paper, the economic analysis of utilization of hybrid PV-diesel-battery power systems to meet the load of a typical residential building (with annual electrical energy demand of 35,120 kWh) in different provinces/zones of K.S.A. has been studied by analyzing long-term solar radiation data. Five geographically distinct sites representing different provinces of the Kingdom have been selected. The monthly average daily solar radiation of K.S.A. varies from 3.03-7.51 kWh/m2. NREL's (HOMER Energy's) HOMER software has been employed to perform the analysis. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system composed of 4 kWp PV system together with 10 kW diesel system and a battery storage of 3 h of autonomy (equivalent to three hours of average load), the PV penetration is 22%., 21%, 22%, 20%, and 20% at Abha (Southern Province), Hofuf (Eastern Province), Qurayat (Northern Province), Taif (Western Province), and Riyadh (Central Province) respectively. The cost of generating energy (COE, US$/kWh) from the above hybrid system has been found to be 0.179 $/kWh, 0.179 $/kWh, 0.178 $/kWh, 0.180 $/kWh, and 0.181 $/kWh at Abha, Hofuf, Qurayat, Taif, and Riyadh respectively. For a given hybrid system, the PV penetration is higher in Sourthern and Northern Province as compared to other provinces. Also, the study has examined the impact of PV penetration on: carbon emissions (Tons/year), diesel fuel consumption, Net Present Cost, cost of energy, etc. Furthermore, for a given hybrid configuration (for Northern Province), the study exhibits that increase in PV capacity results in decrease in the diesel-fuel-consumption/carbon-emissions and increase in COE./NPC/excess-energy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A vibrating sample magnetometer was employed to probe the magnetic properties of the samples at room temperature. It was found that with the increased terbium content, the coercive force and saturation magnetization were decreased which may be attributed to spin canting. Magnetic dynamics of the samples were studied by ferromagnetic resonance in X band (9.5 GHz) at room temperature. The incorporation of terbium sufficiently lowers the FMR line-width. The decrease in FMR line-width is attributed to the reduction of super-exchange interactions. The DC electrical resistivity and activation energy are higher for the substituted samples. The dielectric constant, dielectric loss (tan δ) and AC-conductivity decreased on account of doping. The decrease in dielectric constant is imputed to the reduction in the internal viscosity of the doped samples. The dielectric data are explained on the basis of space charge polarization.

The ANN method is used to predict the expected daily energy output for typical operating conditions, as well as the temperature level the storage tank can reach by the end of the daily operation cycle. These are considered as the most important parameters for the user. Experimental measurements from almost one year (226 days) have been used to investigate the ability of ANN to model the energy behavior of a typical large solar system. From the results, it can be concluded that the ANN effectively predicts the daily energy performance of the system; the statistical R2-value obtained for the training and validation data sets was better than 0.95 and 0.96 for the two performance parameters respectively. The data used in the validation were completely unknown to the ANN, which proves the ability of the ANN to give good predictions on completely unknown data. The results obtained from the method were also compared to the input-output model predictions with good accuracy whereas multiple linear regression could not give as accurate results. Additionally, the network was used with various combinations of input parameters and gave results of the same order of magnitude as the suggested method, which prove the robustness of the method. The advantages of the proposed approach include the simplicity in the implementation, even when the characteristics of the system components are not known, as well as the potential to improve the capability of the ANN to predict the performance of the solar system, through the continuous addition of new data collected during the operation of the system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial neural networks; Daily energy output; Large solar thermal systems; Maximum temperature of storage tank","Energy output; Energy performance; Multiple linear regressions; Performance parameters; Performance prediction; Solar thermal systems; Storage tank; Typical operating conditions; Digital storage; Forecasting; Linear regression; Neural networks; Tanks (containers); Solar system; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; data acquisition; energy efficiency; experimental study; performance assessment; regression analysis; solar power; solar radiation; statistical analysis; storage tank; artificial neural network; data set; diurnal variation; energy dissipation; model validation; performance assessment; prediction; solar system; statistical analysis; storage tank; temperature profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884571934

The energy storage in ECs is based on capacitive (the electrical double layer charging/discharging) and pseudocapacitive (additional charge provided by faradic reaction) phenomena. Considering the electrodes exhibiting pseudocapacitance, examination of their capacitance value is usually complicated, mainly because of its dependence on applied potential. This paper presents the results of evaluating the capacitance of the nickel oxide electrode material by the analysis of the impedance spectra obtained by Dynamic Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (DEIS). The proposed solution allows to acquire the detailed information about capacitance changes as a function of applied potential.

The amounts of oxygen and water in the glovebox were below 0.1 ppm. The gases released from the materials during the thermal decomposition of all samples were analyzed using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The oxidation of MgH2 at low oxygen and water vapor pressures leads to an increase in the hydride decomposition temperatures of the samples compared to their initial (as-prepared) counterparts, which are shown in Ref. [1]. The differences in the decomposition temperatures between the powders stored for one year in a glovebox and the initial as-prepared powders were greater than 60 C for MgH2 with NbF5, ZrF4, TaF5, TiCl3 and VCl 3. The release of water from all long-term-stored materials and the emission of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from MgH2 with metal fluorides were observed during heating. The observed results demonstrate that even a protective argon atmosphere did not prevent the degradation of the nanocrystalline MgH2 powders with various metal halide additives during their long-term storage in a professional glovebox, which is an important practical concern. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Phase-pure spinels are difficult to prepare by conventional solid-state synthesis methods owing to loss of oxygen from the crystal lattice at high temperature (∼800°C). Loss of oxygen causes Jahn-Teller distortion and Mn4+ is converted into Mn3+, which results in undesired double-plateau discharge and reduction in capacity and stability of the material. In this study, nanocrystalline phase-pure LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 was prepared by co-precipitation with cyclohexylamine followed by calcination at a low temperature of 500°C. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that a highly crystalline face-centred cubic product is formed with F-d3m space group. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope studies confirmed that the particles are in the nano range with a porous structure. The as-prepared LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 showed a high initial specific capacity (up to 130mAhg-1) and retained up to 120mAhg-1 up to 50 cycles.

This results primarily from the lack of a reliable and cost-effective power solution within such regions. This study presents a comprehensive review of the underlying principles of the renewable energy technology (RET) with the objective of ensuring a reliable and cost-effective energy solution for a sustainable development in the emerging world. The grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system incorporating a power conversion and battery storage unit has been proposed based on the availability, dynamism, and technoeconomic viability of energy resources within the region. The proposed system's performance validation applied a simulation model developed in MATLAB, using a practical load data for different locations with varying climatic conditions in Nigeria. Results indicate that, apart from being environmentally friendly, the increase in the overall energy throughput of about 4 kWh/$ of the proposed system would not only improve the quality of mobile services, by making the operations of GSM base stations more reliable and cost effective, but also better the living standards of the host communities. © 2014 Michael S.

A coaxial magnetoplasma accelerator (CMPA) was used to generate the plasma flow. The CMPA was supplied from the pulse capacitive energy storage. Effect of input to the CMPA energy value on powders was studied by using several analytical methods such as X-ray diffractometry (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). According to XRD with the increasing of input energy value the content of CNx in the product increased about 1.5 times. It's in a good accordance with the XPS data according to which the presence of nitrogen increased from 0.5 to 1.4 mass percent. Furthermore, the particles morphology was noticeable changed with the energy increasing. The obtained results revealed that by changing the energy parameters of the capacity energy storage it's possible to influence on the product synthesized in the carbon-nitrogen system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Carbon nitride; Effect of energy; High-speed electric discharge plasma jet",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893904099

The leptin receptor was classified as type I cytokine receptor due to its structural homology with IL-6 receptors and the signaling pathways in which they are both involved. The aim of our study is to comparatively assess the gene expression levels of leptin (lep) and leptin receptor (lepr) in different swine breeds specialized either in meat production (Duroc, Belgian Landrace, Large White, Synthetic Lines LS-345, and LSP-2000) or fat production (Mangalitsa) in order to correlate them with morphological and productivity characteristics. Additionally, lepr pattern of expression was evaluated comparatively between different tissue types in the Mangalitsa breed. Our results revealed high expression of the lep gene in Mangalitsa compared to those of all the other breeds, while for the lepr gene, average/medium levels were registered in Mangalitsa and increased pattern of expression was found in the synthetic lines LS-345 and LSP-2000. Regarding the comparative analysis of lepr gene expression in various tissues in the Mangalitsa breed, elevated levels were found in the liver and kidney, while the lowest expression was identified in the brain and muscles. Our results suggest that the Mangalitsa population exhibits leptin resistance, which might be correlated with atypical morpho-productive characteristics for this breed, such as below-average prolificacy and a strong tendency to accumulate fat. © FUNPEC-RP.","Gene expression; Leptin; Leptin receptor; Swine","leptin; leptin receptor; leptin; leptin receptor; animal tissue; Article; brain; breed difference; comparative study; gene expression; kidney; lep gene; lepr gene; lipid storage; liver; muscle; nonhuman; pig breed; tissue distribution; tissue level; animal; breeding; classification; genetics; pig; Suidae; Animals; Breeding; Gene Expression; Leptin; Receptors, Leptin; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907143759

Because they play an important role in lipid and glucose homeostasis, they are called lipid and insulin sensors. Their actions are limited to specific tissue types and thus, reveal a characteristic influence on target cells. PPARα mainly influences fatty acid metabolism and its activation lowers lipid levels, while PPARγ is mostly involved in the regulation of the adipogenesis, energy balance, and lipid biosynthesis. PPARβ/δ participates in fatty acid oxidation, mostly in skeletal and cardiac muscles, but it also regulates blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Many natural and synthetic ligands influence the expression of these receptors. Synthetic ligands are widely used in the treatment of dyslipidemia (e.g. fibrates - PPARα activators) or in diabetes mellitus (e.g. thiazolidinediones - PPARγ agonists). New generation drugs - PPARα/γ dual agonists - reveal hypolipemic, hypotensive, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant action while the overexpression of PPARβ/δ prevents the development of obesity and reduces lipid accumulation in cardiac cells, even during a high-fat diet. Precise data on the expression and function of natural PPAR agonists on glucose and lipid metabolism are still missing, mostly because the same ligand influences several receptors and a number of reports have provided conflicting results. To date, we know that PPARs have the capability to accommodate and bind a variety of natural and synthetic lipophilic acids, such as essential fatty acids, eicosanoids, phytanic acid and palmitoylethanolamide. A current understanding of the effects of PPARs, their molecular mechanisms and the role of these receptors in nutrition and therapeutic treatment are delineated in this paper. © 2014 Grygiel-Górniak; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; anticoagulant agent; antihypertensive agent; cholesterol; ciglitazone; clofibrate; efatutazone; essential fatty acid; farglitazar; fenofibrate; gemfibrozil; icosanoid; palmidrol; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; phytanic acid; rosiglitazone; troglitazone; [2 methyl 4 [4 methyl 2 (4 trifluoromethylphenyl) 5 thiazolylmethylthio]phenoxy]acetic acid; ligand; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; retinoid X receptor; adipocyte; adipogenesis; antiinflammatory activity; article; cholesterol blood level; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; heart muscle; human; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipogenesis; nonhuman; nutritional assessment; obesity; protein expression; protein function; protein structure; agonists; animal; drug effects; genetic transcription; physiology; Animals; Humans; Ligands; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; PPAR alpha; PPAR delta; PPAR gamma; PPAR-beta; Retinoid X Receptors; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893794489

It is widely used for its antioxidant property. Presently, only two digits, tomato microRNAs (miRNAs) are reported in miRBase: a miRNA database. This study is aimed to profile and characterize more miRNAs and their targets in tomato. A comprehensive comparative genomic approach is applied and a total of 109 new miRNAs belonging to 106 families are identified and characterized from the tomato expressed sequence tags (ESTs). All these potential miRNAs are profiled for the first time in tomato. The profiled miRNAs are also observed with stable stem-loop structures (Precursor-miRNAs), whose length ranges from 45to 329 nucleotides (nt) with an average of 125 nt. The mature miRNAs are found in the stem of pre-miRNAs and their length ranges from 19 to 24 nt with an average of 21 nt. Furthermore, twelve miRNAs are randomly selected and experimentally validated through RT-PCR. A total of 406 putative targets are also predicted for the newly 109 tomato miRNAs. These targets are involved in structural protein, metabolism, transcription factor, growth & development, stress related, signaling pathways, storage proteins and other vital processes. Some important proteins like; 9-cisepoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), transcription factor MYB, ATP-binding cassette transporters, terpen synthase, 14-3-3 and TIR-NBS proteins are also predicted as putative targets for tomato miRNAs. These findings improve a baseline data of miRNAs and their targets in tomato.

Similar analyses of binding have previously been limited to individual structures that bind to phosphate groups; here, we investigate a total of 8307 structures obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). An analysis of the binding site amino acid propensities reveals very characteristic first shell residue distributions, which are found to be influenced by the characteristics of the phosphorus compound and by the presence of cobound cations. The second shell, which supports the coordinating residues in the first shell, is found to consist mainly of protein backbone groups. Our results show how the second shell residue distribution is dictated mainly by the first shell of the binding site, especially by cobound cations and that the main function of the second shell is to stabilize the first shell residues. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acid propensities; Cellular function; Energy and information; Individual structures; Protein backbone; Protein data bank; Residue distribution; Structural preorganization; Amino acids; Binding energy; Binding sites; Phosphorus; Phosphorus compounds; Positive ions; Proteins; Shells (structures); amide; metalloprotein; phosphorus; article; binding site; chemistry; metabolism; protein database; protein tertiary structure; Amides; Binding Sites; Databases, Protein; Metalloproteins; Phosphorus; Protein Structure, Tertiary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893860178

As an illustrative example, an iron-based chemical looping system was assessed in various plant configurations. The designs generate 300-450 MW net electricity with flexible hydrogen output in the range of 0-200 MWth (LHV). The capacity of evaluated plant concepts to have a flexible hydrogen output is an important aspect for integration in modern energy conversion systems. The carbon capture rate of evaluated concepts is almost total (&gt;99%). The paper presents in details evaluated plant configurations, operational aspects as well as mass and energy integration issues. For comparison reason, a syngas-based chemical looping concept and Selexol®-based pre-combustion capture configuration were also presented. Direct coal chemical looping configuration has significant advantages compared with syngas-based looping systems as well as solvent-based carbon capture configurations, the more important being higher energy efficiency, lower (or even zero) oxygen consumption and lower plant complexity.

As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like ""community supported fisheries"" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more ""green."" Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of ""ocean literacy"" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals. © 2014 Timothy Beatley.

PHAs granules were isolated from cells grown in sodium gluconate (1.5 % w/v) as carbon source. Lytic activities are strongly associated and act to the PHAs granules proved with various methods. Specialized lytic trasglycosylases (LTGs) are muramidases capable of locally degrading the peptidoglycan (PG) meshwork of Gram negative bacteria. These enzymes cleave the β-1,4-glycosidic linkages between the N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues of PG. Lysozyme-like activity/-ies were detected using lysoplate assay. Chitinolytic activity/-ies, were detected as N-acetyl glucosaminidases (NAG) (E.C.3.2.1.5.52) hydrolyzing the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide (pNP-GlcNAc) releasing pNP and GlcNAc. Using zymogram analysis two abundant LTGs were revealed hydrolyzing cell wall of Micrococcus lysodeikticus or purified PG incorporated as natural substrates, in SDS-PAGE and then renaturation. These proteins corresponded in a SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained gel in molecular mass of 110 and 32 kDa respectively, were analyzed by MALDI-MS (Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Mass Spectrometry).

Overall, the localization of PG hydrolases in PHAs granules appears to be involved to their biogenesis from membranes, and probably promoting septal PG splitting and daughter cell separation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","LTGs; lytic transglycosylases.

Recently, the use of seismic response modification strategies such as base isolation and energy dissipation systems have been extended to liquid storage tanks, particularly large liquid natural gas tanks, in order to protect them from the damaging effects of earthquakes. Base isolation involves the installation of horizontally ffexible base isolation bearings under the liquid storage tanks to extend the vibration period of the structure and to provide an additional mechanism for energy dissipation. This paper investigates the effects of the variation of mechanical properties of lead-core elastomeric base isolation bearings on the dynamic response of liquid storage tanks through a comprehensive parametric study which was conducted with a script that uses the Matlab state-space solvers. The paper begins by outlining the mechanical analogue system to be used for calculating the overturning moment and the base shear in tank wall as well as the free surface displacements for a cylindrical liquid storage tank subjected to horizontal base excitation. The nonlinear force-displacement characteristics of the bearings are modelled with the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model. Results of the parametric study show that base isolation can be effective at decreasing the base shear and that special attention must be paid to the increases in the sloshing displacements in determining the freeboard height.",,"Bouc-Wen hysteresis; Cylindrical liquid storage tanks; Elastomeric bearing; Energy dissipation system; Force-displacement characteristics; Liquid storage tanks; Overturning moment; Seismic response modification; Bearings (structural); Dynamic response; Earthquake resistance; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; Losses; Mechanical properties; Tanks (containers); Liquid sloshing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896892155

The physicochemical characteristics and the textural and rheological properties of yoghurt samples were determined after production and during 10 days of storage. The gel structure of yoghurt samples produced with not inactivated TG was stronger than that of samples produced with inactivated TG and control sample. Yoghurt containing 0.12% (w/w) TG not inactivated showed the highest hysteresis loop area (3,580Pa·s) after 5 days of storage. Hysteresis loop area of samples with 0.12% (w/w) inactivated TG after incubation for 2h at 40C is 56% lower compared with samples manufactured with the same concentration of not inactivated TG after 10 days of storage. Practical Applications: To produce yoghurt with low energy value, improved gel characteristics, and good physical and chemical properties, enzyme transglutaminase (TG) can be used. Enzymes are potential tools to increase the formation of covalent cross-links in protein foods. The addition of TG can reduce proteins and milk fat to produce nonfat yoghurt with the same rheological characteristic as yoghurt from whole fat milk. There are two different ways for the application of TG: simultaneously or prior to the fermentation. In the first case, TG was simultaneously added with starter culture. Pretreatment of milk with TG addition prior to fermentation demands additional process time as well as thermal inactivation step and has the advantage of a constant pH during the cross-linking reaction. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Probiotic culture; Texture; Viscosity; Yoghurt",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895059572

The smallest of these, the microbatteries, are commonly based on the all-solid state concept consisting of thin layers of electroactive materials separated by a solid state electrolyte. The fact that solid state electrolytes are required puts rather severe constraints on the materials in terms of electronic and ionic conductivity, as well as lack of pinholes otherwise leading to self-discharge. The atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology is especially suitable for realization of such microbatteries for the Li-ion technology. ALD has an inherent nature to deposit conformal and pinhole free layers on complex geometrical shapes, an architecture most commonly adopted for microbattery designs.

This paper reports the results of ten whole-tree and two stem wood storage field trials on energy densities. The material consisted of eight Scots pine (P. sylvestris), and four downy birch (B. pubescence) trials, all after the first thinnings. Other factors studied were the length of storage, pile cover and seasoning in the stand. The two variables under scrutiny were the basic density and moisture content. It was shown that even a good degree of drying could not counterbalance the reduction in the basic density. The Scots pine feed stocks dried well, and the basic density losses were less than those of downy birch. As a result, the pine feed stocks increased in energy density from 0.7 to 17.6% over the trial period, whereas all of the birch feed stocks suffered losses from -3.4 to -9.6%. Although covering the feed stocks had a beneficial effect on moisture content, it proved to have a positive effect only on pine when the storage was extended beyond one year. There was some gain on energy density if the feed stocks were seasoned in the stand, but this advantage was lost at the roadside landing. Furthermore, transpiration drying in the stand requires a two-phase harvesting technique, and this expense may be difficult to justify. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Basic density; Biomass; Heating value; Moisture content; Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893740330

For radiation intensity of 1.033 kW/m2 and inclination angle of 0, the results showed that the efficiency of the collector followed a linear relationship versus the flow rate; η = 0.68 × Qv + 49.79 and presented a coefficient of correlation (R 2) of 0.9898. Similarly, the increase of the inclination angle from 0 to 60 increased the effectiveness of the collector. A linear relationship; η = 0.43 × α + 53.07 with a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.967) relates the collector efficiency to the inclination angle.

The STPP system has been divided into four main subsystems: the heliostat field subsystem, the cavity receiver subsystem (tower), the steam generation subsystem and the power cycle subsystem (Rankine cycle). Thermal and thermodynamic models of main subsystems have been developed. A general nonlinear mathematical model of the studied system (STPP) has been presented and solved using numerical optimization methods. The obtained results are presented and analyzed. The effects of the receiver surface temperature and the receiver surface area on the cavity receiver efficiency and the steam mass flow have been investigated. The effects of other parameters, such as the incident heat flux, the absorbed energy and the heat losses from the receiver are also studied. The analysis of these results shows the existence of an optimal receiver efficiency value for each steam mass flow, receiver surface temperature and receiver surface area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

MS is not only the risk factor for cardiovascular disease but also for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thus, there are some reasons to recognize MS as a new challenge for pediatric nephrologists. First, hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy, the main causes of CKD in adults, both share the same pathophysiological abnormalities associated with visceral obesity and insulin resistance and have their origins in childhood. Secondly, as the obesity epidemic also affects children with CKD, MS emerges as the risk factor for progression of CKD. Thirdly, metabolic abnormalities typical for MS may pose additional risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in children with CKD. Finally, although the renal transplantation reverses uremic abnormalities it is associated with an exposure to new metabolic risk factors typical for MS and MS has been found to be the risk factor for graft loss and cardiovascular morbidity after renal transplantation. MS is the result of imbalance between dietary energy intake and expenditure inducing disproportionate fat accumulation. Thus, the best prevention and treatment of MS is physical activity and maintenance of proper relationship between lean and fat mass. © 2013 The Author(s).","Children; Chronic kidney disease; Hypertension; Metabolic syndrome; Renal transplantation","antihypertensive agent; antiobesity agent; insulin sensitizing agent; caloric intake; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; childhood obesity; chronic kidney disease; diabetic nephropathy; disease association; disease course; dyslipidemia; energy expenditure; epidemic; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; kidney transplantation; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; morbidity; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; priority journal; renal graft dysfunction; review; risk factor; Child; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Metabolic Syndrome X; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892825463

We investigated the utility of troponin I (TnI) and telethonin (Tcap) as markers and examined their temporal profiles after skeletal muscle damage. Methods: Plasma profiles were measured before and after exercise in 3 groups: subjects affected by either Becker muscular dystrophy or McArdle disease, and healthy subjects. Results: Mb and TnI appeared early in the blood, and the increase of TnI was only observed in patients with muscle disease. The CK increase was more delayed in plasma. Tcap was not detectable at any time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that TnI is a marker of more severe damage signifying sarcomeric damage, and it could therefore be an important supplement to CK and Mb in clinical practice.

Regenerating the solvent and compressing the CO2 in this process requires a significant amount of energy and therefore increases the cost of the produced electricity, as less electricity can be sold. By implementing solvent storage, this energy penalty can be delayed until moments with a low electricity price (i.e., more electricity could be sold when the electricity price is high and less when the electricity price is low). Investing in solvent storage, however, is only profitable if the profit increase is sufficiently high. This paper presents an analytical optimization framework for solvent storage implemented on a coal-fired power plant in an electricity market with a methodological, two-step electricity price profile (peak and off-peak). This analysis identifies distinct ranges of peak and off-peak price combinations in which solvent storage can lead to an increased profit. Depending on the problem parameters, these price ranges can vary, mostly depending on the emission certificate cost and the investment cost of the solvent storage infrastructure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 capture; Economics; Electricity markets; Flexibility; Solvent regeneration; Solvent storage","Analytical optimizations; Carbon capture and storage; Electricity market; Flexibility; Fossil fired power plants; Post-combustion captures; Post-combustion carbon captures; Solvent regenerations; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Combustion; Costs; Economics; Electricity; Fossil fuel power plants; Investments; Optimization; Profitability; Solvents; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; coal-fired power plant; combustion; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; fossil fuel; optimization; solvent",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892447501

A multi-dimensional optimization study is carried out by combining EnergyPlus and GenOpt tools. The CondFD-algorithm is used in EnergyPlus to simulate phase-changes. For the optimization, the PSOCC-algorithm is used considering a set of predefined discrete construction solutions. These variables are related with the thermophysical properties of the PCM (enthalpy-temperature and thermal conductivity-temperature functions), solar absortance of the inner surfaces, thickness and location of the PCM-drywalls. Several parameters are included in the model mainly those related with the air-conditioned set-points, air-infiltration rates, solar gains, internal gains from occupancy, equipment and lighting. Indices of energy savings for heating, cooling and for both heating and cooling are defined to evaluate the energy performance of the PCM-enhanced rooms. Results show that an optimum solution can be found for each climate and that PCMs can contribute for the annual heating and cooling energy savings. PCM-drywalls are particularly suitable for Mediterranean climates, with a promising energy efficiency gain of about 62% for the Csb-Coimbra climate. As for the other climates considered, values of about 10% to 46% were obtained. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Composites with a small amount of carbon were obtained by pyrolysis directly on a hydrogen storage alloy or by carbonization of conducting polymers. It was done in order to improve the hydrogen electrosorption properties of anode material. The electrochemical properties were examined in 6 M KOH solution with the addition of a different amount of KBH4, using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic methods. It has been proved that only particular forms of carbon are able to promote the electrocatalytic activity of an AB5 alloy type anode and remarkably enlarge the surface area of the working electrode. Additionally, tubular morphology of nanocarbons makes fuel diffusion easier, in comparison to pores in a carbon layer obtained by carbonization of conducting polymers composites. © 2014 by ESG.","AB5 alloy; Anode material; Carbon modification; Direct borohydride fuel cell",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890918022

In this study, we report that lead removal by S. minima causes large accumulation of lead inside the cells in the form of nanoparticles (PbNPs). The accumulation pattern of lead was analyzed in both, submerged root-like modified fronds (here named ""roots""), and in its aerial leaf-like fronds (""leaves""). Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the biosynthesis of PbNPs by the plant. In both, roots and leaves, PbNPs were found to accumulate almost exclusively at the cell wall and closely associated to the cell membrane. Two types of PbNPs shapes were found in cells of both tissues, those associated to the cell wall were quasi-spherical with 17.2. ±. 4.2. nm of diameter, while those associated to the cell membrane/cytoplasm were elongated. Elongated particles were 53.7. ±. 29.6. nm in length and 11.1. ±. 2.4. nm wide.

The present study investigated relationships between accumulated metals with different levels of biological organisation in the aquatic larval stage of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Larvae were collected in seven Flemish ponds differing in metal load. In each field-collected larva we quantified concentrations of accumulated metals and a set of biochemical markers (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)), physiological endpoints (energy storage), and behavioural responses (locomotory activity and the feeding rate). Accumulated metal levels and the measured endpoints significantly differed among ponds, however, a large variation in metal load index was observed within individuals of the same population. Only GST and energy availability could be partly predicted by the observed variation in metal load index on individual damselfly level.

Orlando) grown in southern Israel are treated with maleic hydrazide before storage, and are cold-stored for up to 8 months with minimal losses to rots or sprouting. Nevertheless, in most cases the complete dry outer skin (tunic) cracks and loosens, and tends to fall off during storage. To improve onion postharvest quality, bulbs were harvested at 80-100% green leaf drop (top-down), leaving about 10. cm of neck above the bulb. The early harvest reduced skin cracks in 93% of the bulbs, resulting in a sturdy tunic beneath the muddy outer skin. We applied fast curing (FC) at 30. °C and 98% RH for up to 9 days postharvest: the onion neck became 52% narrower after 6 days, similar to the effect of 5 months of cold storage. FC also changed the color of the treated onion bulbs' outer skin to a darker reddish brown. FC of onions harvested with a long neck and stored for 290 days reduced weight loss and rot by 30% and 80%, respectively, as compared to non-FC onions. The better onion quality induced by FC was accompanied by an increased number of onion skin layers (from an average of 1.8 to 4) and a higher force needed to tear the tunic (average 4.8. N as compared to 3.5. N in the control). FC compressed the effects of 5 months of cold storage into a few days, since most of the bulb neck and tunic changes measured during FC occurred only after long cold storage without FC. Although emission of the lachrymatory factor was not affected by FC, it markedly increased after 5 months of storage. Histological observation showed that FC keeps the onion tunic and inner fleshy scales intact and ensures postharvest quality, even after 8 months of cold storage. The high temperature used for FC can be reached in hot-climate storage areas with minimal energy investment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Curing; Heat treatment; Onion skin; Postharvest storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886013807

Constraints are imposed on flows and pressures, on periodical tanks operation, and on tanks storage. The methodology links the multiobjective SPEA2 algorithm with EPANET, and is applied on two example applications of increasing complexity, under extended period simulation conditions and variable energy tariffs. The proposed approach enables decision makers to take full advantage of the obtained information on a multiobjective scale for trading-off, cost, water quality, and storage-reliability requirements. Verification of the model outcomes through engineering judgment on all runs for both example applications confirmed the model suitability as a decision tool. Limitations of the proposed model reside in using variable speed pumps with assumed constant efficiency as representing an entire pumping station operation, the storage reliability constraint as an u-priori set parameter, and in the computational intensity required to obtain solutions for real sized systems. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Management; Multiobjective; Optimal operation; Optimization; Water distribution systems; Water quality","Computational intensity; Engineering judgments; Extended period simulations; Multi objective; Multi-objective modeling; Optimal operation; Pumping station operation; Variable-speed pumps; Commerce; Costs; Management; Optimization; Pumps; Reliability; Tanks (containers); Water distribution systems; Water quality; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; pumping; reliability analysis; storage tank; water management; water quality; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892884506

Ecuador 3769 Estacion Central, Santiago, Chile","This paper approaches the microgrid concept from a systemic and cybernetics viewpoint, as a viable sustainable energy system (SES) for supplying electricity and heat to small, rural communities in Chile. As such the microgrid may be viewed as a complex adaptive system (CAS) when connected to the grid and operating without energy storage, only with the grid as back-up power source. From an exergy and homeostatic control (HC) standpoint, one may analyze the microgrid as a socio-technical CAS when it is coupled with a set of homes and also connected to the grid; capable of supplying close to 80% of the daily residential consumer needs on average. Thus, under these conditions homes may draw inexpensive renewable electricity and heat from the microgrid if they are thrifty and efficient in their energy consumption; and they may also consume from the utility grid, yet at an expensive price. Based on this, an exergy and HC approach is proposed to develop such SES for rural and remote communities in Chile and South America, aiming to enhance energy efficiency (EE) and energy sustainability (ES). Under this scheme, renewable power (RP)-being a scarce, limited resource that must be managed efficiently-is supplied only to homes which comply with a specific criterion in an effort to curtail demand to ensure ES overtime. Simulation shows as expected that indeed certain criteria produce much better results than others in incentivizing thrifty, efficient energy consumption for small-size communities, without the need for expensive and sometimes polluting and forbidden energy storage systems. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Energy efficiency; Exergy; Homeostatic control; Power supply criteria; Smart microgrids; Sustainability","Complex adaptive systems; Energy storage systems; Homeostatic control; Micro grid; Power supply; Renewable electricity; Residential consumers; Sustainable energy systems; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Exergy; Sustainable development; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892755473

Physics and Astronomy, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium","The use of phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the pathways for the storage of temporarily excessive energy from natural sources (solar) and industry for use at a more suitable later time. One of the materials with a high energy storage density is sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT), on which several studies were conducted in order to solve phase segregation and supercooling problems, e.g. by adding polymers and nucleating agents. Here we investigate the effectiveness of adding a polymer blend of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and silica gel to avoid phase segregation, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as nucleating agent. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was carried out by a green method in CMC as a way to ensure compatibility with SAT. The addition of AgNPs in higher concentrations to 0.5% reduces supercooling, and mixing silica gel with CMC to avoid segregation phase, yields an increment in the stability of the phase change behavior, during heating and cooling cycles. The latent heat release upon crystallization of the PCM was optimum for the mixture with 0.5% AgNPs, and for the highest amounts of CMC with respect to silica gel, with nearly 95% of latent heat recovery compared to pure SAT. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They both form self-standing films, making them potential future packaging materials. This systematic study focuses on the effect of long-term storage on the physical stability of hemicellulose-based films. OsAX and GGM films were plasticized with 40% (w/w of the polysaccharide) of glycerol, sorbitol, or their blends, and their stability was followed for four months. Ageing especially affected the glycerol-containing films, in which the tensile strength and Young's modulus increased and elongation at break decreased. Although the mechanical properties were altered, storage did not affect crystallinity of the films. Oxygen gas permeability (OP) and water vapor permeability (WVP) properties were monitored in OsAX films. Interestingly WVP decreased during storage; more than a 40% decrease was seen when plasticizer blends contained 50% or more glycerol. In contrast, there were no drastic changes in the OP during storage; all the OPs obtained were between 3.7 and 8.9 [cm3 μm/ (m2 d kPa)].","Arabinoxylan; Barrier materials; Films; Galactoglucomannan; Mechanical properties; Plasticizer blends; Storage","Arabinoxylans; Barrier material; Elongation at break; Galactoglucomannan; Galactoglucomannan (GGM); Plasticizer blends; Self-standing films; Water vapor permeability; Elongation at break; Galactoglucomannan (GGM); Long-term storage; Physical stability; Plasticizer blends; Self-standing films; Systematic study; Water vapor permeability; Cellulose; Elastic moduli; Energy storage; Glycerol; Mechanical properties; Packaging materials; Plasticizers; Reinforced plastics; Storage (materials); Tensile strength; Agricultural robots; Cellulose; Crystallinity; Elastic moduli; Films; Gas permeability; Glycerol; Packaging materials; Storage (materials); Tensile strength; Films; Gas permeable membranes; Cellulose; Film; Glycerol; Mechanical Properties; Packaging Materials; Plasticizers; Storage; Tensile Strength; Cellulose; Crystallinity; Gas Permeability; Glycerol; Packaging Materials; Tensile Strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892534977

Adsorption kinetics is studied in a broad range of concentrations and for time scales spanning from several milliseconds to several hours employing maximum bubble pressure tensiometry and drop profile tensiometry. Standard free energy of adsorption and diffusion coefficients for both short and long adsorption times are calculated and discussed. For short adsorption times diffusion coefficients lie in a physically reasonable range but for long adsorption times extremely low values are computed indicating the presence of an adsorption barrier. This barrier appears to mask any micellar kinetics effect for long adsorption times. Measurements of interfacial dilatational storage modulus and loss modulus indicate a visco-elastic character of the adsorption layer for all the examined concentrations and oscillation frequencies. Local peaks in the values of both moduli imply that structural changes occur with increasing concentration. However, these changes seem to be unrelated to the presence of micelles since they are observed at concentrations below the CMC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption Kinetics; Dilatational viscoelasticity; Dynamic surface tension; Ecofriendly surfactants; Micelles","Amino acids; Diffusion; Elasticity; Environmental protection; Ethers; Glycerol; Kinetics; Micelles; Solutions; Surface active agents; Surface tension; Viscoelasticity; Adsorption kinetics; Dynamic surface tensions; Eco-friendly; Hydrophobic alkyl chain; Maximum bubble pressure tensiometry; Oscillation frequency; Phenylalanine-glycerol ether; Standard free energy of adsorption; Adsorption; glycerol ether; phenylalanine; surfactant; adsorption; adsorption kinetics; aqueous solution; article; conformational transition; critical micelle concentration; diffusion coefficient; energy; flow kinetics; green chemistry; micelle; micellization; oscillation; pressure measurement; priority journal; storage; surface property; surface tension; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890186400

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) offers many benefits for preparing all-solid-state thin-film batteries, including excellent conformity and thickness control of the films. Yet, the number of available lithium-containing electrode materials obtained by ALD is limited. In this article, we demonstrate the ALD of lithium manganese oxide, Li xMn2O4, from Mn(thd)3, Li(thd), and ozone. Films were polycrystalline in their as-deposited state and contained less than 0.5 at. % impurities. The chemical reactions between the lithium precursor and the film were found not to be purely surface-limited but to include a bulk component as well, contrary to what is usually found for ALD processes. In addition, we show a process for using Li(thd)/ozone and LiOtBu/water treatments to transform ALD-MnO2 and ALD-V2O5 into LixMn2O4 and LixV 2O5, respectively. The formed LixMn 2O4 films were characterized electrochemically and found to show high electrochemical capacities and high cycling stabilities. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Atomic layer deposition; Film thickness; Lithium compounds; Manganese oxide; Oxides; Thin films; Vanadium pentoxide; As-deposited state; Candidate materials; Electrochemical capacities; Electrochemical energy; High specific capacity; Lithium manganese oxide; Lithium manganese oxide spinels; Spinel lithium manganese oxides; Thin film lithium ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892729931

Then, the study is given with a hybrid fuel cell-photovoltaic generator. The role of this system is the production of electricity without interruption in remote areas. It consists generally of a photovoltaic generator (PV), an alkaline water electrolyzer, a storage gas tank, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and power conditioning units (PCU) to manage the system operation of the hybrid system. Different topologies are competing for an optimal design of the hybrid photovoltaic-electrolyzer-fuel cell system. The studied system is proposed. PV subsystem work as a primary source, converting solar irradiation into electricity that is given to a DC bus. The second working subsystem is the electrolyzer which produces hydrogen and oxygen from water as a result of an electrochemical process. When there is an excess of solar generation available, the electrolyzer is turned on to begin producing hydrogen which is sent to a storage tank. The produced hydrogen is used by the third working subsystem (the fuel cell stack) which produces electrical energy to supply the DC bus. The modelisation of the global system is given and the obtained results are presented and discussed. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We tested this with a controlled experiment in C57BL/6J mice subjected to four weight cycles (WC), continuous hypercaloric feeding (HF), or low-fat feeding (LF). To search for genes involved in an adaptive mechanism to former weight cycling and avoid acute effects of the last cycle, the last hypercaloric feeding period was prolonged by an additional 2 wk before euthanization. Total energy intake was identical in WC and HF. However, compared with HF, the WC mice gained significantly more total body mass and fat mass and showed increased levels of circulating leptin and lipids in liver. Both the HF and WC groups showed increased adipocyte size and insulin resistance. Despite these effects, we also observed an interesting maintenance of circulating adiponectin and free fatty acid levels after WC, whereas changes in these parameters were observed in HF mice. Global gene expression was analyzed by microarrays. Weight-cycled mice were characterized by a downregulation of several clock genes (Dbp, Tef, Per1, Per2, Per3, and Nr1d2) in adipose tissues, which was confirmed by quantitative PCR. In 3T3-L1 cells, we found reduced expression of Dbp and Tef early in adipogenic differentiation, which was mediated via cAMP-dependent signaling. Our data suggest that clock genes in adipose tissue may play a role in metabolic adaptation to weight cycling. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.","Adipokines; Caloric restriction; Clock genes; Metabolism; Obesity","adiponectin; alanine aminotransferase; diacylglycerol; fatty acid; insulin; leptin; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; article; body composition; body fat; body mass; body weight; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; cell differentiation; controlled study; fat intake; fat mass; fatty acid blood level; glucose tolerance test; high performance thin layer chromatography; in vitro study; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lipid storage; liver; low fat diet; male; metabolic regulation; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; weight cycling; white adipose tissue; adipokines; caloric restriction; clock genes; metabolism; obesity; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adaptation, Physiological; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Adiposity; Animals; Body Weight; Caloric Restriction; CLOCK Proteins; Gene Expression; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892604575

The spectral manipulation is aiming at specifically promoting desired physiological responses, while the light scattering is improving the penetration of the spectrally-modified light into the inner plant canopy, thus increasing the efficiency of light-dependent processes. Additional aspects of the technology relate to photoselective effects on plant pests and diseases. Our studies in ornamental crops revealed pronounced differential responses to photoselective shading, relative to the traditional black shading (at equivalent shading levels). These include stimulated vegetative vigor (under the Red and Yellow nets), dwarfing (Blue), enhanced branching (Grey, Pearl), as well as various effects on leaf size, variegation, time-to-flowering and flower quality. In vegetables (bell peppers, tomatoes), the Red, Yellow and Pearl shade nets were found to markedly increase the productivity, compared with the common-practice covers. The photoselective features of these shade nets also affected the crop infestation by insect-pests and their carried viral diseases, as well as the occurrence of pathogenic fungal diseases. The combined effects resulted in better crop yields, improved fruit quality, and lower susceptibility to decay during post-harvest storage. Netting studies of fruit tree crops, traditionally grown un-netted (e.g. apples, pears, persimmon, table-grapes) revealed multiple benefits of the netting. The photoselective responsive parameters included productivity, water use efficiency, fruit maturation rate, fruit size, and fruit quality. This article is overviewing major breakthroughs achieved in ornamentals, vegetables and fruit crops in Israel, practical applications by growers, and future prospects.","Diffused light; Light-quality manipulation; Microclimate modification; Protected agriculture; Solar energy utilization; Stress mitigation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892682079

Standard MR was measured for the lizard Pseudocordylus melanotus over a range of temperatures (20, 22, 25, 30 and 32°C). I measured oxygen consumption using a closed respirometry system and tested for the effects of body mass and temperature. Body mass and total MR were significantly related at 20, 22, 25 and 32°C. Body mass and mass-specific MR were significantly related at 20°C. MR increases significantly with increasing temperature for both total and mass-specific MR. Both mass exponents and temperature quotients (Q10) were similar to those reported for other lizards and snakes. Field measures of body temperature were used to estimate energy expenditure for a standard 40 g lizard. Daily energy expenditures during summer and winter were 3074.32 J/day and 1537.46 J/day, respectively. A 40 g lizard, therefore, requires the equivalent of two to three mealworms per day to cover the costs of maintenance metabolism.

Electric power rotors and turbines, aircraft engines, automotive drive trains, kinetic energy storage systems are only few examples of machines that are to operate efficiently and safely. Very often they are imposed on external excitations, which are characterized by time-dependent characteristics and causing nonstationary random oscillations. In this paper, the dynamics of high-speed rotating rotor is analytically and numerically analyzed. The analytical investigations studied the steady-state vibrations in the neighborhood of resonance conditions of a rotor with 6 degrees of freedom in linear homogeneous elastoviscous field. Unstable frequencies zones are determined by ""limited"" power of an electric motor with linear characteristic and only one time constant. The analytical solution of the differential equations is implemented applying Bogoliubov-Mitropolski's asymptotical method in neighborhood of resonances. The analytical solution verifies the numerical dynamic model derived using a general purpose program system for computer code generation of the dynamic equation and simulation of motion of multibody systems of rigid and flexible bodies. It is regarded an unbalanced rotor attached to a flexible shaft and operating in elastoviscous field.

The paper evaluates two carbon capture options in terms of main techno-economic indicators. The first option involves pre-combustion capture, the syngas being catalytically shifted to convert carbon species into CO 2 and H2. Gas-liquid absorption is used for separate H2S and CO2 capture, then clean gas is used for power generation. The second capture option is based on post-combustion capture using chemical absorption. The most promising gasifiers were evaluated in a CCS design. Evaluated coal-based gasification concepts generate 300-500 MW net power with a flexible hydrogen output from zero up to 200 MW with carbon capture rate higher than 90%. The main techno-economic and environmental indicators of evaluated plant concepts with CCS were presented in detail in the context of development of a large scale CCS project in Romania. The evaluations of the IGCC designs with CCS were done in comparison with the conventional IGCC without CCS. The integrated assessments show that IGCC with pre-combustion capture is one promising technology for the future low-carbon economy. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Indeed, an ultra-capacitor (UC) system used as an energy storage device fulfills the FC slowest dynamics during fast power transitions and recovers the braking energy. In FC/UC hybrid vehicles, the search for a suitable power management approach is one of the main objectives. In this paper, an improved control strategy managing the active power distribution between the two energy sources is proposed. The UC reference power is calculated through the DC link voltage regulation. For the FC power demand, an algorithm with five operating modes is developed. This algorithm, depending on the UC state of charge (SOC) and the vehicle speed level, minimizes the FC power demand transitions and therefore ameliorates its durability. The traction power is provided using two permanent magnetic synchronous motor-wheels to free more space in the vehicle. The models of the FC/UC vehicle system parts and the control strategy are developed using MATLAB software. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy.

This article presents the results of an experimental study to heat up a SOFC system and stack without the said premixed safety gases, i.e. by utilizing a natural gas pre-reformer and anode off-gas recycling (AOGR). Firstly, ex-situ experiments were conducted to investigate the operability of a pre-reformer during system heat-up. It was found that any oxygen fed to the reformer hinders the reforming reactions at low temperatures. Secondly, based on the ex-situ findings, series of heat-up cycles were conducted with a complete 10 kW system using AOGR and a planar SOFC stack. In these experiments it was found that the system heat-up is possible with fuel gas and steam only, without the need for premixed reducing safety gases. Use of the fuel gas instead of a premixed safety gas did not result in a significant performance loss in the SOFC stack. Therefore, such a heat-up strategy was developed for SOFC systems that reduces the need of premixed safety gas storage space and thus decreases the system cost.

The process of mineral carbonation, or in other words, mineral sequestration of CO2 can be used as the last step of the CCS technology. This process bases on the reaction of CO2 with metal oxides which results in insoluble carbonates occurrence and heat is emitted. The carbon dioxide binds by using selected natural raw materials or waste, mainly in the form of suspensions. The mineral sequestration of CO2 with use of waste seems to be the most interesting. In this method the waste do not have to be pre-treated, as it is in the case of natural raw materials. Waste does not generate any cost of output on the contrary to raw materials. The mineral sequestration may be also the way to utilize the commercially unexploited or partly exploited waste. The process of mineral sequestration of CO2 with use of waste was examined in the direct way with use of suspension. However, the problem how to manage the suspension used in the sequestration is still discussed. The literature on this subject suggests to introduce CO2 into the suspension technology. In this case the technological parameters of suspension may change.

Thus, starch, sucrose, or other sucrose derivatives such as oligo- and poly-fructosyl sucrose-also called fructo-oligosaccharides and fructans, respectively-are the major hydrocarbons involved in this process. In plants, these carbohydrates are metabolized in different ways. While sucrose and fructans (which are generally soluble) are synthesized and accumulated in vacuoles, starch (which is insoluble) is stored in plastids. In most species, starch is predominantly utilized for diurnal carbon storage in leaves, and studies have shown that the biosynthesis of starch is regulated to provide this energetic substrate for utilization through the dark period (Smith and Stitt 2007).

The stigma exudate, i.e., the extracellular secretion that covers the stigma outermost surface, has been usually regarded as a reservoir of water, secondary metabolites, cell wall precursors and compounds that serve as energy supply for rapid pollen tube growth. In an attempt to identify the proteins present in the stigma secretome, we performed a large-scale analysis in two species (Lilium longiflorum and Olea europaea) following a proteomic-based approach. The resulting data strongly suggest that the stigma exudate is not a mere storage site but also a biochemically active environment with a markedly catabolic nature. Thus, this secretion may modulate early pollen tube growth and contribute to the senescence of stigma after pollination. In addition, a putative cross-talk between genetic programs that regulate stress/defense and pollination responses in the stigma is also suggested. The stigma exudate might also functionally diverge between species on the basis on their ecology and the biochemical, morphological and anatomical features of their stigmas. Unexpectedly, we identified in both exudates some intracellular proteins, suggesting that a mechanism other than the canonical ER-Golgi exocytic pathway may exist in the stigma and contribute to exudate secretion.","Eastern lily; exudate; olive; proteomics; secretome; stigma","plant exudate; vegetable protein; environment; flower; growth, development and aging; lily; metabolism; olive tree; plant exudate; pollen; pollen tube; pollination; proteomics; Environment; Flowers; Lilium; Olea; Plant Exudates; Plant Proteins; Pollen; Pollen Tube; Pollination; Proteomics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052489139

Since independence, problems have appeared in the management of the water storage and control infrastructure. Most facilities were built by the Soviets to serve the needs of the entire Aral Sea basin. In many cases, infrastructure located in one country is for the benefit of other countries. The division of maintenance and operational responsibility for trans-boundary water infrastructure is often in dispute. There are serious problems with seasonal water coordination. Upstream states would like to use water resources for their own winter power generation needs which is in conflict with the downstream states’ summer irrigation needs. With the contraction of economies in the region after independence, governments cut maintenance budgets. A lack of funds for operation and maintenance has resulted in a gradual decline in the condition of the irrigation and drainage systems. Massive expansion of irrigation developments, associated with the diversion of river water created serious environmental problems in the Aral Sea Basin. In addition to that, new challenges such as climate change impact to water resources and increasing water demand because of population growth and economic development make the existing situation more acute. The recent efforts in this direction give hope for progress toward positive outcomes. Proposals by the Republic of Tajikistan are based on an integrated approach to water management issues with due regard to natural, historical, and geopolitical conditions. This approach should help meet the challenges and prevent inter-state conflicts. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Afghanistan; Amu darya; Aral sea basin; Central asia; China; Conflict resolution; Energy; Glaciers; Groundwater; Hydropower; Irrigation; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Lakes; Pamir; Regional cooperation; Syr darya; Turkmenistan; Uzbekistan",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050326465

It is usually located in low voltage networks and connected to the power grid through switches. In remote or isolated areas, microgrid is an alternative way of power supply instead of installing expensive long-distance transmission lines. A microgrid combines DGs, loads, distributed energy storages, and cogenerations to form a mini power system. The system could be operated as grid-connected mode or islanded mode. The autonomous operation is one of the features of microgrid. Distributed renewable energy resources and small-scale clean energy generating units are the major generation resources in microgrids. The development of microgrids and distributed clean energy generations will be one of the solutions to carbon emissions and global warming. Microgrid is a transition step from conventional power systems to smart grid. The demand management and generation control in a microgrid could significantly improve energy efficiency and system operation.

Dams have long been considered as a ""green"" source of energy because they generate power from water without using fossil fuels. However, dams have a several drawbacks too which are not considered by many people. Dams can alter the habitat quality and fish accessibility to their habitats that play detrimental role in population survival. Fish population could also be affected indirectly by change in water quality and discharge regime. In this frame of study, we review some very important dam associated impacts on fish migration and their recommended mitigation measures by combining different aspects. Some novel approaches for mitigating dams' negative impacts on the fish populations dynamics especially, for downstream habitats have been concluded. The suggestive approached will potentially accommodate seasonal/climatic variations in the reservoir water to be discharged. © 2014, Dept.

The concept of hybridizing renewable energy sources is that the base load is to be covered by available renewable source(s) and other intermittent source(s) should augment the base load to cover the peak load of the base station site. The study is based on modeling, simulation, and optimization of the hybrid energy system located in Nembe (Bayelsa state), Nigeria. The patterns of load consumption by mobile base stations in Nembe are studied and modeled suitably for optimization using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) software. Various renewable/alternative energy sources, energy storage, and their applicability in terms of cost and performance, as well as a diesel generator were discussed. The proposed hybrid [(solar, wind &amp; hydro) + DG] system was simulated using the model which results in eight different topologies: (solar, wind &amp; hydro) + DG, (solar &amp; hydro) + DG, (wind &amp; hydro) + DG, hydro only + DG, (solar &amp; wind) + DG, solar only + DG, wind only + DG, and DG. Total economic costs [net present cost (NPC)] and the environment impact (pollutant emissions in tons of CO2) generated are used as indices for measuring the optimization level of each energy solution, and the option with the highest optimization value is considered to be the best energy solution for the base station site. The quantitative results of the study (as reported here) show that the hybrid power system can be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly in providing energy to a GSM base station site than diesel generators. © 2014 by Begell House, Inc.","Diesel generator (DG); Economic cost; Energy optimization; Environmental impact; Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER); Macro base transmitter station (BTS); Renewable energy; Simulation","Base stations; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Macros; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Topology; Transmitters; Diesel generators; Economic costs; Energy optimization; Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables; Renewable energies; Simulation; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042088453

They are assumed to be established at the low voltage distribution level, where distributed energy sources, storage devices, controllable loads, and electric vehicles are integrated and need to be properly managed. The microgrid cell is a very flexible system that can be operated connected to the main power network or autonomously, in a controlled and coordinated way. When operating in islanded mode, the MG relies on local energy storage to ensure the balance between generations and loads. However, when operating isolated from the main grid, the MG is more sensitive to power quality issues such as voltage unbalance, caused by the connection of single-phase loads and sources. In order to improve the MG emergency operation conditions, the EV should be envisaged as an active and flexible entity, providing to the MG additional distributed load or storage capacity under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept. This chapter reviews the MG architecture considering EV and focuses on the impact of their active participation on the MG frequency regulation in emergency conditions (namely in islanding operating mode). Voltage unbalance issues during MG autonomous operation and the need for adopting voltage balancing mechanisms in specific power electronic interfaces are also discussed. © Springer India 2014.","Electrical vehicles; Energy storage; Islanding operation; Microgrid; Vehicle-to-grid","Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Vehicle-to-grid; Virtual storage; Voltage distribution measurement; Distributed energy sources; Electrical vehicles; Frequency regulations; Islanding operations; Low-voltage distributions; Micro grid; Operational characteristics; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Electric power transmission networks",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027371441

Drying processes can be broadly classified as thermal drying, osmotic dehydration and mechanical and chemical dewatering. Drying is a complex process involving simultaneous coupled transient heat, mass and momentum transport in which heat penetrates into the fish muscle and water is removed. During the drying process, water is removed from the fish muscle, resulting in decreased water content. Water activity is of great importance for food preservation. It has been used to provide a reliable assessment of the microbial growth, lipid oxidation, non-enzymatic and enzymatic activities, and the texture of foods. The different drying methods include sun drying, solar drying, heat pump drying, freeze-drying, and osmotic dehydration.

Advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system, and energy storage can play a significant role in meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid, lowering cost and ensuring high reliability, as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments. Finally, energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services. At present, the U.S. has about 24.6GW (approx. 2.3% of total electric production capacity) of grid storage, 95% of which is pumped storage hydro.1 Europe and Japan have notably higher fractions of grid storage. Pursuit of a clean energy future is motivating significantly increased storage development efforts in Europe and Asia, as well as the U.S. Energy storage technologies-such as pumped hydro, compressed air energy storage, various types of batteries, flywheels, electrochemical capacitors, etc., provide for multiple applications: energy management, backup power, load leveling, frequency regulation, voltage support, and grid stabilization. Importantly, not every type of storage is suitable for every type of application, motivating the need for a portfolio strategy for energy storage technology. There are four challenges related to the widespread deployment of energy storage: cost competitive energy storage technologies (including manufacturing and grid integration), validated reliability & safety, equitable regulatory environment, and industry acceptance. Issues that are being explored in this paper focus on reducing system costs through targeted application of science and engineering research and development for new storage concepts, materials, components and systems (including manufacturability and standardization). Developers should consider technical risk mitigation, for controlling the uncertainties at the early stage of deployment so that cost estimates and operational practices can develop based upon well-grounded and fully understood data. Ongoing research and development, from fundamental science of energy storage mechanisms to the early stage development of platform technologies should also be considered in support of these challenges. Industrial standards for grid storage are in their infancy. Industry acceptance could also gain ground when we reduce the uncertainty surrounding how storage technology is used, and monetized, at scale. Ultimately, it will be the experience and real-world use of storage that will provide the confidence and desire to expand installed storage. The expansion of the electricity system can be accelerated by the widespread deployment of energy storage, since storage can be a critical component of grid stability and resiliency. The future for energy storage in the U.S. should address the following issues: energy storage technologies should be cost competitive (unsubsidized) with other technologies providing similar services; energy storage should be recognized for its value in providing multiple benefits simultaneously; and ultimately, storage technology should seamlessly integrate with existing systems and subsystems leading to its ubiquitous deployment. In reviewing the barriers and challenges, and the future for energy storage, a strategy that would address these issues should comprise three broad outcome-oriented goals: 1. Energy storage should be a broadly deployable asset for enhancing renewable penetration - specifically to enable storage deployment at high levels of new renewable generation 2. Energy storage should be available to industry and regulators as an effective option to resolve issues of grid resiliency and reliability 3. Energy storage should be a well-accepted contributor to realization of smart-grid benefits - specifically enabling confident deployment of electric transportation and optimal utilization of demand-side assets. To realize these outcomes, the principal challenges to focus on are: • Cost competitive energy storage technology - Achievement of this goal requires attention to factors such as life-cycle cost and performance (round-trip efficiency, energy density, cycle life, capacity fade, etc.) for energy storage technology as deployed. It is expected that early deployments will be in high value applications, but that long term success requires both cost reduction and the capacity to realize revenue for all grid services storage provides. • Validated reliability and safety - Validation of the safety, reliability, and performance of energy storage is essential for user confidence. • Equitable regulatory environment - Value propositions for grid storage depend on reducing institutional and regulatory hurdles to levels comparable with those of other grid resources. • Industry acceptance - Industry adoption requires that they have confidence storage will deploy as expected, and deliver as predicted and promised. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In parallel, global fresh water resources are strained due to amongst others population and wealth increase and competitive water uses from agriculture and industry is causing many nations to turn to desalination technologies. This article investigates a Jordanian energy scenario with two different desalination technologies; reverse osmosis (RO) driven by electricity and Multi Stage Flash (MSF) desalination driven by Cogeneration of Heat and Power (CHP). The two systems impact the energy systems in different ways due to the technologies’ particular characteristics. The systems are analyses in the energy systems analysis model EnergyPLAN to determine the impacts on energy system performance. Results indicate that RO and MSF are similar in fuel use. While there is no use of waste heat from condensing mode plants, efficiencies for CHP and MSF are not sufficiently good to results in lower fuel usage than RO. The Jordanian energy system is somewhat inflexible giving cause to Critical Excess Electricity Production (CEEP) even at relatively modest wind power penetrations.

The system consists of 1.15 m2 flat-plate collector as a heat source and a desalination unit. The unit is about 400 l vertical cylindrical insulated tank. It includes storage, evaporator, and condenser of hot salt-water that is fed from the collector. The heated water in the collector is raised naturally to the unit bottom at which it is used as storage. A high pressure pump is used to inject the water vertically up through 1-mm three nozzles inside the unit. The hot salt-water is atomized inside the unit where the produced vapor is condensed on the inner surfaces of the unit outer walls to outside. The system was experimentally tested under different weather conditions. It is obtained that the system can produce about 9 l a day per quadratic meter of collector surface area. By that it can produce about 1.6 l/kWh of solar energy. Moreover, the water temperature has a great effect on the system performance although the scaling possibility is becoming significant. By that way the cost of a liter water production is relatively high and is obtained as 0.5 US$.

In oxy-fuel combustion, the combustion gases are oxygen and the recirculating flue gas, and the main components of the combustion gas are O2, CO2 and H2O [1]. The paper presents the results of the calculation of the flue gas amount during combustion of oil shale using oxy-fuel technology in a circulated fluidized bed (CFB) mode. The calculations were performed for different oil shale heating values and different recycled flue gas (RFG) ratios. Oxy-fuel combustion with flue gas recycling was found to enable the decrease of the extent of carbonate minerals decomposition (ECD), thereby increasing the amount of heat released per 1 kg of fuel. To minimize ECD, the recycled flue gas ratio should be maintained at a level higher than 0.7. This condition allows an increase of the partial pressure of CO2 over the equilibrium state line of calcite decomposition reaction at the bed temperature. The decrease of ECD was observed up to kCO2-min = 0.28. The decrease of CO2 k leads to an additional increase in the amount of heat released during oil shale combustion per 1 kg and, depending on the mean lower heating value (LHV), the heat can be increased up to 0.34 MJ/kg. A comparison with the bituminous and anthracite coals revealed that the specific emission of CO2 per input fuel energy for oil shale is expected to be even smaller compared with those of the considered coals. © 2014 Estonian Academy Publishers.","CFB; CO2 emission; Extent of carbonate minerals decomposition; Oil shale; Oxy-fuel combustion","Boilers; Calorific value; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fired boilers; Coal storage; Combustion; Flue gases; Flues; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gases; Recycling; Shale; Shale oil; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Decomposition reaction; Estonian oil shale; Lower heating value; Oil shale combustions; Oxyfuel combustion; Oxyfuel technology; Partial pressure of co; Oil shale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992317612

Adipose tissue contributes significantly to increase pro-inflammatory mediators whose cascade begins with the union of TLR4 to its microbial ligands (TLR: Toll Like Receptors). It has been reported recently that NEFAs (Non-Esterified Fatty Acids) bind to this receptor as agonists. The purpose of our study was to determine the levels of expression of TLR4-CD14, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, the metabolic markers and the NEFAs in a group of adult, non-diabetic obese Mexicans. Method: A group of 210 adult middle-class Mexican non-diabetic obese patients was evaluated: 105 normal weight individuals, and 105 non-diabetic obese. On both groups, the following was tested in each patient: TLR4-CD14 receptors on monocytes in peripheral blood, inflammatory profile, HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance), NEFAs and each individual's anthropometric profile. Results: Obesity is strongly associated with the expression of TLR4 (77%, MFI (Mean Fluorescence Index) 7.70) and CD14 (86% MFI 1.61) with 66% double positives (p = 0.000). These figures contrast with those for the normal weight individuals that constituted the control group: TLR4 (70% MFI 6.41) and CD14 (84% MFI 1.25) with 59% double positives. As for cytokine concentration, non- diabetic obese individuals vs the normal weight/thin, the numbers were: IL-1β = 2.0 vs 2.5 pg/ml (p=NS), IL-6=36 vs 28 pg/ml (p = 0.030), IL-8 = 27 vs 27 pg/ml (p=NS), IL-10=8.4 vs 6.8 pg/ml (p = NS), TNF-α =31 vs 15 pg/ml (p = 0.000) respectively. Insulin levels were 12.1 vs 19.7 mcU/ml (p = 0.000) and the NEFAs were much higher in the obese vs normal weight/thin individuals (p = 0.000). Conclusion: Adipose tissue used to be thought of as mere storage of fats and energy, but it has been revealed to be an important neuro-immune-endocrine organ. Immune cells, stimulated by NEFAs, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, which have a direct effect on oxidating radicals that directly target the release of noradrenalin. This in turn, reactivates the vicious cycle of low-grade chronic inflammation, as is now described in obesity. © 2014 De Loera-Rodriguez et al.","Inflammatory cytokines; Metabolic markers; NEFAs; Obesity; TLR4","biological marker; CD14 antigen; fatty acid; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor; abdominal circumference; adipose tissue; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; body fat; body mass; body weight; controlled study; descriptive research; diabetic patient; disease association; energy; female; hip circumference; human; human cell; immunopathogenesis; inflammation; major clinical study; male; mean fluorescence index; Mestizo; Mexican; monocyte; nondiabetic patient; obesity; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; protein expression; social status; waist hip ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988378228

However, since its inception the wind energy industry has experienced high gearbox failure rates [1]. In order to achieve their stated design life goals of 20 years, most systems require significant repairs or overhauls well before the intended life is reached [2-4]. Some firm conclusions about the nature of the failures have been made based on the work of Musial et al. [5]: (i) gearbox failures are not specific to a single gear manufacturer or turbine model, which are general; (ii) poor adherence to accepted gear industry practices, or otherwise poor workmanship, is not the primary source of failures; (iii) most gearbox failures do not begin as gear failures or gear-tooth design deficiencies, and up to 10% of gearbox failures may be manufacturing anomalies and quality issues that are gear related; (iv) the majority of wind turbine gearbox failures appear to initiate in the bearings, and (v) it is believed that the gearbox failures observed in the earlier 500 kW to 1000 kW sizes 5 to 10 years ago may still occur in many of the larger 1 to 2 MW gearboxes being built today with the same architecture. With larger wind turbines, the cost of gearbox rebuilds, as well as the down time associated with these failures, has become a significant portion of the overall cost of wind energy [6]. Presently NREL is performing a long-term project to improve the accuracy of dynamic gearbox testing to assess gearbox and drivetrain options, problems, and solutions under simulated field conditions. In addition, in order to increase the longterm reliability of gearboxes and make their design more reasonable, there is increasing interest in utilizing time domain simulations and physical tests in the prediction of gearbox design loads, with the continual development of computer technology, simulation tools and measurement equipments. In several previous studies Klose et al. [7] performed an integrated analysis of wind turbine behavior and structural dynamics of a jacket support structure under combined wind and wave loads in the time domain. Seidel et al. [8] used the sequential coupling and the full coupling methods to simulate offshore loads on jacket wind turbines, and validated these methods using measurement data from the DOWNVInD project. Gao and Moan [9] performed long-term fatigue analysis of offshore fixed wind turbines using time domain simulations. Dong et al. [10] performed longterm fatigue analysis of multi-planar tubular joints for jacket-type offshore wind turbines using time domain simulations. Peeters et al. [11, 12], Xing et al. [13] performed a detailed analysis of internal drive train dynamics in a wind turbine using multi-body simulations. However, there is, at present, limited literature concerning long-term time-domain based analysis of mechanical components, e.g., main shaft, gears and bearings, in the wind turbine drive train system under dynamic conditions. This is mainly due to the complexities involved in modeling and simulating the drivetrain with respect to the computation efforts and scale. Recently, Dong et al. [14] established and applied a long-term time domain based gear contact fatigue analysis of a wind turbine under dynamic conditions. In the present study, several practical problems of time domain based gear contact fatigue analysis encountered in [14] are described and discussed. These are: (1) the rotation reversal problem of gears under low wind speed conditions, (2) the statistical uncertainty effect due to the time domain simulation and (3) simplified long term contact fatigue analysis of gear teeth under dynamic conditions. Several useful suggestions to address these issues are proposed. © 2014 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",,"Bearings (machine parts); Digital storage; Dynamics; Failure analysis; Fatigue of materials; Gear manufacture; Gear teeth; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind turbines; Structural dynamics; Turbine components; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Wind power; Contact fatigue analysis; Design and implementations; Large scale wind turbines; Low wind speed condition; Multi-planar tubular joints; Simulated field conditions; Statistical uncertainty; Time-domain simulations; Time domain analysis",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987922276

The general principles of the creation of preventive sour-milk beverages and the principal requirements to wild-growing raw materials used to enrich their composition are formulated. Tavolga syrup based on herbs, such as megasea (Bergénia crassifólia), meadowsweet (Filipéndula ulmária), and peppermint (Méntha piperíta), and also whey extract and syrup based on balm (Melissa officinalis) are used in the work. The main regularities of the formation of organoleptic, physicochemical, mechanostructural, and probiotic properties of the sour-milk products with the use of aqueous and whey extracts and syrups based on wild-growing raw materials are shown. The prospects and possibility of the application of curd whey, which extracts nutrients from plant raw material, in the production of enriched sour-milk products is demonstrated. The content of milk whey in a sour-milk product is from 5 to 30%. The use of Tavolga syrup excludes the addition of colorants, flavors, and stabilizers, reduces the energy expenditures due to a decrease in the baking time, inhibits the accumulation of lactic acid by starter cultures, and also suppresses the growth of opportunistic microflora during the storage of sour-milk beverages. The technologies of Tavolga phyto-fermented baked milk and phytoyoghurt and Melissa and Lesnoi kefir beverages are described, and the nutritional value of the new sour-milk beverages is shown, including their vitamin composition.

Introduction of sprouts into the diet stimulates metabolism and hematopoiesis, boosts immunity, compensates for vitamin and mineral deficiency, normalizes the acid-alkaline balance, promotes the elimination of toxins from the body, stimulates digestion, and slows the aging process. The use of sprouted wheat grains in public catering is very limited due to the short shelf-life of this product. Storage of dried grains provides a solution for this problem; however, it necessitates the development of a technology for the use of dried sprouted wheat grain. The present study was a part of research on the powder produced from sprouted wheat and centered on the process of hydrothermal treatment of dry sprouted wheat powder. Conventional methods were used in the present work for the analysis of physical and chemical parameters. A range of factors, including the protein content of the powder, the degree of mechanical damage of the starch granules, and the pH value of the solution, affects the water absorption capacity of the powder produced from sprouted wheat. Treatment time, temperature, and mash ratio at pH 4.5 and pH 7.0 were varied in experiments performed to determine the optimum operating parameters of the hydrothermal processing. As a result of the study, an energy-efficient technology has been developed for the hydrothermal processing of powdered sprouted wheat grains. The following process parameters were selected: an optimum swelling temperature of 45°C, hydrothermal treatment duration of 60 min at pH 4.5, and an optimum mash ratio of 1:1.25.","Powdered germinated wheat grains; Technological parameters of hydrothermal processing; The degree of powder swelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984863394

Glycosides contain aglycons attached by a β-glycosidic bond to C1 of the saccharide moiety. Glycosylation is one of the mechanisms maintaining cellular homeostasis through the regulation of the level, biological activity, and subcellular distribution of the glycosylated compounds. The glycosides play various functions in plant cells, such as high-energy donors, or signalling molecules, and are involved in biosynthesis of cell walls. Plant cells exhibit structural and functional diversity of UGT proteins. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains more than 100 genes encoding GTases, which belong to 91 families, and are deposited in the CAZY (Carbohydrate Active enzyme) database (www. cazy.org/GlycosylTransferases.html). The largest UGT1 class is divided into 14 subfamilies (A-N), and includes proteins containing highly conserved 44-amino acid PSPG (Plant Secondary Product Glycosyltransferase) motif at the C-terminus. The PSPG motif is involved in the binding of UDP-sugar donors to the enzyme. UGT1's catalyze the biosynthesis of both ester-type and ether-type conjugates of plant hormones (phytohormones). Conjugation of the phytohormones is an important mechanism that regulates the concentration of physiological active hormone levels during growth and development of plants. Glycoconjugation of phytohormones is widespread in the plant kingdom and all known phytohormones are able to form these conjugates. Most plant hormone conjugates do not indicate physiological activity, but rather are involved in transport, storage and degradation of the phytohormones. UDPG-dependent glycosyltransferases possess high substrate specificity, even within a given class of phytohormones. In many cases, the phenotype of plants is strongly affected by loss-of-function mutations in UGT genes. In this paper, advances in the isolation and characterization of glycosyltransferases of all plant hormones: auxin, brassinosteroids, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid, jasmonates, and salicylate is described.","Auxin; Brassinosteroid; Cytokinin; Glycosylation; Phytohormones; UDP-glycosyltransferases","abscisic acid; aglycone; amino acid; auxin; brassinosteroid; carbohydrate; cytokinin; ester; gibberellin; glycosyltransferase; jasmonic acid; phytohormone; salicylic acid; uridine diphosphate; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; biological activity; cell wall; cellular distribution; conjugation; enzyme specificity; glycosylation; hormone determination; loss of function mutation; nonhuman; phenotype; plant cell; plant genome; protein degradation; protein function; stereospecificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962110296

Some of the political, social and economic pressures facing South Africa’s decision makers in the water sector include having enough infrastructure to secure water during low rainfall periods and supply areas of high demand, growing enough food to supply the population, and meeting the water demands of energy, industry and mining (Claassen 2010). At present most of the country’s water supply has already been allocated. The only remaining ‘supply options’ available are linked to reallocations between different water use sectors (De Lange 2010). An additional problem that aggravates South Africa’s situation of water scarcity is the deteriorating water quality in the country’s major river systems, water storage reservoirs and groundwater resources, which results in social, economic and health risks to society (Ashton 2010). Particular problems include acid mine drainage, eutrophication and soil erosion. In addition to the problems of water scarcity and water quality, the South African government also faces the challenge of redressing the backlog in water supply and sanitation that it has inherited from the apartheid government. The South African government started the process of developing and introducing a number of water reforms when it came to power in 1994, to address this backlog and manage South Africa’s situation of water scarcity. © Dave Huitema and Sander Meijerink 2014.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961325198

However, Mobile Sink (MS) based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) showed great advantage over the traditional WSN for saving energy [36]. By adopting good movement strategy for mobile sink, routing, data gathering and communication policy, MS based WSN can more effectively utilize all the available resources as compared to traditional WSN. On the contrary Cloud Computing provides computing and storage resources typically through the Internet. Therefore, there is a recent trend to combine MS based WSN with the clouds so that both can get benefit from each other. In this chapter, we first give an introduction to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Mobile Sink based WSN and Cloud Computing. After then, we give an overview of state-of-the-art work on Wireless Sensor based Cloud Computing (WSCC). Subsequently, integration of WSN and Cloud Computing is highlighted with some insights on how WSN and Clouds can both get benefits from each other. Applications of Wireless Sensors over the cloud are then described. Afterwards, we explain incorporation of mobile sink between WSN and Cloud.

To accomplish this, BCAP is charged with two tasks: (1) to support the establishment and production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy in selected areas, and (2) to assist agricultural and forest land owners and operators with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility. BCAP was created in 2008 by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246, 2008 farm bill). The 2014 farm bill (Agricultural Act of 2014; P.L. 113-79) extends BCAP through FY2018, with some modifications to its implementation. BCAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Farm Service Agency (FSA). BCAP provides two categories of financial assistance: (1) annual and establishment payments that share in the cost of establishing and maintaining production of eligible biomass crops; and (2) matching payments that share in the cost of the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of biomass to an eligible biomass conversion facility. The payments have different eligibility and sign-up requirements, payment rates, and contract lengths. BCAP assistance for establishing and producing biomass crops is available within designated project areas. BCAP project areas are specific geographic areas where producers may enroll land into BCAP contracts and produce specified biomass crops. As of June 2012, eleven BCAP project areas had been approved. Under the 2008 farm bill, BCAP was authorized to receive such sums as necessary, meaning that funding for BCAP was both mandatory through the Commodity Credit Corporation and open-ended since it depended on program participation. However, Congress-as part of the annual appropriations process-capped BCAP funding in FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. In response to funding reductions, USDA temporarily suspended the CHST matching payment portion of the program through FY2011, and re-prioritized future program funds in favor of uses that emphasize annual and establishment payments, especially under existing contracts, over CHST matching payments. Under the 2014 farm bill, BCAP is authorized with mandatory funding of $25 million for each of FY2014 through FY2018; no discretionary funding is authorized. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958605741

By using this generator, the efficiency of the system increased since certain losses were removed. The perturbation and observation method of MPPT is used to achieve maximum power extraction from the solar panel. The hybrid system was modelled in Matlab/Simulink software. A squirrel cage induction motor was used as the electrical load to the system load. The results obtained for the proposed hybrid system indicates that it can be used as an isolated power supply.

This need has prompted a massive effort in the synthesis and throughout characterisation of novel hydrides and better understanding of these materials and mechanisms of hydrogen absorption and desorption. This knowledge, in turn, follows to rational-based further improvement of solid-state materials for hydrogen storage. Here is given a critical review of experimental infrared spectroscopy (IR) of metal hydride complexes. The included techniques are transmission, attenuated total reflection, diffuse reflection, photoacoustic, variable temperature and variable pressure IR. The advantage of IR spectroscopy lies in its flexibility. It is not restricted to crystalline systems, allowing the observation of amorphous and nanocrystalline materials. Furthermore, it allows in-situ follow-up of hydrogen sorption processes with respect not only to amount of hydrogen, but also ambient pressure and temperature. Changes in the bands due to the metal-hydrogen stretching and bending vibrations, corresponding to specific functional groups in the mid-IR region, lead to detection of reaction intermediates and phase transitions. This approach, giving a direct insight at molecular level, shows favourable features compared to adsorption/desorption calorimetry or to other classical methods. On the other hand, quantum chemical calculations sinergistically support the experimental IR spectroscopy. Namely, comparison of computed and experimental spectra provides an unambigious assignment of spectra and gives a unique and very clear insight into the microscopic background of observed features. This review is focused on alkali metal, alkaline earth and aluminiumborohydrides, alanates, amides and amidoboranes. They are all ionic or covalent complex hydrides, as opposed to hydrogen-in-metal systems, where hydrogen occupies interstitial sites. Although the anion of complex hydrides predominantly determines its properties, central atom often determines the stability of the material, providing a fine tuning of the hydrogen-sorption behaviour. Thus, the understanding of the nature of bonding is crucial with regard to rational tailoring of the properties of material. Among the materials for solid-state hydrogen storage, complex light-metal hydrides, especially borohydrides and amidoboranes experienced a renaissance in a last few years. Considerable improvement of their hydrogen sorption behaviour is achieved, especially by restriction of their particle size to nanodimensions and by addition of catalyticalyactive impurities. Although these achievements launched them to the most promising systems for technologically relevant solid-state hydrogen storage, crucial mechanistic details are still unclear. IR spectroscopy, by giving a direct microscopic insight into the sample, provides a unique opportunity to clarify these aspects of operation of complex hydrides, which are of crucial importance with respect of hydrogen storage. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Integration of the various environmental cues will eventually determine which populations will be able to breed at an appropriate time thus surviving as a species in xeric environments. Osmotic stress was noted as an effective internal signal for reducing reproductive activity in desert-adapted Acomys populations. In the basis of our study lies the assumption that a possible mechanism by which dietary salinity causes an osmotic stress, which affects reproduction in desert adapted common spiny mice Acomys cahirinus in association with osmoregulatory hormones; vasopressin and aldosterone. As leptin regulates energy intake, it seemed of great interest to assess its role in reproduction of desert adapted rodents, inhabiting an unpredictable environment. For a long time energy source storage seemed as the only role of WAT, apart from providing thermal and mechanical insulation. For now WAT in our understanding is a highly dynamic, endocrine tissue, being involved in a wide range of physiological and metabolic processes far beyond the paradigm of fuel storage. White adipocytes secrete several major hormones, protein signals and factors, most notably is the peptide hormone leptin. Circulating leptin levels serve as a signal for the state of body energy repletion to body cells most importantly the central nervous system (CNS) where it suppresses food intake and permits energy expenditure.

Thermodynamic analyses of the heating system combined with solar panels, ground-sourced heat pump, and latent-heat storage are conducted. Lastly for variable ground temperature and solar radiation, changes in amount of heat storage in a heat storage system are analysed. For a 6-month heating period, analyses showed that especially in winter, energy consumption in compressor shows a sharp rise.

Wind turbine plant power output has a fluctuating and interrupted nature, and the penetration of the electrical energy to the grid usually poses problems to the steady operation of the system. Pumped storage hydropower is a mature technology in the energy storage sector. Pumped storage hydropower has advantages compared to other energy storage technologies such as CAES, batteries, etc. due to its short discharge time, high energy storage capacities, and high power output. The first objective of this study is to time-shift the power output of the wind turbine plant to the peak-demand periods by means of storage and thus realizing increase in the penetration level to the grid. The second objective is to obtain a more stable power output from the wind turbine plant that inevitably has a variable power output. A 1-year operation simulation of the hybrid system was carried out under peak tariff strategy within the scope of these two objectives. An operation simulation was also made covering only the wind turbine plant with same power output data and same demand strategy and the results were compared. Without storage, the wind turbine plant feeds 6,350.30 MW h of electrical energy into the grid; this value increases to 7,656.00 MW h for the hybrid system, and this means that there is 17.05 % increase in penetration and the system is technically applicable for the first objective. Annual stable power output ratio that shows the fulfillment of demand is approximately 72.49 % for wind turbine plant without storage, and this value is approximately 87.40 % for the hybrid system. This means that there is a 14.91 % increase and that the system is technically applicable for the second objective. This paper provides the details of the year-long analysis, draws generalized conclusions, and provides recommendations for future studies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Energy storage; Hybrid systems; Pumped storage hydropower plants; Wind turbine plants","Digital storage; Energy storage; Hybrid systems; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Thermoelectric power; Wind turbines; Electrical energy; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage technologies; High power output; Operation simulation; Parametric -analysis; Penetration level; Pumped storage hydropower plants; Electric power transmission networks",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949558746

Full evaluation of the costsand benefits of solar requires that a variety of solar options are included in a diverse setof candidate portfolios. The design of candidate portfolios evaluated in the studies,particularly regarding the methods used to rank potential resource options, can beimproved. We found that studies account for the capacity value of solar, though capacitycredit estimates with increasing penetration can be improved. Furthermore, while mostLSEs have the right approach and tools to evaluate the energy value of solar,improvements remain possible, particularly in estimating solar integration costs used toadjust energy value. Transmission and distribution benefits, or costs, related to solar arerarely included in studies. Similarly, few LSE planning studies can reflect the full rangeof potential benefits from adding thermal storage and/or natural gas augmentation to concentrating solar power plants.

This paper proposes the modeling and control of lateral tower vibrations in offshore wind turbines using active generator torque. To implement the active control algorithm, both the mechanical and power electronic aspects have been taken into consideration. A 13-degrees-of-freedom aeroelastic wind turbine model with generator and pitch controllers is derived using the Euler-Lagrangian approach. The model displays important features of wind turbines, such as mixed moving frame and fixed frame-defined degrees-of-freedom, couplings of the tower-blade-drivetrain vibrations, as well as aerodynamic damping present in different modes of motions. The load transfer mechanisms from the drivetrain and the generator to the nacelle are derived, and the interaction between the generator torque and the lateral tower vibration are presented in a generalized manner. A three-dimensional rotational sampled turbulence field is generated and applied to the rotor, and the tower is excited by a first order wave load in the lateral direction. Next, a simple active control algorithm is proposed based on active generator torques with feedback from the measured lateral tower vibrations. A full-scale power converter configuration with a cascaded loop control structure is also introduced to produce the feedback control torque in real time. Numerical simulations have been carried out using data calibrated to the referential 5-MW NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) offshore wind turbine. Cases of drivetrains with a gearbox and direct drive to the generator are considered using the same time series for the wave and turbulence loadings. Results show that by using active generator torque control, lateral tower vibrations can be significantly mitigated for both gear-driven and direct-driven wind turbines, with modest influence on the smoothness of the power output from the generator. © 2014 by the authors.","Active generator control; Aeroelastic model; Feedback control; Lateral tower vibration; Offshore wind turbine","Aerodynamics; Aeroelasticity; Algorithms; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Digital storage; Electric generators; Electric machine theory; Fatigue of materials; Feedback control; Lagrange multipliers; Research laboratories; Structural loads; Torque; Towers; Turbomachine blades; Turbulence; Vibrations (mechanical); Active generator torque controls; Aeroelastic modeling; Converter configurations; Direct-driven wind turbine; Generator controls; Large amplitude vibrations; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Tower vibrations; Offshore wind turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949115510

Citric acid can be metabolized by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) producing lactic and acetic acids and 4-carbon compounds, mainly diacetyl, acetoin and butanediol. One of these compounds, diacetyl is responsible for the buttery aroma of dairy products. Diacetyl presence in wine is considered as one of the most important flavors produced by LAB during malolactic fermentation. When present at a concentration above the sensory threshold, diacetyl gives the wine an aroma which can be characterized as buttery or nutty. Cells of Oenococcus oeni from wines co-metabolizing citrate with glucose mainly produced acetate, lactate, and carbon dioxide increasing rate and molar yield but not the aroma compounds. However, the presence of diacetyl in fruits or fresh juice is prejudicial. In this sense, the autochthonous lactic microbiota growth from tomato puree produced undesirable buttermilk and fermented flavor by the high diacetyl and organic acids concentrations from sugars and citrate utilization. Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides when inoculated on puree inhibited the natural microbiota development. In this condition, citric and malic acids were not utilized and significant differences in the quantities of the metabolites produced (diacetyl and organic acids) in the different uninoculated/inoculated media during storage were found. On the other hand, studies on citric acid metabolism by Lactobacillus plantarum in orange juice demonstrated that it was also utilized in co-metabolism with glucose and fructose during its growth at 30°C, yielding significant lactic and acetic acids amounts with a concomitant pH reduction but not diacetyl, acetoin and butanediol. This result support the idea that Lact. plantarum strain could be used for application in acid vegetables fermentation, which is expected to become each more important to ensuring food safety and maintaining nutritional and sensory quality. It is interesting to note that during juice storage at 4°C only L-malic and citric acids were partially metabolized, indicating that they were used as energy source, since the strain survived without causing spoilage. Thus, the knowledge on citric acid occurrence and its metabolism by LAB in fermented beverages and fruit juices is of capital importance since it not only influence their flavor but also the stability, nutrition, acceptability and keeping quality of foods. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949008547

While coal reserves present an opportunity for enhanced energysecurity, the coal to liquids (CTL) fuel process upon which Sasol’s success has been builtis a significant contributor to South Africa’s green house gas (GHG) emissions. In responseto the need to move towards lower carbon and greener operations, four distinctive Sasolinitiatives are highlighted. These are: energy efficiency, low carbon electricity, the carboncapture and storage (CCS) initiative, and the natural gas conversion project. In 2008, Sasol established the New Energy Investment Company to drive these initiatives. Sasol’snatural gas conversion project emerged as a major breakthrough in the transition to a lowcarbon and greener economy. Based on estimates provided, the conversion to natural gascontributed towards improved air quality.

The Alaska LNG Project (AKLNG) will now move into the pre-front end engineering and design phase to further refine the cost and engineering aspects of the project. The project involves a one-of-a-kind arctic-based gas treatment plant, an 800-mi large-dia, high-pressure pipeline, and a major liquefaction and storage complex at Alaska's tidewater on the Kenai Peninsula at Nikiski. Aside from the three major project sections, there also a 58-mi, 30-in. pipeline from the Point Thompson field to the North Slope gas treatment plant. Another $11-14 billion was estimated by TransCanada and ExxonMobil to cover the cost of the 800-mi, 42-in. pipeline that will parallel TAPS for much of its route before veering west to the tidelands plant site.

However, these resources cause an extra dependency in both time and carrier domains that should be considered through a comprehensive model. Hence, this paper introduces a new concept for internal and external dependencies in Smart Multi-Energy Systems (SMES). Internal dependencies are caused by converters and storages existing in operation centers and modeled by coupling matrix. On the other hand, external dependencies are defined as the behavior of multi-energy demand in shifting among carriers or time periods. In this paper, system dependency is modeled based on energy hub approach through adding virtual ports and making new coupling matrix. Being achieved by SMESs, the dependencies release demand-side flexibility and subsequently enhance system efficiency. Moreover, a test SMES that includes several elements and multi-energy demand in output is applied to show the effectiveness of the model. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.","Dependency modeling; internal and external dependency; smart multi-energy system","Energy management; Energy resources; Matrix algebra; Comprehensive model; Dependency model; Distributed Energy Resources; internal and external dependency; Multi-energy systems; Operation center; System dependencies; System efficiency; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940223396

Within the SG paradigm, the Microgrid (MG) can be regarded as a highly flexible and controllable Low Voltage (LV) cell, which is able to decentralize the distribution management and control system while providing additional controllability and observability. A network of controllers interconnected by a communication system ensures the management and control of the LV microgrid, enabling both interconnected and autonomous operation modes. This new distribution operation philosophy is in line with the SG paradigm, since it improves the security and reliability of the system, being able to tackle the technical challenges resulting from the large scale integration of DER and provide the adequate framework to fully integrate SG new players such as the EV. By exploiting the MG operational flexibility and controllability, this chapter aims to provide an extended overview on MG self-healing capabilities, namely on its ability of operating autonomously from the main grid and perform local service restoration. The MG hierarchical management and control structure is revisited and adapted in order to exploit the flexibility of SG new players, like the EV and flexible loads and integrate smart metering infrastructures. The implementation of the MG architecture and communication infrastructure in a laboratorial facility is also presented and used to validate the MG self-healing capabilities. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.","Demand response; Electric vehicle; Frequency control; Islanding operation; Microgeneration; Microgrids; Smart grid","Electric frequency control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Microgrids; Observability; Self-healing materials; Communication infrastructure; Controllability and observabilities; Demand response; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Islanding operations; Microgeneration; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939849036

The continued reliance on diesel generators for rural electrification is increasingly becoming unsustainable, due to a number of factors, among which includes their high fuel dependency, and the uncertainty surrounding the price and availability of fossil fuels. While the influx of renewable energy technologies has provided a means for providing off-grid electrification services, the intermittent nature of renewable resources poses a challenge, as energy generation does not always coincide with usage. Through a combination of renewable energy technologies, energy storage, and conventional diesel generation, a hybrid mini-grid system is able to achieve synergy in operation, hence providing a reliable means of extending electricity services to rural consumers. In this paper, a hybrid mini-grid system is proposed for the supply of electricity to a remote village in Uganda.

Two similar forklift setups equipped with either electric or direct hydraulic energy storage are compared. In the first setup, the forklift lifting system is controlled directly with an electric servomotor drive. The servomotor drives a hydraulic pump capable of also operating as a hydraulic motor during lowering motion. In the second setup, the hydraulically operated forklift is equipped with an energy recovery system consisting of pressure accumulators for storing energy and a hydraulic digital valve package for precise leakage free flow control. This paper describes the arrangements of the experimental setups. The results of the proposed systems are then compared from the energy efficiency point of view. Energy-savings ratios for electric and hydraulic test systems were calculated for different fork velocities and payloads. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

Innovations of enabling materials (catalysts, adsorbents, membranes), efficient processing schemes, robust products portfolios and smart business strategies are needed to close the priority gap between fossil and the more complex renewable resources. Co-production of (platform) chemicals and bio-products can improve the economical basis. Options for thermochemical processing towards fuels include the pyrolysis route, which is proceeding via bio-oil (BO) upgrading, and the alternative gasification route, which is proceeding via syngas followed by catalytic synthesis, e.g. Fischer-Tropsch. The number of conditioning and conversion steps that can be envisaged along both routes needs to be minimized. Basic pretreatment of raw BO is chemical stabilization, which enables its storage or transport. More advanced upgrading is required to reach oil qualities suitable for heat and power, and even more advanced for transport applications (including aviation fuel). Catalysts and hydrogen can provide the required processing flexibility and product quality. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is one of the most attractive upgrading options, enabling removal of heteroatoms, adding energy, and chemical transformations for tuning of properties. This review focuses on HDO and the catalytic properties of metal carbides, nitrides and phosphides, the potential of mesoporous-based catalytic materials, and also of noble metals. An overview of matured hydrotreating (HT) technology and conventional catalysts for HDS is provided as the benchmarking technology for developments towards increased biomass utilization. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937433093

Forest operations are the most costly part of forest management and at the same time can be traced to most of the negative externalities on the environment often with strong visual impacts, especially in steep terrain. This paper reviews emerging technology-based engineering solutions that may reduce the impact of forest operations on the environment while increasing the efficiency of operations resulting in an overall higher level of forest ecosystem service provision. Advances in forest machine control and automation systems, and the availability of remotely-sensed high resolution data now provide considerable potential to improve the management and precision of forest operations. Improved planning procedures and more precise operations offer a considerable opportunity for mitigating environmental damage. Accurate positioning of operations machinery allows for the generation of automated warnings in the case of transgressing property or key habitat boundaries. Terrain models derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have been shown to be useful in locating effective extraction trails or timber landings, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing site impact such as rutting and compaction. © 2014 River Publishers.","Environmental impact; Forest operations; Logging; Timber harvesting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930064968

Drops of graphene oxide were added to the powder of Li4Ti5O12, and thus enhanced the structural stability of the alloying.

The developed power control system was used to study the operations of the PV-Battery energy system. From the control output results, it was shown that the load and the supplied energy is efficiently and rationally utilized. A simulation analysis was performed using hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) software and the results indicate that the most optimized PVBattery power system for energy consumption of 2.3kWh/day with a 235W peak demand load consists of 0.9 kW solar PV array, 9 Hoppecke 24 OPzS 300 Battery and a 1kW DC/AC inverter. This energy system can be used in any other registration exercises such as the National Identity Registration or Examination registration etc., and may also be applied to other regions of the country.","Direct data capturing machines (DDCMs); HOMER; Power supply; Solar - PV system; System design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928108846

This work contributes to research knowledge by proposing and validating a sound biometric technique for allowing to reduce the consumption of the generated power energy by turn the lights on for the public roads only when there are vehicles on the way and only for some period of time to make the driving out of harm's way and trouble-free. The proposed and combination models between the PVS and biometric sound chip is used for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun light into a flow of direct current electricity, which can be used to power equipment or to recharge a battery. In addition the Sound biometric techniques can enable PVS to listen and understand their surrounding auditory environment since turning the lights on all the time will get through a lot of energy which it might be used in other significant concerns.

Image compression technology is therefore essential to overcome these problems. Practically efficient compression systems based on hybrid coding which combines the advantages of different methods of image coding have also being developed over the years. In this paper, different hybrid approaches to image compression are discussed. Hybrid coding of images, in this research, deals with combining three approaches to enhance the individual methods and achieve better quality reconstructed images with higher compression ratio. In this paper A new Hybrid neural-network, vector quantization and discrete cosine transform compression method is presented. This scheme combines the high compression ratio of Neural network (NN) and Vector Quantization (VQ) with the good energy-compaction property of Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT). In order to increase the compression ratio while preserving decent reconstructed image quality, Image is compressed using Neural Network, then take the hidden layer outputs as input to re-compress it using vector quantization (VQ), while DCT was used the code books block. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The performance of this method is compared with the available jpeg compression technique over a large number of images, showing good performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,"Codes (symbols); Compaction; Discrete cosine transforms; Image communication systems; Image compression; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Vector quantization; Vectors; Compression technologies; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); High compression ratio; Higher compression ratios; Hybrid image compressions; Hybrid neural networks; Neural network (nn); Video transmissions; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927725157

Modern video surveillance systems are equipped with techniques that allow traversal of data in an effective and efficient manner, giving massive powers to operators and potentially compromising the privacy of anyone observed by the system. Several techniques to protect the privacy of individuals have therefore been proposed, but very little research work has focused on the specific security requirements of video surveillance data (in transit or in storage) and on authorizing access to this data. In this paper, we present a general model of video surveillance systems that will help identify the major security and privacy requirements for a video surveillance system and we use this model to identify practical challenges in ensuring the security of video surveillance data in all stages (in transit and at rest).

CCS is considered a critical component of the portfolio of carbon mitigation solutions, because global economy heavily relies and will continue to rely on fossil fuels in the foreseeable future. Currently, there are close to 300 active and planned CCS-related projects around the world— an indication of a growing commitment to this technological option. However, despite significant progress in CCS technology, the pace of CCS commercial deployment is rather slow. The major challenges facing the large-scale CCS deployment worldwide relate to a very high financial barrier and limited economic stimuli or regulatory drivers to encourage investments in the technology. This chapter highlights scientific and engineering progress in all three major stages of the CCS chain, CO2 capture, transport, and storage, and the current status of existing and planned commercial CCS projects.

The high cost of photovoltaic solar power makes it necessary to track the maximum power point (MPP) of the photovoltaic generator regardless the adopted scheme for the power converters. Several maximum power point tracking techniques for photovoltaic systems have been developed to maximize the produced energy and most of these techniques are well published. The topology adopted for this implementation consists of two main blocs. In the first one, a buck-boost-type converter is used to interface the photovoltaic generator (PVG) to the voltage bus of the inverter. The second bloc contains a five-level diode-clamped multilevel inverter (DCMLI), generating fundamental modulation staircase three-phase output voltages. A microcontroller is used to control both converters. Experimental tests were done using a set of two tanks, one for extracting water and the other for the storage. The pumping system is built around an induction motor coupled to a single centrifugal pump. The main idea of such a system is to improve the global efficiency by increasing the stored water in a day. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Buck-boost converter; MPPT; Multilevel inverter; Photovoltaic generator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924731323

In that way, one of the most popular solutions as well in transmission as in distribution grids is certainly coming from wind energy. However, wind resources on a given location randomly fluctuate with time and have thus a major impact on the capacity of the electrical system to continuously face the load. In order to evaluate this impact and to consequently adapt required reinforcements, Monte Carlo simulations are often used. Those approach can be either sequential or not. Nowadays, load shifting solutions (storage, demand side management…) are practically set in order to adapt consumption to time varying generation without involving too consequent investments. In that way, sequential approach is currently preferred when it comes to long-term planning evaluation and adapted time series models are developed to characterize wind generation on a given site. The consideration of the geographical correlation between those models has been recently investigated in some references. This paper proposes to complete those contributions by evaluating the impact of wind geographical correlation on classical reliability indices such as the Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) or the Expected Energy not Served (EENS). © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Geographical correlation; Monte carlo simulation; Reliability; Wind generation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924690737

It is named “enhanced linear exponential smoothing” or ELES. Compared among other smoothing methods, ELES requires a minimum energy storage capacity to alleviate the same level of power variation. ELES has been derived from a well-known financial forecasting method so-called “linear exponential smoothing (LES)”. This paper presents how LES can overcome disadvantages of the existing techniques. However, in case of PV power generation, a phase delay introduced in LES yet leads to an increment of required storage capacity. To further improve the system performance, ELES has been proposed to shorten LES surplus phase delay. Importantly, this paper presents how the positive factor of LES can be optimized and how an appropriated weighted averaging constant can be chosen. To verify the performance of the proposed technique, a battery energy storage system with ELES technique is simulated under a set of measured PV generated power profiles. The key results indicate that ELES effectively performs, when compared to others, especially the energy storage capacity reduction feature. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Energy storage systems; Photovoltaic generations; Power smoothing; Smart grid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924672133

In the literature it is argued that solar cookers are often implemented as a ""solution looking for a problem"", without consideration of the end-user needs. This study contributes to this debate by investigating the energy patterns and cooking profiles of public institutions for the design and implementation of solar cookers in the case of Mozambique. Interviews were conducted with 12 health institutions in Maputo and Sofala province in Mozambique. The paper concludes that solar cooking presents one solution to overcome the energy crisis in SubSaharan Africa but not the only solution. Solar cookers could improve the current cooking situation if combined with heat storage, back up, or a hybrid system that ensures reliability also during evening hours and rainy days. In general we could see that solar cookers should fulfill a variety of requirements related to cooking habits, schedule of daily routine and performance that are considered to enhance levels of use. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Mozambique; SCOT; Solar cooking","Energy policy; Heat storage; Hybrid systems; Solar equipment; Design and implementations; Energy patterns; Mozambique; Public institution; SCOT; Solar cooking; Solar energy technologies; Sub-saharan africa; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924222400

By integrating this additional current collector layer into the SC structure, the carbon-nanotube (CNT)-based SC showed an improved capacitive performance. The specific capacitances of the CNT/Cu/PET SC and CNT/Au/PET SC were 4.312 × 10-3 F cm-2 and 3.683 × 10-3 F cm-2 respectively, about 60 times larger than that obtained from the CNT/PET SC without the metal collector layer. On the other hand, the energy densities of these CNT-based SCs with metal layers were found to be ∼50 fold increased as compared to the CNT/PET SC. Similarly, the power densities of these two SCs with current collector layers were two orders of magnitude larger than that of CNT/PET SC. High flexibility was also demonstrated in these two metal-layered SCs. For the durability measurement, the CNT/Au/PET SC showed a stable performance, with its specific capacitance maintained at about 89% of its initial value after 2500 charge-discharge cycles. However, the CNT/Cu/PET SC only showed a relatively short-term stability, as its specific capacitance dropped to 12% of its initial value after 2500 charge-discharge cycles. In order to further improve its capacitive performance, polyaniline (PANI) was deposited on the CNT/Au/PET SC surface using a cyclic voltammetric deposition method. A specific capacitance of 0.103 F cm-2, about 30 times larger than that of the CNT/Au/PET SC, was obtained in the PANI/CNT/Au/PET SC which also showed good flexibility as well as high stability performance, with only 11% drop after 2500 charge-discharge cycles. On the basis of our results, we believe that by integrating a thin current collector layer into the textile-based CNT SC, its specific capacitance is enhanced while its flexibility and durability can be maintained.

Now we know that they release a huge number of paracrine and endocrine biologically active molecules. This is also the case for perivascular adipose tissue (P VAT) that surrounds almost all blood vessels in the organism. P VAT secretes the so-called adipo(cyto)kines that, because of its proximity, can easily influence vascular smooth muscle cells. The role of P VAT on vascular function can be both protective and deleterious. Normal healthy P VAT, as present in lean subjects, helps to keep the blood vessels dilated as its presence diminishes the effect of vasocontractile agents. Obesity is associated with an increased mass in PVAT. Excessive adipocyte hypertrophy may result in “adiposopathy” in which P VAT attracts macrophages and becomes a more inflammatory phenotype. This leads to a change in profile of the released adipo(cyto)kines, resulting in a decreased vasorelaxing effect of PVAT, which may be linked to obesity-induced hypertension. It also results in smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions.

It is highly tolerant to drought and hot weather. It can be compressed to form pellets, which can be used as livestock, or energy pellets similar to charcoals. Drying is required to process the grass into a safe storage condition. Moisture sorption isotherms are required to design and optimize the drying process of the grass. Therefore, moisture sorption isotherms were studied using gravimetric methods at temperatures ranging from 20 to 4oC. Both conventional analytical moisture sorption isotherms (MSI) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to model the relationship between equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and equilibrium relative humidity (ERH). The results showed that Modified Halsey equation was the best representative of MSIs. However, ANNs were also found to outperform MSI analytical models with R2 = 0.991 and a root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.17. Monolayer moisture content was also found to decrease linearly with EMC from 0.074 to 0.047 (decimal w.b.) over the temperature range investigated. © 2014, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

All elements in the transport chain, namely liquefaction, storage, loading system, dedicated CO2 ship(s), onshore loading and unloading, and offshore unloading systems are included in the paper. Over 80 % from the primary energy consumed all over the world is obtained from fossil oil and natural gas. The last researches have shown the energy dependences of these types of fuels. The transition to the economy based on the low influence of the carbon, the carbon capture technology, is the main means to reconsider the fossil fuels for meeting the needs for reduction of negative emissions. This is necessary for keeping the world temperature at normal levels. The main target of this paper is to put highlight the negative effect of CO2 emissions and the interest in recovery of carbon dioxide from flue gases trough multiple factors: the merchant CO2 market, renewed interest in enhanced oil recovery, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also takes in account modalities of transport and storage of CO2. Solutions for CO2 capture and injection into caverns instead of natural deposits were found worldwide. These solutions are not applicable however all over the world and they are not a priority in the environment protection activity.Another important aspect calls for all merchant ships requirements regarding CO2 emissions through index calculation and development of Management Plan. Also, to increase the control of CO2 it would be useful to identify the caverns where it is possible to deposit the CO2, to build new special ship for CO2 transport or replace natural deposits through CO2 injection. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Carbon dioxide; Cavern; Ship; Storage; Transport","Carbon; Caves; Deposits; Energy storage; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Loading; Oil shale; Ships; Unloading; Carbon dioxide transport; Cavern; Energy requirements; Enhanced oil recovery; Environment protection; Loading and unloading; Technical solutions; Transport; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922372993

During Sc decoration of ZGNR there is a shift from 0.35 eV small gap semiconductor regime to that of a metal which can be used for band gap tuning by controlled saturation of Sc. ZGNR decorated with Sc can attract H2. Upon saturation of multiple H2 in quasi-molecular fashion, the metallic character is converted to semiconductors of small gap of 0.10 eV, which are predicted to be interesting materials not only for hydrogen storage but also for their band gap engineered properties.

The subset of “phototransformable” fluorescent proteins recently attracted a widespread interest, as their fluorescence state can be modified upon excitation at defined wavelengths. The fluorescence emission of Reversibly Switchable Fluorescent Proteins (RSFPs), in particular, can be repeatedly switched on and off. RSFPs enable many new exciting modalities in fluorescence microscopy and biotechnology, including protein tracking, photochromic Förster Resonance Energy Transfer, super-resolution microscopy, optogenetics, and ultra-high-density optical data storage. Photoswitching in RSFPs typically results from chromophore cis-trans isomerization accompanied by a protonation change, but other switching schemes based on, e.g., chromophore hydration/dehydration have also been discovered. In this chapter, we review the main structural features at the basis of photoswitching in RSFPs. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","Cis-trans isomerization; Dronpa; Fluorescent proteins; Photoswitching; Protein dynamics; Proton transfer; RSFPs; Super-resolution microscopy","fluorescent dye; reversibly switchable fluorescent protein; unclassified drug; green fluorescent protein; Anthozoa; Article; biotechnology; chemical reaction; fluorescence; fluorescence microscopy; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; human; Hydrozoa; microscopy; optogenetics; priority journal; protein structure; signal transduction; single molecule localization microscopy; viscosity; animal; biosynthesis; cell culture; chemistry; genetics; isomerism; photochemistry; protein conformation; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Isomerism; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Optogenetics; Photochemical Processes; Protein Conformation; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921292182

There are various alterations in carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolisms in mother to provide nutrition to fetus. If something is wrong about these metabolisms in mother, this will indirectly affect fetus. So it is essential to elucidate the maternal and fetal carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolisms in the management of a pregnant woman. Mild fasting hypoglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and increased peripheral insulin resistance are the characteristics of pregnancy. The fetus primarily depends on glucose as the energy source but can also use other substrates such as lactate, keto acids, amino acids, fatty acids and glycogen as energy sources. Proteins are needed as structural components. Alterations in lipid metabolism cause accumulation of maternal fat stores in the early pregnancy in order to enhance lipolysis in the late pregnancy providing glucose and amino acids for fetus while promoting usage of lipids as maternal energy source. Maternal energy metabolism affects fetal energy metabolism both in short and long terms. By the clarification of maternal and fetal energy metabolisms, it may be possible to predict and prevent some diseases of a newborn in the future. © 2014, TIP ARASTIRMALARI DERNEGI.

A lubricating grease, based on mineral oil ORLEN OIL SN-400, containing associated molecules of lithium 12-hydroxystearate was subjected to analysis. Rheological dynamic oscillatory and FTIR-ATR (Fourier Transform Infrared Attenuated Total Reflectance) spectroscopy were used to study the kinetics of thickener microstructure regeneration. Changes in the values of storage modulus G′ and loss modulus G″ of the investigated grease during its relaxation in the linear viscoelastic range were examined. In addition, the mechanical stability of the thickener microstructure at a variable oscillation frequency was tested, and changes in the cohesive energy of the grease versus the latter's relaxation time were assessed. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy was used to study the physicochemical interactions between the associated molecules of lithium 12-hydroxystearate. Infrared bands were assigned to the vibrations of the particular functional groups of the grease components, and the spectral parameters in the absorption spectra in the range of 700-3,700 cm-1 were examined. The studies carried out using the two investigative methods have revealed that the intensity of thickener microstructure regeneration was the highest in the first hour of grease relaxation after shearing. In this time interval, the largest changes in the vibrations of the main functional groups of the grease components were observed. In the next hours, the kinetics of thickener microstructure regeneration were substantially lower. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","FTIR-ATR; Grease; Infrared spectroscopy; Rheology; Thixotropy","Functional groups; Infrared spectroscopy; Kinetics; Lithium; Lubricating greases; Mechanical stability; Microstructure; Molecules; Oil shale; Rheology; Shearing; Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectances; FT-IR-ATR; FTIR-ATR spectroscopy; Linear viscoelastic; Oscillation frequency; Physico-chemical interactions; Spectral parameters; Thixotropy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919819218

With regard to the latter, the tremendous worldwide success of mobile electronics (cell phones, smartphones, laptops, etc.) in part relies on batteries capable of high power and energy densities. An even wider market expansion is expected in the coming years from electric vehicles, which demand batteries that feature high ranges at low costs. In this framework, intense efforts are being devoted to the development of improved batteries, with the aim of capturing a market that is expected to boom in the coming decades [1], [2].

However, some factors which adversely affect the balance of nature may interrupt this sustainability. The epidemic which is formed by bark beetles in their spreading region, due to various factors, changes the stability so much that interference is required. One of the most common methods used to monitor these beetles is pheromone-baited traps. The recognition of parameters, such as date (day/month/year), temperature and humidity, when bark beetles are captured in pheromone-baited traps, especially those used for monitoring will help to increase the trap efficiency on land and to develop an effective strategy for combating pests. In this study, an electronic control unit was added to pheromone-baited traps in order to obtain all of the above mentioned parameters. This unit operates with microcontrollers and data related to the parameters is saved in a storage unit. This is triggered by the beetle at the moment it is captured in the trap.

Rubitherm20 (RT-20) is selected to evaluate the thermal performance by reducing the air temperature entering the evaporating coil. The model of PCM celluloid balls have been performed with the air-conditioner. Moreover, the mathematical model of the air-conditioner with the PCM storage is developed and verified with the testing results. For the experiment, 2 TR of R-134a airconditioner is chosen to test a pack bed of PCM balls with thickness 20 cm, 30 cm and 40 cm. And the pressure drops of the air flowing through the bed are considered with and without a set of by-pass tubes along the height of the storage bed. From the study results, it could be seen that pressure drops of the bed with and without bypass tubes are nearly the same results. Thus, PCM ball pack bed using RT-20 without bypass tubes is used to improve the cooling efficiency of air-conditioner. And the testing results, it could be found that the compressor could be stopped when the PCM balls absorb heat from the hot air before entering the evaporator coil. Moreover, the experimental result of the modified unit is compared with the simulation data to verify the mathematical model for predicting the cooling performance of the PCM bed combined with the air-conditioner. It could be seen that the simulated data of the PCM temperature and the air leaving PCM bed temperature agree quite well with the experimental result at the discrepant around 2.73% and 4.61%, respectively.Finally, the model is used to analyze the economic result which is found that the electrical consumption of the modified air-conditioner could be decreased around 3.09 kWh/d. When the electrical power consumption of the modified unit is around 36.27 kWh/d at the operating time 15 h/d compared with around 39.36 kWh/d of the normal unit at the operating time 12 h/d. The saving cost from the PCM bed could be 9.10% or 170.03 USD and the payback period is around 4.15 y. © Research India Publications.","Air-conditioner; Phase change material; Rubitherm20; Thermal energy storage; Thermal performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919756157

The proposed method is based on a hierarchical decomposition of the sets of input datasets into equivalent classes according to two aspects: territorial and thematic. The core of the solution is special-purpose algorithmization in the Python scripting language, which provides a homeomorphism of the transform from a set of input data into a set of data of the project. Data are stored for the given purpose in digital geo-database in a specially created project template in ArcGIS 10 environment. The proposed method of data pre-processing was realized on the project of data analysis of storage of gas facilities under certain types of terrain surface in the Czech Republic of the area of 64,350 km2.

Rather than utility scale storage, smart grid technology (not restricted, but mainly involving bidirectional communication between the supply and demand side and dynamic pricing) enables flexible consumption to be a virtual storage alternative for moderation of the production of variable renewable energy sources on the micro grid level. A study, motivated with energy loss allocation, electric demand and the legal framework that is characteristic for the average Serbian household, was performed using the HOMER software tool. The decision to shift or build deferrable load rather than sell on site generated energy from variable renewable energy sources to the grid was based on the consumer's net present cost minimization. Based on decreasing the grid sales hours of the micro grid system to the transmission grid from 3,498 to 2,009, it was shown that the demand response could be included in long-term planning of the virtual storage option. Demand responsive actions that could be interpreted as storage investment costs s were quantified to 12 £ per year in this article.","Electric hot water thermal storage; HOMER software; Smart grid; Variable renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918537653

These kinds of applications need intensive computational power, memory, and battery. A lot of researches solve this problem by offloading applications to run on the Cloud due to its intensive storage and computation resources. However, none of the available solutions consider the low bandwidth case of the networks as well as the communication and network overhead. In such case, it would be more efficient to execute the application locally on the Smartphone rather than offloading it on the Cloud. In this paper, we propose a new framework to support offloading heavy applications in low bandwidth network case, where a compression step is proposed for the favor of minimizing the offloading size and time. In this framework, the mobile application is divided into a group of services, where execution-time is calculated for each service apart and under three different scenarios. An offloading decision is then smartly taken based on real-time comparisons between being executed locally, or compressed and then offloaded, or offloaded directly without compression. The extensive simulation studies show that both heavy and light applications can benefit from the proposed framework in case of low bandwidth as well as saving energy and improving performance compared to the previous techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Android; Compression; Mobile Cloud computing; Network bandwidth; Offloading; Smartphones","Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Compaction; Face recognition; Machine learning; Smartphones; Android; Computation resources; Computational power; Extensive simulations; Improving performance; Mobile applications; Network bandwidth; Offloading; Mobile cloud computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916223976

AC result inerpretation is essential for prevention and treatment in dairy cow herds. There is necessary an eff ective method with reliable results. The goal was to evaluate the mid infrared method MIR-FT in terms of calibration for AC. Microdiff usion photometric (485 nm) method with salicylaldehyde as reference (RE) and MIR-FT (Lactoscope FT-IR, Delta (D); MilkoScan FT 6000 (F); Bentley (Bentley Instruments (B)) as indirect method were used. Selected (from high yielding dairy cows in early lactation) individual milk samples (MSs; n = 89) were used for MIR-FT calibration development and evaluation. Log AC correlation (r) between RE and indirect MIR-FT (D) was low (0.22, P &lt; 0.05). The same parameter between RE and MIR-FT (F) was closer (0.589, P &lt; 0.001; 0.632, P &lt; 0.001 for n = 64. The artificial AC addition to milk samples had no visible eff ect on AC recovery by MIR-FT instruments. The AC values increased from 4.91 and 5.23 to 45.22 mg.l-1 by RE. There is no possibility to prepare the AC reference samples using artificial addition for MIR-FT calibration. In dependence on possible AC evaporation (a risk of AC result reduction) during storage conditions a knowlege about AC stability in sample is important. The similar AC results were obtained after milk sampling and after 48 hours of storage under cold conditions.

The net energy gain (NEG) from harvest, collection, transport, storage and digestion of roadside vegetation was estimated to range from 60,126-121,476 GJ, corresponding to 1.5-3.0% of the present national energy production based on biogas. The estimated values for the energy return on invested energy (EROEI) was found to range from 2.17 to 2.88.

From a practical point of view, few challenges were identified related to the acquisition and processing of the roadside vegetation. Considering the positive net energy gains, further energy investments for management of these challenges can be made. Despite the somewhat low EROEI values, the use of this resource could however result in other positive externalities, such as improved biodiversity of the verges and recycling of nutrients. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the intermittent nature of solar and wind power presents difficulties in connection with integrating them into national power grids. One approach to addressing these challenges is through an agent-based architecture for coordinating locally-connected energy micro-grids, each of which manages its own local energy production, distribution, and storage. By integrating these micro-grids into a larger network structure, there is the opportunity for them to be more responsive to local needs and hence more cost effective overall. In such an arrangement, the micro-grids have agents that can choose to resell their excess energy in an open, regional market in alignment with respect to their specific goals (which could be to reduce carbon emissions or to maximize their financial outcomes). In this study, we have investigated how agents operating in such an open environment can learn to optimize their individual trading strategies by employing Markov-Decision-Process-based reasoning and reinforcement learning. We empirically show that our learning trading strategies improve net profit loss by up to 29% and can reduce carbon emissions by 78% when compared to the original (non-learning) trading strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Micro-grids; Multi-agent systems; Power trading; Renewable energy","Carbon; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Electric power distribution; Energy policy; Intelligent agents; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Wind power; Agent-based architecture; Clean energy sources; Intelligent learning; Micro grid; Open environment; Power trading; Renewable energies; Trading strategies; Multi agent systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911976807

The effect of the extract was also compared to BHA antioxidant. Physical, functional and antioxidant properties of the films were measured. Development of rancidity parameters of the meat products kept in gelatin pouches was also determined. The extract and starch improved film strength but decreased water vapor resistance. Optical and color properties of film were significantly altered by the extract concentration. The film with extract and BHA exhibited antioxidant activity at 89.83 and 70.36% inhibitions, respectively and significantly decreased hydrolytic rancidity rate of the products. So, plant extract might modify some properties of the gelatin film but it could exhibit antioxidant activity on the gelatin film comparable to synthetic antioxidant.

The application of vitamins as seed treatments increased significantly germination characters, seedling characters and seed chemical analysis as well as survived seed health and minimized dead seeds, rotted seeds and rotted seedlings. Vitamin A was more effective in germination characters while Vitamin B9 was more effective in seedling characters and seeds chemical analysis. The maximum values of shoot length and dry weights of shoot and root were recorded from seed treated with Vitamin A.

Such a PCM enclosure can be used as a heat sink for the cooling of electronic components. The advantage of this cooling strategy is that PCMs characterized by high energy storage density and small transition temperature interval, are able to store a high amount of heat (thereby providing efficient passive cooling). A two-dimensional simulation model is developed that accounts for heat transfer by conduction, convection in the molten region and phase change. In particular, numerical investigations are conducted using an enthalpy-porosity method in order to examine the impact of the considered geometry on the temperature distribution and evolution in the enclosure.

Nowadays, the capital intensive infrastructure investments, such as the expansion of district heating networks and the introduction of significant heat saving measures require highly detailed decision-support tool. A Danish heat atlas provides highly detailed database with extensive information about more than 2.5 million buildings in Denmark. Energy system analysis tools incorporate environmental, economic, energy and engineering analysis of future energy systems and are considered crucial for the quantitative assessment of transitional scenarios towards future milestones, such as EU 2020 goals and Denmark's goal of achieving fossil free society after 2050. The present paper shows how a Danish heat atlas can be used for providing inputs to energy system models, especially related to the analysis of heat saving measures within building stock and expansion of district heating networks. As a result, marginal cost curves are created, approximated and prepared for the use in optimization energy system model.

It is indeed something that must change if modern society is to become sustainable someday. This is to be realized in conjunction with adequate government policies and innovative strategies aimed at effectively integrating non-conventional renewable energies (NCRE), with thriftiness and energy efficiency (EE) - the three pillars of energy sustainability (ES) - in today's electric power systems generation and distribution infrastructure. This ought to be done in a way that incorporates them jointly, as part of a comprehensive energy strategy to propitiate a wider penetration of distributed generation (DG) solutions. Departing from mainstream literature on the subject, this paper proposes such strategies for integrating hybrid micro-generation power systems to the grid through homeostatic control (HC), as a means to reconcile power supply and energy demand response management (EDRM). These strategies can be designed and implemented in the microgrid's supervisory control system for the purpose of eliciting EE and thriftiness in consumers to build ES in the system. The theoretical model behind the HC strategies is presented and a numerical example is provided, using real electricity consumption data of a small rural community in Chile. Upon examining a particular set of criteria designed to control renewable power (RP) supply from a grid-tie microgrid to residential consumers, simulation results show that the model proves effective when testing such criteria for different power supply scenarios. Particularly revealing is the role of the energy storage system (ESS) - the energy buffer - in the HC strategies being proposed and the difference that it makes in eliciting thrifty, efficient energy consumption as a result of individual and collective efforts to ensure energy sustainability of the system as a whole. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: To attain this objective, 0.03-mm-thick cold-rolled platinum foil strips with 99.99 wt% purity were used. The resistivity measurements were made using a 4-point probe technique in which the strips were subjected to dynamic annealing in an argon atmosphere. The stored energy of platinum was recorded in an argon atmosphere using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Finally, the microstructure of the strips was investigated by optical microscopy. RESULTS: In the resistivity measurements, a small change is observed at ~280°C. This change could be explained as the partial recovery elicited by the decrease of dislocation density. Above 500°C, a significant decrease in resistivity was recorded, and the decrease reached a maximum at ~750°C. These results are consistent with the recrystallization trend detected in DSC, namely the DSC measurement detected very weak heat release during recrystallization, which was actually accumulated during the cold-working.

The dynamic stability of the rotor is strengthened with the electromagnetic and electrodynamic levitation techniques. The force on the rotor is predicted in terms of semi-analytical frozen image model. The designed driving system sustains stable levitation during the rotation of the rotor and achieves higher rotational speed than that of the torque driver. The results indicate that the designed rotor and driving system have potential solutions for the development of the superconducting flywheel energy storage. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies on the functional importance of the PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphic variants indicated that the observed alleles may influence body mass measurements; however, obtained results were inconsistent. We have decided to check if body mass changes observed in physically active participants will be modulated by the PPARG Pro12Ala genotype. The genotype distribution of the PPARG Pro12Ala allele was examined in a group of 201 Polish women measured for selected body mass variables before and after the completion of a 12-week training program. The results of our experiment suggest that PPARG genotype can modulate training-induced body mass measurements changes: after completion of the training program, Pro12/Pro12 homozygotes were characterised by a greater decrease of body fat mass measurements in comparison with 12Ala allele carriers. These results indicate that the PPARG 12Ala variant may impair the training-induced positive effects on body mass measurements; however, the detailed mechanism of such interaction remained unclear and observed correlation between PPARG genotype and body mass differential effects should be interpreted with caution. © 2014 Aleksandra Zarebska et al.",,"adult; allele; Article; athlete; body fat; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; gene function; gene interaction; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; heterozygote; homozygote; human; modifier gene; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma gene; physical activity; Polish citizen; single nucleotide polymorphism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908328937

In the current study, it was not possible to induce a high (up to 100%) incidence of diapause unless all the nymphal instars and adults were successively exposed (i.e. full exposure) to a short day length (11.5 h) at constant temperatures of 18 and 26 °C, and fluctuating temperatures of 10/26 °C. Hence an intermittent exposure to long day lengths, even for short periods of time (only during instars IV-V or adult stage), would avoid a high incidence of diapause at 10/26 °C and 26 °C. The response of O. majusculus nymphal instars and adults to a short day length with a low incidence of diapause under fluctuating temperatures suggests that greenhouses, where such temperatures prevail, provide an environment that is conducive to diapause prevention. The release of adults is a better approach than the release of nymphs, since the adults and their nymphs, until the eclosion of new adults, are expected to respond to short day lengths with a low incidence of diapause in greenhouses. When nymphs are released, on the other hand, a high incidence of diapause would be inevitable. Increasing the constant temperature to 30 °C at full exposure did not prevent diapause and consequently did not change the incidence of diapause. Storage of diapausing O. majusculus adults was possible for 1 month with a higher survival rate and fecundity than in a study based on the storage of nondiapausing adults at a lower temperature. © TÜBİTAK.","Biological control; Diapause; Frankliniella occidentalis; Orius majusculus; Photoperiodic sensitivity; Storage","Energy storage; Greenhouses; Biological controls; Diapause; Frankliniella occidentalis; Orius majusculus; Photoperiodic sensitivity; Digital storage; biological control; diapause; enemy release hypothesis; pest species; photoperiod; storage; thrips; Antalya [Antalya (PRV)]; Antalya [Turkey]; Turkey; Frankliniella occidentalis; Orius majusculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908158252

At EU level, by 2030, 27 % of the energy requirements are expected to be covered by renewable energy sources, biomass being one of the most important sources. Also, for the same period, the greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be reduced by at least 40 % below the 1990 level. In this context, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are equally important for transition to low carbon economy. Chemical looping technique is a particular promising carbon capture option for reducing CO2 capture energy and cost penalties. This paper evaluates, from techno-economic and environmental perspective, the hydrogen and power co-generation based on biomass direct chemical looping systems with total decarbonisation of the fuel. As illustrative example, an ilmenite-based chemical looping system was assessed to generate about 500 MW net electricity with a flexible hydrogen output in the range of 0 to 100 MWth (based on hydrogen LHV). The capacity of evaluated plant concept to produce flexible hydrogen output is an important aspect for integration in modern energy conversion systems in which flexible operation scenario is of great importance due to greater integration of high time-irregular renewable energy sources (e.g. solar, wind). The carbon capture rate of evaluated concepts is almost total (>99 %). In addition, considering biomass (e.g. sawdust, agricultural wastes etc.) processing, the investigated power plant concepts have negative fossil CO2 emissions. The performances are assessed for a number of case studies (including some benchmark cases) through process flow simulations. The simulation results are used to assess the main techno-economic and environmental indicators, e.g. energy efficiency, ancillary consumption, carbon capture energy and cost penalty, specific CO2 emissions, capital and operation costs, cost of electricity, implication of hydrogen co-production on techno-economic and environmental performances etc. Copyright © 2014 AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Natural resources; Pollution; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Cost of electricity; Energy conversion systems; Energy productions; Energy requirements; Environmental indicators; Low carbon economy; Renewable energy source; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908111344

Sediment is found in every body of water, and can be comprised of one or more of the various particle classes (from fine silts and clays to coarse gravel) in an infinite variety of combinations. Siltation of water reservoirs with sediments belongs to the important problems in water management mainly due to the reducing of the basin's accumulation capacity and also because of the utilization of sediment waste extracted from water reservoirs. It was evaluated that the storage capacity of the world's reservoirs is reducing annually by more than 1 % due to siltation. Enormous volumes of sediments have to be dredged worldwide for both maintenance and also environmental reasons. Beneficial reuse of dredged materials in confined utilization facilities is a new approach that has the potential to productively utilize large quantities of dredged materials. Dredged sediments have a wide range of uses. Considering their properties, it can be thought about their biotic and abiotic utilization. This paper is focused on the analyzing of chosen physical and chemical bottom sediment characteristics in the reservoirs. It also describes the impact of determined sediment parameters on their properties and reuse in civil engineering.

Because of the main disadvantage of natural plant fibres reinforced composites consisting in high moisture absorption ability of organic filler, chemical treatments of fibres are applied. Moisture in humid atmosphere and water immersion of biocomposites lead to the degradation of fibre-matrix interface as well as mechanical properties. In this paper, the study of long-Term water storage of hemp hurds composites at room temperature was made. Water absorption of composites based on unmodified and chemically modified hemp hurds in dependence on water storage duration was monitored and kinetic curves were described by model.

The system performance is investigated for a real solar radiation profile for an entire year of operation. Inclusive, steady-state mathematical models are used for the simulation of both the solar collectors and the ORC. The effects of different mixtures on several important system operating parameters are investigated. Results indicate that mixtures at different compositions and concentrations may have a significantly different performance in terms of parameters such as generated work, required collector aperture area and so forth.

This is approached by a) using the PGCC to target the optimum power requirements for the subsequent time interval and b) then adjusting the system PMS in the current time-interval to meet the identified target by the end of this interval. First the system PGCC is developed for the subsequent time interval, indicating the external non-renewable input required to satisfy the expected power demands. An appropriate shift in the PGCC sets a target of the minimum power inventory needed by the end of the current interval to completely avoid the use of non-renewable power input in the subsequent interval. The development of this power inventory is then approached in the current interval by identifying the PMS that best satisfies this target. The method is illustrated through a hybrid smart grid considering multiple renewable sources and storage options.

Nowadays in Europe the demand for diesel fuel continuously growing, while the demand for gasoline decreases slightly. Currently, the biodiesel is the biofuel which is blended into the gas oil with the highest amount in case of Diesel engines, which can be produced from different, even waste-derived triglycerides (with transesterification with alcohol). Due to the adverse properties of biodiesel the storage stability of biodiesel/diesel blends have to be examined in detail. In our experimental work we studied the changes in the qualities of biodiesels produced from vegetable oil which contained various waste cooking oil (waste-derived component) share (10, 30, 50 %), and its 7 and 10 % blends with gas oil in case of long-term (more than 150 weeks) storage. We found that with the increasing the proportion of used cooking oil in the vegetable oil used as raw material for biodiesel the oxidation reactions took place in greater amount during the storage of the biodiesel product. Biodiesel made from vegetable oils containing 10 % used cooking oil was the most applicable for blending; in case of using higher proportion it is very necessary to use further amount of antioxidant additives to minimize the degradation. The test results suggest that without the addition of additives the biodiesels are not allowed to store longer than six months, and the diesel-biodiesel blends are not allowed to store longer than 1 year. We established mathematical relationships which describe well the relationship between the Rancimat induction period and the kinematic viscosity and the acid number in case of the investigated biodiesels..

As opposed to, for instance, the smart grid concept, which takes a sole focus on the electricity sector, smart energy systems include the entire energy system in its approach to identifying suitable energy infrastructure designs and operation strategies. The typical smart grid sole focus on the electricity sector often leads to the conclusion that transmission lines, flexible electricity demands and electricity storage are the primary means to deal with the integration of fluctuating renewable sources. However, the nature of wind power and similar sources has the consequence that these measures are neither very effective nor cost-efficient. The most effective and least-cost solutions are to be found when the electricity sector is combined with the heating and cooling sectors and/or the transportation sector. Moreover, the combination of electricity and gas infrastructures may play an important role in the design of future renewable energy systems. The paper illustrates why electricity smart grids should be seen as part of overall smart energy systems and emphasizes the inclusion of flexible combined heat and power (CHP) production in the electricity balancing and grid stabilization. Furthermore, it highlights how to design and model future sustainable smart energy systems.

For this scenario a microgrid is a promising approach and forms a solution to this challenge. Microgrids are subsystems of the distribution grid including distributed generation (DG) units, storage devices and controllable loads, and can operate either connected or isolated from the utility grid. Ensuring a smooth, reliable and economic operation of a microgrid requires an energy management system that dynamically fits the production to the consumption in combination with storage. Quick response of the energy management strategy is crucial for a microgrid as compared to a conventional energy system. In this paper, a formulation of the environomic power dispatch approach in microgrids is proposed which uses multiobjective optimisation. The application aims to fulfill the time varying energy demand while minimising the costs and emissions of the local production and imported energy from the utility grid. With the introduction of a storage device, stored energy is controlled to balance the power generation of renewable sources, cover the overall microgrid demand and to optimise the overall power exchange between utility grid and microgrid. Operational constraints such as generator limits, start-up, operation and maintenance costs and the intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES) are to be satisfied. A representative microgrid structure is studied as an example and some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the microgrid environomic power dispatch approach.

While the use of immersion heaters for the production of hot water or steam is declining, the adoption rate of electrical heat pumps is increasing rapidly. Heat pumps show great flexibility and potential for energy savings, e.g. through low temperature waste heat recuperation. In combination with thermal storage they also allow for load shifting. Because their main power source is electricity, which up to now cannot be stored efficiently, heat pumps can transpose their thermal load shifting ability to the electrical grid. Today, more and more industrial electricity consumers are adopting energy supply contracts with variable pricing parameters strongly coupled to the energy trading market. Some large consumers even buy and sell on this market directly. In this paper it is proven that for customers with (hourly) variable electricity pricing, the use of electrical heat pumps can lead to additional cost savings without influencing the industrial process. The yield of the heat pumps can be increased during hours with low energy cost, with the thermal buffer absorbing the heat surplus. During hours with high energy cost the heat pump yield is lowered and stored heat is used by the industrial process. Considering that heat can be stored much more efficiently than electricity, the load shifting ability of heat pumps can also be utilised to provide stability on electrical smart grids and to increase electrical self-consumption on microgrids. This paper will also explore the potential of thermal storage through heat pumps for these electrical smart grid applications.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies aim to curb CO2 emissions not only from the power generation but also from other energy-intensive sectors. Among the various approaches to separate CO2 from flue gas, the absorption-based CO2 capture technology is known to be the most practical method mainly due to its technical maturity and large gas treating capacity. The power plants are required to be operated in dynamic scenario, due to the timely variation of the grid demand. Dynamic simulation is a viable solution to identify any operational issue at transient conditions for the integration of CO2 capture into power plants. In this paper, a rigorous dynamic rate-based model for CO2 absorption using aqueous ammonia in a packed column has been developed. The main model equations are developed by applying the overall mass, component mass and energy balances for the liquid and vapour phases, respectively. The model also considers mass and heat transfer resistance in the liquid and gas phase, hydrodynamics and column properties of the whole absorption system. The kinetic model has significant impact on the simulation and analysis of absorber. The partial differential equations of model have been solved in Matlab/Simulink, the model has been validated with data collected from pilot plant, published in literature. The developed model is used to analyse the species concentration profile, temperature profile, mass transfer rate and coefficient in the gas and liquid phase along the packing height. In order to analyse the capability of the model to predict the effect of the operating conditions and the disturbances from the up-stream power plant on the CO2 capture plant operation a dynamic simulations were performed. Also, the evaluations of various operation conditions for optimization of technical indicators of CO2 capture were done.

Producing (electrical) energy from renewable sources hardly means difficulties but the storage of the energy not consumed immediately is a great engineering challenge. In the present paper a complex model has been developed by investigating renewable energy sources, converting currently unnecessary energy to Hydrogen for storage purposes and feeding the main grid. A measurement based model of a Hydrogen generating cell developed for simulation of complex energetic system is presented in this paper. The parameter estimation of the static model has been performed based on measurement data collected during the detailed examination of a demonstration cell. Series of experiments has been carried out on a HHO gas producing dry cell in order to find out if there are optimal electrolyte concentration, current value, or geometric parameter (distance between plates) values for this equipment. During the measurement KOH electrolyte solution was used while different signals has been measured, for example cell voltage, gas production value. As a result of the experiments, a cell operating in an optimal way has been developed. The novel element of this work is the temperature and concentration dependent Matlab Simulink model of the hydrogen generation cell. Using this model, a dynamic simulator of a complex domestic power plant using renewable energy source and H2 generation cell become available. Hydrogen generation enables the long range storage of spare electric energy collected but not consumed or injected into the low voltage grid. The generated Hydrogen can be consumed by vehicles for transportation purposes or it can be applied in fuel cells generating direct electrical energy for energy-deficient low voltage network situations. Energetic situations potentially occurring in practice have been simulated in the complex model. Several hours of simulations showed that the presented H2 generating cell model performed well. Producing H2 from excess energy is not a brand new invention. This is the alternative way to store and convert renewable energy for further utilization. The produced Hydrogen can be used to store, to use in power cell to convert back to electric energy or to use in Hydrogen propulsion vehicles. Among the numerous realized H2 producing applications the most important class is when the energy consumption and the quantity of produced H2 is controlled. When the power consumption and generation are continuous (and not necessarily deterministic) function of time, the H2 production depends solely on the excess energy of the grid..

The hybrid system shares common infrastructure and improves solar heat utilisation through direct solar boosting of the HRL intermediate fluid's temperature and enthalpy either through parallel or series application. The challenge of dealing with variable solar energy supply is less of a problem in the hybrid system because the HRL with its associated storage acts as an enthalpy buffer which absorbs temperature and flow rate fluctuations on both the heat supply (including solar) and heat demand side simultaneously. Three options for integrating solar thermal directly into HRLs are applied to a large multi-plant dairy case study to demonstrate the hot utility savings potential of the Solar-HRL hybrid system.

The integration of energy and water systems presents a possible solution for both issues. The flexibility of a desalination system can increase the possibility for the penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources and thus provide both fresh water and the potential for the local production of clean energy. Jordan is the fourth most water deprived country in the world and is also highly dependent on energy import. Almost all of its primary energy comes from imported fossil fuels, mostly from natural gas. It is a country rich in wind and solar energy but unfortunately, almost no utilization of that potential. The integration of desalination systems and renewable energy sources is a possible solution both for Jordan's water and energy supply. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the desalination module in the H2RES model using Jordan as a case study. H2RES is a flexible energy modelling tool used for the balancing of energy supply and demand on an hourly basis. It is capable of demonstrating the benefits of water and energy integration for the purpose of increasing the penetration of intermittent renewables and the reduction of CO2 emissions. For this purpose, four scenarios have been created. The first one is a business as usual scenario with no desalination, a desalination scenario and two desalination scenarios that utilize the produced brine as energy storage in pump hydro plants. The results will show that the utilization of desalination, especially in the case where desalination is combined with pump storage, can help increase the penetration of renewable energy sources into the electrical grid and thus help decrease the dependence on energy import and reduce the CO2 emissions of the energy system..

In the Raman spectra recorded under excitation resonant with the high-energy PL band, the additional Raman peaks at about 300 cm-1 and 600 cm-1, which are close to the frequency of LO and 2LO phonons of bulk CdS, are found. It is proposed that alloyed QDs with chemical composition close to CdS are responsible for the additional high-energy PL band. The possible reasons for the formation of the alloyed QDs are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Among these density functional theory methods, ωB97X-D is found to be the most appropriate for the systems involving H2doping in boron nitride nanocages. It predicted that the smallest nanocage, B12N12, has no stable complex and the H2@B24N24, 2H2@B36N36, 4H2@B48N48and 7H2@B60N60complexes are the most stable hydrogenboron nitride complexes. Accordingly, it is found that the number of hydrogen molecules doped inside the most stable complex of each nanocage quadratically depends on nanocage size. This indicates that as the size of nanocage, as well as, the size of the endohedral cavity increases more stable nH2@BmNmcomplexes are formed. © 2014, Chemical Publishing Co.

Especially in the communist countries, massive multi-storey buildings were erected, supplied by a district heating grid with big power plants. Nowadays the maintenance of such big systems is big-energy consuming and refurbishment is very hard to accomplish and therefore, in many situations, district heating is no longer profitable. We present in this paper an integrated system for local district heating, aiming to substitute the old and inefficient district system for a condominium, located in the city of Bucharest, Romania. The main paper objective is to demonstrate that the energy performance of the connected buildings could be significantly improved by changing the heat source. With CHP-HP-HT-ATES technology, initially D-energy class buildings (according to the Romanian methodology of calculation of buildings performance-Mc 001/2006) can switch to B-energy class. Moreover, the refurbishment of the buildings envelopes will help the envisaged condominium to approach the nZEB characteristics of energy consumption.

These ten represent only a subset of the real possibilities, as felling method was held constant and only a single market (combustion of whole tree chips) was considered. Stages included in-field, roadside landing, terminal, and conversion plant, and biomass states at each of these included loose whole trees, bundled whole trees or chipped material. Assumptions on prices, performances, and conversion rates were based on field trials and published literature in similar boreal forest conditions. The economic outcome was calculated on the basis of production, handling, treatment and storage costs and losses. Outcomes were tested for robustness on a range of object volumes (50-350 m3 solid), extraction distances (50-550 m) and transport distances (10-70 km) using simulation across a set of discrete values. Transport was calculated for both a standard 19.5 m and an extended 24 m timber truck. Results showed that the most expensive chain (roadside bundling, roadside storage, terminal storage and delivery using a 19.5 m timber truck) at 158 td -1 was 23% more costly than the cheapest chain (roadside chipping and direct transport to conversion plant with container truck), at 128 € td -1. Outcomes vary at specific object volumes and transport distances, highlighting the need to verify assumptions, although standard deviations around mean supply costs for each chain were small (6%-9%). Losses at all stages were modelled, with the largest losses (23 € td -1) occurring in the chains including bundles. The study makes all methods and assumptions explicit and can assist the procurement manager in understanding the mechanisms at work. © 2014 by the authors.","Bioenergy; Feedstocks; Modelling; Small tree harvesting","Models; Bio-energy; Small tree harvesting; Whole trees; Feedstocks; bioenergy; boreal forest; cost analysis; forestry production; harvesting; thinning; tree",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907541374

The distribution substation acts as a service provider for distributed resource units in a microgrid and can be used for bidirectional energy exchange between prosumers, such as electric vehicles, battery pack energy storage devices and utility networks. Use of distribution substations equipped with energy storing and bidirectional energy exchange capability enable peak load shaving and demand response, which will reduce the need for new investments into building new power sources or electric power grids to meet peak demand. While the state of the art in the field analyses mainly different theoretical microgrid topologies and integration of unidirectional distributed energy resources, focus in this paper is on practical issues regarding bidirectional energy exchange, which can provide solutions to microgrid manufacturing enterprises. Protection and control functions of the low voltage part of the distribution substation must be tested prior to exploitation. The new testing method for substations includes both computer simulations and practical verifications for automated energy exchange. Simulation results can be used to define and optimize parameters for protection and control functions before constructing a real microgrid. Functions of an experimental microgrid application were simulated with MATLAB, which showed that several prosumers can be served simultaneously and effectively utilized for peak shaving of utility network loads. The results of the simulations were used to develop sample control algorithms and program modules for the substation controller of the experimental microgrid prototype. © MIDEM Society.","Bidirectional power flow; Electric vehicles; Microgrids; Smart substation; Substation testing methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907532049

Mathematical models have constantly evolved, their differences lying mainly in the choice of the driving potentials used to describe moisture flows, as well as in the complexity of characterizing the physical phenomena involved. Models developed in the field of Building Physics (HAM models) are used to describe the behavior of envelope parts and assess their impact on user comfort and energy performance. The water balance equation can be described in many ways; it is a function of the boundary conditions considered and the fact they induce high or low water content in the porous materials used. This paper gives an overview of various formulations for this equation that are found in the Building Physics literature. It focuses first on the physically based formulation of moisture balance, drawing on the Representative Elementary Volume (REV) concept, coupled with thermodynamic flow rates description. This is then reformulated in line with various main moisture state variables offering a wide variety of expressions that are compared with available models. This approach provides access to all secondary transport coefficients associated with the process of mathematical transformation.

Stochastic changes of wind energy in time cause significant fluctuations of the system output power and as a result have a negative impact on the quality of the generated electrical energy. In the author's opinion it is possible to reduce the aforementioned effects by using an energy storage of an appropriate type and capacity. It was assumed that based on the technical parameters of a wind turbine-energy storage system and its geographical location one can determine the boundary capacity of the storage, which helps prevent power cuts to the grid at the assumed probability. Flywheel energy storage was selected due to its characteristics and technical parameters. The storage capacity was determined based on an empirical relationship using the results of the proposed statistical and energetic analysis of the measured wind velocity courses.

However, renewable energy outputs are variable due to a stochastic characteristic of their sources. Electrical power system operators around the world are faced with difficulties of integrating these variable power sources into the existing power grids. Energy storage systems are one of the possible solutions for mitigating the effects of intermittent renewable resources on networks, allowing increased renewable energy utilization, and providing flexibility and ancillary services for managing future electricity supply/demand challenges.

Power management of the micro-grid is performed under two cases: grid mode and local mode. Central supervisory unit (CSU) generates command signal to ensure the power management during the two modes. In local mode, the dc loads in the ac-dc hybrid system can be controlled. In the case of grid mode operation, power flow between the utility grid and micro-grid is controlled. A novel feature of this paper is the incorporation of the multiple power converters. The generated command signal from the CSU can also control the operation of the multiple power converters in both grid and local modes.

The thermal energy storage systems can be an alternative method to be utilized to reduce and time shift the electrical load of air conditioning from on-peak to off-peak hours. In this study, the Hourly Analysis Program has been used to estimate the cooling load profile for an office building based in Tripoli weather data conditions. Preliminary study was performed in order to define the most suitable operating strategies of ice thermal storage, including partial (load leveling and demand limiting), full storage and conventional A/C system. Then, the mathematical model of heat transfer for external ice storage would be based on the operating strategy which achieves the lowest energy consumption. Results indicate that the largest rate of energy consumption occurs when the conventional system is applied to the building, while the lowest rate of energy consumption is obtained when the partial storage (demand limiting 60%) is applied. Analysis of results shows that the new layer of ice formed on the surface of the existing ice lead to an increase of thermal resistance of heat transfer, which in return decreased cooling capacity.","Energy consumption; Heat transfer; Thermal storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907045507

During the 1990's, the industrialised world witnessed a growing number of environmental labels as a way of encouraging consumers and industries to alter their consumption patterns and to make wiser use of resources and energy in the drive for sustainable development. In this exploratory study, environmental knowledge among Slovenian consumers regarding the most popular current eco labels was examined. Data were collected through a structured online survey from a simple random sample of 535 consumers. Responses to an online questionnaire indicated that the largest share of participants consider clothing composition the most, while only a small percentage consider eco labels and the environmental impact. Consumers are willing to pay no more than 10% for a textile product with an ecological label attached. The largest proportion of respondents identified themselves as average eco-conscious, although they didn't show any knowledge of eco labels. The study revealed that it is necessary to increase the level of awareness of sustainable materials as well as trust in eco labelling systems with transparent standardisation and certification systems.","Consideration; Eco labels; Purchase apparel; Recognition; Sustainable consumption; Willingness to pay more","Clothes; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Garment industry; Labels; Surveys; Textile industry; Textiles; Consideration; Ecolabels; Recognition; Sustainable consumption; Willingness to pay; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906907919

In this study, we used a microwave method to produce porous carbonaceous materials designated as graphene foam/polyvinyl alcohol/formaldehyde (GF/PVA/F) and graphene foam-polyvinyl alcohol/phenol-formaldehyde (GF/PVA/PF) from graphene foam, phenol formaldehyde and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the surface morphology, structural defects and functional groups of the materials respectively. Based on these porous materials, the two symmetrical ECs fabricated exhibited a specific capacitance in the range of 0.62-1.92 F cm-2, phase angles of -81° and -84° and resistor-capacitor (RC) relaxation time constants of 4 and 14 seconds. The physicochemical properties of the electrolyte ion (diffusion) and its influence on the capacitive behavior of the porous materials were elucidated.

Its rapid deployment in dynamic industry areas enables variety of new applications in behavioral analysis and processes automation. In such systems it is crucial to identify all RFID tags before they leave the interrogation area. To accomplish fast identification, it is necessary to estimate a number of tags which are in the reader interrogation area. In this paper, we revisit the problem of tag quantity estimate and adapting frame size of dynamic frame slotted ALOHA widely used as RFID medium access control mechanism. The main disadvantage in the implementation of the state-of-the-art estimation algorithms includes the number of required computations, along with the temporary storage of large numbers which appear before estimation. As a consequence, such algorithms are energy inefficient and may require specific computer architecture to support the calculus. In order to address stated issues, we present improved linearized combinatorial model algorithm for optimal frame size selection which, due to linear property of the estimator, allows significant reduction in the estimate computation with acceptable tradeoff in accuracy. Simulations analyze the required number of slots to identify tag population and the floating point operation costs required to compute estimate. In addition, to emphasize the importance of reducing computational cost, we give a case study which compares energy consumed by the mobile RFID reader processor to compute the estimate and its energy equivalent of the required radio front-end energy to identify tags. © 2012 IEEE.","Dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (DFSA); energy efficient methods; optimal frame size selection; tag estimate method","Computer architecture; Cost benefit analysis; Energy efficiency; Estimation; Medium access control; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Dynamic frame slotted aloha(DFSA); Dynamic frame slotted alohas; Energy efficient; Floating point operations; Optimal frame size; Radio frequency identification technology; tag estimate method; Tag estimation methods; Cost estimating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906847318

The modified graphene surface enabled a high pseudocapacitive effect on the GF. A specific capacitance of 133.3 F g-1, power density ∼ 145.3 kW kg-1 and energy density ∼ 4.7 W h kg -1 were achieved based on the functionalized foam in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.

In the suggested system, the dry air heated in an energy center will be circulated in stainless steel pipes through columns. The sensible thermal energy would firstly be stored by means of forced convection in column medium. Then, the stored thermal energy will transfer by natural convection and radiation from the column surfaces to indoor spaces. The transient thermal calculations are realized for a flat of the 11-storey building in Kayseri city of Turkey. The thermal energy requirement of the flat is nearby 5.3 kW as an average of a winter season. The simplified transient calculations were carried out over a concrete hollow cylindrical column having outer radius of 0.31 m and inner radius of 0.05 m corresponding an averaged column section in the sample flat. The flow temperature was selected between T = 350 and 500 K, which are considerably lower than the temperature of 573 K assumed as a limit for thermal strength of the concrete in the literature. The flow velocity ranges were selected between V = 1.0 and 5.0 m/s. The initial temperature was assumed as 293 K. After the first energy charging process of 23 h, for T = 350 K and V = 1.0 m/s, the total heat flux from the column surfaces into indoors are nearby 5.5 kW. The first charging time required to reach the energy requirement of 5.3 kW is decreased by increasing the flow velocity and temperature. Also for 5.0 m/s-350 K and 5.0 m/s-450 K, this time can decrease to 10 and 4.5 h, respectively. In addition, with 4.0 m/s-360 K or 2.0 m/s-400 K, after the energy charging of 8 h, the energy requirement of 5.3 kW can be provided by the energy discharging of 16 h and the energy charging of 8 h during 7 days.

A particular control technique is proposed for power flow regulation ensuring FC life extension, system efficiency optimization and uninterrupted supply of demand. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Energy management; Energy storage; Fuel cell; Photovoltaic systems; Power generation; Wind energy","Electric load flow; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Magnetic materials; Photovoltaic cells; Power generation; Superconducting materials; Wind; Wind power; Control methodology; Control techniques; Hybrid generation system; Hybrid renewable energies; Long term durability; Photovoltaic arrays; Photovoltaic systems; Wind generator systems; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906708314

With energy storage, there is a possibility to generate more energy when the demand is low and store it for later use. In this paper, we study a dynamic optimal power flow (OPF) problem with energy storage dynamics in purely resistive power networks. By exploiting the recently discovered zero duality gap property in the OPF problem, we apply optimization decomposition techniques to decouple the coupling energy storage constraints and obtain the global optimal solution using distributed message passing algorithms. The decomposition methods offer new interesting insights on the equilibrium load profile smoothing feature over space and time through the relationship between the optimal dual solution in the OPF and the energy storage dynamics. We evaluate the performance of the distributed algorithms in several IEEE benchmark systems and show that they converge fast to the global optimal solution by numerical simulations. © 2014 IEEE.","decomposition method; distributed optimization; energy storage; message passing algorithm; Optimal power flow; smart grid","Acoustic generators; Benchmarking; Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Optimal systems; Smart power grids; Decomposition methods; Distributed optimization; Message passing algorithm; Optimal power flows; Smart grid; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906686512

We provide a classification of FD with respect to some WSN criteria. The focus will be on energy depletion and lossy links. We then propose a new general FD model tailored to WSN constraints, called Adaptive Neighborhood Failure Detector for Low-power lossy WSN (AFDEL). AFDEL provides adaptive local failure detection robust against packet loss (intermittent failures) and saves the use of energy, bandwidth and memory storage. Furthermore, we introduce in AFDEL model an adaptive timer strategy. This strategy offers the possibility to customize the dynamic timer pattern with respect to application requirements in terms of completeness and accuracy. We illustrate the use of this strategy by proposing three failure detection techniques based on AFDEL general model. As a part of this work, we give a stochastic based approach for timer adaptation. We evaluate all techniques using implementation on MiXim/Omnet++ framework. The overall experiments show that AFDEL achieves better trade-off between accuracy/completeness and detection/recovery period compared to static timer approach FaT2D (Benhamida and Challal, 2010) and HeartBeat timer-free technique (Aguilera et al., 1997). Moreover, using adaptive timer strategy in local interaction/detection makes it possible to reduce energy consumption and the overall exchanged data overhead. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive timer-based techniques; Failure detector model; Lossy links; Low-power WSN","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Finite difference method; Low power electronics; Outages; Stochastic systems; Adaptive neighborhood; Application requirements; Failure Detectors; Intermittent failure; Lossy links; Low Power; Reduce energy consumption; Timer-based; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906658683

It is expected that each consumer will manage not only the loads, but also small generation units, heating systems, storage systems, and electric vehicles. Each consumer can participate in different demand response events promoted by system operators or aggregation entities. This paper proposes an innovative method to manage the appliances on a house during a demand response event. The main contribution of this work is to include time constraints in resources management, and the context evaluation in order to ensure the required comfort levels. The dynamic resources management methodology allows a better resources' management in a demand response event, mainly the ones of long duration, by changing the priorities of loads during the event. A case study with two scenarios is presented considering a demand response with 30 min duration, and another with 240 min (4 h). In both simulations, the demand response event proposes the power consumption reduction during the event. A total of 18 loads are used, including real and virtual ones, controlled by the presented house management system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Structures of the products were characterized by SEM-EDX, XRD, and FTIR techniques. The light absorbance and band gap energy values of the materials were evaluated by UV/Visible spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the materials was determined from a degradation of methylene blue. It was found that, regardless of the polymerization time, the absorbance of TiO2/(TiO2-V2O5)/PPy was greater than those of TiO2/PPy and the neat TiO2, respectively. This was in accordance with the decrease in the band gap energy of the materials. The catalytic activity of TiO2/(TiO2-V 2O5) was also observed in the dark. After polymerization, the catalytic activity of nanocomposite under UV/Visible light and in the dark was compromised.

Several root, stem and leaf anatomical parameters (cross section diameter, cortex, root cortical cells, pith, leaf lamina and mesophyll thickness) were reduced under moderate to severe water deficit (20-30 days of withheld irrigation). The stele/cross section root ratio increased under moderate water deficit. The root's and stems vascular systems showed reduced xylem vessel diameter and increased wall thickness under water deficit. In addition, the root xylem vessel density was increased in these drought conditions while it was unchanged in the stems. The stomata density was increased under prolonged drought conditions whereas the stomata size was untouched. The leaf vascular system showed reduced xylem and phloem tissue thickness in the main vein under moderate to severe water deficit. However, in the lamina the vascular tissue and the distance between vascular bundle were unaffected. Our findings suggest a complex network of anatomical adaptations such as a reduced vessel size with increased wall thickness, lesser cortical and mesophyll parenchyma formation and increased stomata density.

As both photoperiod and growth season length change with latitude, species undergoing latitudinal range expansion often need to synchronize their life cycle with a changing photoperiod and growth season length. Since adaptive synchronization often involves a large number of time-consuming genetic changes, behavioural plasticity might be a faster way to adjust to novel conditions. We compared behavioural and physiological traits in overwintering (diapause) preparation in three latitudinally different European Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) populations reared under two photoperiods. Our aim was to study whether behavioural plasticity could play a role in rapid range expansion into seasonal environments. Our results show that while burrowing into the soil occurred in the southernmost studied population also under a non-diapause-inducing long photoperiod, the storage lipid content of these beetles was very low compared to the northern populations. However, similar behavioural plasticity was not found in the northern populations. Furthermore, the strongest suppression of energy metabolism was seen in pre-diapause beetles from the northernmost population. These results could indicate accelerated diapause preparation and possibly energetic adjustments due to temporal constraints imposed by a shorter, northern, growth season. Our results indicate that behavioural plasticity in burrowing may have facilitated initial range expansion of L. decemlineata in Europe. However, long-term persistence at high latitudes has required synchronization of burrowing behaviour with physiological traits. The results underline that eco-physiological life-history traits of insects, such as diapause, should be included in studies on range expansion. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioural plasticity; Coleoptera; Diapause; Latitude; Metabolic rate","adaptation; beetle; behavioral response; diapause; invasive species; overwintering; phenotypic plasticity; photoperiod; physiological response; range expansion; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Leptinotarsa decemlineata; acclimatization; animal; animal behavior; animal dispersal; article; beetle; diapause; environment; Europe; introduced species; photoperiodicity; physiology; season; statistical model; Acclimatization; Animal Distribution; Animals; Beetles; Behavior, Animal; Diapause, Insect; Environment; Europe; Introduced Species; Linear Models; Photoperiod; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906256182

Design and subject: Two experimental models were used in the present work: (1) To induce postnatal over- or normal nutrition, the litter size was adjusted to 4 (small litters - SL) and to 10 pups (normal litters - NL) in the nest, (2) in suckling pups at day 10, we used cross-fostering to identify the effect of altered dietary environment on their future body fat regulation, food intake, blood pressure, and the duodenal and jejunal alkaline phosphatase activity. After weaning, these control (NL, SL) and cross-fostered (NL-SL, SL-NL) groups were exposed to standard laboratory diet. Results: On day 50, the SL in comparison with NL rats became heavier and displayed enhanced adiposity accompanied by significantly increased systolic blood pressure (19 %) and duodenal (16 %) and jejunal (21 %) alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. The impact of pre-weaning over-nutrition of NL-SL pups was associated with long-lasting positive effect on obesity. In contrast, SL-NL rats submitted until weaning to the opposite normalized feeding condition on day 50 showed significantly decreased fat deposition (21 %), systolic blood pressure (20 %), and AP activity in duodenum and jejunum (14 %). Conclusions: These results contribute to a better understanding of how early-acquired dietary habits determine the attenuation or prevention of obesity development in later life and can provide some benefit for optimizing the future dietary strategies in young and adult obese individuals. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Health complications; Obesity; Pre-weaning nutrition","alkaline phosphatase; milk fat; alkaline phosphatase; animal experiment; animal model; article; birth weight; blood pressure; body fat; body weight; breast milk; controlled study; energy balance; enzyme activity; female; food intake; lipid storage; litter size; long term care; male; nonhuman; normal litter; nutritional disorder; obesity; overnutrition; rat; risk factor; small litter; suckling animal; systolic blood pressure; weight gain; adipose tissue; animal; chemistry; complication; diet; duodenum; enzymology; jejunum; metabolism; milk; newborn; nutritional status; obesity; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; suckling animal; weaning; Adipose Tissue; Alkaline Phosphatase; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Animals, Suckling; Blood Pressure; Diet; Duodenum; Female; Jejunum; Litter Size; Male; Milk; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Overnutrition; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Risk Factors; Weaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905991907

For this reason, multilevel converters are ideal for connecting either in series or in parallel an AC grid with renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics, fuel cells or with energy storage devices such as capacitors or batteries. For more levels of voltages, the total harmonic distortion of the voltage synthesized, decreases, but the control law gets complicated. This paper presents the modeling and control processes of the cascade H-bridge multilevel converter used as a shunt active filter. The single-phase five-level topology is firstly studied, then, is proposed the generalization of the model and the control law. The transformation of the model in terms of the sum and the difference of the squares of the capacitor voltages is crucial for our developments. Moreover, it is shown that, while the current tracking depends on the sum of the injected voltages, the balance of the capacitor voltages depends on the difference between them. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Active shunt filter; Adaptive control; Cascade H-Bridge; Generalized model; Internal model principle; Multilevel converter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905976251

Concerning the PV module, our measurements show, at low illumination regime, that the short circuit current ISC increases linearly with the illumination power levels. Moreover, for high illumination levels, the mechanism of bimolecular recombination and space charge limitation may be intensified and hence the short current of the PV module ISCMod depends sublinearly on the incident optical power; the behavior is nonlinear. For the open circuit voltage of the PV module VOCMod measurements, a linear variation of the VOCMod versus the short circuit current in semi-logarithmic scale has been noticed. The diode ideality factor n and diode saturation current Is have been investigated; the values of n and Is are approximately of 1.3 and 10-9 A, respectively. In addition, we have shown, for different discharging-charging currents rates (i.e. 0.35 A, 0.2 A and 0.04 A), that the battery voltage decreases with discharging time as well as discharging battery capacity, and on the other hand it increases with the charging time and will rise up until it maximized value. The initial result shows the possibility to use such lead acid battery for low power PV system, which is generally designed for the motorcycle battery. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For some mixtures a compressive strength of more than 300 MPa was reached still retaining good fresh characteristics of the UHPC. These mixtures were examined for properties of fresh and hardened concrete, focusing on tensile strength properties and fracture energy. The fracture energy was determined to describe the work capacity, i.e. the potential energy intake until the failure of the material. Thereby, a significant increase of the work capacity could be achieved by the addition of steel fibers.

The proposed system is a hybrid technology of energy storage and electrification, which is developed to use as a small scale of renewable energy power plant. The energy will be transferred from the renewable energy resource to the compressed air energy by reciprocating air compressor to be stored in a pressurized vessel. The energy storage system uses a small compressed air energy storage system, developed as a small unit and installed above ground to avoid site limitation as same as the conventional CAES does. Therefore, it is suitable to be placed at any location. The system is operated in low pressure not more than 15 bar, so, it easy to available component in country and inexpensive. The power generation uses a variable speed induction generator (IG). The relationship of pressure and air flow of the compressed air, which varies continuously during the discharge of compressed air to drive the generator, is considered as a control command. As a result, the generator generates power in wide speed range. Unlike the conventional CAES that used gas turbine, this system does not have any combustion units. Thus, the system does not burn fuel and exhaust pollution. This paper expresses the modelling, thermodynamic analysis simulation and experiment to obtain the characteristic and performance of a new concept of a small compressed air energy storage power plant, which can be helpful in system designing of renewable energy electrification. The system was tested under a range of expansion pressure ratios in order to determine its characteristics and performance. The efficiency of expansion air of 49.34% is calculated, while the efficiency of generator of 60.85% is examined. The overall efficiency of system of approximately 30% is also investigated.","CAES; Compressed air energy storage; Field oriented control; FOC; Induction generator","Asynchronous generators; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Pressure vessels; Renewable energy resources; Thermoanalysis; Variable speed drives; CAES; Compressed air energy storage; Field oriented control; FOC; Renewable energy power; Renewable power generation; Thermo dynamic analysis; Variable speed induction generator; Compressed air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905676108

Hydrogen must be stored at the production site, as well as at the point of its application. Often, significant part of hydrogen is used directly in the manufacturing process and thus eliminates the necessity of its supply. However, the development of automotive industry and the use of hydrogen for energy production require its storage in order to ensure continuous operation. The need of hydrogen supply itself increases with a use of alternative energy sources. These sources do not allow a constant supply of energy and, as a result, hydrogen serves as an intermediary: an energy carrier. The drawback of its broader application is a low-density storage in conventional pressure and cryogenic tanks, where it is necessary to use high pressures, respectively very low temperatures. Therefore, various types of metal-hydride and adsorption storage tanks are widely tested. Technology of hydrogen adsorption on carbon materials is effective only at cryogenic temperatures and so liquid nitrogen with temperature of 77 K (-196.15 °C) was used for the purpose of lowering the temperature of the storage device. This article discusses the possibilities of use of cryogenic temperatures in the adsorption of hydrogen on materials with broad surface area whereby liquid nitrogen is used to lower the temperature.

The N-CNTs were finite saturated and non-saturated single-walled carbon nanotubes that contained one or more pyrimidine units, the relative positions of which defined the different configurations of the nanotube. The chemisorption of atomic hydrogen to a full exocyclic monolayer of zigzag, armchair, and chiral N-CNTs was studied as a function of the structural parameters. Zigzag N-CNTs of any configuration, with a larger number of nitrogen atoms, a small diameter and a small length, are more reactive compared to chiral and armchair N-CNTs. The presence of nitrogen in the carbon nanotubes enhances their reactivity to chemisorb atomic hydrogen, showing exothermic energy values. In contrast, the physisorption of molecular hydrogen was endothermic for most of the studied saturated N-CNTs, even when including corrections for van der Waals interactions. The endothermicity was greatest for zigzag nanotubes, then decreased for chiral nanotubes and decreased again for armchair nanotubes. In general, the endothermicity decreased for longer nanotubes, which have larger diameters, and a small number of nitrogen atoms. The results of this study suggest that, with saturated bare carbon nanotubes, saturated, and unsaturated N-CNTs could potentially have a higher capacity as hydrogen-storage media than the corresponding unsaturated carbon nanotubes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Chirality; Dispersion forces; Hydrogen chemisorption energies; Nitrogen-doped nanotubes; Physisorption; Saturated nanotubes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905494781

Thereafter, the review moved from on-board power generation, as in diesel electric locomotives, through positive and negative change agents, to external power generation, as in electric locomotives. The change agents included non-renewable liquid fuel availability; energy storage quanta, devices and systems; harmful emissions; throughput scalability; and the potential impact of hydrogen as a fuel. Ideal external generation visualises electric traction within an open system: comprising a smart grid supported by bulk electricity storage, to enable heavy haul railways to manage optimally their traction energy through symbiotic interaction with external generators, consumers and storage providers. The high cost of electricity distribution infrastructure, buoyant availability of diesel fuel, and challenges of up-scaling electrically hauled throughput tonnage, oppose that ideal. To conclude, system design will likely reflect the vertical alignment's potential to regenerate energy, its ability to recover fully instantaneously surplus energy, whether the train brake system supports electric braking priority, and whether there is equitable access to a smart grid. © IMechE 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Diesel; electric; emissions; energy; fuel; independent power production; open system; railroad; railway; regeneration; renewable; risk; scalable; self-sufficiency; smart grid; storage; sustainability; traction","Diesel fuels; Electric energy storage; Electric locomotives; Electric traction; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fuel storage; Fueling; Open systems; Particulate emissions; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Risks; Smart power grids; Sustainable development; Diesel; electric; energy; Power production; railway; regeneration; renewable; scalable; self-sufficiency; Smart grid; Diesel electric traction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905489540

To develop such models for existing buildings, with often unknown the thermal properties, data-driven system identification methods are proposed. In this paper, system identification is carried out to identify suitable reduced-order models. Therefore, grey-box models of increasing complexity are identified on results from simulations with a detailed physical model, deployed in the integrated district energy assessment simulation (IDEAS) package in Modelica. Firstly, the robustness of identified grey-box models for day-ahead predictions and simulations of the thermal response of a dwelling, as well as the physical interpretation of the identified parameters, are analyzed. The influence of the identification dataset is quantified, comparing the added value of dedicated identification experiments against identification on data from in use buildings. Secondly, the influence of the data used for identification on model performance and the reliability of the parameter estimates is quantified.

The conceived SHP mainly consists of a flat-plate solar collector, solar hot water tank and an active layer integrated inside a single room. Firstly, a complete model is formulated taking into account various modes of heat transfer in the SHP by means of the TRNSYS simulation program. To validate the TRNSYS model, experimental tests under local weather conditions were performed for 2 days spread over 2 months (March and April 2013). Predicted results were compared to the measurements in order to determine the accuracy of the simulation program. A parametric study was then achieved by means of the TRNSYS program in order to optimize SHP design parameters (Collector area, collector mass flow rate, floor mass flow rate, storage tank volume and thickness of the active layer). The optimization of all design parameters shows that to achieve a maximum performances from the SHP it is essential to use a solar collector with an area equal to 6 m2 area, a collector mass flow rate equal to 100 kg h-1 and a hot water storage tank with a capacity equal to 450 l. Concerning the floor heating, the optimal values of mass flow rate and the active layer thickness are 200 kg h-1 and 0.06 m, respectively. The long-term SHP performances were afterward evaluated by means of the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data relative to Tunis, Tunisia. Results showed that for an annual total solar insolation of about 6493.37 MJ m-2 the average solar fraction obtained is about 84%. The results show also that the request of auxiliary energy is limited to the cold months of the year chiefly from December to Mars. The results show also that the SHP reduce the relative humidity inside the monozone room of about 40%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The storage operates as a buffer. The material is collected into it and is withdrawn from the buffer for production. Deterministic constant withdrawal rate is supposed and the filling process is described by discrete random variables. The main question addressed here is the probability of material shortage as a function of the initial amount of material. For this purpose, an auxiliary function is defined and a difference equation is set for it. In a special case we present the solution of the difference equation, we compare the exact and simulated results, and we propose a method for the determination of unknown constants. We apply the results for expressing the initial amount of material necessary to a given reliability level.

Universidad 3000, Mexico City, Mexico","The aim of this work is to study the automatic characterization of Naturally Fractured Vuggy Reservoirs via well test analysis, using a triple porosity-dual permeability model. The inter-porosity flow parameters, the storativity ratios, as well as the permeability ratio, the wellbore storage effect, the skin and the total permeability will be identified as parameters of the model. In this work, we will perform the well test interpretation in Laplace space, using numerical algorithms to transfer the discrete real data given in fully dimensional time to Laplace space. The well test interpretation problem in Laplace space has been posed as a nonlinear least squares optimization problem with box constraints and a linear inequality constraint, which is usually solved using local Newton type methods with a trust region. However, local methods as the one used in our work called TRON or the well-known Levenberg- Marquardt method, are often not able to find an optimal solution with a good fit of the data. Also well test analysis with the triple porosity-double permeability model, like most inverse problems, can yield multiple solutions with good match to the data. To deal with these specific characteristics, we will use a global optimization algorithm called the Tunneling Method (TM). In the design of the algorithm, we take into account issues of the problem like the fact that the parameter estimation has to be done with high precision, the presence of noise in the measurements and the need to solve the problem computationally fast.We demonstrate that the use of the TM in this study, showed to be an efficient and robust alternative to solve the well test characterization, as several optimal solutions, with very good match to the data were obtained. © 2014 IFP Energies nouvelles.",,"Algorithms; Constraint theory; Digital storage; Global optimization; Inverse problems; Laplace transforms; Optimal systems; Optimization; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Porosity; Well testing; Global optimization algorithm; Global optimization method; Linear inequality constraints; Naturally fractured-Vuggy Reservoirs; Nonlinear least-squares optimization; Numerical algorithms; Well test interpretation; Wellbore storage effects; Problem solving; algorithm; hydrocarbon reservoir; inverse problem; least squares method; optimization; permeability; porosity; reservoir characterization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905239744

A comprehensive literature review has been conducted and it was concluded that this technology, although attractive, has limitations regarding its performance that seem difficult to overcome. Therefore, new approaches were identified to increase the efficiency and sustainability of basic adsorption cycles, like the development of hybrid or thermal energy storage adsorption systems. A survey of the developments in these new research trends is also presented in this paper. It shows that there are simple adsorption cycles which can be attractive alternatives not only to serve the needs for air-conditioning, refrigeration, ice making, thermal energy storage or hybrid heating and cooling purposes, as standalone or integrated systems, but also to meet the demands for energy conservation and environmental protection. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adsorption refrigeration; Energy efficiency; Hybrid adsorption systems; Solar refrigeration; Thermal energy storage","Adsorption; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Solar refrigeration; Thermal energy; Adsorption cycle; Adsorption refrigeration; Adsorption system; Energy conservation and environmental protections; Heating and cooling; Integrated systems; Literature reviews; Solar adsorption refrigeration; Refrigeration",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905166510

Aiming to find crucial information to reduce the vibration transmitted to the outer shell of HDD, the parameters involving vibrational energy transmission through the main components of HDD are identified by the test-based statistical energy analysis (SEA). First, the vibration tests of HDD in the idle mode are performed in order to identify the contribution of the main components; the top cover, the platters, and the actuator arm to the overall vibration of HDD. The SEA parameters including the dissipation loss factors of the individual components and coupling loss factors of the pairs of the components are then experimentally determined in order to calculate the vibration transmission power among the components. The determined parameters, hence, provide some vibrational energy transmission characteristics to facilitate the design of the HDD components to generate less vibration. With some further studies using this concept, the vibration due to shock exerted to the shell of HDD that is transmitted to main components inside the HDD can also be reduced. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Couplings; Coupling loss factors; Dissipation Loss Factors; Hard Disk Drive; Hard disk drives; Individual components; Statistical energy analysis; Vibration transmission; Vibrational energies; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905099833

The maximum percent of PCM in the composites was assigned to be 12, 13, 18, 23, 30, and 42wt%, respectively. The form-stable BCPCMs were characterized using SEM, FT-IR, DSC, and TG analysis techniques. The characterization results showed the existence of homogenous dispersion of the PCM into the PBM matrixes. The DSC measurements indicated that the melting temperatures of the form-stable BCPCMs are in the range of 20-33°C while they have latent heats of melting in the range of about 28-55J/g. These results make them promising BCPCMs for low temperature-passive TES applications in buildings. Thermal cycling test indicated that the prepared BCPCMs have good thermal reliability and chemical stability. TG analysis proved that the prepared BCPCMs have good thermal durability. In addition, the thermal conductivity of BCPCMs was enhanced considerably by addition of expanded graphite (EG). The improvement in thermal conductivity of the BCPCMs caused appreciably reduction in their melting times. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bentonite; CA-MA eutectic mixture; Chemical stability; Octadecane; PCM; PEG1000; Pumice; Thermal durability; Thermal energy storage; Thermal reliability","Abrasives; Bentonite; Chemical stability; Durability; Heat storage; Latent heat; Melting; Pulse code modulation; Thermal energy; Eutectic mixture; Octadecane; PEG1000; Thermal durability; Thermal reliability; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905051236

It is shown that increasing the quantity of thick-film layers (from two to three) results in the improvement of the temperature sensitivity of thick-film structures. Humidity-sensitive thick films in one-layered form possess good linear dependence of electrical resistance on relative humidity without hysteresis in the range of 40-99%. Integrated p-i-p+ thick-film structures are stable in time and can be successfully applied for integrated environmental sensors. In addition, anomalous proton charge-transfer processes were studied for the first time in these p-i-p+ multilayers as a basis for novel electrical power sources, energy conversion and storage distinguished by high functional reliability, technological reproducibility and cost-effective synthesis route. A so-called aqueous-voltaic effect was revealed as electric motion force generation caused by orientation influence of electrical fields within separate p-i and i-p+ bilayers. This effect is strongly dependent on technical parameters of p-i-p+ nanostructure, reaching approximately 0.2 V for typical thick-film depths.

It not only degrades the quality of search results by intentionally boosting undesirable web pages to users, but also causes the search engine to waste a significant amount of computational and storage resources in manipulating useless information. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach for spam detection by adopting the ant colony optimization algorithm. We first construct a directed graph corresponding to web hosts and their aggregated hyperlinks. Then, we train a classifier by employing ants to walk along paths in the graph. Each ant will start from an individual non-spam host and afterwards decides to follow a link to the next host with a probability based on both heuristic function and pheromone trail. Relying on the approximate isolation principle of a good set, we reward an ant that can discover a good path, i.e., a sequence of non-spam hosts, by charging energy for its longer walking. In contrast, if the ant instead discovers any spam, it will be penalized by decreasing its walking step. Finally, the classification rules are constructed by choosing common overlapping characteristic features of all non-spam hosts along the discovered paths. Experiments on WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset show that our approach contributes to more accurately classify spam and non-spam hosts than several rule-based classification baselines. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","adaptive learning paths; ant colony optimization; penalty distance; reward distance; web spam detection","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Heuristic algorithms; Hypertext systems; Optimization; Search engines; Adaptive learning; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Classification rules; Machine learning approaches; Penalty distances; reward distance; Rule-based classification; Web spam detections; Internet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904862817

Although the highest solid fat content was in the 10% monoglyceride oleogel (9.38%), it was 12.15% in the commercial breakfast margarine at 20 °C. The peak melting temperature of the margarine was 47.11 °C, and among all oleogels, monoglyceride oleogel at 7% addition had the closest value (48.70 °C). The melting enthalpies of the oleogels ranged from 1.25 to 103.97 J·g-1, while it was 94.19 J·g-1 for the margarine sample. The firmness and stickiness values were usually lower in the oleogel samples than those of the margarine sample. There was no significant change in the texture parameters during storage, indicating good structural stability. The polarized light microscopy pictures revealed rod-like crystals for carnauba wax and rosette-like aggregates for monoglyceride oleogels.

The problem with the proposed technology is that it can only provide power during the day and therefore requires some sort of storage system, if power is to be supplied throughout the day and night. A number of storage systems exist, but the one of particular interest is packed rock beds. Discrete Element Models (DEM) of rock beds were developed through both experimental and numerical procedures, by conducting a series of sensitivity and calibration studies. Through these procedures, a set of microproperties could be determined to accurately model the rock particles. The properties were verified by modelling the discharge from a hopper with three different opening widths. Further, the research focused on the potential of constructing self-supporting tunnels within the rock beds in order to improve the air flow through the bed by minimizing the pressure drop. Horizontal and vertical tunnels were investigated, each with different diameters. It was observed that if the appropriate steps were followed, stable self-supporting tunnels could be formed using particles of different scale. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Discrete Element Modelling (DEM); Hopper discharge; Packed rock beds; Property calibration; Self-sustaining tunnels","Calibration; Hoppers; Rocks; Solar energy; Discrete Element Modelling (DEM); Discrete element models (DEM); Element properties; Hopper discharges; Numerical procedures; Opening width; Packed rock beds; Storage systems; Packed beds; airflow; angle of repose; article; bulk density; calibration; cooling; discrete element modelling; dynamics; energy resource; friction; heating; particle size; porosity; rock; sensitivity analysis; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904689253

Nevertheless, the massive adoption of such solutions in small networks (neighborhood, village) may induce problems in the electric grid management. This study explores the impact of such systems in small electric grids, using an hourly electricity backup load model. To test and validate the model, we used the island of Corvo (Azores), a small isolated community where it is being implemented a project of electrification of domestic hot water systems (DHW). We consider different load scenarios to manage the backup of DHW systems and analyze its consequences on the peak load and overall energy demand. For Corvo, for the best case where the backup is limited and distributed along off-peak hours, we observed an increase of 24% in the peak load and 7.5% in the annual energy demand. Critical values of peak load are found in winter, when daily solar irradiation is lower than 2000Wh/m2/day. We conclude that the solar thermal systems are responsible for most of the peak load increase, but since they have the flexibility to adjust the electric backup hours due to the thermal storage capacity, the use of these systems can minimize the impact on the grid. Heat pumps on the other hand, albeit being more efficient in terms electric backup, are less flexible to contribute to the grid management as they operate continuously. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Domestic hot water; Heat pumps; Hybrid renewable energy systems contents; Isolated micro-communities; Renewable energy; Solar thermal","Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Renewable energy resources; Domestic hot water; Heat pumps; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Isolated micro-communities; Renewable energies; Solar thermal; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904580677

Obesity is defined as an unhealthy excess of body fat results from genetic, metabolic, behavioral and environmental factors. Leptin plays a pivotal role in regulating the energy balance and fat storage by its receptor. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of leptin receptor gene may play a role in the pathophysiology of human obesity. In this study, the association between the OB-R gene polymorphism and obesity in Jeddah city population was evaluated by determining the distribution of allele's frequency of the leptin receptor LYS109ARG polymorphism (rs1137100) in 123 volunteers (60 males & 63 females) aged between (15-60 years). Each gender was divided into three groups according to body mass indexnormal ""control"", overweight and obese. Genotypes were determined for all subjects by using polymerase chain reaction, followed by a cut using restriction enzyme. When comparing between the body mass index (BMI) of AA and AG genotypes, a significant difference (P=0.001) was observed. Also, there was a significant increase in AA genotype compared to AG genotype in female obese (OR=0.14, 95%CI: 0.03-0.70, P=0.01). This result suggests that genetic polymorphism of leptin receptor gene (LYS109ARG) may play a role in female obese.","Jeddah- polymorphism; Obesity- leptin receptor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904580589

As with structural transitions, most applications require one to consistently take into account the role of strain. If temperature drives the transition, the relevant strains are, as a rule, small enough to be treated as infinitesimal, and therefore one can get away with linearized elasticity theory. However, for transitions driven by high pressure, strains may become so large that it is absolutely mandatory to treat them as finite and deal with the nonlinear nature of the accompanying elastic energy. In this paper, we explain how to set up and apply what is, in fact, the only possible consistent Landau theory of high-pressure phase transitions that systematically allows us to take these geometrical and physical nonlinearities into account. We also show how to incorporate available information on the pressure dependence of elastic constants taken from experiment or simulation. We apply our new theory to the example of the high-pressure cubic-tetragonal phase transition in strontium titanate, a model perovskite that has played a central role in the development of the theory of structural phase transitions. Armed with pressure-dependent elastic constants calculated by density-functional theory, we give an accurate description of recent high-precision experimental data and predict a number of elastic transition anomalies accessible to experiments.","Condensed matter physics","Condensed matter physics; Digital storage; Elastic constants; Elasticity; Experiments; Geometrical and physical nonlinearities; High-pressure phase transitions; Linearized elasticities; Pressure dependence; Structural phase transition; Structural transitions; Thermodynamic description; Transition anomalies; Strain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904574593

The incorporation of a battery or other energy storage device in the DC-link enables temporary storage of energy. Traditionally, control of DFIG is achieved by Flux Oriented Control (FOC), this technique decouples the rotor currents into active and reactive components; control of the active and reactive powers is achieved indirectly by controlling the input currents by using of classical Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers. However this controller depends highly on parameter variations of the DFIG. Direct Power Control (DPC), without inner current control loops, produces a fast and robust power response. Simulation results on a 1.5 MW DFIG system are provided to demonstrate the control strategy and the large interest of energy storage in such wind energy conversion systems (WECS).","Direct power control; Double fed induction generator; Storage unit; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904574465

Here, we studied ionic transport properties and Li self-diffusion in nanocrystalline Li2O2 by conductivity and temperature variable 7Li NMR spectroscopy. Nanostructured Li2O2, characterized by a mean crystallite size of less than 50 nm as estimated from X-ray diffraction peak broadening, was prepared by high-energy ball milling of microcrystalline lithium peroxide with μm sized crystallites. At room temperature the overall conductivity σ of the microcrystalline reference sample turned out to be very low (3.4 × 10-13 S cm-1) which is in agreement with results from temperature-variable 7Li NMR line shape measurements. Ball-milling, however, leads to an increase of σ by approximately two orders of magnitude (1.1 × 10-10 S cm-1); correspondingly, the activation energy decreases from 0.89 eV to 0.82 eV. The electronic contribution σeon, however, is in the order of 9 × 10-12 S cm-1 which makes less than 10% of the total value. Interestingly, 7Li NMR lines of nano-Li2O2 undergo pronounced heterogeneous motional narrowing which manifests in a two-component line shape emerging with increasing temperatures. Most likely, the enhancement in σ can be traced back to the generation of a spin reservoir with highly mobile Li ions; these are expected to reside in the nearest neighbourhood of defects generated or near the structurally disordered and defect-rich interfacial regions formed during mechanical treatment.

Due to their importance lipids are under tight homeostatic control and exhibit spatial and dynamic complexity at multiple levels. It is thus not surprising that altered lipid metabolism plays important roles in the pathogenesis of most of the common diseases. Lipidomics emerged as a discipline which is dedicated to global study of lipidomes, including pathways and networks of lipids in biological systems. When studying the lipidomes at a systems level, one of the key challenges is how to address the lipid functionality at many physiological levels, from metabolic and signaling pathways to spatial systems such as cellular membranes and lipoprotein particles. Besides the better analytical techniques to study lipids, computational techniques have started to emerge which enable modeling of lipidomes in their spatial and dynamic context. Together, the recent methodological advances in lipidomics have a potential to open novel avenues for predictive and preventive medicine.

Therefore, two batches of P. argentinus were fed for 21 days with a commercial food enriched in proteins (D1) or with D2, composed of D1 enriched with vitamin-E (6.8 and 16.0mg% of vitamin-E, respectively). Subsequently, half of the individuals of each group were exposed to atrazine (0.4mgL-1) for 24h and the others remained as controls.Atrazine promoted oxidative stress response in P. argentinus fed with D1 as indicated by enhanced H2O2 content and induction of superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferases and glutathione reductase. This antioxidant activity would prevent the increment of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the shrimp tissues. P. argentinus fed with D2 reversed the response of the biomarkers measured. However, the activation of antioxidants response had an energetic cost, which was revealed by a decrease in lipids storage in shrimps.These results show the modulatory effect of vit-E on oxidative stress and its potential use as an effective antioxidant to be applied in chemoprotection strategies during aquaculture. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Atrazine; Freshwater invertebrates; Herbicides; Oxidative stress; Tocopherols","antioxidant; atrazine; biomarker; crustacean; environmental stress; pollution exposure; vitamin; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; atrazine; biological marker; glutathione reductase; herbicide; hydrogen peroxide; superoxide dismutase; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; animal; carbohydrate metabolism; diet; drug effects; energy metabolism; growth, development and aging; lipid metabolism; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; Palaemonidae; toxicity; Animals; Antioxidants; Atrazine; Biological Markers; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione Reductase; Herbicides; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lipid Metabolism; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Palaemonidae; Superoxide Dismutase; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances; Vitamin E",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904445426

Biomass used for power purposes is obtained on purpose as a result of production activities or it originates from utilization of wastes from agricultural, forest and industrial production. In biomass burning, the boiler used produces carbon dioxide, recyclable in nature. Increase of the amount of municipal and technological waste including materials that are heavily soiled and difficult to recycle pushed up demand to obtain the best possible solutions in terms of both technological and economic terms. Recycling of materials can provide multiple circulations which have to lead to final solution such as storage or use in energy production.

A study was conducted at Okara and Pind Dadan Khan during the October 2010 and June 2011, respectively. The objectives of study were to evaluate selected ear-corn drying techniques namely sun drying, solar passive ear-corn drying, and heated-air earcorn drying and to perform the cost analysis of these three techniques, and analyzed the comparative performance of these techniques based on field data. Solar passive dryer was constructed in Okara and Pind Dadan Khan to dry ear-corn; the test results indicated that dryer was found capable to dry 0.5 tons of ear-corn from 26.1 to 18.9% moisture content in October in four days and from 26.4% to 20.1% in June in two days. During sun drying 25.9% moisture content was decreased to 19.1% in October and 25.6% to 18.4% in June. A heated-air dryer developed at Agricultural and Biological Engineering Institute, National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad was also evaluated. The tests results showed that dryer had capacity to dry 4 tons ear-corn from 26.5 to 20.4% moisture content in 9 hours using heated air.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-prepared and annealed samples at various temperatures exhibit single phase spinel structure. Enhancement in crystallinity and crystallite size is observed with the increase in annealing temperature. The annealing has also greatly influence the morphology and grain size of prepared NPs. The Co0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 NPs have shown remarkable enhancement in magnetic moment with increase in annealing temperature. The bandgap energies of Co0.5Zn 0.5Fe2O4 NPs have been measured via UV Spectrometer and observed to decrease with annealing temperature. FTIR spectra of the samples reveal the presence of both high frequency and low-frequency bands due to tetrahedral and octahedral sites, which corroborate well with the XRD results.

A complete set of rheological tests including temperature and frequency sweeps, steady shear and transient shear flow was performed in order to get detailed information on the food processing issues. The nixtamalization process affected significantly (P &lt; 0.05) the microstructural and thermal properties of masa. Polarized Light microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XDR) showed that crystallinity in starch granules decreased for the masa; whereas, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), showed swollen granules dispersed into a plasticized surface. Moreover, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences on the gelatinization enthalpy (ΔHgel) of masa, where it increased with increasing the moisture content from 6.7 ± 0.84 J/g for 55% (w/w) to 10.2 ± 0.4 J/g for 60% (w/w). Frequency sweeps showed a predominant elastic behavior where the storage modulus (G′) was higher than the loss modulus (G″) and they were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) affected by the moisture content and temperature into a small range. The steady shear data exhibited a shear-thinning flow behavior and followed a power law equation, where the power law index (n) decreased when the temperature and the moisture content increased. The effect of temperature on the shear-viscosity (η) was well described by the Arrhenius equation, exhibiting energy activation energy (Ea) values in the range from 25.52 to 59.35 KJ/mol. For transient shear test, all masas presented a stress overshoot at high shear rate before reaching a steady state. It was found that the amplitude of this overshoot depends on the shear rate. On the other hand, the stress relaxation test, which gives the main relaxation time (τ), showed fast relaxation decay at short times, whereas at long times, a slow relaxation was observed.

In the current study we examine the body condition of the species in relation to habitat type, age, sex and seasonality on the island of Lemnos. Body condition was assessed based on a visual estimation of the amount of abdominal fat. A high intra-annual variation in the body condition of the species has been observed, which is further affected by sex and age. The species appears to conserve and maintain high levels of energy reserves for two main reasons. The first is to ensure a better reproductive success, as expressed by the relatively high amount of stored fat reserves at the onset of breeding season, and their depletion during it. The second is to ensure survival during periods where the shortage of food creates a rather hostile environment, as expressed by the increased level of reserves during summer and their dramatic decrease from late summer until autumn. The temporal fluctuation in energy reserves differs between male and female rabbits, reflecting their temporally different energy demands. Further, differences in body conditions were observed between juvenile and adult individuals, reflecting their different needs in terms of body growth and maintenance. Our results could offer important insights for the development of a time specific management plan and measures to ensure either the control of the population or its conservation.","Energy reserves; European wild rabbit; Fat storage; Management; Mediterranean environment","body condition; breeding season; energy budget; environmental economics; fat; habitat management; lagomorph; Mediterranean environment; reproductive success; survival; wild population; Aegean Islands; Greece; Lemnos; Northern Aegean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904262047

In most riverside areas in Nigeria, where fish business is very prominent smoking operations are mostly carried out manually and under unhygienic conditions. The concept of the smoking kiln development is to ease the drudgery associated with traditional methods (drum smoking) in the riverside communities. In this study, a motorized fish smoking kiln was designed, fabricated with locally available materials. The smoking process is based on natural convection of heated air with temperature ranging between 60°C and 110°C. The fish smoking kiln has an overall dimension of1600×1220×70 mm and uses charcoal as the main source of energy. The average capacity of the smoking chamber is 120 kg. The performance test was conducted to ascertain its performance. The result showed that moisture content was reduced from 80% to 30% with an average smoking time of 60 mins. The study concluded that fishes smoked by the kiln have a longer shelf life during storage when compared with traditional (drum) method, due to hot smoking temperature which reduces moisture faster. The overall average percentage weight loss obtained for three species tested are as follows: Etholmosa Fimbriata (sawa)-36%, Scombridae mackerel (37%) and Clarias gariepinus (cat fish) -45%. © 2014 Ashaolu Michael O.","Charcoal; Fish; Motorized; Shelf-life; Smoking kiln; Temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904244528

The nuclear power plant module must satisfy inherent safety requirement, and have flexibility in producing electricity, clean water (through desalination), etc. The reactor can be operated for 25 years without the necessity to refuel during that period. To achieve inherent safety capability it is important to minimized excess reactivity during burn-up to be below delayed neutron fraction value so that super prompt critical accident such as in Chernobyl accident case can be avoided.

The aim of this work is to contribute with experimental data to complement theoretical models that are currently under discussion in order to describe the structure of the double layer formed at the interface electrode/ionic liquid. There is still a controversy about the general shape that differential capacitance curves should present and researchers still continue making efforts to correlate the nature of the electrode/ionic liquid with the shape of the curves. Differential capacitance curves at the Au and Pt interface shows that the values of capacity follow the same order C [C 4MIM][PF6] &lt; C [C4MIM][Tf2N] &lt; C [C4MIM][BF4]. However, the values of C are considerably lower for Pt when compared with Au for all three liquids studied. The alkyl chain length effect on the differential capacity curves was also studied at the Pt/[CnMIM][Tf2N] interface (where n = 2, 4 and 6). The results follow an expected trend except for the liquid [C6MIM] [Tf2N] that shows a value of capacity near to that obtained for [C2MIM][Tf2N]. Since ionic liquids have great applicability in energy storage devices and capacitors it is of great importance to evaluate the dependence of differential capacitance as function of temperature. The results indicate that the capacity increases with increasing temperature for all systems studied in this work. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitance; Ionic liquids; 1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate; 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate; Alkyl chain lengths; Differential capacitance; Differential capacity; Double layer structure; Electrical double layers; Increasing temperatures; Platinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904097117

This study standardizes several procedures for AEC determination in penaeid shrimp that are very sensitive to sampling. We concluded that shrimp can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -76°C for up to two years for further analysis, or freshly dissected and immediately homogenized in acid. Other cooling procedures, such as immersion in cold water or placing shrimp on ice for 15 min resulted in 50% and 73% decreases in ATP levels, and 9-fold and 10-fold increases in IMP levels, respectively. Optimal values of AEC (0.9) were obtained in shrimp recently transferred from ponds to indoor conditions, but decreased to 0.77 after one month in indoor tanks when stocked at high densities; the AEC re-established to 0.85 when the shrimps were transferred to optimal conditions (lower density and dark tanks). While the levels of arginine phosphate followed the same pattern, its levels did not fully re-establish. Comparison of different devices for sample homogenization indicated that a cryogenic ball mill mixer is the more suitable procedure.","Adenylic energy charge; ATP; IMP; Litopenaeus (= Penaeus) vannamei; Methods; Stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903954234

Along with this development come a shift from centralized to distributed production and consumption models as well as discussions about the introduction of variable demand-supply-driven grid electricity prices. Together with upcoming ICT and automation technologies, these developments open space to a wide range of novel energy management and energy trading possibilities to optimally use available energy resources. However, what is considered as an optimal energy management and trading strategy heavily depends on the individual objectives and needs of a microgrid operator. Accordingly, elaborating the most suitable strategy for each particular system configuration and operator need can become quite a complex and time-consuming task, which can massively benefit from computational support. In this article, we introduce a bio-inspired cognitive decision agent architecture for optimized, goal-specific energy management in (interconnected) microgrids, which are additionally connected to the main electricity grid. For evaluating the performance of the architecture, a number of test cases are specified targeting objectives like local photovoltaic energy consumption maximization and financial gain maximization. Obtained outcomes are compared against a modified simulating annealing optimization approach in terms of objective achievement and computational effort. Results demonstrate that the cognitive decision agent architecture yields improved optimization results in comparison to the state of the art reference method while at the same time requiring significantly less computation time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the technology is still in the early phases of development due to lack of a design for single hydrogen fuel cells, and problems with hydrogen production and storage.

The gene encoding this enzyme was cloned into the pCWori vector within the same reading frame with six residues of histidine in the C-terminal sequence. Using this vector and the E. coli DH5α, a host-vector expression system has been developed and conditions for protein synthesis have been optimized. To purify the protein, metal affinity chromatography with further dialysis was used to remove imidazole. The enzyme yield was no less than 60 mg of the end protein per 1 L of the culture medium. The concordance between amino acid sequences of the recombinant and native enzymes was proved by peptide mass fingerprinting and mass spectrometry. A rapid test to determine the activity of the enzyme preparation was suggested. It was found that the activity of 1.0 mg of the recombinant protein is no less than 3 × 103 units. The recombinant enzyme was most stable at pH 8.0 and an ionic strength of the solution equal to 200 mM; it lost its activity completely for 10 min at 60°C. Storage during 1 year at -20°C resulted in the loss of no more than 30% of activity. In the enzyme preparation, the activity of DNase was absent.

These can exhibit electrical double layer phenomena and capacitances up to hundreds of F/g. Here, we demonstrate a new supercapacitor fabrication methodology based around the microphase separation of PS-b-PMMA which has been used to prepare copper nanoelectrodes of dimension ~13 nm. These structures provide excellent capacitive performance with a maximum specific capacitance of ~836 F/g for a current density of 8.06 A/g at a discharge current as high as 75 mA. The excellent performance is due to a high surface area: volume ratio. We suggest that this highly novel, easily fabricated structure might have a number of important applications.

The M/N-EPCM was fabricated via emulsion polymerization reaction of methylmethacrylate (MMA) monomer occurred around C19 used as core material. The chemical structure of the prepared M/N-EPCM was verified using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy method. The analysis results obtained from polarized optical microscopy (POM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the synthesized micro/nanocapsules had virtually spherical shape. The particle size distribution (PSD) analysis indicated that the prepared M/N-PCM(1:2) with the highest nonadecane content had mean diameter of 8.18 μm and 4.90 (v/v%) nanosized capsules. These properties make it a feasible PCM in incorporation to thermal fluids, textile, building and food packaging materials. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis results showed that the micro-nanoencapsulated nonadecane had a suitable melting temperature and of 31.23 °C and a total latent heat value as high as 139.20 J/g, respectively. Additionally, the prepared M/N-EPCM had good thermal durability, thermal reliability, chemical stability, phase change reversibility properties even after extended 5000 thermal cycling, and also reasonably thermal conductivity. Therefore, it had a promising potential in different thermal energy storage application such as solar thermal controlling of building envelopes, thermal protecting of vehicle battery systems, and thermal regulating applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The methods that are used to solve the problem of household solid waste elimination are i rregular storage, landfill, composting, reuse, recycling, retrieval and incineration. In Turkey, domestic waste disposal methods are irregular and regular storage. While sanitary landfill method implementations are on the processing in our country, the EU countries have already been abolishing this method and its applications areas gradually. In this study, instead of landfill, installation of a modern solid waste retrieval, disposal and energy production facility installation has been analysed in technical and economic point of view. To make a technical and economic analysis of such an integrated recycling, disposal and energy generation facility, the average composition and the amount of waste, household waste, recyclable (paper, plastic, glass, metal) and organic matter contents that belong to a municipality have been determined.

This is partly due to weather patterns and the changing nature of electricity markets, where intermittent wind energy levels lead to variations in the demand for gas needed to produce electricity. This uncertainty makes it difficult for traders in the market to analyse the market. As a result, there is an increasing need for models of the UK natural gas market that include stochastic demand. In this paper, a Rolling Optimisation Model (ROM) of the UK natural gas market is introduced. It takes as an input stochastically generated scenarios of demand. The outputs of ROM are the flows of gas, i.e., how the different sources of supply meet demand, as well as how gas flows in to and out of gas storage facilities. The outputs also include the daily System Average Price of gas in the UK. The model was found to fit reasonably well to historic data (from the UK National Grid) for the years starting on the 1st of April for both 2010 and 2011. These results allow ROM to be used to predict future flows and prices of gas and to investigate various stress-test scenarios in the UK natural gas market. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Rolling optimisation; Stochastic demand scenarios; UK natural gas market","Flow of gases; Natural gas; Optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Electricity market; Historic data; National Grid; Natural gas markets; Optimisation models; Optimisations; Stochastic demand; Weather patterns; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903644038

Several techniques, such as the galvanostatic charging and discharging, the constant potential discharge, and the potentiodynamic polarization, were applied to characterize these electrochemical properties. The discharge capacity of the LaY2Ni9 alloy increases to reach 258 mAh g-1 after 5 cycles and decreases to 140 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles then stabilizes around this same value indicating good cycling held. The hydrogen diffusion coefficient D H in the bulky alloy is estimated to be (1.02 ± 0.11) × 10 -11 cm2 s-1 correlated with the good stability of electrochemical capacity after 100 cycles. The evolution of the ratio D H/ a2 and the corrosion current density and potential are correlated with the evolution of the electrochemical capacity during the activation and for a long cycling. The enthalpy, the entropy, and the apparent activation energy of the LaY2Ni9 hydride formation are evaluated.

Two abundant renewable energy sources, solar and wind, are increasingly cost-competitive and also offer the potential of decentralized, and hence more robust, sourcing. However, the intermittent nature of solar and wind power can present difficulties in connection with integrating them into the main electric power grid. One measure that can address this issue of local, temporal energy deficits is to organize local micro-grid societies in which excess power is traded to those members that need it by market exchange. Different communities may employ differing strategies and policies with respect to their attitudes concerning environmental sustainability and financial outcomes. In this connection it can be valuable to have modeling facilities available that can assist communities to predict what may happen under various circumstances in a society employing mixed trading and storage strategies. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach that can be used to examine various strategies that can be used in connection with battery storage and market-based energy trading strategies for a set of communities locally connected into an electric micro-grid. We demonstrate that by means of agent-based what-if simulations, battery strategies can be selected that provide financial advantages to local communities and also lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions (from a policy modeling perspective). © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Micro-grid; Multi-agent system; Renewable energy; Strategies","Commerce; Data privacy; Electricity; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Network security; Societies and institutions; Wind power; Agent-based model; Electric power grids; Environmental sustainability; Essential elements; Micro grid; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Strategies; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903582715

Total zinc content in the pancreatic β-cells is among the highest in the body and changes in the Zn2+ levels have been found to be associated with diabetes. The most common form of the Zn-insulin complex is a hexamer containing two zinc ions. However, zinc can also form other complexes with insulin, whereas dissociation constants of these complexes are not known. We have determined that the dissociation constant value of the monomeric 1:1 Zn-insulin complex is equal to 0.40 μM. The apparent binding affinity decreases drastically at higher insulin concentrations where the peptide forms dimers. Cu2+ ions also bind to monomeric insulin, whereas the apparent Cu2+-binding affinity depends on HEPES concentration. The conditional dissociation constant of the Cu 2+-insulin complex is equal to 0.025 μM.

Latent heat storage is one of the most perspective methods of increasing efficiency in energy conservation and effective using sources of heat. Among available latent heat storage materials, the organic materials draw the attention of many researchers. It should be noted that the development of phase change materials advances the investigations of their thermophysical properties sufficiently. Knowledge of thermophysical properties is necessary condition for practical applications. The data on thermophysical properties of potential latent heat storage materials is dissipated in many scientific sources that are inaccessible, in many cases, for potential consumers of phase change thermal energy storage materials.

The objective of the present study is to determine experimentally the thermodynamic properties of solid state silver-palladium alloys in low temperatures. Thermodynamic measurements of silver-palladium alloys have been performed over a temperature range of 450-750 K by the electromotive force method with superionic conductor AgI as the solid electrolyte. The activity and partial molar Gibbs energy of silver were obtained for Ag-Pd alloys over the whole composition range, and the thermodynamic properties of palladium were calculated using the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The results show that activities of silver exhibit fairly large negative deviations over most of the composition range, and the activities of palladium are characterized by both negative and positive deviations from the ideal Raoultian behavior. The results also show the minimum integral enthalpy of mixing of Ag-Pd alloys to locate at around 60 at.% Ag. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Hydrogen storage; Industrial applications; Palladium alloys; Silver; Solid electrolytes; Thermodynamic properties; ELectrochemical methods; Electromotive force method; Gibbs-Duhem equation; Hydrogen permeation; Hydrogen storage materials; Molar Gibbs energies; Super ionic conductors; Thermodynamic measurements; Silver alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903534673

Based on the governing equations of motion of a gyroscope, the equations for the rotor-platform interactions are developed. These equations, which relate the vehicle's roll, pitch and yaw rate with the internal transverse torques on the flywheel, are integrated into a commercial vehicle dynamics program. An average passenger car model equipped with a typical high-speed flywheel energy storage system is used for the numerical investigations. The flywheel bearing loads produced by some selected, representative driving maneuvers are simulated for different orientations of the flywheel spin axis relative to the body frame. In addition, the dynamic response of the vehicle to the reaction torques is investigated in open and closed-loop vehicle dynamics simulations. Thus, the steering response of a driver model to the gyrodynamics of a flywheel-based KERS is obtained for fully charged KERS as well as during braking and under acceleration boosts. The result of the study is an overview of the flywheel bearing loading characteristics caused by vehicle maneuvering, and the vehicle's dynamic response to the induced gyroscopic torques. © 2014 SAE International.",,"Automobiles; Dynamic response; Equations of motion; Flywheels; Maneuverability; Model automobiles; Torque; Wheels; Flywheel energy storage system; Governing equations of motion; Gyroscopic torques; Loading characteristics; Numerical investigations; Vehicle dynamics simulation; Vehicle maneuverings; Vehicle's dynamics; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903479501

Air annealing of as spun fibers at 1000 °C yielded the single phase perovskite fibers having diameter ∼600 nm - 800 nm. Both the ac and dc electrical measurements were carried out at temperatures from 200 K - 420 K. The complex impedance plane plots revealed a single semicircular arc which indicates the interfacial effect due to grain boundaries of fibers. The dielectric properties obey the Maxwell-Wagner theory of interfacial polarization. In dc transport study at low voltages, data show Ohmic like behavior followed by space charge limited current (SCLC) with traps at higher voltages at all temperatures (200 K - 420 K). Trap density in our fibers system is Nt = 6.27 × 1017 /cm3. Conduction mechanism in the sample is governed by 3-D variable range hopping (VRH) from 200 K - 300 K. The localized density of states were found to be N(EF) = 5.51 × 1021 eV -1 cm-3 at 2 V. Other VRH parameters such as hopping distance (Rhop) and hopping energy (Whop) were also calculated. In the high temperature range of 320 K - 420 K, conductivity follows the Arrhenius law. The activation energy found at 2 V is 0.10 eV. Temperature dependent and higher values of dielectric constant make the perovskite CdTiO3 fibers efficient material for capacitive energy storage devices. © 2014 Author(s).",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903444706

Several options include different types of technologies. However, those who are advocating conventional internal combustion engines are faced with the fact that fossil fuels are limited. Others favor hydrogen fuel as the solution for the future, either in combination with combustion engines or as an energy carrier for fuel cells. In any case, the production and storage of hydrogen is an ongoing challenge of numerous research works. Finally, there are battery-electric or hybrid propulsion systems in use, gaining more and more popularity worldwide. Ongoing advances in power electronics help to improve control systems within automotive applications. New developed or designed components enable more efficient system architectures and control. This paper includes a detailed comparison of different electric drive technologies, e.g. a DC motor, an asynchronous and synchronous motor in battery-electric or hybrid drivetrain configurations. Parameters for future drive architectures, such as high torque and power output, high system efficiency, low mass, low energy consumption, very low exhaust gas emissions, and low costs are introduced and discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of different drivetrain configurations are specified, evaluated, and discussed. Additionally, a selection of advances in power electronics is listed and described in detail. Practical examples of electric drive systems are given explicitly and conclusions for future development are made.

We address the problem of distributed frequency synchronization of several isolated microgrids, each one described by a linear-time continuous system, composed by different types of generators, whose outputs are measured and sent through a communication infrastructure. We assume that each microgrid possesses renewable resources with storage capabilities that helps to improve stability of the network when small damping ratio is considered. Thus, using the smart grid communication infrastructure and the data flow through the network, we propose a cooperative control strategy based on the consensus algorithm that simultaneously manages the turbine governor input and the amount of energy that the storage devices have to absorb/inject from/into the grid. Nevertheless, physical constraints need to be included, which can be modeled using saturation non-linearities, and conditions to assure synchronization even with saturation are obtained based on multi-agent systems. Additionally, we consider that sensor measurements are sampled and we extend the results of frequency synchronization with saturation to the case of control discretization and sampling-period independence is demonstrated using passivity concepts. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the objective of improving the conventional power systems with the capabilities of decentralized generation and advanced control has conflicted with the present power system infrastructure and thus a profound change has necessitated in the current power grids. To that end, the concept of smart grid has been introduced at the last decades in order to accomplish the modernization of the power grid while incorporating various capabilities such as advanced metering, monitoring and self-healing to the systems. Among the various advanced components in smart grid structure, ""smart home"" is of vital importance due to its handling difficulties caused by the stochastic behaviors of inhabitants. However, limited studies concerning the implementation of smart homes have so far been reported in the literature. Motivated by this need, this paper investigates an experimental smart home with various renewable energy sources and storage systems in terms of several aspects such as in-home energy management, appliances control and power flow. Furthermore, the study represents one of the very first attempts to evaluate the contribution of power forecasting of renewable energy sources on the performance of smart home concepts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Demand side management; Distributed energy sources; Renewable energy forecasting; Smart grid; Smart home","Distributed power generation; Forecasting; Intelligent buildings; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Stochastic systems; Automation; Distributed power generation; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Intelligent buildings; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Demand side managements; Distributed energy sources; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Smart homes; Automation; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903213382

This paper presents a methodology to optimally size a photovoltaic (PV) stand-alone system with battery storage. Its originality resides in taking into account the stochastic nature of the solar radiation in the sizing process by using statistical techniques. The optimal design is based on the inverse conception, which gives the optimum number of photovoltaic panels and the optimum number of batteries. The inputs of the optimization process are only the radiation data and the load demand. The radiation data of the location were synthesized by the statistical technique from which the average hourly PV power of the day of each month was determined. A photovoltaic panel that most fits the site was chosen among a list of four panels with different characteristics to be afterward deployed for sizing. The loss of power supply probability (LPSP), related to the system reliability was used to evaluate the efficiency of the sizing methodology. The number of PV panel and batteries obtained from the system simulation during 24h presented an acceptable rate of load satisfaction.","Distribution function; LPSP; Optimal sizing; Stand-alone PV system; Statistical approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903179227

Many alternatives are being assessed to solve or at least to cease the negative effects of these issues.Vast amount of methane in the form of gas hydrates is stored in several deep marine sediments and in permafrost region. Therefore, production of methane from hydrates may postpone the former problem for significant period of time. Although several production mechanisms like depressurization, thermal treatment and inhibitor injection have been proposed, recovery of methane from hydrate bearing sediments is still an issue of debate. Also, it is widely believed that CO2 emissions due to fossil fuel combustion and transportation are mainly responsible for the increase in the global temperature level. Therefore, several options are being evaluated to diminish the anthropogenic CO2 emissions like storing the captured CO2 in another domain of the planet for example, the geosphere. At this point, the injection of CO2 into CH4 hydrate bearing sediments deserves particular attention as this technique may enable integration of CO2 storage with production from CH4 hydrates.In this study, gaseous CO2 was injected into the unconsolidated sand pack system which includes 30% methane hydrate saturation at free CH4 excess conditions. After the CO2 injection, cyclic behaviors at the pressure gauges were observed for approximately 6h that may indicate CH4-CO2 swap within hydrate cages. It was thought that the cyclic behaviors in the pressure gauges indicate CO2-CH4 swap within the hydrate cages. Upward and downward trends in cycles results from the gaseous CH4 that was leaving the cages and gaseous CO2 that was stabilizing the cages respectively. Swap process was confirmed by estimating the gas compositions at the instant of CO2 injection and by measuring via gas chromatography analyses after the swap process. As a result of the swap process, it was estimated that 86.3% of the CO2 filled the hydrate cages. After stabilization, system was left to dissociate for several days and samples taken from the cell at different time intervals were analyzed via gas chromatography in order to gain an insight on hydrate distribution in porous media after the swap process. Analyses showed that, amount of free CO2 in the cell were increasing gradually reached a peak value and then decreased. This suggests that, CH4-CO2 swap process mostly took place at the surface of the system as the injected CO2 initially accumulated at the external part of the unconsolidated sand pack system and the area where the reaction took place was maximum. The results obtained from this research proposed that the injection of gaseous CO2 causes dissociation of methane hydrate also samples that were taken during the dissociation process may give some insight about the probable hydrate distribution at the system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Porous media","Carbon dioxide; Dissociation; Fossil fuels; Gas chromatography; Greenhouse gases; Hydration; Methane; Porous materials; Pressure gages; Sediments; Submarine geology; Alternative energy source; Deep marine sediments; Dissociation process; Fossil fuel combustion; Gas chromatography analysis; Hydrate bearing sediments; Primary energy source; Production mechanisms; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903175122

Two solvent concepts (aMDEA/MDEA and Selexol) and a low-temperature concept are modelled and assessed, taking different raw natural gases and natural gas product requirements into consideration. The analyses and comparisons of the concepts and cases consider nine criteria in order to include both energy efficiencies and compactness.The assessment shows that acid gas removal using aMDEA/MDEA technology seems to perform well in terms of energy efficiency, volume and weight for low CO2 removal. However, for high CO2 content or strong polishing requirements, the chemical solvent technology loses its efficiency in terms of weight and volume. The assessment shows that the Selexol concept is an inefficient option in terms of energy efficiency, volume and weight, especially when large quantities of CO2 have to be removed from the gas stream. The assessment also shows that the low-temperature technology can be a compact and energy-efficient option, both in the case of strong polishing requirements and high bulk removal of CO2. However, the higher the amount of CO2 to be removed, the less energy efficient is the low-temperature technology.The case evaluation underlines the fact that the aMDEA/MDEA solvent concept exhibits the best or close to the best key performance indicators (KPIs) for all parameters for the RNG1Pipe case (raw natural gas specification 1 to pipeline quality specification) and therefore appears to be the best technology option. For this case, the two other technologies are slightly less energy efficient than the aMDEA/MDEA, but both are significantly less compact. For the RNG1 LNG (raw natural gas specification 1 to LNG quality specification) case, the aMDEA/MDEA and low-temperature concepts have similar KPIs. The chemical solvent technology, however, is slightly more energy efficient and compact and would therefore be preferred for the RNG1 LNG case. Finally, the RNG2 Pipe (raw natural gas specification 2 to pipeline quality specification) case shows that the low-temperature technology can be a compact option for acid gas removal, which is a critical factor in the case of offshore applications for both the equipment costs and the weight constraints on the platform. Despite its lower energy efficiency, it is therefore likely that the low-temperature technology will be selected in the RNG2 Pipe case. This choice is strengthened by some regulations which recommend that solvents such as MDEA and aMDEA should be phased out for offshore applications, as is seen, e.g. in Norway. In addition, if stricter regulations are also enforced for onshore applications, this might also argue in favour of the low-temperature technology or other chemical solvents that are otherwise less efficient than aMDEA/MDEA.Finally, the potential of hybrid concepts is discussed and suggested for future works, in order to combine the advantages of the different technologies, such as the energy-efficient performances of the aMDEA/MDEA concept and the compactness of the low-temperature concept. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Acid Gas Removal (AGR); AGR; AMDEA; BTEX; CCS; Chemical solvent; Dimethyl ethers of propylene glycol; Evaluation; FPSO; HOCNF; LNG; Low-temperature; MDEA; MS; Natural gas; Physical solvent; Pipe; PSA; RNG; Transport and storage","Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Chemical polishing; Energy efficiency; Floating liquefied natural gas; Floating production storage and offloading; Gases; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas; Natural gas transportation; Offshore oil well production; Offshore pipelines; Offshore technology; Pipe; Quality control; Solvents; Specifications; Acid gas removal; AMDEA; BTEX; Chemical solvents; Evaluation; HOCNF; Low temperatures; MDEA; Physical solvent; Propylene glycols; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903129980

New technological options such as passive buildings, bio-methane injection into grids, small scale CHP with heat storage and PV driven heat pumps for heat provision alter common strategies to supply larger settlements. As energy options become more diverse, heat integration of industry into cities becomes important from economic and ecological considerations. Stabilising distribution grids in the face of diverging supply and demand profiles will further complicate planning of smart city projects. In the face of these challenges, innovative planning tools will gain importance. This paper will discuss using the P-Graph method in its application to sustainable technology systems. This method will be used to generate optimal energy systems linking industry to smart cities and to integrate innovative energy technologies into such systems. The Sustainable Process Index will be used to evaluate these systems from the ecological sustainability point of view. This sustainability measure is particularly well suited to differentiate between conventional fossil based and renewable source based energy systems. A real life case study of the application of these methods to the challenge of designing the optimal energy system for a smart city will be discussed in the paper.

Requirements taken into the account during optimization are: local loads, the level of microgrid autonomy from the utility grid, technical characteristics and cost of components, lifetime of equipment, available area and space, impact on the environment. The optimization resides on the past meteorological data for the specific location (wind speed and solar insulation). Procedures for selecting, dimensioning and placing of renewable energy systems (RES) for location-specific microgrids in urban environments are assessed with weather forecasting. The problem of storage systems is the increase in cost of distributed RES, making them, in market terms, less economically viable. This storage characteristic is even more highlighted in microgrids that need sophisticated and costly power electronics and communication systems to manage power flows from various sources to different controllable and uncontrollable loads.

In transition to a low carbon economy, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies represent another way to reduce CO2 emissions. Hydrogen can be produced from various feedstocks, the most important being based on fossil fuels (natural gas and coal). This paper investigates the techno-economic and environmental aspects of hydrogen production based on natural gas reforming conversion with and without carbon capture. As CO2 capture options, gas - liquid absorption and chemical looping were evaluated. The evaluated plant concepts generate 300MWth hydrogen (based on hydrogen LHV) with purity higher than 99.95 % (vol.), suitable to be used both in petro-chemical applications as well as for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells for mobile applications. For the designs with CCS, the carbon capture rate is about 70 % for absorption-based scheme while for chemical looping-based system is &gt;99 %. Special emphasis is put in the paper on the assessment of various plant configurations and process integration issues using CAPE techniques. The mass and energy balances have been used furthermore for techno-economic and environmental impact assessments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon Capture; Chemical looping; Hydrogen production; Natural gas reforming; Storage (CCS)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902980069

This method was applied to the perspective PCM material of Ge2Sb 2Te5 with different Bi contents (0, 0.5, 1, 3 mass%) for defining the kinetic triplet. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to carry out elemental and phase analysis of the deposited films. Differential scanning calorimetry at eight different heating rates was used to investigate kinetics of thermally induced transformations in materials. Dependences of activation energies of crystallization (E a) on the degree of conversion were estimated by model-free Ozawa-Flynn-Wall, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Tang and Starink methods. The obtained values of E a were quite close for all of these methods. The reaction models of the phase transitions were derived with using of the model-fitting Coats-Redfern method. In order to find pre-exponential factor A at progressive conversion values, we used values of E a already estimated by the model-free isoconversional method. It was established that the crystallization processes in thin films investigated are most likely describes by the second and third-order reactions models. Obtained kinetic triplet allowed predicting transition and storage times of the PCM cells. It was found that thin films of Ge 2Sb2Te5 + 0.5 mass% Bi composition can provide the switching time of the phase change memory cell less than 1 ns.

Mimicking this process in vitro will lead to the formation of new substances that would impact many areas including energy production and storage, biomaterials and implants, and drug delivery. The considerable structural diversity of peptides makes them appealing building blocks for self-assembly in vitro. This paper describes the self-assembly of three aromatic dipeptides containing an azide moiety: H-Phe(4-azido)-Phe(4- azido)-OH, H-Phe(4-azido)-Phe-OH, and H-Phe-Phe(4-azido)-OH. The peptide H-Phe(4-azido)-Phe(4-azido)-OH self-assembled into porous spherical structures, whereas the peptides H-Phe(4-azido)-Phe-OH and H-Phe-Phe(4-azido)-OH did not form any ordered structures under the examined experimental conditions. The azido group of the peptide can serve as a photo cross-linking agent upon irradiation with UV light. To examine the effect of this group and its activity on the self-assembled structures, we irradiated the assemblies in solution for different time periods. Using electron microscopy, we determined that the porous spherical assemblies formed by the peptide H-Phe(4-azido)-Phe(4-azido)-OH underwent a structural change upon irradiation. In addition, using FT-IR, we detected the chemical change of the peptide azido group. Moreover, using indentation experiments with atomic force microscopy, we showed that the Young's modulus of the spherical assemblies increased after 20 min of irradiation with UV light. Overall, irradiating the solution of the peptide assemblies containing the azido group resulted in a change both in the morphology and mechanical properties of the peptide-based structures. These ordered assemblies or their peptide monomer building blocks can potentially be incorporated into other peptide assemblies to generate stiffer and more stable materials.

The performance of micro-cogeneration is assessed through electrical and thermal efficiencies obtained from recently published performance analyses. The results indicate that by using the suggested concept, the energy demands of the case building can be met in cold climates and a good energy match can be obtained.

The initiative is based on an effort to integrate non-conventional renewable energies (NCRE) through distributed generation (DG) projects intended for remote and rural communities in Chile and South America, where electricity supply is both expensive and often times unreliable. This may be due to equipment malfunction, line faults and/or harsh climatic conditions or other natural phenomena like earthquakes, all of which can undermine the electric power distribution networks. Here a systems thinking (ST) and cybernetics approach is employed which looks at grid-connected microgrids supplying power to local loads as intrinsically dynamic, complex adaptive systems (CAS). Moreover, such systems can be viewed and approached as a complex sociotechnical system, wherein the energy users ought to play a crucial role as 'active loads' within the sustainable block to which the grid-tie microgrid is coupled. Building upon this theoretical framework, a set of coordination and supervisory control strategies for renewable microgrids is presented based on homeostatic control (HC) principles introduced by Schweppe et al. Homeostatic control of power systems. In: Fourth energy monitoring and control system conference. Norfolk, VA: November; 1979. The approach is intended to study and eventually develop new forms of sustainable renewable energy technologies (RETs) for DG of electricity and heat, working in parallel with the grid and offering new choices and benefits to energy users everywhere. A concrete theoretical model is proposed and the algorithms depicting the strategies are explained and compared through simulation analysis. Unlike what is available in the literature on sustainability, and looking at what is missing in regards to HMS as sustainable energy systems (SES), this paper offers an entirely new and significant perspective in terms of design and operation of such systems. First the concepts of sustainability and SES applied to HMS are explored, finding that the large majority of the mainstream analysis reviewed on the subject is focused on socio-economic, environmental, and regulatory issues rather than on the systemic, technical and operational aspects of such systems, as this paper does, and how HC, energy efficiency (EE), and a novel approach to energy supply and consumption equilibrium based on homeostasis can help build more sustainable HMS. Results are presented which confirm the hypotheses underlying the strategies employed and the model predictability, showing that SES are indeed possible and feasible. Discussion and recommendations are also offered stressing the fact that sustainability is essentially a systemic property and operational in nature, rather than explained by exogenous factors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Built-In sustainability; Energy efficiency; Homeostatic control; Renewable microgrids; Supply and consumption equilibrium criteria; Sustainable energy systems; Thriftiness","Complex networks; Electric energy storage; Electric lines; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Consumption equilibrium; Homeostatic control; Micro grid; Sustainable energy systems; Thriftiness; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902785690

The MMP value range of -136 to -140. mV has been considered optimal for maximum ATP production for all living organisms. Even small changes from the above range result in a large fall in ATP production and a large increase in ROS production. The resulting bioenergetic deregulation is considered as the causative agent for numerous major human diseases. Normalization of MMP value improves mitochondrial function and gives excellent therapeutic results. In order for a systematic effective treatment of these diseases to be developed, a detailed knowledge of the mechanism of MMP production is absolutely necessary. However, despite the long-standing research efforts, a concrete mechanism for MMP production has not been found yet. The present paper proposes a novel mechanism of MMP production based on new considerations underlying the function of the two basic players of MMP production, the electron transport chain (ETC) and the F1F0 ATP synthase. Under normal conditions, MMP is almost exclusively produced by the electron flow through ETC complexes I-IV, creating a direct electric current that stops in subunit II of complex IV and gradually charges MMP. However, upon ETC dysfunction F1F0 ATP synthase reverses its action and starts to hydrolyze ATP. ATP hydrolysis further produces electric energy which is transferred, in the form of a direct electric current, from F1 to F0 where is used to charge MMP. This new model is expected to redirect current experimental research on mitochondrial bioenergetics and indicate new therapeutic schemes for mitochondrial disorders. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"adenine nucleotide translocase; cytochrome c oxidase; hydrogen; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); water; adenosine triphosphate; multienzyme complex; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; article; bioenergy; biological activity; cell function; cell viability; disorders of mitochondrial functions; electric current; electrical potential parameters; electricity; electron transport; energy conservation; human; mitochondrial membrane potential; oxidation reduction reaction; oxygen consumption; protein hydrolysis; proton transport; respiratory chain; biological model; biosynthesis; energy metabolism; hydrolysis; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; physiology; Adenosine Triphosphate; Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Hydrolysis; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Models, Biological; Proton-Translocating ATPases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902765798

In summer, water temperature exceeds 40 °C during daytime, whereas in winter it drops to as low as 10 °C during night times and early mornings. The objectives of the study were: (1) to reduce the peak water temperatures to comfortable levels for safer domestic consumption during summer, and (2) to save excessive electric energy required to warm up the water during winter. Palm leaves and fronds were used to wrap a prototype tank; the water temperatures were measured continuously and compared to those in a reference unwrapped tank. The efficiency of the insulators was assessed based on the relative amplitude ratio of the water and ambient air temperatures, in addition to the time lag between the times of temperature extremes of air and water in the tanks. The results of the summer experiments indicate that the water temperature fluctuations in the palm-insulated tank are 75 % less than those in the reference tank. The time lag of the peak water temperatures in the palm-insulated tank was two to three times longer than that in the reference tank. Sprinkling of the palm leaves with small amounts of water resulted in reducing the peak water temperatures by 7 °C compared to the reference tank. During winter, the results of the experiments indicate the estimated electric energy saved is on average 28 %. © 2014 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.","Comfortable water temperature; Domestic electric energy savings; Domestic water conservation; Overhead storage water tanks; Palm-based thermal insulator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902664344

Further to the assumption of Euler-Bernoulli beams, dynamic parameters are needed. Equations of a given beam structure subjected to free un-damped and/or damped vibration are established. The natural frequency responses of the first five modes are obtained from both approaches, and then compared with those obtained from a finite element model approach, taking into account different slenderness and boundary conditions. The result shows good agreement. An extension to the equivalent physical parameter homogenization method using the behaviour law in nonlinear state is presented here. Thus, the homogenization is extended to an elastically equivalent model elaboration for a system having an elastic-plastic and bilinear behaviour. The aim is to use analytical expressions from an elastically equivalent model for a nonlinear system of multilayer beam type to obtain the new corrected dynamic parameter. Based on the ductility factor method combined with the secant method that uses a substitute structure and secant stiffness to account for nonlinear behaviour, we developed a formula using global effective flexural modulus E*s, the equivalent mass density ρ*, as well as the two types of viscous damping parameter (these types include a viscous resistance to transverse displacement C* of the beam and a viscous resistance to straining of the beam material C*S which can be incorporated into the formula without difficulty. The nonlinear analysis shows that the degradation of rigidity decreases the frequencies response curve, which tends to increase the vibration periods giving an additional storage space for the structure capacity to accumulate displacements of a higher degree compared to those of the elastic case. The importance of the nonlinearity assumption is shown, which fits better with the real mechanical performances of the structure. © 2014 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.","Composite; Damping factors of Rayleigh; Ductility factor; Euler Bernoulli beam; Global equivalent mechanical-geometrical properties; Global equivalent physical properties; Homogenization; Law of elastic-plastic and bilinear behaviour; Vibration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902664337

In Norway, between 12 and 17% of a national target to increase the renewable energy share by 14 TWh can be sustainably met by mobilizing straw feedstocks. However, straw must compete in an energy market with a vast availability of forest-based woody biomass, and a clean electrical energy pool, 95% of which is derived from hydropower. The performance of seven local straw supply chains was monitored over a period of 3 years to estimate straw yields, supply costs, operating costs of the heating plants, and to synthesiz experiences on supply solutions. Storage facilities for bales constituted the largest single cost in the supply chain. Square bales were both more economical to use and required considerably less plant management time, making them more preferable than round bales for small-scale utilization. The total cost of straw firing averaged out in the range of 36-42 € MWh-1, which is 40-46% of the current cost of electric heating (∼90 € MWh-1). The positive economic outcome provides a good incentive to roll out many more similar plants although heat pumps could be expected to reduce the margin in some applications.

ILs not only have found applications in classical areas of knowledge but also are important candidates to solve classical problems within several societal challenges, such as clean and efficient energy, through the development of a broad swath of energy technologies, such as advanced batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells, double-layer capacitors, actuators, fuel cells, thermo-cells, and water splitting, essentially related to highly efficient carbon capture and storage technologies and resource efficiency to date. This review focuses on the application of IL methodologies to solve critical pharmaceutical problems, in particular, the low solubility and thus bioavailability of pharmaceutical compounds and the presence of polymorphs, which severely hamper the efficacy of important commercially available drugs. The development of strategies to use ILs as carriers of pharmaceutical active compounds is an extremely promising and wide avenue.

Glycosides contain aglycons attached by a ß-glycosidic bond to C1 of the saccharide moiety. Glycosylation is one of the mechanisms maintaining cellular homeostasis through the regulation of the level, biological activity, and subcellular distribution of the glycosylated compounds. The glycosides play various functions in plant cells, such as high-energy donors, or signalling molecules, and are involved in biosynthesis of cell walls. Plant cells exhibit structural and functional diversity of UGT proteins. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains more than 100 genes encoding GTases, which belong to 91 families, and are deposited in the CAZY (Carbohydrate Active enzyme) database (www.cazy.org/GlycosylTransferases.html). The largest UGT1 class is divided into 14 subfamilies (A-N), and includes proteins containing highly conserved 44-amino acid PSPG (Plant Secondary Product Glycosyltransferase) motif at the C-terminus. The PSPG motif is involved in the binding of UDP-sugar donors to the enzyme. UGT1's catalyze the biosynthesis of both ester-type and ether-type conjugates of plant hormones (phytohormones). Conjugation of the phytohormones is an important mechanism that regulates the concentration of physiological active hormone levels during growth and development of plants. Glycoconjugation of phytohormones is widespread in the plant kingdom and all known phytohormones are able to form these conjugates. Most plant hormone conjugates do not indicate physiological activity, but rather are involved in transport, storage and degradation of the phytohormones. UDPG-dependent glycosyltransferases possess high substrate specificity, even within a given class of phytohormones. In many cases, the phenotype of plants is strongly affected by loss-of-function mutations in UGT genes. In this paper, advances in the isolation and characterization of glycosyltransferases of all plant hormones: auxin, brassinosteroids, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid, jasmonates, and salicylate is described.","Auxin; Brassinosteroid; Cytokinin; Glycosylation; Phytohormones; UDP-glycosyltransferases","abscisic acid; auxin; brassinosteroid; cytokinin; gibberellin; glycosyltransferase; jasmonic acid; phytohormone; salicylic acid; uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid; amino acid sequence; apical meristem; Arabidopsis thaliana; article; biosynthesis; Botrytis cinerea; cytosolic fraction; enantioselectivity; endosperm; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme isolation; enzyme specificity; family; gene expression; glycosylation; homeostasis; hydrogen bond; nonhuman; nucleophilicity; pea; Phaseolus vulgaris; phenotype; plant genome; plant growth; Pseudomonas syringae; RNA interference; stereospecificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902456975

It was found that organoclay was well dispersed in the natural rubber matrix. Curing characteristics of the rubber compound indicated that octadecylamine modification accelerated the vulcanization reaction of natural rubber and caused a higher degree of crosslinking.

In thermo-mechanical analysis, the composites with the 3D woven fabrics as reinforcement showed higher storage modulus. Further improvement in the storage modulus due to addition of fly ash can be explained as the nanoscale dimension of fly ash nanoparticles have got very large surface area which leads to interaction sites and hence efficient load transfer between reinforcing agent and matrix.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of weight loss secondary to bariatric surgery in relation to sCD36 among morbidly obese individuals. Furthermore, we investigated the levels of sCD36 in relation to obesity-related metabolic complications, low-grade inflammation and fat distribution. METHODS: Twenty morbidly obese individuals (body mass index (BMI) 43.0±5.4 kgm-2) with a referral to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were included. Anthropometric measurements and fasting blood samples were collected at a preoperative baseline visit and 3 months after surgery. sCD36 was measured by an in-house assay, whereas insulin sensitivity and the hepatic fat accumulation were estimated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-%S) and liver fat percentage (LF%), respectively. RESULTS: Postoperatively, BMI was reduced by 20% to 34.3±5.2 kgm-2 (P&lt;0.001). sCD36 was reduced by 31% (P=0.001) and improvements were observed in the amount of fat mass (Po0.001), truncal fat mass (Po0.001), circulating triglycerides (P=0.001), HOMA-%S (P=0.007), LF% (P=0.001) and the inflammatory marker high-sensitive C-reactive protein (P=0.005). sCD36 correlated with triglycerides (ρ=0.523, P=0.001) and truncal fat mass (ρ=0.357, P=0.026), and triglycerides were found to be an independent predictor of sCD36. At baseline, participants with the metabolic syndrome had a higher LF% and higher levels of the inflammatory biomarker YKL-40 (P=0.003 and P=0.014) as well as a tendency towards higher levels of sCD36. CONCLUSION: sCD36 was reduced by weight loss and associated with an unhealthy fat accumulation and circulating triglycerides, which support the proposed role of sCD36 as a biochemical marker of obesity-related metabolic complications and risks. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",,"C reactive protein; CD36 antigen; glucose; insulin; plasma protein; protein ykl 40; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; C peptide; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; ykl 40; adult; article; bariatric surgery; body fat distribution; body mass; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; correlation analysis; fat mass; glucose blood level; human; insulin sensitivity; leukocyte; leukocyte count; lipid liver level; metabolic syndrome X; morbid obesity; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; protein blood level; triacylglycerol blood level; weight reduction; anthropometry; Article; bariatric surgery; biochemical analysis; body fat; diet restriction; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; inflammation; lipid homeostasis; lipid storage; metabolic disorder; morbid obesity; Roux Y anastomosis; stomach bypass; therapy effect; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902257688

A class of applications is considered where the device is used as deeply cycled energy storage with significant capacity, absorbing/supplying the whole power flow or its significant component rather than shaving low-energy high-frequency peaks. The analytical derivation of SC behavior is based on simple RC model with parameters taken from a manufacturer datasheet. It is shown that the commonly adopted 'state-of-charge' indication based on terminal voltage only is insufficient to reflect the energy balance for both charging and discharging; hence an alternative definition of 'state-of-energy' is proposed for each direction of energy flow, depending on both instantaneous power and terminal voltage. A simplified quick noniterative sizing procedure is proposed at the expense of a slightly oversized SC. Comprehensive example is provided in order to reinforce the proposed method of analyzing SC performance and demonstrate sizing procedure. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Power and energy capability; sizing; state of energy; supercapacitor (SC)","Electrical engineering; Power electronics; Energy capability; Energy performance; Instantaneous power; sizing; state of energy; Statistical distribution; Supercapacitors; Terminal voltages; Capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902173642

Fifty-four cows were allocated to three diets according to parity and days in milk. Two diets were based on maize silage with (MS+) or without (MS-) supplementation of crushed rapeseed, and the third diet was based on late cut grass silage without supplementation of crushed rapeseed (GS-). Dry matter intake, milk yield and composition were measured. Enteric methane emissions were measured on 24 cows by means of indirect calorimetry. Slurry was collected the last 10 days of the experiment. Ultimate biogas yield, CH4 emissions at different storage temperatures and yield in a thermophilic biogas digester were determined for the three slurries. Dry matter intake was 22.5kg/day on MS- and MS+ which was significantly higher than the 20.7kg/day on GS- Yield of energy corrected milk (ECM) was 2.8 and 2.5kg higher on MS+ compared with GS- and MS-, respectively. Enteric CH4 emissions related to dry matter intake or gross energy intake were highest for GS- Supplementation of crushed rapeseed did not affect enteric CH4 emissions. Ultimate biogas yield and yield of CH4 in the digester were higher for MS+ and MS- than for GS- Storage emissions from slurry increased with increasing storage temperature. The average total CH4 per kg ECM for the three treatments (mean±standard deviation) was 25.3±2.5, 26.8±3.3 and 29.0±4.2L CH4/kg ECM if manure was stored at 10°C, 15°C or 20°C, respectively. When the slurry was digested in a laboratory scale biogas plant, the lowest total CH4 emissions per kg ECM were observed for MS+ (20.5L CH4/ECM) and the highest for GS- (24.3L CH4/ECM) corresponding to the enteric emissions of CH4. It was found that MS+ had a higher yield and a lower milk fat concentration than MS- and GS- Although MS+ had a lower milk fat concentration, the ECM yield was significantly higher for MS+ than for the two other diets. It was furthermore concluded that feed ration induced reductions in enteric methane emissions might be counteracted or complemented by changed methane emissions from slurry storage. The slurry biogas yield was highest (per kg ECM) from cows fed MS+ which also gave the lowest total methane emissions per kg ECM. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Canola; Digestibility; Milk production; Slurry composition; Ultimate biogas","Bos; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902107131

The optical scanning sensor for structural health monitoring proposed is a flexible system that can operate with a coherent or incoherent light emitter source. It is conformable to any kind of structure surfaces and data storage budget thanks to the signal processing stage being embedded into the sensor and does not require additional software processing, which reduces the time and memory spacing requirements for information recording.

An innovative solution as presented in this paper has until now not been comprehensively analyzed. This work presents the solution with the application of a (Photovoltaic) PV generator. The main technological features, in addition to the designing methodology and case study are presented in this paper. The critical period approach has been used for the first time for system sizing. The application of this sizing method provides a high reliability of the proposed system. The obtained results confirm the assumption that the PV generator is a promising energy sustainable solution for urban water supply systems. The service reservoir, which acts as water and energy storage for the proposed system, provides the basis for a sustainable solution of water and energy supply. In accordance with the proposed, the reliability of such system is high. This concept of energy supply operation does not generate any atmospheric emission of greenhouse gases, which contributes significantly to the reduction of the impacts of climate changes.

Additionally, the content of bioactives in SBE was determined. A strong correlation was noted between SBE concentrations in the film and the obtained film thickness. Pullulan film containing SBE was characterized by a smooth surface as well as a uniform and compact internal structure. The study involved an examination of the effectiveness of pullulan coatings containing 24 mg SBE/cm2 on the prolongation of the shelf life of "" Jonagored"" apples. Pullulan coating with SBE was found to offer low antibacterial activity against mesophilic bacteria and good antifungal protection against Rhizopus arrhizus on apple surfaces. This coating also contributed to a reduction in weight losses and lower changes in the color and soluble solids of fruits during storage. Apples with pullulan enriched SBE coating presented better overall preference parameters. Industrial relevance The consumers express an increasing aversion and objections towards an application of chemical means in order to prolong the durability of food products. This prompts food producers to search for new methods of preventing raw materials against harmful microbial activity. Plant extracts, due to their chemical variability, ensure unlimited possibilities of microorganism growth control. An application of natural plant extracts combined with edible coatings for fruit and vegetable durability prolongation may find an acceptance among the consumers. Incorporation of plant extract to edible coating ensures slow release of bioactives on food surface, i.e. at the site of the highest microbiological food changes. Pullulan is a natural polysaccharide, a carrier of small energy amounts, forming glossy, colorless and flavorless films, resistant to oils and impermeable for oxygen.

We draw the Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) for a hydrogen probe molecule inside a Carbon Nano-Tube (CNT): it is shown that the adsorption energy increases with the hard radius of the interaction potential and decreases as the CNT pore enlarges. This is valid just for low-medium pressures, when hydrogen repulsions are negligible. If not, adsorption is driven by H2-H2 hard radius despite all other parameters. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, following the Gibbs Ensemble (GE) in high density conditions, confirm that the thermodynamic equilibrium of an order-disorder phase transition show no changes throughout any of the studied potentials. We also analyse, in the Grand Canonical (GC) ensemble, the geometric and structural characteristics of square lattice bundles of Single Walled Nano Tubes (SWNTs) with regard to their influence on adsorption storage. To do so, we develop a method for independently simulate inner or outer adsorption in infinitely long nanotube lattice systems.

Acute inhibition experiments involved two fill/draw reactors, supplying the biomass, and two sets of batch reactors, which were all fed with the same peptone-meat extract mixture. Each set included a control reactor started without antibiotic addition and parallel reactors with pulse erythromycin additions. RESULTS: Model evaluation of the oxygen uptake rate, chemical oxygen demand and intracellular storage profiles indicated that erythromycin did not affect microbial growth. However, it totally stopped substrate storage and accelerated endogenous respiration. Enhanced endogenous respiration could be explained by higher maintenance energy required for generating specific inactivating enzymes to prevent the toxic effects of erythromycin. CONCLUSION: Major impact was partial obstruction/binding of available substrate for microbial utilization, suggesting uncompetitive inhibition. The present study is unique in emphasizing the increase in maintenance-energy requirements of microbial cultures upon erythromycin exposure, by respirometric and modeling approaches. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.","Activated sludge; Degradation; Kinetics; Modelling; Pharmaceuticals","Batch reactors; Chemical oxygen demand; Degradation; Drug products; Enzyme kinetics; Maintenance; Models; Substrates; Activated sludge; Control reactors; Endogenous respiration; Microbial culture; Oxygen uptake rates; Parallel reactors; Substrate utilization; Uncompetitive inhibitions; Antibiotics; erythromycin; oxygen; activated sludge; article; biodegradation; biotransformation; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; energy; growth rate; hydrolysis; microbial growth; microbial respiration; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; sludge; substrate induced respiration; substrate utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901693536

Rain gauges however measure the rain falling on an extremely small proportion of the catchment and the areal rainfall obtained from these point measurements are consequently substantially uncertain. These uncertainties in areal rainfall estimation are generally ignored and the need to assess their impact on catchment modelling and water resources assessment is therefore imperative. A method that stochastically generates daily areal rainfall from point rainfall using multiplicative perturbations as a means of dealing with these uncertainties is developed and tested on the Berg catchment in the Western Cape of South Africa. The differences in areal rainfall obtained by alternately omitting some of the rain gauges are used to obtain a population of plausible multiplicative perturbations. Upper bounds on the applicable perturbations are set to prevent the generation of unrealistically large rainfall and to obtain unbiased stochastic rainfall. The perturbations within the set bounds are then fitted into probability density functions to stochastically generate the perturbations to impose on areal rainfall. By using 100 randomly-initialized calibrations of the AWBM catchment model and Sequent Peak Analysis, the effects of incorporating areal rainfall uncertainties on storage-yield-reliability analysis are assessed. Incorporating rainfall uncertainty is found to reduce the required storage by up to 20%. Rainfall uncertainty also increases flow-duration variability considerably and reduces the median flow-duration values by an average of about 20%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Areal rainfall; Multipliers; Reliability; Storage; Uncertainty; Yield","Catchments; Energy storage; Frequency multiplying circuits; Gages; Probability density function; Rain gages; Reliability; Runoff; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Water resources; Catchment modeling; Catchment modelling; Rainfall estimations; Rainfall uncertainties; Stochastic rainfalls; Uncertainty; Water resources assessment; Yield; Rain; catchment; estimation method; hydrological modeling; probability density function; rainfall; raingauge; reliability analysis; resource assessment; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; water resource; water storage; water yield; Berg Basin; South Africa; Western Cape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901690119

In CM applications, each sensor node transmits periodically its sensed data to the sink node, while in event-detection driven (EDD) applications, once an event occurs, it is reported to the sink node. Hence, CM applications entail much higher energy consumption since all nodes are actively transmitting information much longer than typical EDD applications. Furthermore, in highly dense WSNs, the energy consumption is even higher. As such, the use of autonomous devices that provide a constant energy supply is becoming relevant for these environments. In this work, we propose to take advantage of the electromagnetic waves found in the radio-electric spectrum in order to supply the energy to each node in the network. To this end, the antenna and the storage and amplifications system for such device are designed. Additionally, the performance of dense CM WSN is studied using a Markov chain in order to calculate the lifetime of the system. © 2014 Cortés-Sánchez et al.; licensee Springer.","Antenna design; Markov analysis; Voltage multiplier; Wireless sensor networks","Antennas; Digital storage; Electric power systems; Electromagnetic waves; Energy utilization; Markov processes; Wireless sensor networks; Antennas; Circular waveguides; Digital storage; Electric power systems; Electromagnetic waves; Energy utilization; Markov processes; Sensor nodes; Antenna design; Autonomous devices; Continuous monitoring; Event detection; Markov analysis; Supervised areas; Voltage multipliers; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Electric spectrum; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901638503

While a transport network usually already exists, custom-built terminals are often not available. A reliable identification of potential energy wood terminal (EWT) locations requires the consideration of spatial information and the preferences of stakeholders. To meet these requirements, a spatial multicriteria decision analysis model was developed.The model framework consists of three steps. (1) An exclusion analysis eliminates unsuitable areas. (2) The performance of suitable areas is evaluated by applying fuzzy set theory and by involving experts who assign their preferences via the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The combination of spatial data and the preferences of users results in a Suitability Index map. (3) A pre-defined grid transforms the suitable areas into potential EWT points. Planned terminals were evaluated if they meet the pre-defined threshold values. For all spatial analyses, geographic information systems technology was used.The model was demonstrated in Styria (Austria). Infrastructure and phytosanitary risks have been identified as the most important evaluation criteria for selecting EWTs, whereas land use and nature protection have been identified as negligible. Only 18% of Styria, or almost 300,000ha, were classified as potential storage areas. In particular, coniferous forests and alpine areas with steep terrain and high snow cover duration reduced the original study area dramatically. Therefore, more than 50% of the land is potentially suitable only in the most southeastern part of the province. In this region, hilly terrain and broadleaved forests dominate, which are not excluded from storing fuel wood because of phytosanitary risks. The application of a pre-defined grid achieved 82 potential EWT points for the total area of Styria. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","AHP; Energy wood; Fuzzy set; Spatial analysis; Storage; Terminal","Decision making; Decision theory; Digital storage; Energy storage; Forestry; Fuel storage; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Land use; Maps; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Snow; Terminals (electric); Wood; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Broad-leaved forests; Energy wood; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Snow cover durations; Spatial analysis; Spatial informations; Utilization of fuel; Spatial variables measurement; decision analysis; energy policy; forest resource; fuzzy mathematics; location theory; multicriteria analysis; spatial analysis; stakeholder; wood; Decision Theory; Forestry; GIS; Maps; Austria; Styria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901631781

A significant effect of solar gains was noticed in massive external walls as well as roof structures in sunny days from March until September. However, modern lightweight materials lack the thermal inertia to store energy. An idea to utilize the latent heat of phase change materials (PCMs) inside the insulation of a light-weight roof structure enables to overcome this problem. The idea is supported with a principal example of the diurnal performance of a metal sheet roof structure as well as comparative calculation of the energies consumed and gained. The results of the current study show that PCMs have potential in the future application of lightweight roof structures. In general, efficient solar solutions still need to be developed in order to store energy in summer and to release it in winter.","10-year data; Calculation of heat losses and gains; Phase change materials (PCMs); Temperature distribution within a structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901472400

Remarkable differences in the energy consumption between the alternative methods were also found. Grain crimping showed the lowest energy consumption, but the effect of the used additive and especially the storage system was large. A suitable option for different farm animal species can be found among these methods, and the limitations, when they exist, are set rather by the feeding technology than the nutritive value of the preserved grain.","Acid preservation; Agriculture; Airtight preservation; Energy consumption; Grain crimping; Grain preservation; Hot air grain drying",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901465617

Integration of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) with solar energy collection devices has the potential of making solar energy available on demand. Thermal energy can be stored in a bed of rocks at temperatures suitable for applications like cooking, boiling space heating, etc. During charging, temperature stratification is observed in the bed. In a stratified system, if the heat is used immediately, then it is possible to extract heat at reasonably high temperature from the top. For cases where the system is to be used after sometime (later at night or the following morning), the high temperature heat at the top is observed to degrade as the system tries to establish thermal equilibrium irrespective of the bed height. The average rate of heat loss from the TES unit to the ambient is found to increase with increasing average bed temperatures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Four different scenarios are implemented for the discharging process, in the effort to cover situations typically encountered in practical applications, determined by either the initial temperature distribution in the tank (uniform or stratified) or the temporal evolution of the process (continuous or intermittent). Two structurally different computer codes based on the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method were employed. The results of the two codes were found in very good agreement between them and independent of the sub-grid turbulence model used, ensuring the validity of the simulation results. A detailed view of the time evolution of the flow and temperature fields inside the tank was obtained, and parameters such as the thermocline thickness, entropy generation rate and exergy were calculated to quantify the mixing mechanism in the store. The gravity current developing from the incoming cold flow at the floor of the tank, its subsequent reflection on the opposite vertical wall and the interaction between the reverse flow and the incoming flow were analysed by incorporating elements from gravity currents and jet theory. New coherent flow structures were discovered in the thermocline region, which appear in the form of cells which follow the thermocline in both its upward and side movement, in a manifestation of internal waves along the thermocline. A major finding of the above analysis was that the discharging process can be divided into two distinct phases characterized by a different rate of development of the thermocline thickness. The importance of the intrusion region at the very early times of the process and its influence to the mixing resulting from the overall process was demonstrated. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the battery cells are never fully identical due to the fabrication process, surrounding environment factors and differences between the cells tend to grow if no measures are taken. In order to have a high performance battery system, the battery cells should be continuously balanced for maintain the variation between the cells as small as possible. Without an appropriate balancing system, the individual cell voltages will differ over time and battery system capacity will decrease quickly. These issues will limit the electric range of the electric vehicle (EV) and some cells will undergo higher stress, whereby the cycle life of these cells will be shorter. Quite a lot of cell balancing/equalization topologies have been previously proposed. These balancing topologies can be categorized into passive and active balancing. Active topologies are categorized according to the active element used for storing the energy such as capacitor and/or inductive component as well as controlling switches or converters. This paper proposes an intelligent battery management system (BMS) including a battery pack charging and discharging control with a battery pack thermal management system. The BMS user input/output interfacing. The battery balancing system is based on battery pack modularization architecture. The proposed modularized balancing system has different equalization systems that operate inside and outside the modules. Innovative single switched capacitor (SSC) control strategy is proposed to balance betweenthe battery cells in the module (inside module balancing, IMB). Novel utilization of isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter (IBC) is proposed to balance between the modules with the aid of the EV auxiliary battery (AB). Finally an experimental step-up has been implemented for the validation of the proposed balancing system. © 2014 by the authors.","Battery balancing; Battery management system (BMS); Cell equalization; Isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter (IBC); MATLAB/Simulink; Single switched capacitor (SSC)","Automobile manufacture; Charging (batteries); DC-DC converters; Electric batteries; Equalizers; Modular construction; Secondary batteries; Topology; Battery Management; Bidirectional DC/DC converters; Charging and discharging controls; Fabrication process; MATLAB /simulink; Surrounding environment; Switched capacitor; Thermal management systems; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901388700

This development is related to the target of 20% renewable energy share in the primary energy consumption. Thus it is very important to increase the value of fresh wood materials by application of drying technologies. Drying allows increasing the efficiency and flexibility of combustion, transportation, and storage processes. The goal of this research is to study wood chip drying process in low temperature conditions as a promising solution for the use of low exergy energy sources, such as solar energy, geothermal, and waste heat. Low temperature drying processes typically require high parasitic consumption of electrical energy that is required to provide the air change in the wood chip body, but allows reduction of heat loss. This study was developed to collect experimental information required for designing, optimization and operation of low temperature dryers. Experimental setup was used to study wood chip drying process in controlled laboratory conditions. Air pressure loss is settled as the dependent variable. Thickness of wood chip layer and airflow rate were changed between the experiments. A comprehensive analysis of the obtained monitoring data is carried out.","Biomass dryer; Low potential thermal energy; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901386670

One of the most promising and abundant of these sources is hydrogen. Firstly, the use of current fossil fuels is discussed focusing on the emissions and economic sides to emphasize the need for a new, cleaner and renewable fuel with particular reference to hydrogen as a suitable possible alternative. Hydrogen properties, production and storage methods are then reviewed along with its suitability from the economical point of view. Finally, a cost analysis for the use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is carried out to illustrate the benefits of its use as a replacement for diesel. The outcome of this cost analysis shows that 98% of the capital expenditure is consumed by the equipment, and 68.3% of the total cost of the equipment is spent on the solar photovoltaic cells. The hydrogen plant is classified as a large investment project because of its high initial cost which is about 1 billion US$; but this is justified because hydrogen is produced in a totally green way. When hydrogen is used as a fuel, no harmful emissions are obtained. © 2014 Harbin Engineering University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","cost analysis; hydrogen fuel; hydrogen production; hydrogen properties; hydrogen storage; inland waterway units; sustainable alternative energy sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901367520

The particle size, sample preparation and storage, sample weight, nitrogen flow rate, relative humidity, and sample history were varied in order to evaluate the effect of these factors and to more accurately interpret the data obtained from such analysis. It was determined that comparable kinetic parameters can be obtained in both isothermal and nonisothermal mode. However, dehydration activation energy values obtained in nonisothermal mode showed variation with conversion degree because of different rate-limiting step energy at higher temperature. Moreover, carrying out experiments in this mode required consideration of additional experimental complications. Our study of the different sample and experimental factor effect revealed information about changes of the dehydration rate-limiting step energy, variable contribution from different rate limiting steps, as well as clarified the dehydration mechanism.

The only difference between the treatments of the two carbons is the cooling down step. After these treatments, the two carbons were hydrophobic and presented similar adsorption properties and an identical behavior toward water and cyclohexane uptakes. After being stored in ambient conditions for 20 months, the stability of oxygen functional groups is studied. The quantification of various oxygen groups is done by Boehm's titration and by thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy analysis. It is found that the creation of oxygen groups, especially carboxylic acids, which are very attractive to water molecules, depends on the cooling down step. This is confirmed by both water isotherms and cyclohexane breakthrough measurements. Cyclohexane breakthrough times show that one of the heat treated carbons does not preserve its hydrophobic character compared to the other carbon, which presents a breakthrough time value close to that obtained before the storage. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Activated carbon; Heat treatment; Hydrophobicity; Storage; Surface groups","Activated carbon; Cooling; Cyclohexane; Energy storage; Functional groups; Heat treatment; Inert gases; Mass spectrometry; Oxygen; Thermogravimetric analysis; Adsorption properties; Ambient conditions; Breakthrough time; Hydrophobic character; Oxygen functional groups; Surface groups; Water isotherms; Water molecule; Hydrophobicity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901062431

In this paper, the thermal performance of a new solar air heater using a packed bed of spherical capsules with the latent heat storage system in east-west oriented greenhouse, is analyzed and discussed. The excess heat in the greenhouse was stored in the packed bed through the diurnal period and extracted at night. An experimental comparative study was conducted in two greenhouses installed in the Research and Technologies Centre of Energy (CRTEn) in Tunisia. The greenhouse heat balance in different components of the greenhouse with a heating system (cover, canopy, soil, inside air and packed bed solar collector), has been used to investigate the impact of the phase change material (PCM) on the greenhouse temperature and humidity. Results show that the nocturnal temperature inside the greenhouse equipped by a heating system exceeds the temperature inside the conventional greenhouse by 5 °C. The relative humidity was found to be of an average 10-20% lower at night time inside the heated greenhouse. The nighttime recovered heat of the solar system attained 31% of the total requirements of heating.

In this study an experimental infrared (IR) stabilization system was developed to prevent rice bran rancidity. The free fatty acid content of raw and IR-stabilized rice bran samples was monitored every 15 days during 6 months of storage. In addition, energy consumption was determined. RESULTS: The free fatty acid content of rice bran stabilized at 600 W IR power for 5 min remained below 5% for 165 days. No significant change in γ-oryzanol content or fatty acid composition but a significant decrease in tocopherol content was observed in stabilized rice bran compared with raw bran. IR stabilization was found to be comparable to extrusion with regard to energy consumption. CONCLUSION: IR stabilization was effective in preventing hydrolytic rancidity of rice bran. By optimizing the operational parameters of IR stabilization, this by-product has the potential for use in the food industry in various ways as a value-added commodity. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.","Fatty acid composition; Infrared; Rice bran; Stabilization; Tocopherols; γ-oryzanol","fatty acid; gamma-oryzanol; phenylpropionic acid derivative; tocopherol; chemistry; food irradiation; infrared radiation; plant seed; procedures; rice; Fatty Acids; Food Irradiation; Infrared Rays; Oryza sativa; Phenylpropionates; Seeds; Tocopherols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900563287

The dynamic mechanical analysis of PU coatings showed that the β-transition process occurs at -60°C for these PU networks. At 20°C, the tensile storage modulus (E') is higher for those PU networks that are characterized with higher cohesive energy density (CED). There is a good correlation between the theoretical molecular weights between two crosslinking points (M c) of the PU network and M c that has been calculated from E' based on the ideal rubber theory. PU coatings from a RO/TEA polyol and polymeric 4,4′-methylene diphenyldiisocyanate (MDI) were sprayed using a Graco Reactor E-10 industrial spraying machine with a volume ratio of the components A:B = 1.0:1.0. Eco-friendly volatile organic compounds-free, 100% solids, fast-curing two pack (2 K) PU coating compositions were formulated. The kinetics of gel formation was studied for PU coatings from RO/TEA, chain extenders, and polymeric MDI under adiabatic conditions; the temperature range was from 10 to 50°C. It was found that gel formation occurs with activation energy (E a) 26.56-33.43 kJ/mol. When a PU coating is spray-applied on a substrate under nonadiabatic conditions, the gel formation time of the coating is not significantly influenced by the temperature of the components in the range 20-50°C. © 2014 American Coatings Association &amp; Oil and Colour Chemists' Association.","100% solids; Curing process; Mechanical properties; Polyurethane; Rapeseed oil; VOC-free spray-applied coating","Activation energy; Alcohols; Curing; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Ethanolamines; Machine components; Mechanical properties; Oilseeds; Polyols; Polyurethanes; Protective coatings; Triethanolamine; Vegetable oils; Volatile organic compounds; Activation energies (Ea); Cohesive energy density; Curing process; Non-adiabatic conditions; Polyurethane coatings; Processing and properties; Rapeseed oil; VOC free; Sprayed coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900495128

The rheological studies were carried out immediately after the preparation of the pastes as well as after 1 and 7 days of storage. For the paste of acetylated potato starch (P-A), a phenomenon of oscillatory changes of viscosity with time was observed. The pastes of the acetylated amylostarch (AMY-A) and acetylated waxy potato starch (AP-A) exhibited the phenomenon of thixotropy. Based on the flow curves, the distribution of the time constants of the exponential rheological equation of state has been determined. They served to describe the contributions forming rheological properties. It has been noticed that during shear the phenomenon of the energy dissipation is predominant in AMY-A (rheological characteristic time of 0.3 s) and AP-A, whereas the elastic contributions are specific for the paste of acetylated potato starch (rheological characteristic time of 10-6 s). In order to describe the structural changes of AMY-A and AP-A pastes during flow, i.e. for the systems exhibiting frictional properties, the Cheng and Evans viscous structural theory has been applied. The rheological properties were then interpreted in light of the results of chromatographic and osmometric analyses. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

However, little has been done on optimal design of the storage tank. For application in dense living environment like Hong Kong, another concern is whether or not the amount of recoverable heat can meet the household water heating demand. In this study, a typical residential estate in Hong Kong was chosen for supply and demand analysis. The analysis was based on hour-by-hour simulations using actual building characteristics and previously identified utilization patterns. It was found that with the use of SEHRAC, the daily cumulative recoverable heat far exceeds the daily household water heating demand. For optimal design of the storage tank, an air-conditioner model (REFMOD) was developed to enable ascertaining the operating parameters at the refrigerant side of SEHRAC. Other design requirements of the storage tank including the minimum required heat storage capacity and heat transfer effectiveness were determined. The potential energy and energy cost savings, as well as CO2 emission reduction for wider application of SEHRAC were estimated as 9.3% of the overall contribution of the residential sector in Hong Kong. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Air-conditioner; Dense living environment; Free water heating; Heat recovery; Residential building; Storage tank design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900459547

However, Mg anodes cannot function in usual non-aqueous electrolyte solutions. Consequently, it is important to develop unique, complex solutions for reversible Mg metal anodes. Also, finding relevant cathode materials that can reversibly insert bivalent Mg ions is a great challenge. In this article, we review the efforts and success in the development of several families of electrolyte solutions for secondary Mg batteries, in which Mg anodes behave fully reversibly, but also exhibit the necessary wide electrochemical window. We also review attempts to develop positive electrodes for rechargeable Mg batteries. The first generation of secondary Mg batteries has already been demonstrated, but their specific energy density remains relatively low.

In this regard, this paper presents an enhanced control method for battery energy storage systems (BESS) to support the frequency of MG and with the ability of disconnecting from the MG to supplying in the island mode a local consumer. A frequency controller, combining a conventional droop control with an inertia emulation function, governs the BESS active power transfer during the primary frequency control level. The BESS may also provide voltage support in the point of common coupling with the MG. Moreover, the proposed BESS may compensate, partially or totally, the power absorbed by the local loads in order to improve the MG frequency response. When the MG power quality worsens below a certain level, in terms of voltage and frequency, the BESS detaches from the MG and continues to operate islanded. The reconnection is accomplished following a smoothly resynchronization of the local voltage with the MG, without disturbing the local loads supply. Additionally, this paper also discusses about the aspects related to the BESS management and its integration within the proposed system. The simulation and experimental results assess the feasibility of the proposed control solutions. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system (BESS); frequency control; inverter; microgrid (MG); seamless transfer","Electric frequency control; Electric power distribution; Frequency response; Renewable energy resources; System stability; Battery energy storage systems; Frequency controllers; inverter; Micro grid; Point of common coupling; Primary frequency control; Renewable energy source; Seamless transfer; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900409604

Therefore there is an increasing research interest towards the development of new methods and markers for the detection of irradiated food items. In the present article, 60Co-irradiation was applied to macadamia nuts in increasing doses up to 10kGy using different packaging and storage conditions in order to monitor changes in their lipid profile. Compositional data showed predominance of triglycerides followed by phytosterols in a much smaller proportion in nuts' lipids. The production of hydrolytic compounds as a result of gamma irradiation was statistically significant but didn't affect the macadamias' fat quality. Classification was achieved in relation to irradiation dose, package and storage conditions, using Chemometrics. More specifically, PCA and OPLS-DA analyses on the GC-FID, TLC-FID and color results managed to differentiate samples according to irradiation doses. NMR based FoodOmic application is employed for the first time, in order to explore any trends in sample classification according to the irradiation dose and the storage or the packaging effect. Minor lipid components (such as β-sitosterol, C18:2 n. - 6, C18:3 and sn1,2 and sn1,3 DGs) have shown high discriminant power over the samples.

The preparation of new nanostructured composite materials, displaying electron- and proton-conductive properties, to be used for the fabrication of new and superior energy storage devices was envisaged. The semiconducting TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained by means of a hydrothermal route. The PAni films were prepared on glassy carbon electrodes by electrochemical polymerization, under potential dynamic conditions. After characterization by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical techniques, the nanocrystalline particles were immobilized in the polymer matrix. The incorporation of the TiO2 was achieved using two distinct approaches: during the polymer growth or by deposition over previously prepared PAni films. The results demonstrate that the PAni morphology depends on the experimental conditions used during the polymer growth. After TiO2 immobilization, the best electrochemical response was obtained for the nanocomposite structure produced through the TiO2 incorporation after the PAni film synthesis. The modified electrodes were structurally and morphologically characterized and their electro-catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction was analyzed. A new electrochemical performance related with the oxidation of molecular hydrogen entrapped in the PAni-TiO2 matrix was observed for the modified electrode after TiO2 incorporation.

Lipids are required for the formation of membranes and contribute to many different processes such as cell signaling, energy supply, and cell death. Various organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets are involved in lipid metabolism. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has become a reliable model organism to study biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology of lipids. The availability of mutants bearing defects in lipid metabolic pathways and the ease of manipulation by culture conditions facilitated these investigations. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about lipid metabolism in yeast. We grouped this large topic into three sections dealing with (1) fatty acids; (2) membrane lipids; and (3) storage lipids. Fatty acids serve as building blocks for the synthesis of membrane lipids (phospholipids, sphingolipids) and storage lipids (triacylglycerols, steryl esters). Phospholipids, sterols, and sphingolipids are essential components of cellular membranes. Recent investigations addressing lipid synthesis, degradation, and storage as well as regulatory aspects are presented. The role of enzymes governing important steps of the different lipid metabolic pathways is described. Finally, the link between lipid metabolic and dynamic processes is discussed. © 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

To test the null hypothesis that HM freezing and storage for a range of 1 to 10 weeks at-80 °C does not affect HM fat, protein, lactose and energy contents.Study design:Samples of HM were obtained from 20 mothers (60 samples) of preterm infants (25 to 35 weeks gestation), who routinely expressed their milk, every 3 h, using an electric pump, from the second to the seventh week after delivery. All samples were frozen at-80 °C for 8 to 83 days (43.8 days average). After thawing and homogenization, energy and macronutrient contents were measured using an HM analyzer.Result:Fat, carbohydrates and energy contents were significantly lower in thawed HM than in fresh HM (fat, fresh vs thawed: 3.72±1.17 vs 3.36±1.19 g/100 ml, P<0.001; carbohydrates, fresh vs thawed: 5.86±0.71 vs 4.09±0.96 g/100 ml, P<0.001; energy, fresh vs thawed: 64.93±12.97 vs 56.63±16.82 kcal/100 ml, P<0.0001), whereas protein content remained unchanged (protein, fresh vs thawed: 1.14±0.36 vs 1.15±0.37 g/100 ml, P=0.7). The decline in carbohydrates content but not in fat and energy correlated significantly with freezing duration.Conclusion:Freezing at-80 °C significantly decreases the energy content of HM, both from fat and carbohydrates. Since quantitatively the decrease in macronutrients was much higher than that published for HM storage at-20 °C, our results do not support freezing HM at-80 °C as the gold standard for long-term storage. We suggest that caloric intake calculations in preterm infants cannot be established based upon fresh HM data. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

The station blackout event is of great importance for nuclear power plant safety. This event is caused by the loss of all alternating current power supply to the safety and non-safety buses of the nuclear power plant. In this study an independent electrical connection between a pumped-storage hydro power plant and a nuclear power plant is assumed as a standpoint for safety and reliability analysis. The pumped-storage hydro power plant is considered as an alternative power supply. The connection with conventional accumulation type of hydro power plant is analysed in addition. The objective of this paper is to investigate the improvement of nuclear power plant safety resulting from the consideration of the alternative power supplies. The safety of the nuclear power plant is analysed through the core damage frequency, a risk measure assess by the probabilistic safety assessment. The presented method upgrades the probabilistic safety assessment from its common traditional use in sense that it considers non-plant sited systems. The obtained results show significant decrease of the core damage frequency, indicating improvement of nuclear safety if hydro power plant is introduced as an alternative off-site power source. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The assessment allows identification of the meltwater contribution of flows for any reach in the country, including bridge, irrigation take and lake locations. The snow melt estimates were generated by separating gridded daily precipitation into rainfall and snowfall components to provide mean annual snowfall and rainfall data. The ratio of the catchment-based accumulation of these precipitation components was then found, which is shown to be equivalent to the ratio of melt-derived flow to total flow. The assessment allows comparisons between sites, which were previously complicated by a paucity of assessments and differing methods. Based on the assessment, 3% of the South Island's mean annual stream flow is made up of meltwater. This is considerably less than estimates for regions of California, Austria, India and Chile. This difference is probably a reflection of the relative lack of seasonality in precipitation and the generally mild winter temperatures in the South Island. This low snow and ice melt contribution is problematic for irrigation schemes, in that artificial storage management is required if winter precipitation is to be retained for summer plant growth, but beneficial for hydro-electricity generation in that stream flows continue throughout the year, including winter (albeit often reduced) when energy demands are often high.

Beyond production, soils have manifold environmental functions that must be preserved despite increasing production levels. Today, substantial parts of the world's soil resources are degraded. Urbanization and increased sealing of fertile soils, human-induced erosion and soil compaction, the input of contaminants, increasing nitrogen depositions, a possible scarcity of fertilizer P, and soil organic matter loss due to changing land use and soil management are amongst the severe present and future threats to soil resources. Research shows that agricultural production could be increased worldwide by several approaches such as filling the gap between potential yields and actual yields by improved agricultural techniques, increased agricultural land and reduced post-harvest losses. The highest potentials are seen in temperate rather than in tropical areas with their less resilient soils. Climate change will have a tremendous impact on the availability of agriculturally productive areas and will induce significant shifts between regions. Intensification of agricultural systems should aim at low-input high-yield systems best adapted to the local needs and framework conditions. This requires implementing all possible measures including aspects of organic farming, precision agriculture, reduced tillage, high-efficiency irrigation systems, agro-forestry systems, breeding, mechanization and improved post-harvest storage and handling technologies. The cascade use of biomass for food and feed, industrial raw material, energy production and organic fertilizer is clearly a valuable concept in this context.","Biomass production; Ecological/sustainable intensification; Food security; Soil degradation; Soil resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899692636

The calibration parameters, that are the open circuit voltage, the serial resistance and the resistance and capacitance of two serially connected RC-circuits, are used to configure the electric equivalent circuit model of the battery. The calibration process is based on a best-fit of the measured data from one test, while the validation is made by comparing measured and simulated battery voltages of a different battery load cycle.

For molecular biological analysis, it is common to use quick freezing and low-temperature storage of the tissue materiel. This is a very energy-intensive and expensive method that requires advanced infrastructure, including monitoring and control procedures. The purpose of this work has been to study drying as an alternative process to cryogenic storage of undried biobank material, especially for use in cancer research groups. Fast freezing has been shown to be suitable to preserve the integrity of RNAs, while traditional formalin fixation preserves proteins and thus morphology in a good way. Various fresh-harvested murine tissues, such as lung, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney, were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then subsequently dried at +5°C and -10°C, respectively, in a heat pump dryer. After drying, the RNA integrity was measured. The dried material was then stored for five months at +4°C and -20°C in commercial refrigerators, with subsequent measurement of RNA integrity. Dried materials were also evaluated with light microscopy and by electron microscopy with respect to tissue and cell structure. The same pattern was found for all five murine tissues. We conclude that drying at temperatures below 0°C is most careful to preserve the RNA integrity, with approximately the same RIN score of dried and non-dried samples for all five tissues. What characterized the general pattern of stored samples is that drying leads to a preservation of RNA integrity. Moreover, architecture in tissue resembled normal sections prepared from fresh tissue. In some places in the rim of the tissue sample, the lung tissue revealed alveolar-like morphology. In the electron microscope, few organelles other than the nuclei could be identified. Drying of biological material is a promising and cost-effective method for biobanks that store tissue, compared to cryogenic storage of undried material. Degradation of RNA, measured by the RIN number, is a critical factor in storing biobank tissue. In low-temperature dried material, the RIN factor is at the same level as storage of undried material at cryogenic temperatures, which is the common way of storing biobank material today. In this study, a heat pump dryer was used successfully to establish drying temperatures below and above the freezing point of the material. Further work has to be done in order to study different drying methods, drying conditions, and drying costs. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Atmospheric freeze drying; Biobanking; Heat pump dryer","Biological organs; Cryogenics; Diseases; Drying; Formaldehyde; Freezing; Heat pump systems; Histology; Materials; Morphology; RNA; Temperature; Tissue; Atmospheric freeze drying; Biobanking; Cost-effective methods; Cryogenic temperatures; Heat pump dryer; Low-temperature storage; Monitoring and control; Tissue preservation; Tissue engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899449134

The storage of latent heat provides a greater density of energy storage with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat than the sensible heat storage method. Many different groups of materials have been investigated during the technical evolution of PCMs, including inorganic systems (salt and salt hydrates), organic compounds such as paraffins or fatty acids and polymeric materials, e.g. poly(ethylene glycol). Historically, the relationships between the structure and the energy storage properties of a material have been studied to provide an understanding of the heat accumulation/emission mechanism governing the material's imparted energy storage characteristics. This paper reviews the present state of the art of PCMs for thermal energy storage applications and provides an insight into recent efforts to develop new PCMs with enhanced performance and safety. Specific attention is given to the improvement of thermal conductivity, encapsulation methods and shape stabilization procedures. In addition, the flame retarding properties and performance are discussed.

The development and large scale deployment of energy and cost effective carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are equally important for transition to low carbon economy. This paper investigates the potential use of biomass (sawdust and agricultural wastes) and solid wastes (e.g. municipal wastes, meat and bone meal etc.) in a co-gasification process with coal to cogenerate hydrogen and electricity with carbon capture. The paper underlines one of the main advantages of gasification technology, namely the possibility to process lower grade fuels (lower grade coals, biomass, solid wastes etc.), which are more widely available and cheaper than the high grade coals normally used in combustion-based power plants, this fact contributing to the improvement of energy security supply. Based on a proposed plant concept that generates 400 - 425 MW net electricity with a flexible output of 0 - 200 MWth hydrogen and a carbon capture rate of at least 90 %, the paper presents in details coal and biomass / solid waste blending for optimizing plant performance, mass and energy integration aspects, hydrogen and power co-generation and overall energy efficiency. Energy vectors poly-generation capability of gasification plants and a critical comparison of coal and biomass co-gasification with correspondent co-combustion are also discussed. The key technical performance indicators are calculated for a number of case studies through process flow simulations. The mass and energy balances resulted from simulation are then used to assess the main techno-economic and environmental indicators of the evaluated cases, like plant energy efficiency, ancillary power consumption, carbon capture energy and cost penalty, specific CO2 emissions, capital costs, specific capital investment per kW, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, cost of electricity, CO2 removal and avoidance costs, cash flow analysis.

Wastewater comprises significant amounts of chemical energy primarily in the form of organic molecules (in particular lipids), which are currently not being recovered comprehensively. Within biological wastewater treatment (BWWT) systems, specialized microorganisms assimilate and store lipids anaerobically. These intracellular stores represent interesting feedstocks for biofuel synthesis. Here, we review our current understanding of the genetic and functional basis for bacterial lipid accumulation and processing, and relate this to lipid accumulating bacterial populations which occur naturally in BWWT plants.

Virtual Power Players (VPP) can aggregate several players, namely a diversity of energy resources, including distributed generation (DG) based on several technologies, electric storage systems (ESS) and demand response (DR). Energy resources management gains an increasing relevance in this competitive context. This makes the DR use more interesting and flexible, giving place to a wide range of new opportunities. This paper proposes a methodology to support VPPs in the DR programs' management, considering all the existing energy resources (generation and storage units) and the distribution network. The proposed method is based on locational marginal prices (LMP) values. The evaluation of the impact of using DR specific programs in the LMP values supports the manager decision concerning the DR use. The proposed method has been computationally implemented and its application is illustrated in this paper using a 33-bus network with intensive use of DG. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, hydrothermal process was employed to modify the structure of commercial V 2O5 powder to be nanorod-like structure V 2O5 to increase its specific surface area. Structural and morphological properties of the composites were characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. The XRD results indicate that the crystallisation of the composite corresponds to anatase and orthorhombic structures of TiO2 and V 2O5, respectively. The significant variation of charge storage properties of the composites under ultraviolet irradiation was obtained by varying V2O5 content in the composite.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the stability and loss kinetics of carotenoids in dehydrated emulsions, and to compare the ability of freeze dried single-layer (SL) and layer-by-layer (LBL) emulsions with trehalose as wall material to protect the carotenoids. WPI (2%, w/w, in oil) was used as an emulsifier and homogenised with sunflower oil containing β-carotene (0.05%, w/w) and lutein (0.05%, w/w). Gum Arabic was added to obtain LBL emulsion. Trehalose (20%, w/w) was used as the wall material. Citric acid solution (10%, w/w) was used to adjust the pH of emulsions to pH. 3.5. The emulsions were then freeze-dried, humidified at 33% RH, stored at low oxygen (25. °C, 37. °C and 45. °C) in closed containers, and analysed using HPLC with C30 column and photodiode-array detector. The loss of lutein and all-trans-β-carotene followed first order kinetics and was more rapid in the SL system compared to the LBL system. Carotenoid losses increased with increasing storage temperatures especially in the SL systems. The activation energy of all-trans-β-carotene in SL was 62.1. kJ/mol compared to 43.9. kJ/mol in LBL and 58.9. kJ/mol in SL compared to LBL with 45.9. kJ/mol for lutein. The total β-carotene retention upon storage for 70. days was higher in LBL at all storage temperatures. However, the utilisation of LBL increased isomerisation. LBL gave better protection towards carotenoid losses during storage and is highly applicable to formulated materials to control the stability of oil soluble bioactive components. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","HPLC; Layer-by-layer emulsion; Lutein; Trehalose; β-carotene","Activation energy; Emulsification; Kinetics; Oils and fats; Pigments; Citric acid solution; First order kinetics; HPLC; Layer-by-layers; Lutein; Photodiode array detectors; Physico-chemical changes; Trehalose; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898942604

Nanomagnetite (Fe 3O4) particles were prepared by sol-gel method for this investigation. Once characterization of nanomagnetite was done, it was added at 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15% ratios to paraffin (melting range: 46-48 °C) to obtain a paraffin nanocomposite.

The proposed phase change material-shutter is a thermal energy storage system designed to take advantage of solar energy for winter nighttime indoor heating. A two-dimensional phase-change heat diffusion model based on the enthalpy formulation was considered. The numerical model follows the finite-volume method with a fully implicit formulation and allows the alternating melting and solidification of a phase change material submitted to cyclical thermal boundary conditions. Parametric investigations were carried out about the effects of thermophysical properties of the phase change material and temperature and convection heat transfer boundary conditions on the charge/discharge rates of energy. Due to the low thermal diffusivity of the phase change material, an aluminum fin arrangement was considered as a heat transfer enhancement technique. The distance between fins is directly proportional to the daily energy storage/release capacity of the system. The solar radiation flux has a strong effect on the charging/melting processes during the day. The indoor temperature and the interior convection heat transfer coefficient have a major influence on the discharging/freezing processes during the night. The design of the phase change material-shutter depends strongly on the thermophysical properties of the phase change material and on the interior and exterior boundary conditions considered. © The Author(s) 2013.","enthalpy formulation; heat transfer; latent heat; Phase change materials; solar energy; thermal energy storage","Boundary conditions; Computer simulation; Enthalpy; Finite volume method; Fins (heat exchange); Heat convection; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Latent heat; Solar energy; Sun; Thermal energy; Enthalpy formulations; Heat Transfer enhancement; Implicit formulation; Melting and solidification; Parametric investigations; Solar-radiation fluxes; Thermal boundary conditions; Thermal energy storage systems; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898814645

We perform a life cycle assessment of electric vehicle (EV) and fuel cell vehicle (FCV) powered by bioelectricity and biohydrogen, respectively, derived from Norwegian boreal forest biomass, considering the nonclimate neutrality of biological carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and alteration in surface albedo resulting from biomass harvesting-both with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS)-while benchmarking these options against EVs powered by the average European electricity mix. Results show that with due consideration of the countering effects from global warming potential (GWP) factors for biogenic CO2 emissions and change in radiative forcing of the surface for the studied region, bioenergy-based EVs and FCVs provide reductions of approximately 30%, as compared to the reference EV powered by the average European electricity mix. With CCS coupled to bioenergy production, the biomass-based vehicle transport results in a net global warming impact reduction of approximately 110% to 120% (giving negative GWP and creating a climate-cooling benefit from biomass use). Other environmental impacts vary from -60% to +60%, with freshwater eutrophication showing maximum reductions (40% for the EV case and 60% for the FCV case) and photochemical oxidation showing a maximum increase (60% in the FCV value chain). © 2014 by Yale University.","Bioenergy; Biohydrogen; Electric vehicles; Fuel cell; Impact assessment; Industrial ecology","Atmospheric radiation; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Electrophysiology; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Forestry; Fuel cells; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Bio-energy; Bio-hydrogen; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas balance; Impact assessments; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Photochemical oxidation; Biomass; albedo; bioenergy; biomass; carbon dioxide; electric vehicle; environmental impact; fuel cell; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; sustainable development; Norway; Feline calicivirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898779214

They should also be self-configurable to node failures and changes of the network topology dynamically.

Drying experiments were conducted using constant air velocity of 2m/s and air temperatures of 50, 60 and 70C. Drying rate increased with increase in air temperature and thus reduced the drying time. The experimental drying data were applied to 14 thin-layer drying models. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed to relate the parameters of the model with the drying conditions. The performance of these models is evaluated by comparing R 2, χ2 and RMSE between the observed and predicted moisture ratios. Among all the models, Midilli etal.'s model was found to be the best for explaining the drying characteristics of bay laurel leaves.

Estrogens and testosterone differentially affect adipocyte physiology, but the importance of estrogens in the development of metabolic diseases during menopause is disputed. Estrogens and estrogen receptors regulate various aspects of glucose and lipid metabolism. Disturbances of this metabolic signal lead to the development of metabolic syndrome and a higher cardiovascular risk in women. The absence of estrogens is a clue factor in the onset of cardiovascular disease during the menopausal period, which is characterized by lipid profile variations and predominant abdominal fat accumulation. However, influence of the absence of these hormones and its relationship to higher obesity in women during menopause are not clear. This systematic review discusses of the role of estrogens and estrogen receptors in adipocyte differentiation, and its control by the central nervous systemn and the possible role of estrogen-like compounds and endocrine disruptors chemicals are discussed. Finally, the interaction between the decrease in estrogen secretion and the prevalence of obesity in menopausal women is examined. We will consider if the absence of estrogens have a significant effect of obesity in menopausal women. © 2014 Fernando Lizcano and Guillermo Guzmán.",,"adipocytokine; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; estrogen; estrogen receptor; fat; glucose; norethisterone acetate; adipocytokine; estrogen; estrogen receptor; abdominal fat; adipocyte; appetite; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cell differentiation; central nervous system; central nucleus (amygdala); cytokine release; energy balance; estrogen deficiency; estrogen release; estrogen therapy; food intake; glucose metabolism; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; Medline; menopause; meta analysis (topic); metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; obesity; prevalence; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; satiety; systematic review; complication; deficiency; female; metabolism; middle aged; obesity; physiology; Adipokines; Central Nervous System; Estradiol; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Menopause; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Receptors, Estrogen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897876705

The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources brings new challenges, requiring an efficient management of those sources. Additional storage resources can be beneficially used to address this problem; the massive use of electric vehicles, particularly of vehicle-to-grid (usually referred as gridable vehicles or V2G), becomes a very relevant issue. This paper addresses the impact of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in system operation costs and in power demand curve for a distribution network with large penetration of Distributed Generation (DG) units. An efficient management methodology for EVs charging and discharging is proposed, considering a multi-objective optimization problem. The main goals of the proposed methodology are: to minimize the system operation costs and to minimize the difference between the minimum and maximum system demand (leveling the power demand curve). The proposed methodology perform the day-ahead scheduling of distributed energy resources in a distribution network with high penetration of DG and a large number of electric vehicles. It is used a 32-bus distribution network in the case study section considering different scenarios of EVs penetration to analyze their impact in the network and in the other energy resources management. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis follows a multicriteria approach. It uses a method called compromise programming and takes into account the technical, economical, environmental and social criteria. The hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) software was used to generate alternative energy sets through enumerative search, with which decisional matrices were built for each case study. The influence of weighting for each criterion was assessed. In the case of self-sufficiency in UNISTMO, when the decision-making center has a preference for the minimization of equivalent emissions in the life cycle (ESLC), a wind system is suitable. On the other hand, when there is a preference for the minimization of levelized cost of energy, a photovoltaic (PV) system is suitable; both systems connected to the national electrical grid. Obviously, a preference for the minimization of capital cost led to keeping the power supply from the grid. In the case of Gran Piedra, a diesel generator-based system is suitable when the criterion 'capital cost' absorbs 70% or more of the preferences of the decision-making centers. When the preference is less than 70% regardless of the weighting given to other criteria, the best alternatives are those involving renewable technologies, reaching renewable fractions of 75% and 94% in two potential configurations of energetic systems. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","HOMER software; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen technology; Life cycle; Multicriteria analysis","Decision making; Energy policy; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Life cycle; Compromise programming; Homer softwares; Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables; Hydrogen technologies; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multi-criteria approach; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable technology; Electric power distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897560738

This appraisal can provide an important tool for assessing the sustainability of cities. Socioeconomic activities are mostly responsible for these fluxes, which are well manifested in the household unit. Human behavior associated with cultural traditions, belief systems, knowledge, and lifestyles are important drivers controlling the transfer of materials throughout the urban environment. Within this context, we explored three aspects of household consumption and waste disposal activities along the Río Piedras Watershed in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico. These included: the source of food consumed by residents, recycling activities, and trends in connection to the municipality's sewerage system. We randomly interviewed 440 households at 6 sites along the watershed. We also conducted analysis to estimate accessibility to commercial food services for residents in the study areas. Our surveys revealed that nearly all interviewed households (~97%) consumed products from supermarkets. In neighborhoods of the upper portion of the watershed, where residential density is low with large areas of vegetative cover, more than 60% of residents consumed food items cultivated in their yards. Less than 36% of residents in the in densely urbanized parts of the lower portion of the watershed consumed items from their yards. Accessibility to commercial stores for food consumption contrasted among study sites. Recycling activities were mostly carried out by residents in the lower portion of the watershed, with better access to recycling programs provided by the municipality. The surveys also revealed that only 4 to 17% of residences in the upper watershed are connected to the sewerage system whereas the large majority uses septic tanks for septic water disposal. For these residents wastewater from house maintenance is disposed of directly into the environment. In the lower portion of the watershed all residents were connected to the sewerage system. Our study suggests there is a need to understand human behavioral attitudes in the acquirement and processing of resources, as a tool to generate informed-based strategies promoting sustainable consumption and disposal patterns. © 2014 by the author(s).","Household; Nutrient cycling; San Juan ULTRA; Social-ecological systems; Urban biogeochemistry; Urban ecology; Urban metabolism; Watershed","accessibility; consumption behavior; food supply; inflow; recycling; sewer network; strategic approach; sustainability; tropical environment; urban area; waste disposal; waste management; watershed; Piedras Basin; Puerto Rico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897558289

In this study, the most traditional and mature storage technology, pumped hydro storage (PHS), is introduced to support the standalone microgrid hybrid solar-wind system. This paper explores a new solution for the challenging task about energy storage. A mathematical model of the hybrid system is developed and the operating principle is introduced. The proposed system is applied in a case study to power a remote island in Hong Kong, and its technical feasibility is then examined.

Box 50329, 3603 Limassol, Cyprus","Thermosiphon systems heat potable water or heat transfer fluid and use natural convection to transport it from the collector to storage. This type of technology is applied extensively in countries with good sunshine potential. One such example is Cyprus, which is currently the leading country in the world with respect to the application of solar water heaters for domestic applications, with more than 93% of the houses equipped with such a system. The performance of such a system depends on many factors including the collector construction and the arrangement of the system, mainly with respect to the distance between the top of the solar collector and the bottom of the storage tank and the solar collector slope, which affects both the energy collected and the hydrostatic pressure of the system. A typical system in Cyprus uses 3m2 of collectors, 160lstorage, its collectors are usually inclined at 45° from horizontal and has 15mm copper riser tubes and header tubes with a diameter of 28mm. The collector absorber plate is also made from copper. The main objective of this paper is to investigate through modeling and simulation possible configurations, which will optimize the performance of the system. For this purpose, a number of riser and header tube diameters were considered ranging from 6mm to 35mm, slopes from 20° to 90° and distances between the top of the collector to the bottom side of the storage tank ranging from ±15cm. The system is modeled using TRNSYS and simulated with the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) of Nicosia, Cyprus. The results showed that the best-optimized system is obtained for small header and riser pipe diameters and very close performance is obtained for various combinations. Therefore, the decision on the optimum system should depend on cost issues, which are currently very important because of the increased price of copper and operational problems depending on the hardness of the water in the area of installation, which could cause scale deposits that could clog the riser pipes. The optimum slope is found to be equal to the latitude plus 10°, i.e., 45°, although a smaller slope does not affect the performance a lot, and the optimum distance between the top of the collector and the bottom of the storage tank is-15cm. These findings should prove valuable for the collector and systems designers and manufacturers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Collector slope; Header and riser pipe diameters; System configuration; Thermosiphonic solar water heaters","Computer simulation; Copper; Drilling platforms; Heating; Hydrostatic pressure; Optimization; Piping systems; Potable water; Scale (deposits); Solar water heaters; Tanks (containers); Tubes (components); Water hardness; Collector slope; Flat-plate collector; Model and simulation; Operational problems; Riser pipes; System configurations; Type of technology; Typical meteorological year; Solar collectors; convection; copper; diameter; drinking water; heat transfer; hydrostatic pressure; installation; optimization; performance assessment; pipe; solar power; Cyprus; Nicosia [Cyprus]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897384135

Given that the electrical contribution of energy each sources (taking individually) is dependent on the variation of the resources (sun, wind, water), and since the load energy requirement fluctuates, the main attribute of such hybrid system is to be able to generate energy at any time by optimally using each energy source, and storing excess energy for the later use in deficit generating conditions. The induced optimization problem is to compute the optimal size and operation control of the system with the aim of minimizing its initial, operation and maintenance as well as replacement costs while responding to the load energy requirements.In this paper our goal will be to propose an approach for optimal operation control of a hybrid multisource system with the aim of meeting the load energy requirement with reliability and minimized life cycle costs. The paper will be limited at the problem formulation and the development of the mathematical model for the performance of all the hybrid system's components.The proposed hybrid system model is based on a description of current flows from the different power sources, taking into account the losses and the impact of the operating decisions along the way up to the loads. The decision variables include the renewable energy sources sizes and number of modules as well as the operation control settings and strategies which lead to the determination the diesel generator and battery system output power.

It is based on the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method, which makes the procedure suited for automation since local minima in the cost function can easily be circumvented. The identification procedure is tested on four different vessels in a distributed thermal storage lab-setup. Two domestic hot water cylinders and two hot water storage buffers have been monitored in a series of charge-discharge tests.

However, it has recently been found that depending on the storage pool/period and source of biomass, the associated climate impacts may be a burden or a benefit. It is important that carbon accounting schemes and life cycle assessment practitioners take these carbon/CO2 flux dynamics and the climate impacts that they create into consideration. In this work we illustrate these climate impacts with a Norwegian case study using a material flow analysis of the biogenic carbon in harvested wood products derived from a 2006 harvest year. We illustrate the dynamic carbon balance over time and show how the climate impacts can diverge greatly between two well-known climate impact metrics: global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential (GTP). We also show how these climate impacts can be attributed to contributing parties with an example of a glue laminated beam value chain which is stored in a long-lived building.

The building sector presently represents 27% of the total energy consumption in the European Union and is one of the major energy consumers. Accordingly, it is expected that in 2035 this sector will be the fourth largest contributor to CO2 emissions. To minimize the energy consumption it is essential to improve the research on passive cooling and heating strategies, as well as in the development of new materials and building components with lower environmental impact. The development of new techniques for energy storage resourcing to renewable energy sources presently dominates the essential research trend for sustainable and low energy buildings. New and intelligent materials, as the case of Phase Change Materials (PCM) may store latent heat energy in addition to the typical sensible energy capacity of common building materials, allowing to store significantly more energy during the phase change process. Macroencapsulated PCM applications into building envelope components, opaque and translucent, can take advantage of solar energy, potentially reducing the overall energy consumption of active heating and cooling systems.

We studied infant rib fractures from a biomechanical and morphological perspective using a porcine model. Methods: We used 24, 6th ribs of one day old domestic pigs Sus scrofa, divided into three groups, desiccated (representing post-mortem trauma), fresh ribs with intact periosteum (representing peri-mortem trauma) and those stored at -20. °C. Two experiments were designed to study their biomechanical behaviour fracture morphology: ribs were axially compressed and subjected to four-point bending in an Instron 3339 fitted with custom jigs. Morphoscopic analysis of resultant fractures consisted of standard optical methods, micro-CT (μCT) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results: During axial compression fresh ribs did not fracture because of energy absorption capabilities of their soft and fluidic components. In flexure tests, dry ribs showed typical elastic-brittle behaviour with long linear load-extension curves, followed by short non-linear elastic (hyperelastic) behaviour and brittle fracture. Fresh ribs showed initial linear-elastic behaviour, followed by strain softening and visco-plastic responses. During the course of loading, dry bone showed minimal observable damage prior to the onset of unstable fracture. Frozen then thawed bone showed similar patterns to fresh bone. Morphologically, fresh ribs showed extensive periosteal damage to the tensile surface with areas of collagen fibre pull-out along the tensile surface. While all dry ribs fractured precipitously, with associated fibre pull-out, the latter feature was absent in thawed ribs. Conclusions: Our study highlights the fact that under controlled loading, fresh piglet ribs (representing perimortem trauma) did not fracture through bone, but was associated with periosteal tearing. These results suggest firstly, that complete lateral rib fracture in infants may in fact not result from pure compression as has been previously assumed; and secondly, that freezing of bone during storage may affect its fracture behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Forensic biomechanics; Four-point bending; Rib fracture; SEM; Shaken baby syndrome","Biomechanics; Brittle fracture; Computerized tomography; Fracture mechanics; Scanning electron microscopy; Thawing; Energy absorption capability; Fluidic components; Forensic biomechanics; Four-point bending; Fracture behaviour; Fracture morphology; Rib fractures; Shaken baby syndromes; Bone; collagen fiber; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; biomechanics; bone; bone strength; comparative study; compression; controlled study; elasticity; energy absorption; fluorescence imaging; freezing; infant disease; micro-computed tomography; morphology; nonhuman; periosteum; piglet; porcine model; priority journal; rib fracture; scanning electron microscopy; storage; swine; animal; compressive strength; forensic science; materials testing; pathophysiology; rib; swine; weight bearing; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Compressive Strength; Forensic Sciences; Materials Testing; Rib Fractures; Ribs; Swine; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897028068

The minimization of the vibration and turbulence arising from the continuous compression/expansion effects arising from the input-output volume airflow difference is achieved, whilst simultaneously maximizing the output volume airflow. Variations in the parameter values are employed to confirm the effectiveness of operating under optimum conditions, for ventilation system airways with various dimensions and characteristics. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Minimization; Optimization; System; Turbulence; Ventilation","Optimization; Turbulence; Analytical procedure; Characteristic impedance; Dissipation effects; Distributed systems; Feasibility studies; Operating condition; System; Ventilation systems; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896987626

Efficient routing requires finding optimum route with minimum delay, updating it on availability of a better one, and repairing it on link breakages. Current routing protocols are generally focused on finding and maintaining an efficient route, with very less emphasis on route update. Adaptive route update usually becomes impractical for dense networks due to large routing overheads. This paper presents an adaptive route update approach which can provide solution for any baseline routing protocol. The proposed adaptation eliminates the classification of reactive and proactive by categorizing them as logical conditions to find and update the route. © 2014 Asim Rasheed et al.",,"adaptation; algorithm; article; density; dynamics; energy conservation; Vehicular Ad hoc Networks; velocity; computer network; computer simulation; information retrieval; procedures; signal processing; theoretical model; wireless communication; Algorithms; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Simulation; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Theoretical; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Wireless Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896920570

Lipids are also important signalling molecules involved in the regulatory mechanisms of maturation and hence in oocyte competence acquisition. Recent studies show that LD are highly dynamic organelles. They change their shape, volume, and location within the ooplasm as well as their interaction with other organelles during the maturation process. The droplets high lipid content has been correlated with impaired oocyte developmental competence and low cryosurvival. Yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In particular, the lipid-rich pig oocyte might be an excellent model to understand the role of lipids and fatty acid metabolism during the mammalian oocyte maturation and their implications on subsequent monospermic fertilization and preimplantation embryo development. The possibility of using chemical molecules to modulate the lipid content of oocytes and embryos to improve cryopreservation as well as its biological effects during development is here described.

To date only a few contradictory studies have been published on the influence of melatonin on preadipocytes. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the influence of melatonin at physiological and supraphysiological concentrations on the proliferation of 3T3-L1 murine preadipocytes after 3 and 24 hours of the experiment and to determine the participation of membrane melatonin MT2 receptors, and for the first time - MT3, in its melatonin action during a 24-hour experiment. The 3T3-L1 murine preadipocyte cell line were cultured with or without melatonin at 10-3 and 10-9 mol/L, with or without melatonin antagonists luzindole (10-4 mol/L) and prazosin (10-5 mol/L). Cell proliferation was determined by means of labeled [3H]-thymidine incorporation in the DNA of the cell. Melatonin at both physiological and supraphysiological concentrations has a stimulating effect on the number of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The application of luzindole inhibits the above effect of melatonin both at 10-3 mol/L and 10-9 mol/L concentrations (P&lt;0.05). The presence of prazosin does not have a statistically significant influence on the effects of melatonin action. Summarizing, it has been proven that melatonin exerts a proproliferative effect on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at physiological and supraphysiological concentrations, partially by MT2, and not by MT3 receptors.","3T3-L1 proliferation; Luzindole; Melatonin; Melatonin receptors; Obesity; Prazosin; Preadipocytes","luzindole; melatonin receptor; prazosin; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell count; cell culture; cell function; cell proliferation; cell strain 3T3; cell viability; controlled study; cytology; DNA synthesis; incubation time; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; proadipocyte; quantitative assay; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Proliferation; DNA; Melatonin; Mice; Prazosin; Receptor, Melatonin, MT2; Receptors, Melatonin; Thymidine; Tryptamines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896805937

However, the intermittent structure of the wind and solar energy systems directly related with the dependence on meteorological conditions lowers the reliability of such sources especially for sole use in a stand-alone small scale system. Thus, utilizing these sources with energy storage units in a proper hybrid combination is the most accepted solution today to overcome the mentioned drawbacks of solar and wind systems. In order to make the mentioned hybrid system investment as economic as possible together with considering technical limitations, optimum sizing algorithms have been widely utilized. In this paper, a real-time performance analysis of an optimally sized hybrid energy system is conducted to examine the effectiveness of the optimum sizing approach proposed in a recent study of the authors.

In this paper we analyze the economic performance of bulk electricity storage (ES) technologies for load-leveling operation in the German and Austrian power market. We assess four different power storage technologies: Pumped hydro storage (PHS), adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES), hydrogen storage (H2) and methane storage (CH4). We examine storage revenues by simulating optimal price arbitrage based on historic price data of the years 2007-2011. The results indicate that revenues have decreased significantly during this time period and even the most efficient technology, the PHS, has fallen below the profitability margin. Alternative technologies proved to be inferior to the PHS as a day storage plant. There might be a field of application for H2 and CH4 as seasonal storage, if their costs can be reduced considerably. The results reveal that, based on the past 5 years' development, incentives to invest in storage capacity are currently low. Given the uncertain mid- to long-term development of the power market, this could seriously delay the extension of storage capacities required for the integration of intermittent renewable electricity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Preliminary results in a not fully self-consistent scenario show this equilibrium is possible and, compared with the more usual ST rail limiter $D$- shaped geometry, retain consistently the same kinetic storage energy. The related parameters such as volume-averaged beta increase by 17% due to pure geometric effects, i.e., the increase of plasma major radius (10%), which then increases the aspect ratio (1.4-1.6) due to the simultaneous reduction of plasma minor radius (9%), while the elongation increases (1.2-1.3). The plasma volume is virtually the same but the plasma triangularity increases substantially (0.32-0.45) thus favoring beta limits because of shaping. These results have been obtained after a careful pressure tailoring by fixing the plasma outboard within a 3% error. This unique bean-shaped equilibrium can be attained simultaneously (but independently) setting an edge localized ergodization as observed via a Poincaré mapping, using a low level of nonresonant perturbation to the plasma current ∼ 2%. This combination can theoretically lead to a higher beta limit ST plasma with different thermal power loads distribution, which is an interesting area of study for larger devices. © 2014 IEEE.","Bean-shaped plasmas; beta limit; equilibrium reconstruction; ergodic limiter; Poincaré mapping; second stability; spherical tokamaks (STs); tokamaks","Aspect ratio; Electric load forecasting; Geometry; Magnetoplasma; Tokamak devices; Beta limit; Equilibrium reconstruction; Ergodics; Poincare; Spherical Tokamak; tokamaks; Plasma stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896493793

This provides mobiles practically infinite battery lives and eliminates the need of power cords and chargers. To enable MPT for mobile recharging, this paper proposes a new network architecture that overlays an uplink cellular network with randomly deployed PBs for powering mobiles, called a hybrid network. The deployment of the hybrid network under an outage constraint on data links is investigated based on a stochastic-geometry model where single-antenna base stations (BSs) and PBs form independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs) with densities λ-b and λ-p, respectively, and single-antenna mobiles are uniformly distributed in Voronoi cells generated by BSs. In this model, mobiles and PBs fix their transmission power at p and q, respectively; a PB either radiates isotropically, called isotropic MPT, or directs energy towards target mobiles by beamforming, called directed MPT. The model is used to derive the tradeoffs between the network parameters (p, λ-b, q, λ-p) under the outage constraint. First, consider the deployment of the cellular network. It is proved that the outage constraint is satisfied so long as the product pλ-b^\frac{alpha}{2} is above a given threshold where α is the path-loss exponent. Next, consider the deployment of the hybrid network assuming infinite energy storage at mobiles. It is shown that for isotropic MPT, the product qλ-p λ-b^\frac{alpha}{2} has to be above a given threshold so that PBs are sufficiently dense; for directed MPT, z-mqλ-p λ-b^\frac{alpha}{2} with z-m denoting the array gain should exceed a different threshold to ensure short distances between PBs and their target mobiles. Furthermore, similar results are derived for the case of mobiles having small energy storage. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","adaptive arrays; cellular networks; energy harvesting; mobile communication; Power transmission; stochastic processes","Antennas; Cellular arrays; Cellular telephone systems; Electric power transmission; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Mobile devices; Network architecture; Random processes; Stochastic models; Adaptive arrays; Cellular network; Mobile communications; Network parameters; Poisson point process; Transmission power; Uplink cellular networks; Wireless power transfer; Plasma jets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896400591

These expressions are valid for the entire range from zero to infinite material loss tangents, with any dispersion of the real parts and an inverse frequency variation of the imaginary parts of permittivity and permeability. For the dipole modes of a sub-wavelength antenna, we demonstrate how an increasing magnetic loss tangent initially leads to a decreasing radiation quality factor, but in the limit of a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) core the dissipated power tends to zero and the radiation quality factor reaches the fundamental Chu lower bound. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Electrically small antennas; energy storage; magnetic losses; quality factor; spherical antennas","Energy storage; Magnetic leakage; Spheres; Closed-form expression; Electrically small antennas; Perfect magnetic conductors; Quality factors; Radiation efficiency; Radiation quality factor; Spherical antennas; Sub-wavelength antennas; Antennas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896376471

The system is highly modular and adaptable and can be used in any laboratory in which continuous and/or ad hoc measurements require centralized storage. A presentation component for the data back end has furthermore been written that enables live visualization of data on any device capable of displaying Web pages. The system consists of three parts: data-logging clients, a data server, and a data presentation Web site. The logging of data from independent clients leads to high resilience to equipment failure, whereas the central storage of data dramatically eases backup and data exchange. The visualization front end allows direct monitoring of acquired data to see live progress of long-duration experiments. This enables the user to alter experimental conditions based on these data and to interfere with the experiment if needed. The data stored consist both of specific measurements and of continuously logged system parameters. The latter is crucial to a variety of automation and surveillance features, and three cases of such features are described: monitoring system health, getting status of long-duration experiments, and implementation of instant alarms in the event of failure. © 2013 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.","collaboration; database; experimental data; logging; open source; PHP; Python; storage; visualization","Database systems; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Energy storage; Experiments; Flow visualization; Logging (forestry); Software engineering; Visualization; Websites; collaboration; experimental data; Open sources; PHP; Python; Data visualization; article; automation; computer program; data base; data extraction; information processing; information retrieval; Internet; collaboration; database; experimental data; logging; open source; PHP; Python; storage; visualization; Information Storage and Retrieval; Laboratories; Software; Statistics as Topic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896299565

Unirradiated control and irradiated samples were compared organoleptically by a sensory panel. Microbiological analyses were performed directly after irradiation and during post-irradiation storage for 8 days at 5. °C. Ascorbic acid contents, composition of carotenoids and tocopherols were determined. Statistically significant differences of sensory scores between unirradiated and irradiated samples were observed only in the texture of sliced carrots. Total aerobic viable cell counts have been reduced by about two log cycles with 1.5. kGy dose. Total coliforms and moulds were below the detection limit of 15. CFU/g in the irradiated samples during the refrigerated storage. Yeasts were relatively resistant part of the microbiota of pre-cut tomatoes, but 2. kGy dose reduced them below the detection limit. In pre-cut tomatoes, alpha-tocopherol and some carotenoids seemed to be the most radio-sensitive losing approximately one-third of their original concentrations at the dose of 2. kGy. At this dose tocopherols and the level of ascorbic acid decreased also one-third of the initial level in sliced carrots. Additional experiments were conducted to study the effect of irradiation and storage on the population of Listeria monocytogenes and Listeria innocua artificially inoculated on cut tomato and carrot. Cell numbers of both test organisms decreased by at least two log-cycles as an effect of 1. kGy dose. Our studies confirmed earlier findings on a temporary antilisterial effect of freshly cut carrot tissue. No re-growth of Listeria was observed during the studied storage period. The results of these studies suggest that irradiation with 1. kGy gamma rays could improve sufficiently the microbiological safety of the investigated pre-cut produce to satisfy the requirement of low microbial raw diets with acceptable nutritional quality and without diminishing significantly the organoleptic parameters of the commodities. © 2014.","Antioxidant vitamins; Low-dose irradiation; Microbiological safety; Pre-cut produce","Ascorbic acid; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Listeria; Pigments; Additional experiments; Listeria monocytogenes; Low dose irradiation; Microbiological analysis; Microbiological safety; Pre-cut produce; Refrigerated storages; Statistically significant difference; Fruits; alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; carotenoid; article; carrot; cell count; cell viability; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; controlled study; food composition; food processing; food quality; food safety; food storage; freezing; gamma irradiation; limit of detection; Listeria innocua; Listeria monocytogenes; low energy radiation; microbiological examination; mould; nonhuman; organoleptic property; radiosensitivity; tomato; yeast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896090926

These substrates were selected to represent complex and readily biodegradable organic carbon sources, respectively. Acclimated biomass was obtained from two fill/draw reactors sustained at a sludge age of 2days, one fed with peptone mixture and the other with acetate. Acute inhibition was tested in two parallel sets of batch reactors. Each reactor set was started with acclimated biomass seeding and pulse sulfamethoxazole dosing, including a control reactor without antibiotic addition. RESULTS: Model evaluation of the oxygen uptake rate, chemical oxygen demand and intracellular storage profiles indicated that sulfamethoxazole stopped substrate storage and accelerated endogenous respiration, but it did not affect microbial growth. The major inhibitory effect was on process stoichiometry, leading to partial substrate utilization. Enhanced endogenous respiration could be explained by higher maintenance energy required for possibly generating specific resistance mechanisms against the inhibitory effects of sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: The impact of sulfamethoxazole was different depending upon the nature of the substrate. For peptone mixture, it was stoichiometric, leading to partial substrate utilization. For acetate, it exerted slight inhibition on microbial growth, with full substrate utilization. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.","Activated sludge; Degradation; Modeling; Pharmaceuticals","Batch reactors; Chemical oxygen demand; Degradation; Drug products; Ecology; Mixtures; Models; Volatile fatty acids; Activated sludge; Biodegradable organic carbon; Complex substrates; Endogenous respiration; Oxygen uptake rates; Process stoichiometries; Specific resistances; Substrate utilization; Substrates; acetic acid; antibiotic agent; organic carbon; peptone; sulfamethoxazole; article; batch reactor; biodegradation; biomass; carbon source; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; energy; hydrolysis; microbial community; microbial growth; microbial respiration; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; sludge; stoichiometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895879299

A necessary precondition for the complete utilization of the nutritive value of maize is to prepare high quality silage. In North America and Europe, cattle nutrition is increasingly based on maize silage fed throughout the year, resulting in the need to store silage in silos for 14 months or even longer. Thus, it is necessary to collect a greater amount of data on the microbial composition of silage throughout its storage. In view of the above, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of cutting height (CH) and the application of ensiling additives (EAs) on the hygienic status and aerobic stability of maize silage. The experiment was run in a 2-factorial design with 3 replications. The first factor was CH of the maize plants: 20 cm, 30 cm, and 40 cm. The second degree factor was connected with the EAs: Inokulant 11A44, Inokulant 1132, Bioprofit, Pro-Stabil AP 80 L, and the control with no additives. Analyses showed that the applied EAs, both microbial and chemical, influenced both the quality and stability of maize silage. Applied EAs in the tested silage reduced the counts of mold fungi, yeasts, bacteria from the genus Clostridium, and coliform bacteria. The chemical preparation containing propionic acid (E-280) and ammonium propionate (E-284) was found to be the most effective at limiting microbial counts in silage. © Tübïtak.","Aerobic stability; Cutting height; Ensiling additive; Maize silage","Additives; Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Coliform bacteria; Digital storage; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Propionic acid; Aerobic stability; Chemical preparation; Concentration of energy; Cutting heights; Hygienic conditions; Maize silage; Microbial composition; Nutritive values; Grain (agricultural product); concentration (composition); experimental study; feeding mechanism; maize; microbial community; silage; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895741044

The latent heat storage provides much higher storage density than sensible heat storage, with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat. In addition, phase change materials provide constant and moderate temperature which is needed for drying most agriculture crops sufficiently. This paper reviews the previous work on solar drying systems which implemented the phase change material as an energy storage medium. It is concluded that the solar dryer with a PCM reduces the heat losses and improves the efficiency of the system. Furthermore, this review paper summarizes the previous methods that have been used for improving the thermal conductivity of the used phase change material particularly paraffin wax since it is commonly used as a storage medium in solar drying systems. It is inferred that carbon fibers, expanded graphite, graphite foam and high thermal conductive particles may improve the thermal efficiency of solar energy devices employing paraffin waxes as thermal energy storage media. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","PCM; Solar drying; Storage material","Drying; Foams; Graphite; Heat storage; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Pulse code modulation; Solar dryers; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Conductive particle; Higher storage density; Moderate temperature; Sensible heat storages; Solar drying; Solar drying systems; Temperature differences; Thermal efficiency; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894530208

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was grafted onto a cellulosic cotton backbone to give solid–solid phase change properties. The change in the surface morphology of the fibers was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Chemical characterization of the fibers was carried out using Fourier-transform infrared radiation spectroscopy. Thermal analysis of the modified fibers was performed by differential scanning calorimetry, and the thermal regulating properties of the PEG-grafted fibers were investigated using a thermal history system comprising insulated boxes, temperature sensors and a data-logger. Static thermal insulation measurements were also carried out on the fibers. The PEG-grafted cellulose fibers were shown to absorb up to 33.8 J/g heat at 33.0℃, releasing 31.5 J/g heat at 29.4℃, during the phase transitions. Thermal history results showed that temperature of the box containing PEG1000-incorporated fiber differed by 1–1.5 ± 0.1℃ from the temperature of the box containing untreated cotton fibers over 23–25 minutes.

Specifically, the recharging process of the secondary battery, i.e., the most prominent ESS, should be done in a specific manner to preserve its lifetime, the common MG bus voltage must be kept within the bounds, and the energy offered by RES should be utilized as efficiently as possible. This paper proposes a method for coordination of an autonomous low-voltage direct-current (LVDC) MG that consists of a number of sources using power-line signaling (PLS), which is a distributed control strategy in which the units inject sinusoidal signals of specific frequency into the common bus in order to communicate with each other. The control structure that allows the application of this method is revealed, and the optimal range of operating PLS frequencies is specified. In order to achieve a zero steady-state error of injected signals in the common bus, primary control of batteries has been extended with dedicated proportional-resonant controllers that are switched on only during injection period. Finally, a method for coordination among the units using the PLS concept was developed and experimentally tested, confirming its applicability for autonomous LVDC MGs. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Battery chargers; Distributed energy management strategy (DEMS); Microgrid (MG); Power-line signaling (PLS); Voltage droop (VD) control","Electric power distribution; Energy management; Renewable energy resources; Battery chargers; Distributed energies; Micro grid; Power lines; Voltage droop; Distributed parameter control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894095538

One of the major fungal species colonising the ecosystem of stored grain is Penicillium verrucosum because of its ability to produce ochratoxin A (OTA). Knowledge of favourable environmental conditions promoting fungal growth and mycotoxin biosynthesis seems to be a crucial step towards preventing mycotoxin formation in stored grain. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of temperature and different cereal substrates (wheat, triticale, rye, barley, maize, rice) on fungal growth and OTA and citrinin (CIT) production by a mycotoxin-producing P. verrucosum strain at one moisture content. The correlation between fungal growth and mycotoxin biosynthesis was also investigated. For this purpose, cereal substrates moistened, autoclaved and inoculated with P. verrucosum spores were stored at 10°C, 20°C and 30°C for 40 days. After the storage period, the ergosterol (ERG) content as a fungal growth biomarker and OTA and CIT levels were determined using HPLC. Fungal growth was observed on all cereals at each temperature. Maximum ERG levels were found at 30°C and the values ranged from 401 to 3280 mg kg-1 of grain. Among tested cereals, the highest ergosterol content was found on rice at all applied temperatures. Accumulation of OTA and CIT was detected in samples stored at 20°C and 30°C, while optimal conditions for the production of both mycotoxins were observed at 20°C. The maximum concentration of OTA (31.9 ± 4.3 (SD) μg kg-1) and CIT (74.8 ± 5.7 μg kg-1) were found on rice. The ability to biosynthesise OTA and CIT at 10°C was not detected. Analysis of variance showed that single factors, temperature and cereal matrices and their interactions had significant effects on ERG, OTA and CIT levels. Optimal conditions for fungus growth did not coincide with the ones for mycotoxin formation. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.","cereal; citrinin; ergosterol; fungal growth; fungi; grain; mycotoxins; ochratoxin A; Penicillium verrucosum; storage","cereal; Citrinin; ergosterol; Fungal growth; mycotoxins; Ochratoxin A; Penicillium verrucosum; Alcohols; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Energy storage; Food storage; Fungi; Grain (agricultural product); Grain growth; Optimization; Substrates; biological marker; citrinin; ergosterol; mycotoxin; ochratoxin; article; bacterial spore; barley; biosynthesis; cereal; fungal contamination; fungus growth; high performance liquid chromatography; maize; moisture; nonhuman; Penicillium verrucosum; priority journal; rice; rye; temperature sensitivity; triticale; Fungi; Hordeum; Penicillium verrucosum; Secale cereale; Triticosecale; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Cereals; Citrinin; Ergosterol; Food Contamination; Food Microbiology; Food Storage; Humans; Ochratoxins; Penicillium; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893681598

Moreover, in recent years the energy demands for buildings have increased very rapidly due to increase in the growth rate of population and improvement in living standards of people. Furthermore, fossil fuels will continue to dominate the world's primary energy by 2030. Thus, the increase in energy demand, shortage of fossil fuels and environmental concerns has provided impetus to the development of sustainable building and renewable energy resources. Thermal energy storage is an efficient method for applying to building envelopes to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. This, in turn, reduces the environmental impact related to energy usage. The combination of construction materials and PCM is an efficient way to increase the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements. Therefore, an extensive review on the incorporation of PCM into construction materials and elements by direct incorporation, immersion, encapsulation, shape-stabilization and form-stable composite PCMs is presented. For the first time, the differentiation between shape-stabilized and form-stable composite PCM has been made. Moreover, various construction materials such as diatomite, expanded perlite and graphite, etc. which are used as supports for form-stable composite PCM along with their worldwide availability are extensively discussed. One of the main aims of this review paper is to focus on the test methods which are used to determine the chemical compatibility, thermal properties, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of the PCM.

Nevertheless, due to the intermittent power generation from wind, this may cause a problem of large frequency fluctuation when the load-frequency control (LFC) capacity is not enough to compensate the unbalance of generation and load demand. Also, in the future transport sector, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is widely expected for driving in the customer side. Generally, the power of PHEV is charged by plugging into the home outlets as the dispersed battery energy storages. Therefore, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power control can be applied to compensate for the inadequate LFC capacity. This paper focuses on the new coordinated V2G control and conventional frequency controller for robust LFC in the smart grid with large wind farms. The battery state-of-charge (SOC) is controlled by the optimized SOC deviation control. The structure of frequency controller is a proportional integral (PI) with a single input. To enhance the robust performance and robust stability against the system uncertainties, the PI controller parameters and the SOC deviation are optimized simultaneously by the particle swarm optimization based on the fixed structure mixed H2/H\infty control. Simulation results show the superior robustness and control effect of the proposed coordinated controllers over the compared controllers. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery state-of-charge; mixed H2/H \infty control; particle swarm optimization; plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; smart grid; vehicle-to-grid","Mixed H; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Smart grid; State of charge; Vehicle to grids; Charging (batteries); Controllers; Electric control equipment; Electric frequency control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Smart power grids; Wind power; Electric load management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892593479

The infrastructure supplements the residential and public slow charging infrastructure. Two models are designed. The first determines the charging demand, based on current mobility behavior in Flanders. The second model simulates a charge infrastructure that meets the resulting fast charge demand. The energy management is performed by a rule-based control algorithm, that directs the power flows between the fast chargers, the energy storage system, the grid connection, and the photovoltaic installation. There is a clear trade-off between the size of the energy storage system and the power rating of the grid connection. Finally, the simulations indicate that 99.7% of the vehicles visiting the fast charge infrastructure can start charging within 10 minutes with a configuration limited to 5 charging spots, instead of 9 spots when drivers are not willing to wait. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery storage; electric vehicles; fast charge infrastructure","Battery storage; Charging infrastructures; Energy storage systems; Fast charges; Grid connections; Mobility behavior; Photovoltaic installation; Rule-based control; Algorithms; Energy storage; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892566441

In agriculture, straw and hay are commonly compressed with extrusion, but this process is highly influenced by changing crop conditions. A mathematical description of the compression profile of fibrous materials would be useful to compare the compression characteristics of different materials and to predict the energy required for compressing it to a certain density. In this study, different biomass modelling techniques have been reviewed to select the most useful crop compression model. It is shown that the selected crop model (Faborode model) is appropriate in describing the crop compression up to a density of 145kgm-3, dry matter (with R20.8). The selected stress-deformation relation (Faborode model) involves two crop parameters which are determined for wheat straw and hay at different moisture contents and particle orientations (random and parallel stacking). These parameters allow for separating the time-dependent and the elastic compression behaviour. The relaxation properties of the samples have been estimated by fitting the stress decay over time. It is shown that a Maxwell model cannot properly describe the relaxation (R20.7) while the Peleg model resulted in reasonable fits with high R2 (&gt;0.8). Although the model of Peleg is accurate only after a relaxation time of 1s, the parameters can be used in describing the relaxation behaviour. © 2013 IAgrE.",,"Agricultural robots; Biological materials; Compression characteristics; Compression profile; Different moisture contents; Elastic compression; Mathematical descriptions; Modelling techniques; Particle orientation; Stress deformations; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892544355

Lipodystrophy characterized by adipose tissue redistribution and lipid and glucose metabolism abnormalities, is common among HIV-infected adults and children on highly-active-antiretroviral-therapy (HAART). In a previous study of HIV-infected children, we did not detect insulin resistance, despite a high percentage of body fat redistribution abnormalities. Aim of the study. To investigate the non-traditional adipokines Retinol-binding-Protein-4 (RBP4), neutrophil-gelatinase-associated-lipocalin (NGAL), a-Fatty-Acid-Binding- Protein (a-FABP) and YKL-40 in HIV-infected children on highly-active- antiretroviral-therapy and evaluate their possible association to lipodystrophic changes or insulin resistance. Methods. Seventeen vertically HIV-infected children (mean age: 12.5 years, mean duration of HAART: 5.2 years) and 20 age- and BMI-matched controls were recruited. The HIV-children were re-evaluated after 12 months. RBP4, NGAL, a-FABP and YKL-40 were assessed at study entry and 12 months later and were correlated to body fat content and insulin resistance. Results. RBP4 values were similar at study entry and 12 months later in HIV-children and controls and showed no correlation to body fat or insulin resistance. NGAL was lower in HIV children at study entry but normalized after 12 months with no positive correlation to insulin resistance. a-FABP was positively correlated to body fat content, especially to trunk fat, both at initial evaluation and at follow-up in HIV children and, after prolonged highly-active-antiretroviral-therapy, it was also positively correlated to insulin resistance. Conclusions. This study is the first one to demonstrate that a-FABP could be a useful marker in unraveling central fat accumulation in HIV-infected children on highly-active-antiretroviral-therapy. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm these results. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.","A-FABP; Highly-active-antiretroviral-therapy; HIV; Insulin resistance; Lipodystrophy; NGAL; RBP4","abacavir; adipocytokine; biological marker; efavirenz; fatty acid binding protein; glucose; insulin; lamivudine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; retinol binding protein 4; zidovudine; abdominal fat; adolescent; article; body composition; body fat; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; CD4 lymphocyte count; child; childhood disease; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fat content; fat mass; female; follow up; glucose blood level; highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV associated lipodystrophy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lean body weight; lipid storage; male; preschool child; priority journal; school child; trunk; vertical transmission; virus load; Abdominal Fat; Acute-Phase Proteins; Adipokines; Adiposity; Adolescent; Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Biological Markers; Body Fat Distribution; Child; Child, Preschool; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Lectins; Lipocalins; Lipodystrophy; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma; Risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892181180

The TRT measurement series on eight boreholes has shown the possibility to compare the differences among individual measurements in a practically identical rock environment. The temperature profiling of boreholes enabled studying the dynamics of temperature changes occurring in the rock environment as a reaction to the heat supply during the TRT. The measurement series was performed with the aim to assess the possibility of shortening the TRT duration while maintaining the acceptable precision of the measured results. For this reason the software simulation of shortening the TRT duration to 24h was performed, and the influence of such shortening to the precision of determination of values λ and RB was studied. The simulation has shown that shortening the test to 24h in our case would have brought an acceptable amount of inaccuracy with regard to the dispersion of measured values obtained from the real test. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Borehole temperature profiling; Thermal energy storage; Thermal response test","Computer software; Heat storage; Thermal energy; Underground temperature measurement; Energy storage; Temperature measurement; Borehole temperature; Borehole thermal energy storage; Software simulation; Temperature changes; Temperature profiling; Thermal parameters; Thermal response test; Underground heat storage; Boreholes; borehole; computer simulation; heat transfer; precision; rock property; software; subterranean environment; temperature profile; testing method; thermodynamic property; accuracy assessment; assessment method; dispersion; experimental study; measurement method; temperature effect; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891494306

It is likely, that in the future, these units are to be integrated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) installations, which enable a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. A significant share of the energy market in Poland is constituted by coal-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The integration of these units with CCS installation can be economically inefficient. However, the lack of such integration enhances the investment risk due to the possibility of appearing on the market in the near future high prices of emission allowances. The aforementioned factors and additional favorable conditions for the development of cogeneration can cause one to consider investing in large supercritical CHP plants. This paper presents the results of an economic analysis aimed at comparing three cases of CHP plants, one without an integrated CCS installation and two with such installations. The same steam cycle structure for all variants was adopted. The cases of integrated CHP plants differ from each other in the manner in which they recover heat. For the evaluation of the respective solutions, the break-even price of electricity and avoided emission cost were used. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Absorption method; Carbon capture; Combined heat and power; Economic analysis","Carbon capture; Coal; Coal industry; Commerce; Costs; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Installation; Investments; Power generation; Steam engineering; Carbon; Power markets; Avoided emissions; Break-even prices; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Combined heat and power; Emission allowances; Energy investments; Favorable conditions; Supercritical coal-fired units; Carbon capture and storage; Combined heat and power plants; Cogeneration plants; absorption; carbon sequestration; coal-fired power plant; combined heat and power; economic analysis; electricity generation; emission control; energy market; greenhouse gas; investment; power plant; cost-benefit analysis; emission; heat balance; installation; market system; price dynamics; Poland; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891484714

The focus is on the key issues of the transportation of primary forest fuel to heat and/or power plants: (i) transportation modes, (ii) terminal types, and (iii) forest fuel supply chain management, and provides basics on the logistically relevant characteristics of wood as feedstock such as on various feedstock assortments.The analysed supply chains include the transshipment, storage, handling (e.g. chipping) and transportation of primary forest fuel from the place of harvest to energy conversion plant. Due to spatial distribution, low mass density, low energy density and low bulk density, the transportation of primary forest fuel is crucial for economic efficiency as well as for reduced CO2 emissions. As a consequence of forests accessibility, road transportation (after hauling the biomass to the forest road) is the first step of the modern primary forest fuel supply chain. For longer transportation distances, rail or waterway is preferred because of lower transportation costs per volume transported and lower CO2 emissions. We highlight that some experience exists in multimodal transport, including truck, train or ship.

Those wastes are a serious threat to the environment. Main precondition for the protection of natural resources in the environment is to recover raw material and energy from waste. The use of waste as raw materials does not involve the storage and creates the possibility of closure of the existing landfill. The article presented utilization of metallurgical waste containing 4-20 wt. % zinc in non-metallurgical industry. Chemical analysis of pollutants contained in waste (dusts, sludge and slag) and in manufactured products (cement bricks, ceramic construction materials, coloured glass products and slag for road construction) was performed. Aqueous extracts analysis results were compared with the maximum values for the sewage entering into water and soil. The performed research proves that proposed technologies (production of cement clinker, construction bricks, hollow glass, decorated glass) do not pose threat to environment.

Therefore, as a rule, plants store oils almost exclusively in their seeds. Plant oils are not only a major food and feed products, but also the raw material for obtaining many nonfood products from drying oils and lubricants to biofuel. TAGs differ from other storage compounds in that in the course of fruit ripening their quantitative and qualitative composition does not remain constant, but undergoes significant changes. Therefore, the biosynthesis pathways of TAGs in living organisms have been actively studied for the past several decades, and today enough data can be presented to outline as how and where these processes occur in the plant cell.

During this period, the biggest obstacles to the integration have been widely identified. The present paper examines two of the issues: the ramping events and the scheduling errors of wind power plants. As a possible way of easing these problems, the authors propose the use of energy storage. In this paper, two different complementary methods are presented, which can be used to determine the parameters (rated power and energy) of a grid-connected energy storage unit that is capable of providing auxiliary (gradient) control reserves required by wind power plants, assuming that the power system is partially or wholly not capable of such operation. The methods are demonstrated using the openly available data of the Hungarian power system. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer simulation; Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Wind energy","Complementary methods; Control reserves; Energy storage unit; Grid-connected; Hungarians; Wind power integrations; Computer simulation; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890901527

The RCM used in this work is the Consortium for Small-scale Modelling-climate limited-area modelling (COSMO-CLM) model. The COSMO-CLM model was evaluated by performing simulations of the past Irish climate, driven by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-40 data, and comparing the output with observations. For the investigation of the influence of the future climate under different climate scenarios, the Max Planck Institute's global climate model, ECHAM5, was used to drive the COSMO-CLM model. Simulations are run for a control period 1961-2000 and future period 2021-2060. To add to the number of ensemble members, the control and future simulations were driven by different realizations of the ECHAM5 data. The future climate was simulated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenarios, A1B and B1. The research was undertaken to consolidate, and as a continuation of, similar research using the Rossby Centre's RCA3 RCM to investigate the effects of climate change on the future wind energy resource of Ireland. The COSMO-CLM projections outlined in this study agree with the RCA3 projections, with both showing substantial increases in 60 m wind speed over Ireland during winter and decreases during summer. The projected changes of both studies were found to be statistically significant over most of Ireland. The agreement of the COSMO-CLM and RCA3 simulation results increases our confidence in the robustness of the projections.

Bellstar and Legacy) during postharvest storage (23 °C for 7 days) and correlated with colour change and the activity of peroxidase/POD, ascorbic acid oxidase/AAO and lipoxygenase/LOX. Volatile organic compounds were monitored using PTR-MS. Methanol had the highest concentration compared with other volatiles released in the headspace that significantly increased during senescence. The methanol concentration was approximately 500 ppbv before the broccoli colour began to change from green to yellow. The concentration of methanol in the headspace increased to 1000-1100 ppbv for Bellstar and Legacy when the colour became yellowish. LOX had high correlation (0.91 and 0.83 for Bellstar and Legacy, respectively) with volatiles for both cultivars, but not for POD.

Methods: Thirty-six twin-pregnant ewes were fed a NORM (fulfilling 100% of daily requirements for energy and protein), LOW (50% of NORM) or HIGH diet (150% of energy and 110% of protein requirements) during the last 6 weeks of gestation (term = 147 days). Post-natally, the twin lambs were subjected to a high-fat or a moderate diet until 6 months of age (around puberty), where metabolic and endocrine adaptability to fasting was examined, and subgroups of animals were killed. Results: Animals exposed to either prenatal under- or overnutrition had reduced subcutaneous fat deposition when fed a high-fat diet, resulting in higher ratios of mesenteric and peri-renal fat relative to subcutaneous fat compared to controls. This was not related to prenatal influences on plasma glucose or insulin. Irrespective of the prenatal diet, high-fat-fed lambs underwent changes resembling the metabolic syndrome with higher plasma glucose, cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids, triglyceride and lactate combined with abdominal obesity. Peri-renal fat appeared to be a particular target of a high-fat diet post-natally. Conclusion: Both prenatal under- and overnutrition predisposed for abdominal adiposity, apparently by reducing the expandability of subcutaneous adipose tissue and induced differential physiological adaptations to fasting. This study does not suggest that exposure to gestational overnutrition will provide a protective effect against development of hyperglycaemia later in life. © 2013 Scandinavian Physiological Society.","Fat deposition; Foetal malnutrition; Metabolic profiles; Obesity; Post-natal overnutrition","3 hydroxybutyric acid; cholesterol; creatinine; fatty acid; ghrelin; glucose; hydrocortisone; insulin; lactic acid; leptin; somatomedin C; triacylglycerol; abdominal obesity; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; article; body weight; caloric intake; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; creatinine blood level; diet restriction; endocrine function; ewe; female; food intake; gestational age; glucose blood level; hydrocortisone blood level; insulin sensitivity; lactate blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; malnutrition; maternal nutrition; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; nonhuman; nutrient supply; outcome assessment; overnutrition; priority journal; protein intake; puberty; subcutaneous fat; triacylglycerol blood level; urea nitrogen blood level; fat deposition; foetal malnutrition; metabolic profiles; obesity; post-natal overnutrition; Adaptation, Physiological; Aging; Animals; Fasting; Female; Fetal Nutrition Disorders; Gestational Age; Glucose; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Overnutrition; Pregnancy; Sheep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890165759

The economic and social life of any nation depends enormously on the energy resources. Over the past few years the energy crisis is becoming a major issue in developing countries as Pakistan. Oil, Natural gas and hydro are the three major energy resources of the Pakistan. These conventional energy resources were being exploited in the past leading to an issue of energy crisis in the country. Replacing expensive imported energy resources with coal briquettes made from indigenous coal reserves can provide fuel for the local residential and commercial markets. Coal briquettes formation is a process to convert coal powder into a specific shape with the help of a binder. An external force is applied to the coal binder mixture to make a firm body of desired shape. The briquettes formed this way will not disintegrate under normal conditions of transportation and use. Coal briquettes are preferred over raw coal because they are a smokeless, strong and low emissive fuel that can be used in numerous domestic and commercial applications. The performance of coal briquettes formed is dependent largely upon its thermal properties and the mechanical strength. Nowadays an environmentally safe briquettes formation process is also included in the performance criteria of coal briquettes. The mechanical strength of coal briquettes affects its storage and transportation to the intended market. The studies on coal briquettes show that coal briquettes quality depends on many factors like the type of binder, quantity of binder, grade of coal, moisture level, coal particle size and its distribution etc. These factors along with some of the factors as time of compaction, compaction temperature, and compaction pressure and moisture level are discussed in this paper to evaluate the performance of briquetting technology in future.","Alternative energy source; Binders; Coal briquettes; Strength of coal briquettes",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889668997

The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive ANN-controlled SMES is then compared with that of proportional-integral (PI)-controlled SMES optimized by response surface methodology and genetic algorithm (RSM-GA) considering both of symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults. For realistic responses, real wind speed data and two-mass drive train model of wind turbine generator system is considered in the analyses.

A division of the various evolutionary theories into two classes has been proposed based on the presence or absence of a priori information about the evolving system. A priori information plays a key role in solving problems in evolution. Here, a model of partially directed evolution, based on the learning automata theory, which includes a priori information about the fitness space, is proposed.

It is estimated that the demand for electricity is growing at an average of 5.4% per year, encouraged by government subsidies and driven by the rapid and continual expansion in building construction, urban development, and heavy reliance on air-conditioning (AC) systems for the cooling of buildings. The chilled water thermal storage (CWTS) system is one of the available techniques that can be utilized to reduce peak electricity demand of buildings when national electricity consumption is at its highest level. This paper demonstrates that the implementation of CWTS system reduces the peak power demand of AC systems for design day conditions by 36.7-87.5% and annual energy consumption by between 4.5% and 6.9% compared with conventional systems, where chillers and pumps significantly contribute to this reduction. In addition, the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) was estimated for both the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) and the consumer. Results show that CWTS operating with a load leveling strategy gives the lowest LCC compared to 50% demand limiting and full storage strategies, and is, therefore, considered as the most cost effective option for both MEW and consumer. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Combined heat and power (CHP) or cogeneration has several advantages in the context of the smart grid, which include the efficient use of primary energy and the reduction of electrical losses through transmission. However, the role of the gas network is often overlooked in this context. Therefore, this work presents an analysis of the impact of a massive implementation of small scale (micro) cogeneration units on the gas demand at distribution level. This work shows that using generic information in the simulations overestimates the impact of CHP. Furthermore, the importance of the thermal storage tank capacity on the impact on the gas demand is shown. Larger storage tanks lead to lower gas demand peaks and hence a lower impact on the gas distribution network. It is also shown that the use of an economically led controller leads to similar results compared to classical heat led control. Finally, it results that a low sell back tariff for electricity increases the impact of cogeneration on the gas demand peak. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the residential end-user will not be always available to manage energy resources and decide, based on price signals and preferences/needs, the best response actions to implement or the best usage of the electricity produced locally. Therefore, energy management systems are required to monitor consumption/generation/storage and to make the best decisions according to input signals and the user's needs and preferences. The design of adequate algorithms to be implemented in those systems require the prior characterization of domestic electricity demand and categorization of loads, according to availability, typical usage patterns, working cycles and technical constraints. Automated demand response actions must be tailored and chosen according to this previous analysis of load characteristics. In this paper, a characterization of household electricity consumption is presented and an operational categorization of end-use loads is proposed.

The proposed converter is derived from the conventional Single Ended Primary Inductor Converter (SEPIC) topology and it is integrated with a capacitor-diode voltage multiplier, which offers a simple structure, reduced electromagnetic interference (EMI), and reduced semiconductors' voltage stresses. Other advantages include: continuous input and output current, extended step-up and step-down voltage conversion ratio without extreme low or high duty-cycle, simple control circuitry, and near-zero input and output ripple currents compared to other converter topologies. The low charging/discharging current ripple and wide gain features result in a longer life-span and lower cost of the energy storage battery system. In addition, the ""near- zero"" ripple capability improves the fuel cell durability. Theoretical analysis results obtained with the proposed structure are compared with other bi-direction converter topologies. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed bi-directional converter. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An ultrasound bath system with the frequency of 40 kHz was used and the acoustic energy density during extraction was identified to 48 W/L. The effects of extraction time, extraction temperature, solvent-to-solid ratio and the solvent composition on the extraction yields of total phenolics and total anthocyanins were taken into account. The extraction process was simulated and optimized by means of artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The constructed ANN models were accurate to predict the extraction yields of both total phenolics and total anthocyanins according to the statistical analysis. Meanwhile, the input space of the ANN models was optimized by GA, so as to maximize the extraction yields. Under the optimal conditions, the experimental yields of total phenolics and total anthocyanins were 58.76 and 6.69 mg/g, respectively, which agreed with the predicted values. Furthermore, more amounts of total phenolics and total anthocyanins were extracted by ultrasound at the optimal conditions than by conventional maceration. On the other hand, the stability of phenolics in the liquid extracts obtained from ultrasound-assisted extraction during storage was evaluated. After 30-day storage, the total phenolic contents in extracts stored at 4 C and 20 C decreased by 12.5% and 12.1%, respectively. Moreover, anthocyanins were more stable at 4 C while tartaric esters and flavonols exhibited a better stability at 20 C.

Five different full size hybrid and electric city bus configurations were considered in this study; two parallel and two series hybrid buses, and one electric city bus. Overall, the simulation results indicate that plug-in hybrid and electric city buses have the best potential to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

The RESs could be a combination of photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines (WT) based on common DC-bus, which are used as the primary DC source. The FC operates as a backup, feeding only the insufficiency power from the RESs based on the load-following strategy. The battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS operates as an auxiliary source for supplying the power deficit based on dynamic power balance strategy (the transient power - mainly via the ultracapacitors stack, and the steady-state power - mainly via the FC and batteries stack). If the FC stack is designed and operates based on average load-following strategy, then the ESS will operate in charge-sustaining mode during a load cycle. This feature permits to optimize the batteries stack capacity and extend its life time as well. The ultracapacitors stack can be designed considering the peaks of RESs power on DC-bus and the imposed window for its state-of-charge (SOC). This FC/RES/ESS HPS is ideal to be used for standalone plug-in charge station (PCS) or as DG system grid connected. In the last case, which is not analyzed here, the energy management unit (EMU) that communicates with smart grid will establish the moments to match the HPS power demand with grid supply availability, stabilizing the grid. Using load and RES power profiles that have a higher dynamic than in reality, the HPS operation is shown based on an analytical analysis and the appropriate Matlab/Simulink® simulations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the charging process, a set of internally cooled vertical banks of horizontal tubes of brine is subjected to a falling film of water. The formed ice is periodically observed, photographed and measured in falling-film jet mode at specific internal coolant (ethylene-glycol solution) flow rates and temperatures. In the discharge process, the same solution is heated and used internally to release ice. Different thicknesses of the released ice are observed and measured. The maximum quantity of released ice is obtained and the optimum ice formation is determined. The results indicate that the ice formation and the solid ice released are controlled by the thermal resistance of the ice, time and pitch between tubes. The maximum gained ice has a thickness that is approximately equal to half of the tube spacing between the tubes utilized, which is formed in approximately 45 min and released in 12.5 min.

They exchange a large amount of energy with the grid and rely heavily on these energy exchanges to fulfill their yearly zero balance. Nevertheless, grid hosting capacities are limited and they can only accept a limited spread of such buildings. Large scale application of Net-ZEBs in the building stock can only be realized if well-designed energy solutions are in place. As current market trends shows strong growth in heat pump and photovoltaic applications, this article investigates the flexibility of such combinations that they could offer to the grid. For the purpose, two different hydraulic configurations of heat pump with thermal energy storage and four different control strategies are analyzed. Results shows that with a proper control: self-consumption of the building could be improved by almost 40%, the annual import bills could be reduced by 20% and hours of peak exchanges with the grid could be reduced by 30%. However, it is observed that the objectives are mostly contradictory, and optimizing one objective degrades the other.

Antioxidant aqueous extracts of yerba mate were entrapped into a sucrose matrix by co-crystallization. The products were characterized in terms of their morphology, entrapment yield, loading capacity, water activity, moisture content, antioxidant activity, thermal behavior, solubility and hygroscopicity. It was found that the co-crystallization process led to high entrapment yield and maintained the antioxidant activity of the yerba mate extract towards DPPH radical. Also, the co-crystallized powders showed values of water activity, moisture content, hygroscopicity and flowability indicative of high stability and good handling properties. The total polyphenols content of the co-crystallized products remained almost constant along storage at 75% RH and 20 C, however, fluctuations in their DPPH radical scavenging activity were observed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the activity of cranberries, in terms of the inhibiting effects of adipogenesis, was investigated using the 3T3-L1 cell line. The obtained results showed that cranberries reduced proliferation and viability of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with cranberries decreased the number of adipocytes and reduced lipid accumulation in maturing 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, demonstrating an inhibitory effect on lipogenesis. Moreover, it was found that cranberries directly induced lipolysis in adipocytes and down-regulated the expression of major transcription factors of the adipogenesis pathway, such as PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP1. These findings indicate that cranberries are capable of suppressing adipogenesis and therefore they seem to be natural bioactive factors effective in adipose tissue mass modulation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We report a magnetic graphene material consisting of 2-5 graphene layers encapsulating magnetic nanoparticles, produced in one step without any chemical modification or post-treatment, using a dual-action ferrofluid catalyst/carbon chemical vapor deposition (CVD) precursor. The resulting composite exhibits high quality, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, since the properties of as grown pure graphene are fully preserved, coupled to magnetic sensitivity, as evidenced by Mossbauer and magnetic measurements, originated from the encapsulated Fe-based nanoparticles. Notably, the material is stable due to particle encapsulation by the graphene layers, while the fabrication is simple and carried out by CVD which is widely used in the microelectronics industry thus favoring scalability towards applications that include magnetoelectronics, high-density data storage, magnetic nanodevices, and electrochemical energy storage and supply. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The interpolation is built on a Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grid by applying the method of mean weighted residuals. Unlike traditional approaches, which use either the Smolyak construction or the combinatorial formula for interpolation on a sparse grid, our approach is based on the properties of multidimensional cardinal functions, built as a tensor product of one-dimensional basis functions. The interpolation technique combines the efficiency of Chebyshev interpolation with low calculation and storage requirements of sparse grid methods, which makes it scalable in dimensionality. In addition, the method provides a way to optimize the size of the library, while still keeping control of the accuracy of the representation. The representation method was applied to the few group homogenized cross sections of diverse light water reactors: PWR and MTR fuel assemblies and a VVER fuel pin. These examples differ in terms of intervals of state parameters, number of energy groups, the number of microscopic cross sections treated explicitly, and transport codes used for calculations. The analysis of the results obtained allows one to conclude that the method is capable of providing cross section representation with an accuracy that is sufficient for use in practical applications with reasonable calculational resources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, the user simply utilizes TYPE 45 as thermosiphon ready to be run, and a single zone (TYPE 19) is a complex type which is designed for residential buildings that can be specified by the user in order to obtain an acceptable heating within a house. The user specified the characteristics of the internal space, external weather conditions, walls, windows, and doors. To facilitate this description, the parameters and inputs for this component are organized in separate table according to a logical structure. According to us, the choice of this model of thermosiphon coupled with a single zone can have multiple interesting engineering applications, in particular ameliorating the mode of the heating in residential buildings. Two flat plate collectors of aperture area of 6 and 8 m2 are modeled. The solar fraction of the entire system is used as the optimization parameter. The temperature of the water in the storage tank, the collector's temperature, the temperature inside and outside the house, the solar fraction for different collector areas and the total energy were also measured in 11 h operation in January and 2880 h operation in winter. The average solar fraction obtained was 85% and the system could cover all the hot water needs of a house of six people. The maximum auxiliary energy was needed during 11 h operation in January and 4 months in winter. The results show that by utilizing solar energy, the designed system could provide 40-70% of the hot water demands in winter. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The contents of total phenolic compounds and total anthocyanins were also determined by specific spectrometric methods. Significant differences between fresh and stored plum cultivars (p < 0.05) were found. Storage at 4 C resulted in an increase in antioxidant potential and anthocyanins content of the autumn plum varieties.

In this study, tin/tinoxide (Sn/SnO2) films and tin/tinoxide/multi walled carbon nanotube (Sn/SnO2/MWCNT) nanocomposites are produced by a two steps process; thermal evaporation and subsequent plasma oxidation as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. The physical, structural, and electrochemical behaviors of the nanocomposite electrodes containing MWCNTs are discussed. The ratio between metallic tin (Sn) and tinoxide (SnO2) is controlled with plasma oxidation time and effects of the ratio are investigated on the structural and electrochemical properties. The greatly enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly due to the morphological stability and reduced diffusion resistance, which are induced by MWCNT core and deposited Sn/SnO2 double phase shell. The outstanding long-term cycling stability is a result of the two layers Sn and SnO2 phases on MWCNTs. The nanoscale Sn/SnO2/MWCNT network provides good electrical conductivity, and the creation of open spaces that buffer a large volume change during the Li-alloying/de-alloying reaction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An alternative torque mechanism is proposed to drive the rotor of the designed bearing. The design consideration for the rotor consists of a permanent magnet with 7.5-kg mass and its force interaction with the superconductor defined in terms of a semi-analytical frozen image model. The driving mechanism is based on eddy-current induction on a conducting disk placed on the rotor of the bearing. The driving system is intended not only to sustain stable levitation during the variation of the rotor speed but also to rotate the rotor with a speed higher than that of the torque provider. Levitation, drag, and lift forces are discussed via considering various conditions such as the rotor configuration and conducting material. The thickness of the conductor strongly affects the optimum working conditions of the magnetic bearing. In order to compensate the repulsive force due to lift force on the rotor, the top of the rotor was covered with iron sheet.

Each step in the supply chains of harvesting residues (HR), small-diameter energy wood (EW) and stumps (ST) is assessed separately, with geography-related differences between Northern and Southern Finland (NF and SF) taken into consideration. Furthermore, the GHG performance of five distinct bioenergy options - (1) combined heat and power production, (2) condensing power production, (3) torrefied pellets, (4) gasification, and (5) pyrolysis oil production - is assessed and compared with that of current reference systems in Finland and also the European Union (EU) sustainability criteria. If soil carbon stock (SCS) changes and possible storage emissions are omitted, the GHG emissions deriving from the supply chain of comminuted forest biomass to plants are 2.4, 3.0, and 2.6 gCO2eq MJ-1 for HR, EW, and ST in SF, respectively. In NF, the corresponding values are 2.9, 3.6, and 3.2 gCO2eq MJ-1, respectively.

Lately developed grid operating codes demand the WTGs to stay connected during fault conditions, supporting the grid to recover faster back to its normal state. However, forcing a WTG to remain connected during a grid fault has consequences on the conventional protection devices, as they might become blind to over-currents and short circuits. This paper proposes a new control algorithm combined with a power management method, which fulfills the demand to keep the WTG connected to the grid during a fault, but disconnects the WTG when the fault insists. The energy generated while riding through a grid fault, is stored in a Supercapacitor Energy Storage System (SCESS). Furthermore, the SCESS is exploited for smoothing medium frequency wind power fluctuations, providing a high quality power profile. The simulation results which are performed on a 2 MW synchronous generator with external excitation, verify strongly the proposed power management method. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The concept is based on connecting a voltage source in series with the dc bus line to compensate the ripple voltage on the dc-link capacitor, so as to make the output have a near zero ripple voltage. Since the voltage compensator processes small ripple voltage on the dc link and reactive power only, it can be implemented with low-voltage devices. The overall required energy storage of the dc-link, formed by a reduced value of dc-link capacitor and the voltage compensator, is reduced, allowing the replacement of popularly used electrolytic capacitors with alternatives of longer lifetime, like power film capacitors, or extending the system lifetime even if there is a significant reduction in the capacitance of electrolytic capacitors due to the aging effect. Comprehensive analysis on the static and dynamic characteristics of the system, and hold-up time requirement will be discussed.

Putative physicochemical indicators of bruise susceptibility, including peel electrolyte leakage (PEL), total polyphenolic content, hardness, water content, and peel thickness, were investigated. Bruise susceptibility is the lowest impact energy needed to produce visible bruising by an object dropped on post-climacteric banana fruit from a pre-determined height, converted into impact energy (20-200. mJ with a 20. mJ increment). The bananas were stored either at 18. °C throughout ripening or at 13. °C between the 2nd and 6th day after ethylene induction. Five cultivars with contrasting susceptibility to impact bruises were used. Neither Grande Naine nor hybrid Flhorban925 bruised at the maximum impact energy (200. mJ) during ripening whatever the storage conditions. A gradient in bruise susceptibility was observed among the other cultivars: French Corne. >. Fougamou. >. hybrid Flhorban916. Bruise susceptibility increased during ripening and was higher in bananas stored at 18. °C. The lower ripening temperature resulted in a two-day delay to fruit maturity as well as in bruise susceptibility. Bruise susceptibility was positively correlated with PEL (R= 0.78) and to a lesser extent negatively correlated with hardness (R= -0.45), and was not correlated with polyphenolic content. In conclusion, membrane permeability provides the first clue to understanding bruise susceptibility. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Cold storage; Cultivar; Electrolyte leakage; Impact bruising; Musa; Polyphenol",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883763636

The model is used as a base for quantifying the energy and temperatures at each step, as replacing electric energy with thermal energy is considered. In Iceland, it is possible to use geothermal steam as a thermal resource in the drying process. The most feasible type of dryer and heating method for lithium batteries would be a tray dryer (batch) using a conduction heating method under vacuum operation. Replacing conventional heat sources with heat from geothermal steam in Iceland, we can lower the energy cost to 0.008USD/Ah from 0.13USD/Ah based on average European energy prices. The energy expenditure after 15 years operation could be close to 2% of total expenditure using this renewable resource, down from 12 to 15% in other European countries. According to our profitability model, the internal rate of return of this project will increase from 11% to 23% by replacing the energy source. The impact on carbon emissions amounts to 393.4-215.1g/Ah lower releases of CO2 per year, which is only 2-5% of carbon emissions related to battery production using traditional energy sources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon emission; Energy cost; Geothermal energy; Lithium-ion battery","Carbon; Costs; Dryers (equipment); Earnings; Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Ions; Thermal energy; Battery production; Carbon emissions; Emerging applications; Energy cost; Energy expenditure; Internal rate of return; Production process; Renewable resource; Lithium-ion batteries; alternative energy; carbon emission; electrical power; emission control; energy efficiency; expenditure; geothermal energy; heating; lithium; production cost; storage structure; Iceland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883557243

Some of them are complicated electrochemical approaches; others, are given by simple analogies. However, simple models with electrochemical states capable of describing important quantities, like the rate capacity effect and the recovery effect, are hard to find. In this paper, based on an electrochemical approach, we present a generalized model suitable for use in BMS applications, which takes into account explicitly the rate capacity effect and the state of charge. Moreover, the model is thought up for general energy storage processes based on mass transport and charge transfer. The proposed general model approach is able to interpret the most commonly used models in the literature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This building element is made of gypsum based composite with microencapsulated PCM. The proposed heat storage unit has a form of a ceiling panel with internal channels and is, by assumption, incorporated in a ventilation system. Its task is to reduce daily variations of ambient air temperature through the absorption (and subsequent release) of heat in PCM, without additional consumption of energy. Methods: The operation of the ceiling panel was investigated experimentally on a special set-up equipped with temperature sensors, air flow meter and air temperature control system. Mathematical and numerical models of heat transfer and fluid flow in the panel account for air flow in the panel as well as real thermal properties of the PCM composite, i.e.: thermal conductivity variation with temperature and hysteresis of enthalpy vs. temperature curves for heating and cooling. Proposed novel numerical simulator consists of two strongly coupled sub models: the first one - 1D - which deals with air flowing through the U-shaped channel and the second one - 3D - which deals with heat transfer in the body of the panel. Results: Spatial and temporal air temperature variations, measured on the experimental set-up, were used to validate numerical model as well as to get knowledge of thermal performance of the panel operating in different conditions. Conclusion: Preliminary results of experimental tests confirmed the ability of the proposed heat storage unit to effectively control the air temperature inside the building. However, detailed measurement of the temperature of PCM composite have shown some disadvantages of the panel used in the study, e.g. thickness of the walls and distribution of PCM should be optimized. This can be achieved with the aid of the numerical simulator developed in this research. Practical implications: The proposed ceiling panel, optimised from the point of view of thermal performance in a given environmental conditions, can be used as a part of ventilation systems in residential and office buildings. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Heat storage; Hysteresis of enthalpy-temperature curve; Night ventilation; Numerical modelling; Phase change materials (PCM)","Air; Atmospheric temperature; Ceilings; Enthalpy; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hysteresis; Numerical models; Office buildings; Phase change materials; Ventilation; Air temperature variations; Ambient air temperature; Conductivity variation; Consumption of energy; Environmental conditions; Heat transfer and fluid flow; Night ventilation; Numerical simulators; Thermal conductivity; air temperature; building; composite; construction material; control system; cooling; enthalpy; experimental study; gypsum; heat transfer; heating; hysteresis; numerical model; storage structure; structural component; temperature profile; thermal power; thermodynamic property; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883347859

The solution includes features that enhance the system's stability and security of supply. The BESS can operate connected to MG or islanded and the transition between the two states is seamlessly coordinated by an original method. The BESS active power response is governed by an improved frequency controller on two layers, namely primary and secondary. It responds to frequency deviations by combining a conventional droop control method with a virtual inertia function to improve the system's stability. The proposed BESS may also compensate the power of the local loads, so that the MG frequency transients can be reduced and, depending on the remaining inverter capacity, voltage support in the point of common coupling with the MG may be provided. If the MG power quality degrades in terms of the voltage and frequency, the BESS and the local load are disconnected from the MG and continue operating islanded. The BESS is reconnected to the MG after a smoothly resynchronization of the local voltage with the MG, without disturbing the local loads supply.

Thus, a thorough matching analysis is conducted for the on-site hybrid systems of two office buildings under distinct climate conditions. Both of the studied buildings are equipped with PV and solar thermal assisted ground source heat pumps (GSHP), which can be controlled by six excess renewable electrical (REe) and one excess renewable thermal (REth) treatments with respect to certain thermal storage recharging and grid exporting strategies. The assessment criteria are six recently defined indices. With the aid of these indices, the key methodology is to conduct parametric analyses from the aspect of matching for solar thermal collector area and connection type, PV panel area, and electrical battery size regarding certain excess REe or REth treatments. The outcomes of matching analyses show the advantages of solar thermal collectors connected in a parallel fashion in meeting office heating demands, the consistency between electrical generation and demand in the daytime in office buildings, the enhancement of on-site heating and cooling by GSHP and free ground cooling, and the battery effect in technically improving electrical matching. Furthermore, the fluctuations of indices in the instantaneous matching analysis clearly reflect the matching situations of on-site renewable energy resources and demand conditions at each time-step, which will be helpful for the detailed investigation of specific system operations and user behaviours. It has been shown that the methodology used in the study can be helpful for aiding the design of increasingly complicated on-site hybrid energy systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ground source heat pump; Matching indices; Mismatch analysis; Office building; Renewable feed-in; Solar","Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Geothermal heat pumps; Heat storage; Hybrid systems; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Solar collectors; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Matching index; Mismatch analysis; Primary energy consumption; Renewable feed-in; Solar; Solar thermal collector; Renewable energy resources; building; carbon emission; climate conditions; electric field; energy conservation; energy efficiency; heating; renewable resource; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882630857

Analysed margarines contained four phytosterols: brassicasterol, campesterol, sitosterol, avenasterol and two phytostanols: sitostanol, campestanol. The content of phytosterols and phytostanols in margarines changed from 79 mg/g in a control sample to 63 mg/g and 55 mg/g in samples stored for 18 weeks at 4 °C and 20 °C, respectively. At the end of storage, contents of sitostanol decreased by 23% and 30%, while the amounts of oxidised sterols increased by 35% and 100%, respectively, for both temperatures. 7- Hydroxy derivatives dominated among all oxidised phytosterols and their content increased threefold at the end of storage.
